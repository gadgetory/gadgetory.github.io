United States our fringe or affordable
smartphones you've got to have some
serious stones to price your first
SmartWatch like this at $349 only one
other SmartWatch in the Google store is
as expensive and that's just the entry
tier does Huawei bring enough quality to
justify the coin I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and let's find out in our
video review of the Huawei watch the
Huawei watch was designed to make an
impression and it does from the moment
you open the package while we loaned us
the base model of the watch to review
but nothing about it says basic the 42
millimeter casing is 3/16 L cold formed
stainless steel made it to a 21
millimeter black suture stitched leather
band that's both more traditional
looking and more rigid than the soft
leather of some other smart watch bands
every Android wear manufacturer in 2015
seems to be using the same strategy when
it comes to design D emphasize the
geekiness of a SmartWatch by amping up
its style and while this is certainly
subjective I don't think anyone this
year has done it better than Huawei from
its blended lugs to its brushed finish
to its sapphire crystal this is an
absolutely beautiful piece it's ready to
ip67 for water and dust resistance but
it's such a great-looking watch you'll
probably find yourself taking it off
well before you get near either of those
about the only hardware complaint I've
got is thickness at over eleven
millimeters it's got some girth but
that's par for the course in today's
SmartWatch world and you forget all
about the thickness once the display
comes to life it's a 1.4 inch full
circle screen at a resolution of 400 by
400 the highest you can find on Android
wear compared to much of its competition
everything on the Huawei watch looks
incredibly sharp the deep color
saturation of AMOLED makes the on screen
graphics pop in full brightness while
it's high contrast means the time is
usually still visible even in power
saving mode toggling between the two is
as simple as pressing the crown at the
two
o'clock position which like everything
else feels very well made
unfortunately there's no ambient light
sensor here to change the displays
brightness you've got to go to the
settings menu it's pretty common for
smartwatches but it still feels archaic
on such an otherwise advanced product
when it comes to software Android wear
is Android wear Google gives
manufacturers precious little room for
improvisation or expansion and to be
candid that's probably a good thing
Huawei has seldom impressed us with its
software design on smartphones that said
there are a few bits of custom work here
most notably in the fitness suite the
daily tracking app is a straightforward
way to keep track of your step count and
calories burned and qua Way says it's
heart rate readings are more accurate
than the competition due to its use of
two optical sensors instead of one I
can't speak to the accuracy but it did
seem a bit faster it's weird to even
think of the Huawei watch in a sporty
sense though maybe it's because I don't
have the black Sport Edition here but
this is a watch that gets along much
better with a business suit than a
tracksuit and Huawei includes over 40
watch faces out of the box to make sure
you can find a match for whatever you're
wearing no matter which watch face
you're running the Huawei watch seems to
have no trouble keeping up standard
hardware loadout of a Snapdragon 400
with a half gig of ram serves it well
making for very fluid interactions
whether you're swiping tapping gesture
scrolling or commanding it with your
voice whether what we watch differs from
a typical hardware loadout is in
acoustics according to Android police
there's a speaker underneath the casing
there must be some reason hallway has
included it but for now it's one of
those mysterious touches we have to
assume is for future expansion a shame
that Huawei didn't take that a step
further and build in NFC which is just
as absent here as on any other Android
wear device I've tested the Huawei watch
for five days during which it's been
paired with the Moto X pure edition the
watch is also capable of working with
the iPhone but we stuck to Android
now depending on where you look huawei
claims up to two days or one point five
days of battery life and my testing I
found the shorter figure more accurate
with the always-on display enabled but
Wi-Fi disabled I managed to get about 18
hours on a single charge that means most
people will be charging this thing every
night and that's kind of a shame because
this charger isn't the greatest like the
Apple watch charger it's a nondescript
magnetic puck but huawei's disk is shoes
wireless charging for a set of tiny pins
that don't always line up on the first
try what that means is that sometimes
the magnet will attach but charging
won't take place and unless you remember
to look for that charging indicator
you'll be none the wiser until you wake
up the next day to a dead SmartWatch for
a watch this expensive it would have
been nice of Huawei to bundle a more
convenient charger Motorola's Moto 360
comes with a cradle in the box so the
watch can double as a bedside clock and
that watch starts at 50 dollars cheaper
than the Huawei watch the Huawei watch
is available in three colors with
several options for bundled bands with
prices stretching all the way up to
seven hundred ninety-nine dollars for
the gold-plated Edition and additional
bracelets available in several styles at
similarly steep prices and as I said
before even our entry level review
device here is a not insignificant $349
is it worth it yes but only if you're
already sold on Android wear is a
platform for some the interface is still
too convoluted and the added convenience
of an android smart watch still doesn't
offset the inconvenience of charging yet
another device every night for them the
Huawei watch is likely to be just as
ill-fitting as any other but Android
wear has come a long way in a short
while and nothing exemplifies that
better than this device from where I'm
sitting it's got the best display the
best industrial design and the most
elegant look and feel you can find in
the Google store right now like the
Apple watch and the watch urbane I do
think it's too expensive especially at
the higher tiers but as Huawei continues
to remind us this is a product aimed
squarely at wristwatch lovers and the
unconscious both groups accustomed to
spending money if you're looking to kick
off or upgrade your Android wear
experience and look and feel matter more
to you than anything else well it just
doesn't get any better than this
of course the Huawei watch isn't alone
in the marketplace and we saw almost all
of its competition at Aoife 2015 in
Berlin check out our related hands-on
coverage from that show here on YouTube
