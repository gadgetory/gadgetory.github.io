show packed with lots of technology but
it's rather ironic to see that for every
year that we go to the less mobile
technology we see I'm home it'll be
better with pocket now here with a quick
look at the things we saw at CES 2016
when it comes to smartphones we had a
ton of expectations for the show I mean
hey the rumors claim that the Galaxy s7
was going to make it here and in the end
we cut a ton of midranges to low-end
phones from LG from a surfer masseuse
and Alcatel OneTouch and surely yes
Huawei came with their mate 8 but it's
not like if China already had the phone
and sure there's the honor 5x as well
the only hot ticket for the show was the
next bit Robin yes we saw it at ctia but
that was a pre-alpha product today we
actually saw the final product that is
going to be on sale and it's going to
arrive to Kickstarter's over the next
few months and it is a very hot phone
remember this is not just about the
smartphone but really the platform as
there is a ton of promise for this to be
one of the smartest android phones in
the market and then when it came to the
tablets remember this is a market that's
clearly on decline we were expecting to
see some Android tablets and we actually
didn't end up seeing any of them and we
ended up seeing a lot of Windows
products like the Lenovo ThinkPad x1 and
probably the hottest one which was the
samsung galaxy tabpro s which again is a
very decent looking tablet with windows
and sure it's running on the core m
processor there probably is promise here
but then again when those 10 is still on
a rise it's very hard to predict that
this product will sell but yeah we can't
wait to get it for review i'll admit
then when it comes to the wearable
fronts that's probably where we saw most
products but then again some of these
products are from startup companies that
still have to prove these and you can
expect to the park and i'll fit in this
video series well take a look at some of
these to tell you of these products are
actually good for fitness or not but
then when it came to the hottest tickets
surely there was a revamp and colors for
the gear s2 from Samsung but I probably
think that the hottest wearables were
definitely the casio Android we're
offering in addition to the fifth
blaze the cashew in particular is
probably one of the ones that we liked
the most because of its new approach to
Android wear wear this is just part of
the platform but then again our reviews
will tell you more very soon and finally
the hottest ticket for everything that
we saw at CES particularly in mobile has
to do with VR we've been seeing VR
headsets for years ever since 2012 with
oculus and we've seen some progress with
the gear VR which is meager but then
again there's that and then there's the
HTC vive we had an opportunity to test
it out all of us at the team and my god
this is just something out of this world
something it's really hard to describe
over a video we would rather you go test
it but the biggest question is is it
really the hottest ticket meaning is we
are the future do you believe that
company should bang convey our the way
these companies have because well the
oculus rift is costing six hundred
dollars not a cheap accessory and then
the HTC vive will be another product
that will not be that affordable as well
so it does lead me to the question of
the day what was a the hottest product
that you saw at CES 2016 out of
everything that we covered because hey
again we feel that it was vr but then
again we still debated VR is the
smartest thing leave us a comment down
