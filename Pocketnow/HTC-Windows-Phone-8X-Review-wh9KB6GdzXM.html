and start full review of the Windows
Phone 8x by HTC if you want to learn
more about all the new Windows Phone 8
features be sure to search pocket now
for our full Windows Phone a review in
the meantime let's take a look at the
Windows Phone 8x the Windows Phone 8x is
one of the first available with a new
Windows Phone 8 operating system it's
got a Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM 80260 a
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor with 1
gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of internal
storage the front-facing camera has 2.1
megapixels and the rear camera has 8
megapixels while both support 1080p HD
video recording the 4.3 inch Super LCD
to screen includes 720 by 1280 pixel
resolution of course you've got
Bluetooth 2.1 Wi-Fi assist the GPS and
NFC the weight is 130 grams and
thickness is 10.1 2 millimeters at its
thickest point powering it all is a 1800
million per hour battery the design of
the Windows Phone 8 X is quite
impressive in the same way as the Nokia
Lumia 800 that is it's got a very smooth
integrated shape and this version has a
soft touch matte black finish at the top
you've got the handset speaker along
with some sensors a 2.1 megapixel
front-facing camera and an LED light
that glows while charging at the bottom
are the usual Windows Phone capacitive
buttons for search start screen and back
on the right side is a very flushed in
volume control as well as a camera
button and the Micro SIM card slot the
buttons are very difficult to feel for
without looking at the phone on the
bottom you'll see the microphone hole
and a microUSB port on the top is the
3.5 millimeter headset jack and the
power button again the power button is
impossible to feel for and have it at
the top of the device it makes it
difficult to reach on the back is the 8
megapixel camera with a single LED flash
and speaker
you'll also see the HTC and Beats Audio
logos here in hand the Windows Phone 8x
feels very thin and that's because of
its tapered shape the center is pretty
thick but the edges sloped down to a
point these pointy edges make it very
uncomfortable to grip since there's less
surface area on the edges for your thumb
and fingers now let's talk about the
software
most of our Windows Phone 8 coverage can
already be found by searching
packing.com for our full Windows Phone 8
review however there are a few
customizations that HTC has made which
we'll cover here the first big
customization is HTC's new live tile for
the HTC hub and now as a nice big clock
when he says the full width of the Start
screen it shows a weather information
below that which automatically updates
its location periodically throughout the
day once you open the HTC hub you'll
find most of the same features of the
previous version including customizable
weather reports printable stock quotes
and customizable news feeds
HTC's attentive foam features are also
available in the Windows Phone 8x you
can set it to quiet the rain on pick up
increasing volume when the phone is in
your pocket and meet the ringer when you
flip the phone over you'll also find a
few custom apps from HTC both bundled
with advice and available in HTC section
of the store the flashlight photo
enhancer units converter and connection
setup are all there
however you may notice a lot is missing
from previous HTC Windows Phones
speaking of missing features I was
disappointed to see this some of HTC's
best camera customizations options
panorama and burst Ramos are not
currently available in the Windows Phone
8x HTC is probably working on converting
those features to Windows Phone 8 new
camera lenses feature so hopefully we'll
see those returned in the update
meanwhile the cameras seen some other
significant improvements first of all
it's forced 1080p HD video recording now
image quality looks great but the
focusing and exposure adjustment changes
are a bit slow during recording and the
audio quality is very poor even on phone
calls
no there's more complaints about the
audio quality than any other phone I've
used this decade those shots have been
improved in the sense that the camera
shutter is much faster than any other
Windows Phone we've tested so far
touchscreen and there's barely any focus
lag before capturing a photo multi-touch
zooming is smooth and quick as well
that said image quality isn't
spectacular especially when you look at
100% crops compared to other cameras the
Windows Phone 8x still has a lot of
noise and lacks some detail especially
when compared to mid-range DSLR like the
Nikon d7000 and even an older phone like
the Nokia n8 the front-facing camera has
some special additions to it can record
video at 1080p HD with its 2.1 megapixel
sensor but one of the things I really
like is the still image capture option
you touch the screen to focus and then a
big three to one appears on the screen
so that you can recompose your
self-portrait before it takes the photo
next let's look at the Windows Phone 8
X's Beats Audio support and dedicated
audio amplifier the audio volume on the
Windows Phone 8x can get very loud it's
fantastic when you plug in headphones it
automatically turns on the Beats Audio
enhancements the included headphones
have the flat style wire and work pretty
good but once I plugged in some eye
beats headphones the audio quality got a
lot better and louder I also tried some
monster purity headphones which normally
I find better than the eye Beats
headphones but in this case I think the
eye beats brand had better quality in
terms of battery life I found the
Windows Phone 8x to be disappointing it
does not have a removable battery so it
really needs to last a full day and
night for me however after only eight
hours it was generally needing to
recharge this is on the international
model that doesn't support LTE on my
network so I don't have much faith in
battery life in terms of pricing and
availability the Windows Phone 8x by HTC
is currently available on some European
carriers and will be available on AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon later this November t-mobile
will have the Windows Phone 8x on
November 14th for 149 or $1.99
depending on what kind of rate plan you
choose our final rating is going to be
seven point five out of ten the screen
audio amplifier camera performance and
operating system are pretty impressive
but the pointy edges poor audio
recording quality and impossible to feel
Hardware buttons can get quite
frustrating be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
