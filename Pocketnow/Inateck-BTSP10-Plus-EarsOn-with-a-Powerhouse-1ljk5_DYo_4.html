crafted to be taken anywhere I'm Michael
Fisher with pocket now let's take a
quick look at one of the most
tricked-out bluetooth speakers out there
the VTS p10 plus from innotek the
packaging like this abbreviated unboxing
is minimal taking off the cardboard
sleeve and peeling away the shipping
foam the aggressive styling of the 10
plus is visible through the cellophane
and it's enough to make me go far
beneath that or the accessory
accessories needed to make the accessory
work a USB to mini-usb cable for
charging and a three-and-a-half
millimeter male to male connector for
hardwired audio along with a nice
microfiber carrying pouch if you want to
protect your purchase it's all rounded
out by a tiny little instruction card
and that's all she wrote for the
unboxing onto the speaker itself pulling
away the protective plastic reveals the
10 plus in all its hexagons pocked glory
and unto that soft touch paint job it
feels as beefy as it looks on the front
you can see the dual 3 watt drivers
peeking through the grill and around
back we got a spec plate laying down
some audio file info for us the right
side pax power ports and an on-off
switch there's nothing on the left and
up top we've got Bluetooth and volume
controls and still more hexagons at 390
grams this is a heavy sucker but of
course with a 9 to 15 hour battery and a
root unded 16-core ndfeb 3w magnetic
driver you've got to expect that right
yeah I don't know what any of that means
but I'm gonna find out and follow up
when we take a closer look at this thing
in a future video for now I just want to
quickly hear how it sounds I power it up
pair it with my Moto X via bluetooth
fire up the stitcher app and get an
earful of a podcast you should listen to
some time all I have is the Milky
remnants of a caramel macchiato at the
back of us I reasons we go
I bought on this DJ always I think we're
ready
you know someone once told me when I was
down in the dumps feeling like that's a
ton of sound from a very small box but
there's also a ton of echo in the studio
so into the sound booth we go for a
little bit of pinback
you
okay so first impressions this sucker is
loud proud and acoustically well so far
I'm pretty wowed on the flip side I'm a
little put off by the size and the
weight I'm not sure how I feel about the
aesthetic and battery life is a mystery
only time can solve sup stay tuned for a
longer look at the innotek BTS be 10
plus coming soon from pocket now in the
meantime take a look at some other
accessories that have crossed our review
labs and if you want to hear the rest of
that engaging episode of the pocket now
weekly that's here too till next time
this has been michael fisher with pocket
now captain two phones on twitter
reminding you that the total of the
internal angles of any hexagon is 720
degrees the more you know we'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
