calm this is another episode of the
windows phone 7 app roundup and which
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get started share shopping
list that allows you consolidate all of
your shopping into one application so
that your friends and family don't buy
the same exact thing and put in the
fridge so you don't end up with like a 4
gallons of milk in the fridge or so that
you know exactly what you should be
getting from the grocery store so what
you can do is you can add your store so
I like to do is add an item and once I
have purchased that I'm all have to do
is check it off but the cool thing about
this application is it syncs with the
other users on your account so that they
know exactly what to purchase and what
has been purchased score mobile is a
free application bill in the windows
marketplace that allows you to view
practically any score of any major
sporting event in the world you can also
be live sports right here I have NHL
hockey selections click on this and I
can view the live scores so now I can
view the scores of today and the time
period and what the standings are second
let's go back and from here I can load
my favorites onto with the dashboard so
I do is click on one of these hold it
down and then move it into this box and
then it will be assigned to my favorites
on my dashboard and I can also view my
favorite teams by clicking on the star
wind phone alpha is a free application
but on the windows marketplace the ledge
compute practice any calculation so this
is kind of tied into wolfram alpha so
all I do is click up here and once they
learn to integrate something I can
integrate and I can just go here and add
a number soldiers do 3x and now just
equals and wait for this to load and it
also saves my results and now we'll show
me right with my results through Wolfram
Alpha and I can just click here to view
the steps and to see exactly how that
was derived traffic cop is a free game
available in the windows marketplace the
object of the game is to either speed up
or slow down the oncoming traffic and
what you do is to control the traffic
but if you hit a tank it doesn't really
make that much difference so I'll show
you this now let's say I wanted to stop
this car here in the middle of the
intersection I can do that I can also
speed them up by clicking on them and
moving them across so the game continues
on like this and becomes more
increasingly difficult until you have
an accident and then something explodes
and it shows that you've crashed our sea
air sim is a light and paid remote
control flight simulator game so this
does cost two dollars and ninety-nine
cents for the full version so the way
that it works is you have two
controllers would have left and then
right so what you want to do is control
your aircraft and fly it through the air
unfortunately this is the reason why my
parents didn't buy me one of these when
I was a child because I would have
crashed it on the ground so we'll try
that again and let's see if we can do
this a little bit better and probably
not and once again I've crashed into the
building so you try it out yourself so
