continued the HTC One gets announced and
Glamour read but there's a catch and
Google now allows you to check TV shows
now I'm Jaime Rivera and yeah I'd even
love Google now to film this video for
me while I sat down but this is
PocketNow daily let's start off with
some expected news the Ghul editions of
the galaxy s4 on the HTC One were
launched yesterday and already these
stock roms are available for everybody
at xda-developers so link to the
description for details on how to get
these stock roms for your current HTC
One or galaxy s4 of you felt ripped off
with this launch and aside from that you
can also get that read glamour it would
be glamour of read HTC one variant that
we leaked ever since the phone was
launched but sadly only if you're in the
UK as this phone is exclusive to phones
for you so sadly that's the catch now
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy Note
3 it's slated for Ethan Berlin as it
always happens and well we heard our
tipster recently saying that the device
will have a 5.7 inch display but
interesting we've got other rumors now
saying that there will be two variants
of the phone one with an LCD display and
another with the Super AMOLED display
and the question is why would we have
these two variants apparently they will
be slated for different markets and I'm
wondering why the Super AMOLED display
was just fine but let's see what happens
in the future t-mobile is up next as the
company has just sent out press invites
for an event to happen on July 10th and
even though we know that the roadmap has
the Xperia Z coming up and also the
Nokia Lumia 925 well the event
invitation says that these are their
boldest moves yet and while these phones
are cool but they're not they're boldest
moves yet so the question is what are we
getting at this event stay tuned we'll
be covering it live definitely Skype has
just rolled out a new update that brings
video messaging for free to everybody
but this is pretty much like voice
messaging you just spilled something and
you leave it to somebody at the chat
which is interesting cuz you could
always just have a video chat with this
person directly from your phone it's
kind of hard to see how this is gonna be
functional make sure you up they didn't
give it a try leave us a comment tell us
what you think about it so far I wish
that Skype would give us free video
conferencing how about that and finally
for the interesting news of the big
Google now it just got better you know
you can now control your music from the
application which is something long
overdue but even cooler is the fact that
you can now detect what's on TV and get
information through Google now but
there's obviously a caveat here you
sadly
need to have that TV connected to Wi-Fi
meaning you need a Wi-Fi enabled TV to
be able to detect what's on TV using
Google now but you know it's still a
work in progress and it's always cool to
see these updates come links in the
description for full details on every
other update that comes up but that
leave it to the question of the day do
you like using Google now is that a
service that you enjoy in my particular
case I depend a lot on it it's probably
one of the coolest features I've ever
seen but leave us a comment down below
what do you think about Google now of
course it's always for an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on Parga now calm
subscribe to our youtube channel as well
it also follow me on twitter and Hein
underscore to be better please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw I am hey Metairie better thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
