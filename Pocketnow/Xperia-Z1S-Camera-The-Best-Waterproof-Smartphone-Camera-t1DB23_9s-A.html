a waterproof smartphone acclaim t-mobile
USA is all too happy to reiterate on its
website but our experience with Sony
smartphone shooters over the years has
been an inconsistent one so we wanted to
test the Xperia z1s for ourselves to see
just how well its camera performs
fortunately the folks at t-mobile USA
we're able to send us a review unit and
while it is a little too late for a full
review it's never too late to have some
fun with smartphone photography I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is a test of the Sony Xperia z1s camera
both above and beneath the waves the z1
s certainly isn't lacking for optical
prowess on the spec sheet a twenty point
seven megapixel autofocus camera sits
around back and packs a twenty-seven
millimeter f/2 sensor with up to three
times lossless zoom and an LED flash all
of it controlled by something we always
love to see a hardware shutter key on
the phone side pressing and holding that
shutter key fires up the viewfinder
software and Sony's is one of the better
implementations we've seen if you've
ever used a Sony mirrorless camera you
probably be familiar with the
iconography the shooting modes even the
sound effects are the same we'd like to
see more manual controls offered a
complaint that persists from our time
with the earlier z1 but otherwise
there's an awful lot to play with here
it's just a fun software experience
particularly when you dig down into the
various modes like picture effect which
allows you to apply various
quote-unquote artistic effects to a
photo like sketch if you want to look
like you're in a 1985 music video from
AHA or Harris shutter if you want to see
the world through Geordi LaForge as
visor there's also room for modes that
can plug in from third-party apps like
Evernote and even a home screen widget
so you can jump right into the mode of
your choice which is convenient in more
traditional still photography the camera
defaults to eight point three megapixel
shots and in open-air settings
performance can venture into the truly
excellent outdoors in balanced afternoon
lighting some shots offer colors that
are more muted than real
but others are vibrant and gorgeous we
probably have the intelligent Auto
filter to thank for that inconsistency
but on the whole the camera delivers
solid photos viewed at normal size it's
only when you zoom in that you start to
see Sony's characteristic color modeling
which were disappointed but not
necessarily surprised to see and that
fuzziness is only amplified in low-light
shots which do a good job of brightening
up a scene that these photos came out
much brighter than the true life
conditions but even a small bit of
magnification reveals the loss of detail
you have to deal with in exchange these
photos are all available at pocket now
in the link in the description below if
you want to take a closer look for
yourself under good daylight conditions
video is nice you'll notice a smooth
shot here something we took to be
digital stabilization until we took a
closer look at the lens and saw the
camera module moving when activated true
to t-mobile's word this is Hardware
image stabilization resulting in a nice
clear picture the frame rates a little
low in the default setting but otherwise
we have very few complaints in the open
air as you might have gleaned from some
of our device photography it's pretty
cold outside
so rather than test underwater
performance in the Charles River we
opted instead for a kitchen sink a
pretty dull testing site which we
promptly liven up with a Koosh ball a
baking soda powered submarine and a
crashing Starship Enterprise underwater
shooting is still pretty challenging due
to display visibility problems and the
tendency of the screen to get a little
wacky on first immersion but it's worth
the trouble if you can keep the object
you're shooting in the frame the clarity
of the footage is outstanding and the
autofocus does a good job even in
changing lighting conditions stills -
are impressive under the waves and
here's where that hardware shutter key
really earns its money because half
press to focus works just as well
underwater as above at first glance this
Koosh ball almost looks like it was
photographed in a professional studio
floating in some ethereal mist but
loaded with color
and though the submarine here starts in
a distant out-of-focus cloud it resolves
into a beautiful close-up honestly I
don't recall ever seen underwater
results this good from a smartphone
camera once again if you want to see him
close-up all these photos are available
to review in full size at pocket now we
proved with last month's smartphone
guessing game that phone shooters can
surprise you and surprised is a good
word to describe my feelings toward this
camera is it the best I've ever used now
would I want to use it if I took most of
my pictures in low-light settings also
no but is it capable of capturing great
photos absolutely and I didn't expect
that given my experiences with Sony's
smartphone cameras of the past plus the
viewfinder software is some of the best
thought out and most responsive I've
used so I don't really mind if I have to
try a photo again is it in fact the
world's best camera on a waterproof
smartphone well given the wide range of
shooting modes that reliable Hardware
camera key and the great results we were
able to get underwater let me put it
this way we can't say it isn't the
world's best underwater smartphone
camera we'd have to try everyone in the
world to ultimately prove or disprove it
but given our excellent experience here
Sony's claim is tough to challenge if
you're a swimmer looking for an
excellent freshwater smartphone shooter
the z1 s is probably the best you can
hope for right now and it's pretty good
even if you're a landlubber to everyone
you know where you can find the full
size sample images you saw in this video
click the link down in the description
below it will take you right to
pocketnow.com and on your way please
drop us a like if you enjoy the video
the meantime stay tuned for more on the
z1 s including a comparison with the z1
compact coming very soon until next time
this has been michael fisher with
PocketNow please follow us on social
media if you don't already but most
importantly thank you for watching we'll
see you next time
fortunately t-mobile USA damn I can't
that framerate oh god I need to know
more about photography
fortunately t-mobile USA was able to
send us a review unit and while it's a
little too late for a full review it's
never too late it's never too late it's
never too late to have some fun
if curse I'll have to do what's the out
looking like SIM card removed oh oh
actually not good at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
