and t-mobile has been gracious enough to
supply us with a mytouch 4g phone to
review in our last video I showed you
the initial unboxing and a hardware
review of the the device just a walk
around in this video let's see what the
first boot looks like alright so here we
go the power button is up here on the
top so we'll go ahead and push that and
we will wait for the initial boot we've
got a vibration to indicate that is
booting up along with the tmobile and
the mytouch 4g logos kind of an earthy
green something that something that i
like and then we've got a mytouch
animated logo right in the middle of the
screen so we'll go ahead and let that
run now while we're doing this it's
worth mention that first boots initially
take longer than subsequent boots not
just power on and power off where you're
powering on and off the screen but where
you're actually powering on and off the
device so bear that in mind when you're
booting it up the first time so I've got
ahead and done that and this is using
the sim that was provided by t-mobile so
that we could review it it should be
able to go out and grab the time here
pretty quickly so we'll just go ahead
and let that think but in the meantime I
met with some striped horses here and
new voicemail how about that go ahead
and unlock the screen just by dragging
it down and I've got my welcome message
now this welcome I don't know if I can
bump the brightness of the phone up here
so you'll have to bear with me a little
bit go ahead and go through the next
it's got a nice welcome message will say
next and then we've got a welcome video
which is kind of cool
now this is kind of interesting showing
you a an advertisement to the phone that
you've just bought trying to guess
convince you hey you should buy this but
you know we already have it in hand it's
kind of neat showing you the features
and capabilities of the device and it's
something that honestly I haven't seen
before on on an Android or any other
smartphone for that matter don't do this
at home the phone does not actually
float or fly at the screen all right so
now we're back to the welcome screen
we've got this welcome to your new phone
with a few clicks we're going to set it
up so we're going to go ahead and walk
through that just so you can see it and
of course we've got a replay button
there in case you missed the video you
can watch it again and again and again
we'll go next we can choose a theme now
this is a very HTC Sense esque so we're
just going to find one that we like dead
tree zebras nice close-up of flowers
eight you know what you guys always like
when I show you flowers so let's choose
our flowers theme here because I know
you like it so much no of course what we
can do now is I check my social networks
to keep in touch with my friends and
family yes I do and I listen to my
personal music yes I do know what this
is doing is its setting up what you're
going to see on these themes on this on
your home screens basically go ahead and
say next and how do i coordinate
activities with my friends and family
while I keep up with my schedule and I
check my email so yeah that's fairly
obvious will select those and then of
course we've got the location consent
where we say yeah I want to be able to
share my location with google and for
Google services so that I can get better
search results and stuff they're checked
by default you just saw what happens
when you try to uncheck them it tells
you why you might not want to we're
going to leave them selected and say
next and then it goes through kind of a
wizard where it sets up the home mode
applies your theme load some widgets and
does something else that went by too
fast
now I can set up email accounts video
chat and social networks right here so
email accounts will choose Google this
is the standard Google set up now and i
am going to sign in with my account so
let me do that off camera and I'll be
right back okay so I just provided my
credentials to google and it came back
and said everything was good and now
it's giving me the option to back up my
data with my google account which i
always do that makes transferring phones
a lot easier to and then we'll finish
the setup so that's all I have I can
also set up an exchange server if I have
one or yahoo mail or some other popper
smtp or IMAP mail I don't have any of
those so I doesn't give me an option
here but I'm going to go ahead and hit
back and that works for me now next I'm
going to skip video chat for just a
minute and we're going to go to social
networks and I will set up my facebook
and twitter now those take you to the
standard setups and again I'll go ahead
and put this in just so you can see what
the end result okay so I've set up all
three of my social networks and while I
was doing that it showed me that this
particularly in the flicker area is
using the HTC media uploader which gives
me the impression that this is an HTC
Sense UI or something that uses the
sense UI components so we'll definitely
get into that as we go further so let's
go back and now let's go on to that
video chat will choose that then it says
what do I want t mobile video chat or a
yahoo messenger well since I don't use
yahoo messenger let's use a tmobile
video chat go ahead and sign up now
video chat is cool because you have this
front facing camera now this is not like
a Apple solution where you can only use
it over over Wi-Fi this you can actually
do over 3g or 4g or at least that's what
the claim is you do need to have a kik
account so if you do not you will need
to sign up for one i'm going to go ahead
and log in here okay so after providing
my login credentials i met with this
screen of course if you didn't have a
kik account previously what you need to
do is go ahead and set that up and there
is an in app setup for that to create a
new account so here you can create or
you
do a video chat which is a two-way live
video call you can record and share now
this is kind of like youtubing stuff
boat instead of recording stuff on the
camera and then uploading it to to
youtube later it actually streams it up
to the kick server so you can get real
life stuff as it goes on now if you're
ever involved in any kind of police
activity that's a really good thing to
have because you can record what's going
on and have it streaming up an online
and even if they confiscate the phone
and destroy that recording it's up on
the web not that I get into trouble with
the police too much but this is the app
of choice for that just so you know you
can also record a video mail which is
just like it sounds it's like a
voicemail but with video and then of
course there's the video gallery where
you can manage share and sync your
videos so that's kind of cool now why am
i covering the top of the phone it's
because the the auto brightness is kind
of Wiggin out with the camera and
whatnot I'm not trying to hide anything
from you I'm just covering that up so it
thinks it's dark and lets you see it a
little bit brighter on camera so that's
what I'm doing that but let's continue
through I'm going to go ahead and hit
back we're not going to set up yahoo
messenger so we'll go back again I've
done all of these and we'll go to the
next option now it lets me learn more
stuff learn about the genius button
about the media room which is all of my
media in one place at least what that's
what it says right there learn more
about video chat learn more about screen
share to broadcast photos and videos to
a high-definition TV that's something
cool and something I want to get into in
a later video and then of course how to
use the swype keyboard the phone does
come with swype and it is set as the
default keyboard it's got kind of a nice
white theme to it so you might not know
it swipe right off the bat but it is and
you can use it just like you would with
any other swype keyboard so we've got
ahead and done that so let's it done and
what we've got now is the mytouch logo
and it's showing me my picture gallery
just kind of cool because I don't have
that on this phone it's pulling that in
I I suppose through picasa so that's
kind of cool and if you're wondering
what that is that's a that's a cable
modem that has the stupidest button in
the world on it the button being the
internet
on/off button not the device on off but
internet on off okay so what you're
going to notice the first and foremost
this is sense UI very clearly sense UI
you've got all the sense widgets you
know friends stream you can see it's
already populated with my friends
information playlist stuff is empty and
then it's got the phone and contacts and
app drawer buttons right there so there
is your first boot and initial look at
what comes on the mytouch 4G obviously
we're going to be doing more videos
about this in the very very near future
again want to thank t-mobile for sending
us this evaluation unit and including
the capability to do data we'll see if
we can get 4G where I am located out
here in Utah and if not we'll see what
their 3g speeds are and we'll do that in
a later video but thank you to them for
that and of course our views and our
review comments and whatnot are our own
and they're not that of t-mobile USA or
any of their affiliates associate
assigns or any other legal entities
yadda yadda okay legal stuff done so go
ahead and subscribe to our video channel
will give you a link for that right now
and make sure you come back give this
video a thumbs up if you liked seeing
first boot and initial impression stuff
and showing off the the mytouch 4G I'm
