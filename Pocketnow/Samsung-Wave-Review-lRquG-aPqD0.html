calm and these are my final thoughts on
the samsung wave alright guys and we're
back and I pretty much just want to jump
into some of the pros of the samsung
wave to get started you know some of the
things that I really enjoyed about the
phone that really stuck out to me and
the first one is going to be the screen
itself the screen is by far the most
vibrant screen that I've ever used with
a cell phone the colors really jumped
out at me and the colors were extremely
accurate I also found that I was able to
see the phone without an issue at all
outside granted as you saw in the camera
testing there was a little bit of glare
I love what I found was me turn the
brightness up the colors actually will
shine through that glare and there's no
issue at all seeing as many of you do
and do not know is I spent a lot of time
outside that made the phone very easy
for me to see I was able to make phone
calls write emails text message even
play games like the asphalt five the
racing game that I showed you in the
software overview without any issue
whatsoever so that really went a long
way from me also staying on the screen
as I mentioned in the previous video
it's a capacitive touchscreen now
capacitive screens are usually amazing
screens I have you some phones that I
don't know if it's a software issue or a
hardware issue the capacitive doesn't
really work that well the samsung wave
however is fantastic despite the fact
that it's a very narrow screen I was
able to actually text message write
emails with ease on that on-screen
virtual keyboard I had no problems
navigating it was very accurate when I
pressed on an icon so I have no
complaints as far as that goes another
one of the great features that i really
enjoyed about the samsung wave was what
they call the mobile AP it's actually an
application that's in the phone itself
it's basically just making your phone
into a mobile hotspot now i really
wasn't able to show and then the
software video unfortunately due to the
time and the fact that my signal at
least in my office and home area with a
tease reception isn't really the
greatest i was also only using edge
which i will touch on later on in this
video i was able to basically take my
phone use it as a wireless hotspot to
three computers i did actually to my
iPad itself into other computer so i was
able to fully test that out and it
worked great for me no issues at all and
not every phone has that the fact that
bada is going to incorporate that with
they're operating system it was great to
me jumping back toward the hardware
front I have to say and it may sound
weird the form factor with the phone was
just phenomenal for me it fit in my hand
no problem at all it was a thin fun i'm
used to putting cases on my phones but i
had no issues at all using that for what
it was on the fact that it really wasn't
that wide fit in my hand in the palm of
my hand perfectly you know i was able to
actually put the phone into my pocket
pull out a one slick motion and I'll
mock it no issues at all put the phone
back into my pocket with the same thing
there's no issues whatsoever staying on
the hardware also kind of moving right
into the battery life many of you do
know i'm using the evo right now and the
battery life isn't the greatest however
with the wave which was my primary phone
during this test period i was getting
like two days of battery on a consistent
basis browsing wasn't really you know
the biggest thing that i was doing on
the phone but making a lot of phone
calls sending a lot of text message
messages i had no problem at all with
the battery up i'm going back to the
software front is going to actually be
the browser and the fact that flash is
incorporating the browser as you saw in
my test video of the browser itself it's
extremely fast it doesn't load every
detail to a website and i'm not a
hundred percent sure why that is however
the browser does load flash and is
compatible with flash that was huge for
me I actually do a lot of browsing that
requires flash I miss out on a lot of
videos a lot of other content that does
require flash because other phones that
I may have used in the past and not use
them however with the wave no issue at
all and as I showed you in the video the
browser is very fast so I have to say
the bada native browser works great
whatever Samsung has done on that front
they need to keep doing what they're
doing and finally is going to be the
voice quality now I've used the nexus
one with 18 teen in the past and that
phone is notorious for having great
voice quality however the samsung wave
tops it I don't know what they've done
with a microphone in that phone of the
fact that it's able to receive possibly
a signal better however I was only using
18 T's edge with the samsung wave and it
sounded better than the nexus one did on
18 th 3g signal once again i'm not
really sure what they've done but people
could hear me much better and i could
hear them much better it actually
sounded like their actual voice when I
was talking to them on the phone now so
that to me is a new experience and now
having to move back to a different phone
almost sounds like I'm talking on a
muffle phone to mean now kind of going
through some of the cons or some of the
negatives about the phone one of the
first things i want to touch
is going to be the fact that as you just
heard I was not able to get the 3g bands
of eighteen t on the samsung wave so
that was a big thing for me personally
because my data speeds were a little
slower in that sense the phone is
ultimately made for the UK however
because it's unlocked you can use it
wherever the hardware inside is not
compatible with the 850 megahertz
spectrum that we use here in the US
partly with ATT i will be 3g compatible
with the UK with most of europe as well
as australia so there's no issues there
another downside on the software side of
things was actually the samsung apps in
the App Store the fact that I wasn't
actually able to go into the store and
down there any kind of apps I believe
Samsung is going to be doing a steady
roll out over time basically going from
country to country and i believe the
u.s. is scheduled to get theirs in
september-october timeframe but the fact
that i was actually not able to get in
and download some new apps really made
me feel like I was missing out on some
of the key features that this phone
could offer I think this will grow in
time but right now it does need some
work and it needs to be out so we can
get a shot with it and lastly on the
cross between a software and the
hardware front is going to be the fact
that the screen is somewhat small it's
three point three inches and you know
that was a little narrow for me when
trying to text and stuff like that while
the screen is accurate just the visual
perception of seeing a small keyboard
kind of made me feel like the phone was
a little lacking in that sense but on
top of that because the screen was so
small and also I think part of the
software was the fact that was only able
to comfortably add one or two widgets
per page as you saw in the video itself
now I'm able to put up to ten pages
which is great but I would like to be
able to put the main widgets that I'm
going to be using on that first page
comfortably rather than having to do
only one or two in what seems like a
pre-decided template spot so I can only
move the widget up down left right in a
certain area now basically how do I feel
about the phone honestly guys I love the
phone it was my main phone over the
course that I was testing it out for I
did have my evo with me but the evil
really took a back seat here I did use
the wave I mean all my phone calls with
the way because i had more bars in more
areas go figure i did also though find
that the call quad it was better and
that just really made the phone more
enjoyable for me also you know again the
form factor was great in the fact that
my battery was actually going to last me
a full day if not to really made me just
again put the evo aside and use the way
for what it was now what I you
the wave if I had the chance to
personally by the wave probably not and
there's only one reason why I see the
wave as more of a I wouldn't say a niche
device but I see the wave as a in
between or a tweener type device if you
have a feature phone on the left and a
smartphone on the right I feel the wave
and bada fall right in the middle and
that's strictly because of bada now if
you had the wave with android on it i
would say smartphone all the way but i
think some of the features that that
bada offers in terms of the email and
stuff like that isn't really the full
spectrum that you would get on a
smartphone so I do think that it would
fall right in the middle so if you're
not looking for a smartphone and you're
looking for a future phone you want
something that's going to do a little
more but not too much and really kind of
scare you away the wave really will be
for you all right guys and that's going
to wrap up my overview my review of the
samsung wave i really hope you enjoyed
some of the info i was able to provide
to you i know i had a lot of fun putting
these videos together so hopefully
they'll be more from me coming in the in
the next few months next few weeks for
that matter once again I really do up to
recommend the samsung wave if you're not
looking for a smartphone or a dull
feature phone let's say if it does fall
right in the middle there and if you are
looking to pick one up you can get it
over at clove co uk around four hundred
dollars and as I always ask guys please
give us a thumbs up also if you like
these videos and there will be more and
you want to see a lot more video
overviews and all that fun stuff please
