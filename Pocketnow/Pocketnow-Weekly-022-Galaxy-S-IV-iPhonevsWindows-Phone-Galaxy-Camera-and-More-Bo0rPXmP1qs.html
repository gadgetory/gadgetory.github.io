everything in between I'm your host
Michael Fisher senior editor at pocket

world announcement will happen there in
a couple of days so you can actually
choose the topic you know we could

pocketnow.com that was crazy to see this
morning so I looked at it about 20
minutes ago and I was like oh I didn't
know we were hiring again that's fun
let's see this very exciting I won't be
that maybe won't be the new guy again
like I mean person out loud right all
right well let's uh let's jump into
we've got the announcements out of the
way let's jump into our thought thread
to kick off the the show here kind of a
cool period like right before the
holidays but after the big holiday rush
of announcements so we're kind of in
this little trough and as people who are
bored or people who have access to
information that i find dubious
sometimes have already started
speculating about products that
I I that are so far in the future I
don't even know what to think of them
but I think Brandon does so friend if
you want to tell us something about the
galaxy s4 maybe well yeah so I don't
know anything particular but I want to
have a little discussion about it it's
it's funny because in just about three
months Samsung will announce a phone
that will be talking about in a year
from now when it's out on carriers just
like it's been happening every year now
uh and the galaxy s4 is going to be as
significant if not more significant than
a galaxy s3 was and Samsung pretty much
owned this year in the Android space
with the galaxy s3 and it's a it's
really just a combination of factors
that made it amazing so I kind of want
to have a discussion about what Samsung
could do to hold on to that that that
dominance in Android in 2013 with the
galaxy s4 in terms of hardware and
software and really where they can go
from here I guess I'll start off with
one obvious place that they can go and
that's higher in screen resolution HTC
has proved that more pixels can be
better even if it's beyond that 300 PPI
threshold so you know I think 1080p
5-inch screen on the galaxy s4 is a sure
thing and what's interesting is that if
you take out your galaxy s3 and you
measure a 5-inch screen you can actually
fit a 5-inch screen in the same form
factor as the galaxy s3 which is
important because if if Samsung makes
that the bezels wider and the whole
device taller and wider him and they got
rid of the home button and they got rid
of the home a-men get rid of them but
yeah so you think they're gonna get rid
of the home button they have to get rid
of the home button I mean try to try to
launch Google now right now with that
galaxy s3 it just pisses me off big
thing in the galaxy nexus a simple swipe
the top with this thing you have to hold
the button and then wait for the menu
and then press the damn google now
button it just pisses me off yes yeah
but yes and no i think i think yes they
should remove the home button because
like for example to get the 5-inch
screen they're gonna have to
probably take it off you had sacrificed
that chin down below you're talking
about right yeah you're gonna have to go
into that chin significantly but then
again the home button on the Galaxy S
series of devices has been there since
the beginning and it's it's almost like
a I can iconic design element like an
iPhone man it's like a night that's what
you said it when you unbox the galaxy s2
this looks too much like an iphone right
and that's just the way it is I mean
they go ahead we've now written two
editorials on the site spaced about five
months apart by different editors saying
the home button needs to go in general
and you know whether you agree with that
or not for for the iphone i think it is
eventually going to go away on the
iphone and i think it's definitely going
to go away on the Galaxy series I just
wonder which one of them is going to
blink first and I think it has a solid
chance of being samsung because that
screen size is going to have to be
they're going to go with a larger
display for their 1080p panel and
brandon i agree with you i think they're
going to cut into that below the screen
area to do that and I you know and
there's something really amazing about
seeing a phone that is you know in
standby state or shut off whose face is
just a continuous sheet of glass there
was yet it's very sexy he's one of the
cool things about the nexus for the
Galaxy Nexus etc yeah yeah that's why I
wanted about your your razr m that you
love so much that's very true but do you
like that thing a lot better than I
thought it would you know that's that
that bezel less but it's bezel less word
actually I mean it is no no no best
around the screen yeah it's become but
yeah if Motorola wanted to pull that off
they couldn't do it so you know I would
follow and brandon's idea i mean if they
were able to pull a screen without a
bezel no buttons at all it's just the
gigantic screen within the same size as
the galaxy s3 I'm buying yeah and well I
mean we've we've seen the droid DNA and
Brennan and I've both you know handled
that and that's a it's amazing how much
display can be fit into a into a chassis
that actually still feels like a
smartphone it is still you know petite
enough and I it would be great to see
Samsung do something similar it's it's
lovely the 1080p thing um what do you
guys think will Samsung wilbert will
bring to the table for the galaxy s4 I'm
just gonna crack up if they bring a 4k
screen or something like that I just
it's just right now it's
it's we actually have a notorious 20p
720p I mean 720p barely came out by the
end of last year we've got 1080p now so
next year is gonna be the 1080p thing
i'm just wondering what's it gonna be
like in 2014 are we gonna get 4k or
something it's just going crazier and
crazier I really anti I really mean what
I'm about to say I don't think for the
foreseeable future five years we're
gonna go beyond 1080p I don't think
we're gonna go to 4k for a very long
time until four case TV sets are
affordable and there's lots of content
for it there's just there's there's
literally no knee I can't I'm really
trying to think it's amazing to hear
that from you too so like this is why
I'm this is why I think you're right i
mean when it's coming from when Brandon
renamon says there is no need for any
higher resolution displays you're like
the most qualified person to say that
because you're the biggest resolution
you know how and there is so I agree
with you I think there will be a you
know I don't think there's any need for
anything above 1080p but you know every
time my mouth makes the move to say
something like that I get a little
worried because you know they're people
what is that that famous thing that Bill
Gates never said you know you I don't
see why anyone would ever need more than
512k of RAM you know which is apocryphal
but it's a hilarious quote wait yeah it
is hilarious yeah I mean you know
there's gonna I but I i agree i think
resolution we're gonna plateau at
resolution we're gonna go into the next
thing and maybe maybe somebody will find
a way to do 3d in an interesting way
that's their IQ cite you know I just
which always smart phone no II I just
wish these smartphone OEMs would forget
you know we've already reached 720p okay
let's leave it at 1080p that's great
1080p is great how about if the next
technology they work on is bringing a
frickin solar panel on the phone or or
work on battery technology I mean make
something up that's in order to make
phones I'm not saying make phones
thinner i just wish they would last a
week yeah well night in turin that
that's an interesting place that that we
have yet to see evolution and I feel
like if any company is gonna come out
and say oh by the way this phone gets a
week worth of battery life or even like
three days it's going to be Apple
especially because the iphone 5 you know
as as it is still pretty power-hungry I
mean it's tough to get through a day
with the iphone 5 in a lot of cases and
that'sthat's interesting because in my
particular case the last company I would
ever think of whatever it would be able
to pull that off as Apple and the reason
why is because ever since the first
generation iphone no iphone has had good
battery life no I yeah that's true but
like I mean I mean and we can have this
conversation later the iphone 6 there i
bring that term up um well you know it
it's it's not going to have a larger
screen it's probably not going to be
very much thinner what we're talking
about the 5s which we'll talk about
later so it's like where else can it get
better besides the software of course
which is the obvious place i mean bad I
you know I think got to be working on
battery life it's such a problem yeah
you know I mean to kind of to kind of
get us back toward the to the galaxy s4
here behaving like I think there are
other areas that that we can you know
Excel besides battery life and I wrote a
piece on Betterlife this past week or
whatever it was and I was like oh that's
a whole different ball of wax it's a
whole different birds nest in there but
like with the galaxy s4 seems to the
rumors seem to be attaching to it very
readily as they did before the 3 launch
and you know it's will the with a galaxy
s3 have across the room wireless
charging and all this kind of random
crazy stuff you know but the galaxy s4
has been rumored to have a what is it an
unbreakable display is that what it is
like a that would bring about flexible
display what is the deal I manage that
that would be awesome that would be
awesome and you know the biggest problem
with samsung and and by the way that
Galaxy Nexus that you have is a product
of another galaxy nexus that used to be
Brandon's that I broke and the problem
stammering and you don't have this issue
with HTC and you don't have this issue
uh it's funny but you don't have this
issue with the iphone is that you know
Samson is the only company that dares to
take the display the glass of the
display up to the mere border of the
plastic and therefore you know with the
galaxy either the galaxy s3 or the
Galaxy Nexus it really depends on how
you drop the phone to smash it yeah
that's that's the biggest deal if the
phone falls on its corner you're good
smash the display there is just no way
around it is actually backed up by the
plane HTC device it's funny you mention
HTC because the with the DNA they take
the glass all the way to the edge and
I'm just very similar to the galaxy s3
but better and my friend of mine who
just bought the droid DNA and was so
excited showed me last night that he had
dropped it on its side just as you say
and it had shattered from narrow side in
ya know oh man well so that's the thing
you know I was the funny thing is when
when I smash it this way you know I
immediately told Brandon I just broke
your phone man I'm so sorry um you know
I was I started quoting what it would
cost me to replace the display because
you know this is one of the things that
pisses me off and I'm gonna sound like a
fanboy right now but it just is the case
you know I smash an iphone and all I
have to do is go to an apple store I pay
for a replacement I get a new phone but
if I smash a samsung phone what do I do
with it you know that that's the biggest
question what do i do with a smash
display you know recently I had a
problem with my HTC One X and the only
thing i could do is ship it back to the
HTC hope that they want to replace my
phone and then send it back so if samson
can figure out a way to make their parts
you know more durable than yes i would
love the device because for you know for
the record changing the galaxy nexus
display on the i9250 cost 250 bucks and
a brand new phone started costing 350 so
it's like what do you do you know yeah
it's pretty it's pretty Craig um but
what what person what percentage of uh
phone owners who have their phone for
two years would you say crack or shatter
their screen men or women ah that's a
dangerous dangerous question right but
let's put them in the same group let's
let's let's not do that okay out of 10
friends that I know I could tell you
that uh between three and four of them
have smash a display in the past year
that's interesting that's a good way of
looking at it have ten friends I know
maybe to have and you are one of them
actually yeah are we counting ourselves
cuz I definitely smash my galaxy nexus
shoot you Galaxy Nexus Brandon's match
his iphone and his iPad so
all right come on all right so I guess
with more devices you did you run the
risk of more smashing we'd go ahead
Rendon yes okay so so let's say there's
there's three out of ten so I'm a
30-percent high knees at 45 what are you
what do you get my home i'm at about i'm
at about twenty percent I've got some
some careful friends I guess so in if if
our sampling is accurate which it
probably isn't because we've more
tech-savvy friends approximately thirty
percent of people will crack her smash
your phone so yes that it did at first
when you said Jaime Jaime you said
unbreakable screen I thought that that
was not really going to be headlined
future but now talking about talking
about it sounds like it it would
actually be pretty good yeah yeah you
know it's just so complicated you know
in the particular with the case of the
Samsung devices and even with Apple
devices you know the the glass is fused
to the LCD know and and you know word of
warning listeners if you ever smash a
display do not make the mistake of
buying the glass on ebay and getting a
heat gun to replace this the display
yourselves you will never get it right
and you'll trace man I do that so let me
tell you how about all you have exactly
do we do it no it said are you talking
just for the iphone I mean because you
can do it for other devices but be good
listeners I know that Samsung's HTC
devices and the iphones are fused
together yeah well yeah the i-35 is in
sell the iphone 5 is in cell so it's
different yeah if it's an old-school
display though I mean one of the one of
the first dates I went on with a girl
once where she was she had busted her
droid razr x and she was like yeah hang
on we just got to like hang out in here
for a second so ever hang out in my
living room and I wat over the course of
25 minutes i watch her disassemble her
droid razr x replace the LCD and put it
back together a job it was the sexiest
thing I've ever seen you didn't get and
you didn't get married right there come
on we got open on it I'm sure that what
that was the queue that was but that was
the cute right there was a sign from
heaven right exactly well at any rate uh
yeah i agree i mean i think these are
this is a really compelling feature that
would be really cool I don't know what
unbreakable display means maybe it means
it's so flexible not display mounted in
a incredibly futuristic manner that
deploys with incredibly complex hardware
that will then break and then we'll be
the hardware that breaks not the display
then it will respawn and regrow on your
screen exactly and you can just like you
can make new phones all you want it has
stem cells in it it is a built-in
replicator that's all it does this side
atrix already man i doesn't it but let
me tell you what what i would want to be
this will be my last my last thing on
the galaxy s4 and I know imprenta you
probably have a wrap up on it but what I
would love to see is we talked about
this kind of uninterruptedly a sauna
phone right we talked about it on the
Galaxy Nexus in the nexus 4 but it's not
really uninterruptedly earpiece hole up
there and you've got you know
penetrations for the front-facing camera
whatever and you can kind of see it and
it's it's close to its close to perfect
but it's not what if what if
manufacturers implemented both bone
conduction and offset mics so that
there's not even an earpiece hole what
if the entire front of the phone is a
shear plane of glass I would be amazing
he would that be incredible because I
nokia's hair has been working really
hard on bone conduction they're about to
have released their first one or
whatever they're gonna and they're gonna
call it the echo too yeah another
episode of worst gadgets ever exactly oh
well you know but but I I would love
that I I think that that would be
interesting and that's kind of in line
with what Samsung wants to be doing now
we're right where they want to kind of
get away from the aping the iphone thing
and they've successfully done that with
the galaxy s3 where they were like
here's this riverstone teardrop thing
agree and they're gonna do something as
compelling with date with the four I
think agreed you know for the record and
Brandon knows this I hated the galaxy s
I hated the galaxy s2 but when the
galaxy s3 came out you know I was the
first person when we saw the event and
everything that I was like what the you
know at first I was disappointed but
then you know the more I looked at the
phone I was like man this is awesome
this is the you know this is the most
daring thing that Samsung has ever done
this thing looks nothing like an iPhone
um and it is so cool and I just feel
that Sammy just got you know they've got
their cool with this phone they've got
their confidence and whatever they can
do to evolve the market away from
everything else that's Apple man I mean
it really pisses me off how many
companies try to copy something that
other people criticize so much I
Sammy's doing an awesome thing at being
unique and that's I think that's the way
it should go and they you know bone
conduction be it be an unbreakable
screens whatever ways they can innovate
and still give us a replaceable battery
with external storage and Sammy is gonna
win the gold agreed yeah I don't know is
i think that's well said yeah I think
that's a good way to button it up
speaking of you put me in mind ha me
when you said the iphone the people
copying the iphone and it's doing so
well i was out last night after a staged
reading we did I was out with a bunch of
my friends and I had a product that is
not necessarily doing well well it's
doing relatively well but it's not doing
any where near as well as the iphone i
had my lumia 920 on me and I was sitting
across from friend of mine who asked to
see it because i was taking it some
panoramic photos of the group which
works very well on Windows Phone 8 by
the way and my friend was absolutely
stunned I have never seen and she's not
a technophile I've never seen such an
authentic and impressed reaction from
somebody to a mobile phone user
interface first I mean obviously the
Alumni twenties hardware Cotter I but
then she's just playing with the home
screen on Windows Phone 8 and she's like
this is beautiful and I'm like well what
do you have I'm expecting her to say
that she's got a dumb phone or something
like that she's like no I have the
iphone I'm like really and then
furthermore she's like yeah but my my
upgrade is coming up and I don't I mean
this is amazing then she asked me for
like 25 minutes about the platform and
I'm like wow I've never seen Windows
Phone do that like firsthand in my
experience I've never seen it like I've
never seen somebody take the phone from
my hand and just you know if use about
it which iphone did she have uh the the
4s I think are interesting so she she's
asleep it's interesting that she's
already do for it that could be the four
actually probably better if she's
already do from but yeah sorry that was
stupid yeah yeah yeah that makes sense i
mean that the four at this point in time
fee is slow just over time and she
probably is the small screen blues
compared to you know all the big big
screen phones out there that's
interesting you a reaction she had
that's pretty it wasn't no it was cool
and I wish I'd had the 820 out so that I
could have um you know so that I could
have had a more a more relevant
experience but of course the review was
already up
step we've read oh good i'm sure i'm
trying to think about an analogy that
quebec could describe Windows Phone
adequately because you know recently I
have this friend that I actually you
know I I pulled out the HTC Titan and
you know my friend would just completely
blown away by you know I don't have a
windows phone 8 device yet I admit
they're not sold here yet so sadly I had
a rough trying time trying to get the
Lumia 920 for the record I went to like
three or four best buys a couple of
weeks ago and I was not able to get a
phone and I had to come back to my
country um but but the problem is um
here's the thing windows phone I love it
when these guys just stand on stage and
talk look how beautiful these live tiles
are and look how beautiful the UI is and
how beautiful and how delightful and you
know what I agree with them when they
talk about how beautiful the UI is
because in my opinion it is I'm just
trying to find an analogy for something
that's beautiful but not really useful
yet you know it's got a lot of potential
but its its potential has it's been
three years well no here's the thing no
it is useful like like unless you unless
you use the OS not only you guys like
you can't pick it up for a day and then
and then because you remember how I felt
two three or four episodes ago when you
guys were asking me about like how do
you like the Windows Phone platform and
oh my god I'd it's weird and I don't
know if I still like it like you can't
just use it for a day or two you
actually have to use it for your daily
driver for a couple weeks to to to
acclimate and to find out and to
download enough third party apps that
support the live tiles and see how well
you know they work for you there was an
app release just last night I think
called weather flow or something like
that that that brings live tiles to an
entirely new dimension and it uses
windows phone 8 to like you know you can
blow up the live tile to the full width
of the screen and then you've got all
this information right there without
even entering the app and it's you know
it is useful it's just not used it's not
used to its full potential i may i agree
with you but all the the kind of
beautiful talk that Windows that
Microsoft people do when they're
unveiling a new windows phone 8 feature
when it it reminds me of apples to be on
this way it's like an announcements like
okay years ago it's gorge okay been
magical okay just
yes here's the big difference between an
apple presentation and a Microsoft
presentation yeah you know yes Phil
Schiller would stand on stage and tell
you how beautiful a computer is or how
beautiful a phone is but the cool thing
is their presentations are mostly
focused and just compare this how many
developers have you seen on a Microsoft
presentation show off an application
working on their phones 200 why do you
think that is because you want to keep
their presentation shorter no okay
they're actually longer so here's the
deal you know Apple presentations are
full of showing you what you can do with
the phone and on the by contrast
Microsoft presentations are full of how
beautiful the phone is and it's just
funny I mean you can look at your child
and say how beautiful your child is but
every new born mott none of my newborn's
were pretty when they were born it's
just that's just the way it it's a very
good analogy it's a good analogy but you
know I mean I feel it's interesting you
bring up children because I feel like
children were a huge focus of the the
windows phone 8 announcement because of
the you know the kids corner in addition
to like data sense and rooms and I seem
to remember a lot of functionality being
announced at the windows phone 8
announcement okay so what I would out
that what I was gonna try to point out
it you've seen you've seen all these
videos on YouTube lately and I'm
actually gonna move a little bit into
windows 8 right now but it's just funny
have you seen these videos on YouTube of
chris pirillo and all these guys putting
their fathers but I'm trying to use
Windows 8 no but I bet it's a disaster
you have to look at this because they
cannot figure out how to you know these
are old men not old men but you know
people in their 50s 60s um that that are
you know they're sitting in front of a
computer and you know Chris Pirillo is
like okay show me how to go into the
Start screen and you know intuitively
the person does not figure it out right
and okay and you know the problem with
my friend when I you know when I showed
him you know windows phone 7.5 which by
the way I used for for around five
months before I dropped it um no not
dropped it meaning i just stopped using
it right yeah but yeah but the thing is
you know the person could not find an
intuitive way to move around the UI you
know it
it was like okay so okay this is the
people sub but these are things that I
had to explain to the person um and so
that that was the big that was the
biggest issue you know he was like it
looks very pretty it looks very nice but
ironically i find that they have a very
large learning curve which is ironic
because then I then I show the person
the Galaxy Nexus and the the president's
impression was very different it this
looks a little more like something that
I'm used to this person was using a
blackberry for the past year so I I
think that the problem with windows
phone is that it's just so different
that people either feel daunted by it or
they just don't feel comfortable enough
to give it a try windows English with
windows they could probably bridge that
gap but it's not happening and it's not
happening yet because Windows 8 is even
more complicated than Windows Phone 8
like when I you use my surface it's like
when I love the gestures I love pulling
in from the bezels and you know
context-sensitive bezels whether I'm top
bottom left or right but you don't pick
it up right away and I don't think
that's a that's a dig against the
platform but it the onus is on Microsoft
to really really really drive home the
fact that you do need to spend two
minutes with this device to get to know
it when you first pick it up and the
that's something palm you know failed to
do with with webos because I remember
people like not knowing how the card
interface works on my gavel once you
complicating about so many gestures you
remember exactly and I was like no but
and then once you I watched it I did
this like several times I taught people
how to use it I watched them learn and
after you know three or four minutes
ever like oh I get this now and then
they loved it but if you don't overcome
that if you you know a lot of people
just want to stick in that kind of what
you see is what you get oh I can poke
this and it opens you know whatever I
think if you appeal to the lowest common
denominator you're going to get a lot of
sales sure and it's interesting I
thought you're going to draw a
comparison to anti phone Jaime but you
drew a comparison to Android you said
your friend is was able to pick up
Android much more intuitively which is
curious well that's the thing everybody
that I've known and and this is just the
funniest thing you know I find iOS
boring and I you know I say it
everywhere and it's just true I find it
boring the only thing about the iphone
is that since its its compact its
compartmentalised
do you say that word compartmentalized
okay um you know everything is in a
specific place so you know that you know
intuitively you don't know that you
could see people your friends photos on
the People Hub or on the photos hub on
Windows Phone but then on the iphone you
know that if you go to Facebook
everything that's related to Facebook
will be inside the facebook app sure and
and if you go to contacts everything
that's related to contacts would be in
the contacts app and if you go to phone
everything that's related to phone and
so on and so forth the thing about
Windows Phone is that you know it
strives to add value into these
different hubs which is actually awesome
because it adds functionality the
problem is when you add I think there
they probably just try to add too much
to the operating system when they should
actually just focus on bringing more
apps that come that compartmentalize the
experience and they are doing that but
you know it goes against the grain of
the experience this is a philosophical
difference between I think between
Windows Phone and the rest of the thing
and when Microsoft has said with Windows
Phone and with Windows 8 we're not doing
that we're not doing this thing where we
hop into a nap and we hop out of an
apple we hop into a different app to go
to that app and it like they're they
want to bring it into their paradigm
they want to impose their their design
philosophy on it you know everything
they can and I you know I understand
that that's obviously it's been a tough
road for them and but you know what
they're not changing it that they had of
course we have facebook and twitter apps
on on Windows Phone but they're not
they're primarily they want you
primarily to use the hubs and I've got
to say using the hubs it's a leaner
experience it's it's annoying at times
because it doesn't have all the
functionality of the apps but it's much
more beautiful cohesive yeah exactly
it's that's a much better word it's a
much more cohesive experience to do that
now you know they're going to continue
having these problems but I found
something very interesting my roommate
who is a the last person ever to want
any to want anything to do with
technology get her getting the iphone
was like a I think we threw a party but
she has the iphone and i was explaining
how i was showing her just the other day
had heard like home rearranging live
tiles and stuff on like so this is how
this works because she was you know
because i had her
and for some reason I was subjecting her
to tech talk and she was like oh well
that's pretty cool and I'm like what and
she's just watching we moved the tiles
around on the home screen I'm like what
you that that's cool like a you did and
she's like yeah how do I and she has her
iphone icons arranged and you know a
particular way she's like oh so when I
try and move this down here and the
iphone wouldn't let her move like an
icon you know how it does like you have
to fill up a whole page yeah and she was
and I just kind of watched her reaction
for and there's just this kind of half
second twinge of annoyance on her face
where you know whether this thing
happened where it's like yes okay
Microsoft does impose a lot on you when
you get a windows phone but Apple of
course is the king of that Apple is the
king of saying you're going to do it our
way and you know it's whatever it's
boring fine but if you don't like it get
another phone because you can't you have
to do it the Apple way okay but here's
the deal that here's my problem okay
with window I'm okay with windows phone
saying that frankly hi mate because to
me it's not boring okay carefully I have
to do something a better damn well be
exciting but there's this is the thing
okay Brandon you tell me which is the
best email experience that you get on
the phone ah snap that the most
efficient or the most beautiful both
which goes buddy know which company
they'll was it best HTC does the best
with beautiful and stock Android is the
most efficient you didn't like the
iPhone before that's what you said you
know I like the iPhone until an iOS 6
they made it much more difficult to
multi-select you have to go to edit
check check Marco there's like a million
steps if you want to do arbitrage like
unread on doing red states okay but but
the thing is no company has figured out
HTML email like the app like the iphone
has oh yeah that's it that's a given
yeah so here so here's the deal I don't
mind being imposed if a company figures
it out since version 1 you know that's
that's just my point you know email on
the iphone has been the same since
version 1 and why are they gonna fix
something that's not broken so in the
case of Windows Phone if I wonder what
if i want to read an email and well not
on Windows Phone that much on Android it
really pisses me off that I to be
panning or
found an HTML email and you know gmail
has now brought this with Android 4.2 so
now you don't now you have a much better
experience on gmail but if I wanted that
on the native email app for Android I
can't do that and so you know again I
know that there is a lot of imposition
on applets it's like a friend of mine
was asking me yesterday you know what
alternatives do I have to the iPhone
because you know I have a ton of music
that I didn't buy on the iTunes Store
and I just want to sync it and and I'm
like okay yes the iphone is really not
your thing because you're gonna need to
go through itunes that's just the way it
is you don't need to do that on another
platform so yeah there are a lot of in
positions that are that are definitely
annoying but you know I feel that you
know itunes aside there are a lot of
things that they did get right from day
one they got so right that everybody
else followed so I you know I I do
understand that Microsoft wants to
impose a paradigm but the problem of the
paradigm is that it's not natural
everything is texty and everything is
retro and therefore people don't feel
related to it and that's why they're
having a hard time adopting it I have to
tell you the text the text heavy nature
of Windows Phone has has been something
that's gotten under my skin yeah you go
into the settings menu and instead of
like you know color cues or instead of
iconography you're confronted with this
scrolling 25 element list each one is a
text thing so it really slows everything
down when I'm looking for brightness and
I actually have to search for the word
brightness I have to read every entry
essentially exact and exaggerated a
little bit so ya know i am now saying
the platform is perfect certainly it's
not but it's just it is it is
undervalued because i think microsoft
has not done a very good job of
conveying the message right up front
that this is not something you just pick
up and use this is something you pick up
you learn how to use it for three
minutes and then you get used to using
it for two days like it's like what is
it what is it like I mean is there like
a is there like a parallel like is there
I don't know you know is it like a like
a food that's poisonous until you eat
enough of it like a man because it's
kind of it's kind of what it is I mean
that's a crappy analogy because I'm the
king of those but you know it's that way
um and but it's like it's beautiful go
ahead it's like it's like that guy that
you you know you grew up with and in the
beginning you hated him you are in grade
school then you start to get to know him
and he became your best friend yes yes
that's exactly it and the qualities that
made you hate him were actually the
qualities that you liked about him the
most and made you you have good
good friendship feel like we're out of a
feel-good hallmark movie that's exactly
correct you know I'm gonna here's the
thing you're everybody remembers windows
mobile right um okay I didn't that's not
my impression of Windows well that is
dumb that's right see I didn't like okay
but but here's the thing this uh no I
did like a ton of q yo years ago when
you looked at years ago when I looked at
the first palm device um that you know
back then and a pocket pc and i had to
choose between one or the other you know
choosing the compaq ipaq was simple it
was like dead simple it was three times
more expensive but it had a color
display and the whole UI it was just so
familiar because it's it looked like
windows 95 only inverted come here and I
and I was just so used to the interface
I'm like okay this looks like a computer
so this is cool oh so this is yeah this
is really a pocket pc and you know the
word pocket pc was just so smart the
name was so smart because that's really
what it was um it was if it was really
easy for me to relate to windows mobile
because of that because it looked like
the windows pc that i was using and they
were very easy to sell as a result yes
good exactly so here's the thing um you
know windows 95 was a hit it was it was
it was a huge hit you know they figured
out the perfect UI for a computer you
know even even if they didn't invent it
who cares they made it mainstream and
that's that's just the way it is and
what they did was grab a mobile platform
and you know the only reason why windows
mobile didn't take office because you
know it was based on a mobile kernel and
so many other things and then you know
they just continued you know rehashing
it instead of evolving it and I think
that the problem with Windows Phone 8
and this is just my particular opinion
is that they've based live tiles and the
whole UI out of nothing that's been
successful before and it's great for you
to try to do something new you just
can't tell people that it's beautiful
and expect them to believe you what is
what what is you know okay time is
problem five tiles I've just I'm not
understanding I this is me off to hear
Joe Belfiore all the time be like look
at these beautiful
five thousand I'm sure well you have a
presentation problem I mean you know you
have you've got you've got to use it you
you absolutely have to use no here's the
deal here's the deal okay why did I stop
using and I'm sorry Brandon here this is
my last thing why did I stop using
Windows Phone 7.5 okay first of all out
of the two windows phones that I have
none of them were able to take one good
photograph so there was a software issue
and it was not the the dell problem or
an HTC prom it was a software windows
phone jus okay okay that's the first
thing the second thing is I would just
get really annoyed with multitasking
because sure they were trying to do
multitasking but they'd never got it
right you know that the interface was
just don't know for me it's texty if
there's just a point where I'm like man
this looks like freaking d OS 4.2 no oh
that's that's not fair okay okay so this
is why you dropped 7.5 right but so you
mean you're gonna pick up you're gonna
pick up windows phone 8 and it's gonna
be a lot like 7.5 and like I carried
7.52 and stuff like that I mean it you
know it's it but it sounds like it's
you're not gonna have much more luck
with with eight with the exception of
taking better photos because the
hardware is better especially in the
Lumia phones because it's not anathema
to the way you operate you know mobile
right but you have no idea how important
that is you know that's the only reason
why I'm like okay what phone am I gonna
get I'm gonna go for a Lumia I want to
see if Nokia you know I want no key to
put their money where their mouth is and
you know that's the only reason why I do
want to get a windows phone 8 if the
camera is good and the app experience
improve I am willing to sacrifice the
live tile expiry I do when I'm willing
I'm willing to put up with I want to
revisit this because I do want I cannot
wait until you have a windows phone
because I loved this conversation i love
this discussion about about Windows
Phone as a whole and Brenda we both
steamrolled you there did you have
something that was that was wanted to
jump in with ya what's what's
interesting is that the UI of Windows
Phone is is unfamiliar because it
doesn't match the the paradigm of a
mainstream product meaning if windows 8
had come out two years ago and it was
wildly popular and successful when
people really liked
Metro thing in a hundred million people
like understood this live tile thing in
the Metro design I think windows phone 8
would have a different rate of adoption
agrees it's it's it's it happened in
reverse and it happened that way because
you know Microsoft stumbled upon a
hidden success that this Metro UI is is
is well received but it's it's kind of
unfortunate the timing of all this
because then you have people like I'm a
that are like this live tile thing just
doesn't work for me because I don't I
don't I can't relate to it it doesn't
make sense to me yeah and you know we'll
we'll have to see going forward how the
how the relationship between windows 8
and windows phone 8 either drives each
platform forward or drives them each
into you know the doldrums but you know
I think I think there's a lot to be
explored there I think Windows 8 is an
entirely different question because it
just bring in so many more gestures and
it'll be interesting to see what
Microsoft ports from windows 8 into
Windows Phone 8 because that that
non-existent home screen to the left of
the current home screen is just begging
to be used and it's going to be really
interesting to see what they do with
that a great agree yeah commenters must
really love me right now I was just
gonna say like when this this podcast
goes live how many you're gonna we're
gonna be all be over time in the comment
i love you guys too i love you guys yeah
go ahead read it let me just uh never
mind I was just gonna save you the the
the the yeah what's it called I wanted
to soften the blow by just calling you a
jerk I'm am getting it out you are a
jerk you are a fan of wave I teach you
go back to cupertino go back there well
anyways let me let's kind of move on
here is where i just want to mention
that the but we now have both almost the
entire Lumia 800 series or the 2012
edition Lumia 800 series reviewed the
810 for t-mobile USA the 822 for Verizon
Wireless and the 824 AT&amp;amp;T all of those
reviews are posted on the site listeners
if you haven't seen them yet you should
and I did all of them which is crazy and
really thankful I got to see the whole
spectrum personally of them of this
mid-range line and just very briefly
we've talked about the mid-range
smartphone before as a concept and how
it's changing this here and how wrote a
piece about how like mid-range phones
are more impressive even in some metrics
than high-end phones and the the Lumia
820 and its derivatives really
reinforces that because it's been really
really cool to to see these devices that
are like okay well these are setting my
expectations sort of low at the outset
because their mid range but oh wow
they're surprising me with with how how
competently they execute all of the
tasks i asked them to that said it is
really really interesting when you are
when you surprise yourself when like
i've never been a resolution guy i've
always been the guy on the podcast in
editorials who's the counterpoint to
Brandon right like Brendan's like I need
really high-resolution awesome stuff and
I love I love high pixel density and I'm
over here like I want color saturation
and deep blacks and I don't care about
resolution but using three or using
three Lumia 820 series devices over the
course of a month has taught me exactly
what it's like to be using last year's
display for an extended period and it's
not interesting not very fun yeah I mean
you know you can I'm starting to be able
to see taps key to say I'm starting to
be able to see the fuzzy edges on texts
and stuff and yeah and as as we move
forward as this 1080p explosion
continues that's only going to get more
pronounced so that's the sad thing to me
about the DA 20s and a lot of the
mid-range devices that are launched
today sure they're fine today but even
regular users are going to be able to
you know in a year and a half when they
sold the same phone and they're still
locked into that contract and they are
not eligible for an upgrade for another
six months that screen is gonna look
positively antique but what if you don't
have anything to compare it against what
if you're using a wvga screen for two
years you're not looking at your friends
phones you're not looking at other
phones in the store is it okay do you
get used to it it's okay or is it still
crappy yes yes of course but nobody
lives in that kind of a bubble like when
you go out to the bar like what do you
do when there's a lull in the
conversation or sometimes it causes laws
on the conversation because people are
looking at each other films like
what is that is that a new phone and
then everyone gets into that same
conversation even and this isn't because
I'm people know I'm a tech writer like
half the people i hang out with Jonah
but they'll just do it themselves they
launch into the sink oh yeah it used to
be plans it used to be carriers he used
to be like oh I got this planet for 400
minutes and whatever and now its devices
like huh you got the iphone the new
galaxy oh what's up and then it's a like
25 minute conversation you got the new
galaxy that's just the funniest phrase
of the year isn't it yeah we talked
about that in length but you know anyway
it's so that's that's disappointing um
the only other thing i want to touch on
in the in that kind of same vein is i
tried to take a self-portrait with the
Lumia 820 s front facing camera and this
I think spawned that editorial I just
wrote about full res front-facing
cameras and also I included an
impression of this in the review the do
you guys remember vga resolution cameras
oh yeah made me look a lot more pretty
yeah great well Matt I had kind of
forgotten about vga resolution cameras
but the Lumia 820 incorporates one as a
front facing camera it's weird because
the carrier very the 822 for verizon the
a-10 for t-mobile each has like a 1.3
megapixel front-facing shooter like you
know is standard but the 820 has a 0.3
megapixel shooter i think it's like 640
x 480 or whatever the hell that is so i
take this picture and i look at it I'm
like wow there must be something wrong
the three of us have been turned into
kind of amorphous blobs well I thought
you had an ipad 3 anyways it takes the
same photos from facing anyways does it
well yeah it's it's a VGA camera I am
forgetting that front facing cameras
there and imagine that blowing up on the
retina display that looks on you T&amp;amp;S
yeah well it's just that we never use
the front-facing camera on an iPad uh
well here's the deal whichever company
figures out how to put a full resolution
camera front-facing that would be the
perfect facebook phone you know the
perfect bone for your bathroom pics yes
room for your best face mirror pics yes
exactly pucker your lips and you know
yeah tucking your your your your son
stomach and
and just do little pout puff up your
chest and get a high angle going there
how I found stuff under here and don't
forget to move the toilet away from the
photo that's right there's nothing worse
than a toilet in a photo um laughs let's
let's wrap up the windows section here I
we kind of already talked about the
windows phone 7 7 8 into Windows Phone 8
but I just want to say I think this is
one of my favorite headlines of of the
month from Adam Lane who's what if
windows phone 7 8 was named Windows
Phone 8 instead I think I think there
would have been a smart move you know
it's fascinating and I think commenters
I think it would've been a smart move to
and a commenter provided the
counterpoint ray said you know I think
if it weren't for the colonel change
that's exactly what they would have done
but I mean what do you call iOS 6 on an
iphone 4 iOS 6 exactly listen Willy you
know even though you don't get um what
what don't you get on the iphone you
don't get maps you don't get there I
think they should have just called
Windows Phone 8 and if your phone
doesn't have NFC it's not what it's not
microsoft's fault it's you know do we
ever do I think Microsoft is is kind of
bearing a lot of a lot of heat for this
where that they don't necessarily
deserve because they were more honest
than then other companies generally are
with their release I was one of the
first pieces i wrote for pocket i was
talking about the phone ification of the
tablet and i was like getting so annoyed
with my Apple products because I'm like
yeah well I have iOS 5 on this older
device but it runs like hell so why do I
you know why is it called iOS 5 it's not
the same experience and I think my
yourself probably had the same attitude
and as a result of their honesty their
just being you know dragged through the
mud up there they're being direct to the
mud not because of the name it's because
of the deployment Oh where's the
software nobody has seen it yet nobody
is tested yet nobody has a phone that
has the upgrade yet so if they would
have launched windows phone 7.8 at the
same time that they launch Windows Phone
8 then things would be nice but you know
I there are a lot of unhappy customers
that are wishing they had you know the
new tiles that they see everywhere but
they have a bite they have to buy a new
phone and they just can't afford it so
it just pisses people off they won't buy
a phone in the future that's just the
way it is right okay it will
I don't you know I would I would like a
windows phone 7 device still kicking
around so i could try windows phone 7.8
but i'm sure we're gonna have
comparisons and you guys have them and
you know yeah yeah we just to close out
when this phone surface is coming to new
retailers this is something that I don't
think is a surprise to anyone but it was
announced tell me something Michael what
do you think I mean I read your thing
and everything but what do you think you
know right now what do you think about
that surface I will tell you that and
this is why I kind of wanted to bring
this up before before brandon has to go
I will tell you that I still stand
behind everything I wrote and I still
really like the idea of the surface but
I have had a very busy week and this
isn't a cop-out this is actually a point
I've had such a busy week that I have
had to rely only on the most efficient
and practical devices with which to get
things done as a result the surface has
served primarily as a scenic component
in my video reviews to prop phones up at
the right angle the surface the surface
is a device Eileen phones against so
there's no glare on the phone screen
that's that's what i've been using the
surface for so I'm that's just the
reality of the surface I mean out of you
know last time I was traveling I I flew
through three airports run away and i
saw one surface yeah and uh thousand
ipads of course but you know I mean and
that's gonna be the case right now of
course I mean the surface is such a new
product that even if it was a even if it
was a runaway success you'd still be
seeing that because it's not you know
embedded yet and by the way since I met
since hymas already thrown himself under
the comment or bus I'm not gonna I'm not
doing that I'm I have to say this is as
I need to come back to the surface and
have a look at it but I will tell you
that that that this experience taught me
more about where the surface is in its
development then spending like 48 or 72
on interrupted as I did because when I
have to rely on something that I need to
get something done right now then I'm
going to use the macbook air or I'm
going to use my nexus 7 or I'm going to
use my iPad you know what I mean I don't
turn to the surface I turn to the
surface when I want when I have
I'm done for the day and on some novelty
exactly exactly I want some futuristic
novelty and that's what the surface is
to me right now um I was going to
propose the question what does the
surface RT do one thing what does it do
better than any other product and I'm
not saying like you know it prop itself
up on a table I'm saying in terms of
getting a task done or just consuming
some piece of content and you don't
think that there's a there's an answer
for that there isn't yet I don't off the
top of my head I also don't think there
is one um hey you know it there's a I
don't have a name for it yet but there's
a name for that phase of a device where
it's it's it's like the honeymoon phase
where it's still really new and you're
carrying it around and you're using it
not because you want to get things done
but you're using it to use it because
it's new and it's in it's fresh so for
example I don't need to I don't need to
make a to-do list right now but I'm
gonna go ahead and I get to do list
right now because I want to use the
device because it's fresh and I want to
kind of explore it that's that's where
the surface still lives in my brain you
know it when I take out the surface I'm
doing it very specifically to use the
surface not to get something done so
that's yeah but the problem is there's
there's nothing beyond that it's you
know Rogers gonna keep it in that stage
and you're not gonna get get to the next
step which is integrating into your life
because there's it has no place on well
unfortunately i don't i don't know about
you Michael but in my particular case
when I get a new phone um my honeymoon
phase would last you know sometimes I
don't even sleep just playing with the
thing yeah by the way my honeymoon face
with my galaxy s3 has not ended over
more than a month now that's crumb I
just love that thing and that's just me
and it's just funny because I would tell
Brandon that I would not want that phone
and I just learned that I was wrong and
I wouldn't I would love to be proven
wrong by the Microsoft service whenever
I get one for the first time you know
but so far if you have not been
interested enough to actually use it
during the first day at least then I
think that's just gonna be the story
from here on no and I was I mean no I
remember it for the first she's like
three days I had it I did I used it like
non-stop
and I loved it in the yada yada but it's
just when it when things became really
fast-paced and I had to get things done
that's when it fell by the wayside but I
have to say this because if you guys had
asked me three weeks ago four weeks ago
if we'd had the same conversation about
Windows Phone I probably would have been
saying the same thing because it took me
so long to acclimate to it now if I shut
down my macbook if I put aside a you
know three quarters of the rest of my
devices and I kind of force myself to
use the service all the time my
efficiency would improve I would
probably find an answer to your question
Brandon I'm sure there's something it
does better than than anything else I
just don't know what it is yet and my I
go ahead I was gonna say I tried that um
you should I you know I i had i got the
surface RT during Hurricane sandy and I
i worked from home for a couple of days
because it was pretty crappy outside and
I was like all right I'm gonna write the
surface RT review on the surface RT and
and and of course I pre uploaded the
picture is just to make it a little bit
easier but I just was going to using a
wordpress on the surface RT and I
started off the review i am writing this
review on the surface RT and i had this
whole paragraph after the end of the
paragraph i deleted the paragraph i
saved it I saved the the review as a
draft and I I went to my macbook air and
i just realized i could I couldn't I
couldn't use it as a WoW too many things
about it and and and you know it was
weird because when I was writing the
surface RT review on the surface RT I
tried using both browsers because I
thought maybe I'll use the touch
friendly browser in the Metro
environment because no maybe that's more
natural more precise but was very
imprecisely and there are some other
problems with it and then I went into
the the desktop environment and I used
the other browser the second browser of
surface RT and I was so frustrated by
using the touchpad and wanting to like
move my hands up to scroll and then move
my hands back down to type and to use
the touchpad is just just use dirty is
gross you know and I think you're making
a solid point see in you know what's the
success of the ipad and we talked about
this like three or four two episodes to
go the what's successful about it is
that it's
not trying to be a computer it's not
trying to be a computer it's trying to
be its own thing where it's made for
consuming content and here's Microsoft
trying to do a very smart idea because
it is a very smart approach for you to
try to make the tablet become a
productive device a very portable unit
that you can actually make productive
with a couple of accessories it's it's
it's an awesome idea they did it years
ago with the ipaq where you have the
sleeves where you can actually add
functionality to the pocket pc by adding
more sleeves it's a smart idea but the
problem is that you know it it was it's
a cumbersome experience and that's where
it really fails I mean not even Skype on
the surface we we tried skype with
Brandon for his review and even Skype on
the surface was terrible and so here's
the point I just have to instead exactly
that's the that's the irony not even
their own things are done right so
here's the thing i think that the
Microsoft Surface RT would have been
successful if they would have focused on
bringing a tablet only operating system
and not trying to sell a productive
computer because what whoever person is
coming from a netbook and wants to move
into a surface RT will most probably
return the device after a week of
knowing that it's not really a computer
so here I mean yeah let me this is not
i'm not asking this because of the
reason it sounds like i'm asking this
what a great sentence i just made pets
hey isn't it beautiful I'm gonna write
that down excusing I'm gonna ask you a
question now you have not actually used
a surface right no okay every single
observation you are making in this
podcast is I cannot disagree with it is
absolutely correct and that is my
principal objection if I were somebody
just listening to this that you've never
held one or even ever used one but you
are you are absolutely correct because
it's it doesn't in Brandon by
implication you're correct as well but
it's just fascinating that someone who's
never handled it can can draw the same
conclusions that I completely agree with
having handled it so I I don't disagree
I think guys we have we actually have
fifteen minutes before brandon has to
has to bail and I i do want to touch on
a couple other things so can I ask you
to just kind of can we wrap it up on the
on the windows front is there anything
he's asking us to shut up so please
please let's not just gone better to
shut up no no no I um I want to jump in
and I kind of want to stagger this just
a little bit and we're gonna fragment
the run down a bit and then jaime you
and i will do some listener may laughter
Brandon goes how does that sound awesome
good the we had a couple after the buzz
episodes and the reason that I'm really
happy that high man Brandon around the
show together is that they can each kind
of give some brief thoughts on to
encapsulate there after the buzz
experiences Brandon did it after the
buzz episode for the ipad 4 or the late
2012 ipad if you prefer and hi mate did
one of course for the iphone 5 we've
been really loading up on after the buzz
episodes recently we hope your listeners
have enjoyed them if you haven't seen
the new ones please go to pocket now and
and find them there is an after the buzz
tag there who under our new do we have
Brandon who we've launched the new
series page yet yes there's the new
series page in the top it says features
features yes go there it's awesome
anyway um who uh who would like to go
first because we've been talking about
these iOS devices we've been I think we
just finished talking about tablets I
think it would be logical maybe if
Brandon you you encapsulated your
thoughts on the late 2012 iPad after the
buzz well actually I was gonna ask jaime
to start and I an America and I'm but I
wanted to start him off with a thought
Jaime with you would you agree that the
iPhone 5 is like a beautiful woman that
you are dating that is pretty smart and
capable but you find out after dating
her for a while that she's boring as
hell didn't know that the beautiful part
that's like the funniest that allergy
ever but it's like the most accurate one
yes I emphasis on the beautiful part
like you know she you know she's got
soft skin like everything everything
about her you know visually
aesthetically in terms of tactile it's
just it's great but then you start you
know date you know and then you know the
dinner table conversation is just like
she's trying to do she's trying to do
that how to lose the guy at 10 dates in
10 days thing listen yeah
you know it's funny um I remember that
after i got the iphone 4s earlier this
year pretty much her last year i
remember that i dropped it at the at a
bar and i was with a couple of cousins
and a friend and it just scratched all
over the screen and you know great that
i was able to go swap the phone for free
um but I remember that my aunt was there
and she was like why does your phone
this why does your phone not have a case
and I'm like well would you ever buy a
BMW and actually cover all the leather
seats with it with a cloth like drive
down the road with her with a car cover
on it well the car cover art or just or
just cover all the leather seats with a
 currencies I think that's yeah I'm
like you wouldn't do that right so I'm
like what the problem is that you know
obviously if you don't take care of the
leather than what do you expect you're
gonna end up cracking it and you know
the thing about the iphone is i feel it
that way you know yesterday I was taking
car I was drinking coffee with a good
friend and it took him forever to be
able to get an iphone 5 and once he got
the phone he ended up scratching and he
has the white iphone 5 and he ended up
scratching it with his wedding band and
I'm like well you know it's just you
know I showed him my phone and my phone
is completely pristine no scratches
whatsoever um and he's like how are you
able to do that and I'm like well I I
handle my phone with my right hand so my
wedding bands not there um I always put
it on top of a cloth I'm always carrying
it with a pouch I always carry every
phone with a pouch and I just don't drop
them so you know if you ask if you ask
Tony Tony never drops his phones it's
the same deal so it's like okay if you
know that you're gonna be the type of
customer that's gonna be dropping your
phone not even the galaxy s3 would put
up with certain users that's just the
way it is you know the problem is not
the phone it's the user and so I feel
that you know for me my experience with
the iPhone 5 is if you know you're not
gonna drop your phone don't buy a case
and if you know that you're gonna be a
you know I have to user then get an
outer box or something like that but you
know my experience with the iPhone 5 is
so far after the buzz it's one of the
fastest phones I've ever used one um
it's a beautiful device there's just no
way around that it is a beautiful device
it looks like jewelry and the third
thing is you know and I i I've made this
point in a lot of my editorials you know
power users have
have really evolved um in the past the
power user was a person that could hack
their phones root their phones change
the operating systems and everything but
you know power users now are people that
actually rely on their phones to get
work done you know and they need
specific apps they need specific
services and so you know the iphone is
king for the most type of power users
but it's not really a king for those
people that are out to route bones and
stuff like that so you know my
experiences I feel that it's still a
great phone I just wish that Johnny I
would trash the hell out of iOS you know
at least aesthetically you know I'm not
really after widgets I just wish that at
least the icons would anime you know
something something that would be
different to what we know for the past
five years that's just my point with
after the bus yeah that the Johnny I've
thing I know that was news a while ago
and I don't know if that was a rumor at
the time or actually confirmed but it
became more real for me when I was
reading the Tim Cook interview in
Business Week magazine where he you know
said it again you know Johnny I've is
going to be doing a lot with iOS and I
my heart became a flutter with what the
possibilities that that might be there
and try i was kind of imagining what
Johnny would say when he you know sat
down at a table and was you know
planning with some of the marketing guys
on how they're gonna change iOS I me how
do you what do you think Johnny would
say okay you're gonna laugh at this but
I'm actually worried um you know you
have a macbook air don't you both of you
have a Mac yeah none of you have ever
used the macbook pro the the the first
generation macbook pro the the previous
one I actually have the retina display
one right now but you know the problem
with the previous one is that the USB
ports were so close together that you
cannot use to USB things at the same
time in all you had was two ports so my
problem with Johnny I've is that he is
really great at doing things that are
beautiful but not necessarily useful
that's interesting you're worried about
Johnny I've bringing a bringing a
windows phone like that exactly exactly
I am I have you know I am you know my
you know cause Scott Forstall was too
much into school morphs I do I actually
do like school Murph's more than digiti
digitally authentic things you know I
just think that Johnny could definitely
bring a new where and probably what we
need is a new era but I just wish that
new air
brought more usability and not
necessarily more beauty let's yeah yeah
okey morphs make me an offer me too at
this point now yeah well you'd be
marshes of every user interface ever
since you know windows 95 everything's
been like that no no no no no no no I
mean come on windows 95 like hold on
second that's that's a whole different
we can't get into that we have we have
six minutes left to talk about the to
talk about the iphone 4 before before
Brannigan I want to hear about it
because i have not handled the iphone 4
right and I Amy do you have one there's
a ipad 4 not the iphone 4 oh the iPad
for no no I think yeah I think this is
the perfect segue for Brandon I mean
yeah just just to end it I think that
Jony ive there are other things that
he's done great like the unibody design
in the end the the thinness and design
and the minimalism of every Apple
product is really great you know I just
feel that there are certain things that
require usability and not necessarily
minimalism and I just hope that he
figures that one out right right so I
mean how does this in a world where none
of this has happened yet in a world
where we are still dealing with the same
version of iOS we're familiar with on
essentially the same hardware we're
familiar with just with some some
different chips inside and I think an
identical chassis what's how is uh
Brandon tell me how you feel about the
the ipad and how it's going to hold up
uh you know I kind of look at the after
the bus series as a way to inform people
on on on buying decisions I mean after
after we've gotten a chance to fold it
fully integrate it into our lives
whether they should go out and buy it or
not yeah and you know you know how I'm
stock analysts though the place a buy
sell or hold rating on a stock based on
you know you know what they think the
the best interest of the investor is
right yeah i would say i would put a
don't to buy on the ipad for for the
following reason if you haven't there's
really two groups that you can fall into
either you have an ipad 3 or you don't
have an ipad 3 if you have an ipad 3 the
ipad 4 is marginally better it's faster
but not by much
launching an app is faster but not by
much browsing the web is faster by not
by much playing the most intense game is
faster but not by much the only real
amazing thing and it's not that amazing
about the ipad 4 is that it charges
significantly faster which is which is
great because when you when you have a
device like the ipad you use it a lot
and you wanted to charge as fast as
possible so it's interesting that the 12
volt charger which is twenty percent
higher voltage than the 10 volt that the
ipad 3 came with charges the ipod for in
eighty percent the dime is that right
wow that's a lot of numbers there i'm
just gonna say you're right so what
we're dealing with is a seven-hour
charge time on the ipad 3 and a 5 hour
charge time on the ipad 4 so if you fall
into that second group of people that
don't have an ipad and are thinking
about getting an ipad yeah that four is
a great device but you should know that
we are on the verge of a redesign of the
ipad 4 and i don't i don't know this for
it to be a fact but you know in in my
best estimation because the ipad has
been unchanged for now three years and
because the ipad is to a fault too heavy
and too thick i I have confidence that
I'm pretty darn certain than 2013 we're
gonna get an ipad 5 that is finally thin
and light and just look at the ipad mini
what they did with that absolutely yeah
yeah and and you know the ipad minis a
different story because it needs a
battery that's what a third the size or
half the size oh it's much it's much
smaller it's actually a one-fourth of
the size and I wonder about the screen
component because it is now maybe tell
me if I'm wrong on this guy's but a
screen that is so much less dense like
pixel wise do you think that there's an
actual like tangible physical difference
in in weight between those two displays
oh there is you I mean you know of
course putting aside the fact that the
larger iPad screen is larger so of
course it's going to be a little bit
heavier but I just mean density wise
I've never thought about this before
what was it pixel way I think no I think
it's insignificant I think there's a few
things with the screen one is that the
ipad 5 in-cell touch
for better or for worse which has lower
touch responsiveness so that's gonna
make that's gonna save about one to two
millimeters right off the bat and that's
significant yeah and then apples seems
to have figured out a new way to create
a battery that's so ridiculously flat um
with the ipad mini they that yes yeah
yeah it's real flat so maybe if you take
that okay so you take that flat battery
from the ipad mini you make it the size
of the larger 9.7 inch screen so you
increase the size probably by double and
then you stack two on top of one another
and then you know you obviously fuse
them together somehow and i think the
ipod fives gonna have that battery so
maybe that's good for another two or
three millimeters we're not gonna get a
device as thin as the ipad mini for the
ipad 5 but i think you know three or
four millimeters is a good bet and in
terms of weight um I don't think they're
gonna do much with the weight because of
you know the battery's gonna have all
that all the heft but it'll be
significant so so after the buzz the
ipad 4 is still a great tablet it's my
favorite tablet by far because of the
high quality app selection but i don't
think it's a good time to buy an ipad 4
agree I couldn't agree with you more
yeah I couldn't agree with you more I I
that's the reason why what with the ipad
mini you know I and it's just it's
really tough for me by the way guys well
yeah we are gonna have it after the buzz
of the ipad mini very soon but I have a
Retina Display MacBook Pro and I have a
Retina Display iphone and I have a 720p
galaxy s3 and for me to go to the ipad
mini it's tough but the thing is just so
freaking light that it just I'm willing
to put up with it yeah that is almost
toilet it's it's it's on it's it's it's
a realistic Star Trek sci-fi like um
those things were heavy on Star Trek but
go ahead it's speaking of the ipad mini
i have sent my ipad mini away to a
company called a no style which does
this ammo how do you pronounce an
anodized anodized finish on the I they
do this on the iphone 5 and on the ipad
mini I should be getting a back soon so
look out for a video I have gotten my
ipad mini died a bronze color which is a
nice kind of like reddish copper ish so
is really pretty I think is gonna be
pretty badass and what
do at a no Stiles they they're able to
maintain the deed what's that edge the
shiny edge the chamfered things sham
verdict they're able to maintain that
but it's it's now a little bit more
scratch proof because of their their
process this is it this is not what I
actually think but I just had the
craziest image of some like you know
backwater chop shop with dudes like just
putting masking tape on ipad mini's and
spraying in with krylon i know i know
it's not like that I've just just just
left in my brain so go ahead that would
bring a tear to my eye um tell me how I
should be receiving that back soon they
turn it a bet they turn it around in
about a week but um actually need to
jump off Stephen Schenk is here and I
want to hang out with him for a bit so
uh it was nice talking gents it's always
nice talking with brand before you go
real quick galaxy camera from Samsung
for verizon has been announced are you
excited or now you've handled it you you
talked a lot about it we've handled it
together what are your thoughts very
quickly the best camera is the one in
your pocket and the one in my pockets
attached to my phone and I don't want to
have another pocket with something
that's four times as thick even if it
takes slightly better pictures in the
galaxy camera apparently doesn't take
you know incredible photos but so I i
I'm not that interested I've curious
about it but not that interested galaxy
note 2 giveaway trivia question what is
the name of the manufacturer that makes
the Galaxy Note tues digitizer the
element of the screen that makes the
s-pen function boom I don't see how you
can ask for a better rapper than that
thank you very much sir alright guys
talk to you later take care of dr.
Lederman I ok so is this the segment
where we get to make fun of the galaxy
camera well you know we didn't we didn't
burn that segue for nothing let's uh
it's help your thoughts sir you know I
love Samsung yeah I love Samsung you
haven't handled one yet right I know oh
no you know I for the record I love
samsung um I had I didn't have high
regards for them a year ago um but I
love the fact that these guys are bold
enough to try everything he took the
galaxy note to the galaxy camera they're
willing to try everything and that's a
bold company
I mom and look ahead look how it served
them on the galaxy note i mean the
galaxy note 2 is just blowing it up
right now agreed you know i think that
if you know whenever Sampson figures out
how to do the kindle deal with the
galaxy camera it'll be successful
because nobody in their right mind you
know amazon figured out something i
don't know how they came up with their
whispersync thing where you know the 3g
I a kindle Tsar able to connect to 3g
and down the book download ebooks for
free you don't pay for anything right is
so you know the problem of the galaxy
camera is not really the galaxy camera
is the fact that you have to pay for a
data plan exactly i know and which
person in the right mind would pay for a
data plan over a camera that they are
rarely gonna take out of the house
exactly right we because the camera does
have integrated Wi-Fi as well so why are
you gonna do that it it sort of reminds
me of all that when when the tablet
explosion first happened the android
tablet explosion and all these android
tablets started shipping with embedded
3g radios for the carriers and I'm like
who's gonna who's gonna do this who's
gonna open up a separate data plan for a
free you know for a tablet for an
Android tablet that who at the time was
running honeycomb that isn't really
gonna have much staying power ya Yin
tablets in tablets it does make a little
more so now it does but it back then it
did not I mean you know this shakes next
year maybe we'll be saying like job man
it's a good thing I took out that HSPA
plan for my goats a camera yeah I don't
know but here's the thing like I've
handled the the camera we in at you know
a diva and at a New York City kind of
event and you know it has some really
cool ideas behind it I have not read any
of the the early reviews of the early
hands-on so whatever we are going to be
getting one by the way yeah and it's
going to be really interesting to to see
just how how it fares in real world
situations but uh Tony's big thing Anton
said ed in Berlin he was like why didn't
they just take a phone on this I would
buy this if it had a phone on this that
is the same thing that I thought I would
hit up with a thick phone me if it had
that quality of the camera exactly would
and when we led in with our hands on
video at Eva we led in with it with his
PureView 808 actually he was yet a
really cool idea for a 10 second lead
and I was like yeah
was something like it I was like last
year nokia built a camera with a phone
attached today is samsung released a
camera with no phone attached house like
most hilarious thing that but you know i
think i think that the camera has
potential i think that the idea is great
and i think that if that camera would
cost the same thing as a point-and-shoot
to be a start-up you know there's just
no point in paying 450 bucks for a
camera you know you can buy a know how
do you call the no lens you know those
new cameras that are i actually have one
sony nex-5 ends yeah I don't know those
are mirrorless camera mirrorless yes
okay so i just paid 500 bucks for a
mirrorless sony NEX that i could buy an
eye-fi card to be able to transfer my
photos to my phone so why would i want
to pay the same amount of money for a
point-and-shoot camera that is not a
phone and that i would have to buy an
extra day to parent for I just I feel
that that's really the problem with the
camera the camera itself is not a
problem it's the concept it's the
business model that's the problem yeah
and I think you know I think Samsung is
treating it as an interesting little
side side project that like you said at
the very beginning of this segment you
know it's it's something that they're
being bold enough to try and I think in
America when they did the first Galaxy
Note it was only on one carrier was on
AT&amp;amp;T and they just put it out there and
let's just see and then it turned out to
sell like gangbusters and this time the
galaxy camera is on on two carriers in
the United States and it's it's a first
it's a unique product I mean in the very
definition of the the sense it's like
i've never seen anything like it let's
put it out there and we're going to
price it weirdly and if it sells then
maybe we'll we'll keep going in this
direction but i agree it's not priced to
sell okay my thoughts are you know with
the microsoft surface that whenever with
everything else I'm like okay we'll see
with the galaxy camera we're not gonna
see that's my thought you think it's
just not gonna go anywhere it's gonna
flop it's gonna flop but again not
because of the product because of the
business model yeah i agree i mean it it
reminds me of and you know this is a
whole bag of worms and i don't want to
get into or whatever the hell that
expression is it's like the Kin which
which was named ace right
product was not as bad as the as the
business model there is the the data
plan that it was true that Verizon was
putting on you know a friend of mine was
you know he's like men my daughter my
fifteen-year-old daughter once at iphone
5 and he's like do you think it's worth
it for me to buy one and I'm like what
phone do you use and he's like oh I've
got a blackberry bold 9700 I'm like not
even you have an iPhone and you're gonna
give your daughter an iphone 5 hahaha
you know that's like are you crazy it's
ballsy oh I am I wanted we're gonna
we're gonna have like a whole bunch more
on that on the camera and I'm excited
exactly was that that's the thing with
the kin and with the galaxy camera you
know with what the Ken it was that
problem you know if you're not gonna if
you're hardly gonna pay for a full data
plan for you you're not gonna do it for
your kids right so you know the business
model would that Ken killed it the
business model with the galaxy camera
killed it again I would bite of it were
cheaper um or you know to replace a
point-and-shoot 250 bucks i would pay
for it definitely um you know it would
probably be like the point and shoot on
steroids or something but i would
definitely not ask for an extra day to
playing just for camera that's just it i
just don't want to carry around a
separate device I think that's what I
don't want to do and that sounds strange
because I like Captain two phones right
I kind of em always carrying a separate
device but I die if the galaxy camera
were a little thinner I've had phone
built-in I would have bought it i would
have pre-ordered it okay in my case i
would definitely be willing to use it as
a separate device if it were cheaper
interesting i would do I would we're
gonna have this is as far as we can go
speculation wise in time wise because we
don't have it yet we're gonna have it
very soon I can't wait to talk about it
when I when we finally have it um let's
let's let's do this again and we
actually let's let's kind of close out
Android here do you have you had any
exposure to the DHT CVX I mean um you
were able to handle it I haven't really
I haven't really it's um I love the
minimalistic design of the phone at
least on pictures I'm I'm just not sure
what was your experience with it it was
very cool the HTC VX listeners if you're
not familiar with it is a mid-range
device that has been that is finally
making its 80 debut after having been
delayed several times I think I think we
handled at first
um New York City brent when Brennan and
I went for that AT&amp;amp;T unwrapped event
yeah excuse me I'm clicking on the link
right now here just it yeah that's right
so yeah you should really look it up if
you haven't looked it up listeners like
it's cool it's kind of like a 1x that
that got the that maybe it didn't get
like beaten with the ugly stick but it
got a little rap on the head you know
it's I think it's actually quite
beautiful in in person the renders don't
look at the press shots actually don't
make it look very good but it's got that
you know the poly the polycarbonate back
and you know it it feels really really
excellent and it's one of this cadre of
devices that I talked about earlier in
the show and that we've talked about
several times of this kind of mid-range
resurgence you know I think that you
know with the one VX and this is just
the thing i have a 1x um and probably
I've said this so many times my biggest
disappointment the 1x is it's just the
cumbersome lee big heavy device you know
it just makes my fingers go crazy and i
have big hands you know i feel that
samsung did a great thing with the
galaxy s3 and figure it out figuring out
a way to make a big phone light they did
a great job and you know but I remember
that my impression when I held the 1x
for the first time was that I actually
like the one that's more because it was
it was just light enough and big enough
to be perfect for me in my particular
usage need so I feel that the one VX is
right there it's right in the middle
it's not too big not too small and I
love the design i feel that HTC has
great designers they really understand
hardware very well and they're really
bold with their designs even though they
look a lot a lot alike i feel that
they're very ergonomic and in their own
way so I I do like that phone it would i
buy it i would i would yeah and i would
definitely consider it because in person
especially the VX catches the light it
has this kind of enhanced silver bezel
that that really catches the light
nicely and it looks a lot more high-end
than then i guess it is it looks very
elegant so green and it is yeah but you
know i'm glad to see it's finally out
i'm sorry it's late and it's not gonna
make much of a it's not gonna do much
for HTC yeah what's a beautiful design
with a bad parent company and this is
not me throwing a rock that's right it's
not they're a great company but they are
really strong
right now they are bearing now and
they're not you know what they're
they're starting to because that the
droid DNA which we talked about
endlessly on a previous episode in which
we've talked about for weeks in which
we've covered extensively on the site is
such a beautiful thing and when we heard
about the butterfly launch which we kind
of interpret it as a global launch we
were all talking about it like on Iran
email we were talking about it i am we
were all just a buzz with them
speculation and it turned out to be that
the HTC butterfly which is the droid DNA
and the butterfly j it's all the same
thing with different radios is it was
only announced for china that day i
remember i know and i know you're like
rocking out daily that day yeah and i
was like oh my god the global DNA it's
like oh here it is oh shoot amazon when
are you gonna get this thing i want this
phone now I was crazy yeah then I start
I started looking at the specs and I'm
like wait a second what are these 3g
bands i'm like 850 well i got 850 in one
of my carriers here but i actually want
to use this on another carrier that i
use um and I'm like what the wait wait a
second and in recent years 1904 you
knighted States yeah exactly and I'm
like okay highly Russian subs got to be
something wrong one of the emails he's
like wait look at the bands guys and
we're all looking at the bands like wait
this is crazy this isn't a global
variant we're just going on and but
meanwhile you're writing a script for
the pocket out daily I'm halfway through
an editorial on the global butterfly son
of it gotta go back and rewrite all this
so anyway it turned out to be the
Chinese one and I I reached out to HTC
and they're very quick tour to reply the
one thing I wanted to confirm with them
was that the device had a micro SD card
slot mm-hmm and I cuz because that was
the that is the primary thing that I've
complained that everyone who's
complained about with the droid DNA is
that it only has 16 gigs of storage and
there's no expandability and that's just
absurd okay what if a flagship device
and HTC to their credit responded very
quickly as quickly as as they could our
contact was in Beijing for the launch so
he responded as quickly as he could he
said that is confirmed the microSD slot
is present on the butterfly it was not
present on the droid DNA because the
they needed the room for the LTE radio
no no I don't know if you know
I'm far be it for me to question that I
just you know let me try to understand
this there are admit okay you have a
mid-range nokia lumia 820 with you with
a micro SD card slot a removable vac a
removable battery and an LTE radio and
how is it that HTC can't figure out how
to add a a slot and i'm not gonna use
the word yeah n FN f slot on a 5-inch
spa in especially and this is HTC which
we've already established makes some of
the best hardware in the business agrees
so is it that i mean is are they are
just willing to sacrifice all that in
the name of aesthetics because maybe I
really isn't possible I think HTC is the
next blackberry you remember the days
where the blackberry pearl was like you
can buy it with Wi-Fi but not with GPS
or we were to yes but not with Wi-Fi
yeah the genius and that was the only
reason why the blackberry bold was such
a hit because it was the first
BlackBerry that had everything yeah I
did I don't know you know I I hesitate
to say that HTC is the next blackberry I
really because I think that they I think
that they were in danger of becoming
that in 2011 but then they learned their
lesson and have been you know they have
been doing better financially but
they've been doing better from a product
perspective this year so I think that
they're on the right track maybe they're
not going anywhere down that road but at
least they're standing on the right Road
ok the problem when you when you focus
on specific products is either your
products have to be and these are these
are the things where I'm like why are
you guys following Apple these are the
stupid things that I feel that OEM
should not follow non removable
batteries is a mistake non removable
storage is a mistake and you know it's
just funny when you have an HTC a you
know and I'm standing and I'm staying
I'm sitting here watching Peter Chou at
mwc in Barcelona what you're gonna be
there next year yeah and and I'm like
okay he's I and this is the most like
carnac beautiful design and when I go
grab the phone and I'm like okay where's
the SD slot and it's wait a second it's
sealed and I was carrying an HTC
sensation in my pocket there and like
wait a second this phone has everything
and then the new one x doesn't and I'm
like what is this what's going on and
I'm like why are
you guys doing what you're not supposed
to be doing you know these are the
things you shouldn't copy from Apple
non-removable battery is non-removable
storage yeah that's that's just a
mistake and you know and and and I'm
like okay fine they were trying to make
a slim design and it's beautiful poly
carbon and so fine I'm gonna put up with
it and then you get Sam's on three
months down the road well the galaxy s3
that has everything right yeah you can
you have to know what you can get away
with right right you know and I don't
know units we're we're gonna have to see
what what goes on i'm looking forward to
the butterfly global launch because I
mean I'm it's it's guaranteed basically
in my view and tell me if I'm crazy on
this it's guaranteed to have a microSD
slot and probably just an HSPA radio
right persons probably and I am with you
on that it we know butterfly you know
day one I will buy it I will yes yeah
your your review was enough for me to be
like I am drooling over this thing to
DNA it's just too bad it doesn't work
here you know where I am but yes i would
i would be willing to cough up whatever
money and this is just the thing HTC I
wish and and I really hope you're
listening I want you to be bold enough
to actually make the phone a little more
expensive if you have to but put in
everything please please you know and
we'll have to see how it goes i we do we
have heard from from HTC directly some
of the guys on the on the floor at the
droid DNA launch we're talking about
pocket now and it's I think at least one
of them did mention the weekly so I do
hope I do hope that because I feel like
we give HTC such fanservice on the
podcast and it sounds like it sounds
like some kind of like if you were a
conspiracy-minded you would think we
were sponsored or something like that
because we're always like more bad news
out of HTC but aren't they awesome you
know you know it's just the funny it's
like you know we've got great
relationships with each of the companies
um HTC I would say is we have a great
relationship with them but you know it's
it's always you know HTC is just
different and it's just funny because in
my case I've got and I'm not gonna lie
to you I have seven HTC devices in my
drawer whoa and I'm from you know from I
was ever since they built the first I
pack I just became a fan of their design
and it's just funny because none of
those seven devices in my drawer
I got for free I actually paid for yeah
well that's and sorry I just had a
massive coughing fit it's it's
fascinating how much sentimentality can
play into which devices you keep around
and we know this as geeks and listeners
you know this because we're all kind of
geeks in the same way where it's like I
love HTC because they were the first
android phone I ever had was the HTC evo
on sprint nice and it was like the phone
of 2010 like it was the thing everyone
talked about and you know so i really
really i remembered HTC from the times
when i was selling them and i was like
my god it's finally great to have one of
these yeah the record listeners every
one of you that calls me an Apple fanboy
could you please ask me how many iPhones
do I have in my drawer please right um
you know I would declare myself an HTC
fanboy fine I'll take it it gets to that
point where you're like where you know
you're you're a real lover of a brand
when I was reading a blog entry about
how the design of the HTC evo came about
it was a blog entry from a guy who
worked at the at the engineering firm
that HTC hired to design the the
physical it you know the physical
embodiment of the device because the
chassis was not an HTC design they
brought in you know they collaborated
with another company on it yea which was
just fascinating reading about like this
the confluence of the pillowy design
with the hard edges and all this kind of
stuff I'm like my god i'm sitting here
I've been sitting here for 25 minutes
reading an article about how it how a
mobile device is designed one I i knew i
was really geeky but i didn't know i got
to this extreme to apparently i'm really
in love with HTC and then 2011 landed
and i was like what are you guys doing
great agreed anyway we raid we've got to
jump into two pieces of listener mail
and then we gotta go because we're at
we're at time basically and yeah i hope
that you will i hope that we're able to
get through this first one in in a very
short amount of time because i feel like
we talked about this for about a half
hour at the start of the show so maybe
listener whose name I don't know how to
pronounce as usual kire or kirei it is
que ir e hear hear ok either way one
we've got somewhere in there we got one
of them right
this is a good question do you think
this is a windows phone question do you
think over time the Metro UI design or
the modern UI design will devastate all
devices and applications as it's heavily
integrated within the Metro tile design
fashion does change quickly in so do you
is what will Microsoft do when users are
bored I've been using the samsung omnia
7 for two and a half years now and I'm
sick of tiles and now it's on my desktop
fascinating so this is a viewpoint we
don't hear very often from not only from
somebody who doesn't like tiles I mean
we hear that all the time but you know a
user who's lived with them for a very
long time and is now sick of them hmm
typical me let me go ahead let me answer
first I completely sympathize with being
bored with something even after six
months I think with my samsung focus
back in the day I was like yeah I'm kind
of this is I've grown tired of this let
me go to something that's a little bit
more visual for visually fulfilling but
that happens to me on every platform
almost every platform I get bored and I
want to jump to the next to the next
thing so I think this is a personality a
question more than it is a platform
question because we've seen the opposite
extreme with with iphone users right
we've seen people who have been bought
the iphone back in 2007 and still have
an iphone 5 and they've bought everyone
and you know for millions of people they
don't care that they have a static grid
of icons I don't find it boring they're
like others familiar this is home and I
think that's true for Windows Phone
users or so I think this is a
personality thing I think this is like
if you're a platform jumper then you're
just gonna be a platform jumper it's you
know it's not the platform's ok i will
i'll put this into this perspective I
you know I studied business and one of
the things that I and I'm gonna move a
little bit into Samson but I'll make a
point out of this ok you know what
Apple's done with the ipod and the
iphone is figure out a way to put it in
style yeah they've they've made it a
style fashion statement what what
Samsung did with the galaxy s3 is the
same thing they figured out a way to
make it a fashion statement um you know
and i think that microsoft's marketing
is terrible just like HTC
Marketing is terrible and that's the
reason why these products haven't really
taken off there's a lot of genius behind
the Metro UI and there's a lot of genius
behind a lot of the things I you know I
feel that once Microsoft gets rid of
their marketing firm and and hires
anybody that does a better job at making
the the Metro UI a style thing then I
feel that it has a future but as of yet
it you know I feel that it'll take more
time in the problem with more time is
when you have an aggressive Apple that
will not let you win hmm when you have
an aggressive Samson that will not let
you win and when you have a Samson that
doesn't really want to push the achieve
s you know if Samsung would push the
achieve s the same way that they push
the galaxy s3 then the you know the
platform would have a future well what I
mean how does that tie into I mean you
know like from it from a UI perspective
like from a well know the thing is he's
asking if you know do we really think
that it's gonna become more of a
mainstream in the future you know though
at the time that applications grow and
evolve into it and become more on
tyler's and stuff you know I I feel that
the problem is Microsoft is being too
slow and marketing it inadequately so
yeah the apps could be there and once
it's there than you could say that it's
a mathematical certainty because of how
many windows users are there in the
world that yes eventually it will grow
um but you know will that help you from
the boredom I agree with you Michael it
won't you know i'm bored of the iphone
but still every time that I walk down
the road and I see another iphone that's
not mine on the counter i want to buy it
that's just me I'm just dupid like that
it's true it happens to be all the time
and I look at a galaxy s3 on the counter
and it's not mine and I wanted but I
have one in my pouch so it's it's just
that they figured out a way to make it
such a fashion statement that people
want to buy it and that's really what
Microsoft has to push they have to make
Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 a fashion
statement in order for people to adopt
it and therefore even if you get bored
with it everybody will have one and
therefore you won't want to get rid of
yours either right yeah that's that's a
very that's something I I have a
difficult time disagreeing with um okay
you know I but i think i think we are is
we continue to be mired in this space
where we don't have enough data for how
Windows Phone 8
windows 8 are going to play together and
how they're going to affect the market
together and which direction they're
going to to drive users and I it's kind
of like this herding cats thing it's
like I don't know what what this is
going to do so we will have to see it's
a good question it is and it's uh but it
sounds like for you particularly how do
how did you say it before I mean kiri
could hire here here god I can't say
things sorry buddy yeah oh it's going to
get worse I've every piece of reader
mail is from a name that I can't
pronounce because I'm just inadequate I
think for you okay you are going to be
you are stuck in in the same kind of
dubious spot that the rest of us are
where you you you've held out for two
and a half years with the same UI which
is awesome it's more than I've ever done
in my life but it sounds like you're
ready for a change and you shouldn't
feel guilty about that agree um just to
close us out we have a interesting email
from froude Thorson boar Seth that's as
close as I can get perhaps for a day by
the way listeners he never pronounced is
my name so don't worry I know I can't
roll that are I can't do anything that
up great way to put a K in there and a
TD but this gentleman is is is from
Norway where many phones are not
available all the motorolas most notably
and it mentions that he listens to our
podcast while doing laundry which makes
the task a lot more entertaining well
thank you I thought I was alone in that
that's great no yeah me too I when I'm
folding laundry I quality was good
quality control the podcast is great the
questions I'm looking for an android
device with a physical keyboard without
too many compromises hardware wise is
there even such a thing I mean are there
any such models coming out in the near
future that you know of and finally
finally our physical keyboards a thing
of the past only to be found on
mid-range devices for a smaller market
never again in the high-end well will
you do the honors or you like
me to start haha uh why don't you go
ahead okay we share a view on this I
didn't catch your name but here's the
thing from fro their load through this
app yeah there's this application called
swiftkey please it's like five bucks at
times sometimes it costs three bucks
that application single-handedly is
responsible for making me like android
you know my first android device was the
nexus one and i hate it i love the phone
it was beautiful in everything but i
hated the keyboard i came from
blackberries from the slide out
keyboards of the touch pro 2 which was
the best keyboard in the business and i
was of the mentality that this that the
keyboard was a necessity up to the point
to my first windows phone being a dell
venue pro just because of the slide out
keyboard actually waited for it so my
point is you don't really know how much
a keyboard actually deters the
experience until you actually find the
good software keyboard so my advice to
you is forget about the keyboard by
swiftkey it'll be worth every penny it
gives you a 30 day trial and it'll make
you love android and by the way since
you're from norway and you were able to
send us this email in english and you
catch this so you're multilingual I you
know I speak two languages I know people
that speak three languages and I believe
that swiftkey was designed by people in
Germany and these guys actually speak
three languages themselves and that's
the cool thing about swiftkey is I don't
know how these guys were able to figure
that out but you can actually have three
languages set up in the keyboard and it
is able to predict what language you're
typing without having to switch the
keyboard so I wish that apple would
allow a third-party keyboard and I wish
that swiftkey would come to the iphone
and just about everything this planet
has to offer see I was gonna do a piece
on swiftkey at one point I never got
around to it so I actually haven't used
the app all that much and I I've had
really good luck with stock touch touch
keyboards but I was in a similar place
with this physical keyboard question
several years ago with the you know with
the webos line which always you know the
thing was like we're always going to
build keyboards into this because that's
where our roots are that's what we did
on the trio that's what you know blah
blah blah and I appreciated that and I
liked you know something keyboards were
good some are bad on those devices but
it was always great to have them and I I
never said like I'm never gonna use a
touch keyboard like I could use a touch
keyboard and it was fine i had an iphone
for a while and it was like
now I can really fly on this this is
great but I appreciated the physical
feedback of touch keyboards and we have
it's mentioned in this in the in the
listener mail here it's a I I bet you've
discussed this and exhausted all the
angles that there are to this topic we
have we've talked about it a lot and
I've written I've written an editorial
it was a brutally honest question corner
some other folks on the side of written
editorials and I still have friends
though who will not give up their
blackberry not because of bez or not
because of enterprise stuff not because
of the UI certainly but because they
don't want to give up their physical
keyboard I mean this is still a thing
but it's great and I think it's it what
I find is that it is typically the
people who have never even tried a
touchscreen keyboard and some of them
would be like well I tried it for a
little bit in that I then I had to go
back and it's like you didn't use the
right one and here's the thing you know
people don't really remember this guy
remember when the iphone was launched
the first generation iphone you know is
Steve Ballmer came on record and said it
doesn't have a keyboard it's not a good
email machine right you know you
remember that yeah it's a good bowler
voice yeah and and the funny thing is I
remember that Apple actually threw out
like three or four tutorials on the
keyboard specifically because people
were having a hard time understanding
that the keyboard was predicting what
they were typing and so people would
actually look at the keyboard and type
and you know that's the biggest issue
you know a friend of mine you know the
same blackberry friend that I told you
that's giving his daughter an iphone 5
he's like I don't want to get an iphone
he's like I want to keep her and I'm
like I showed him my finger in his eye
and he's like oh my god because my
finger covers like half 3ds on it yeah
right half the keyboard and he's like Oh
God and it's just funny cuz this guy's
like twice my size if he's got small
hands and so I'm like okay this is the
reason why I moved away from software
keyboards see you don't you no longer
have to worry and this is the paradigm
shift that a lot of people have not from
hardware keyboard you mean yeah I think
they think that software keyboards are
cumbersome because they have to type
accurately and they can't because they
have to look at the keys and that's the
biggest paradigm shift that people have
not made that's that's always my point
it's like yeah but I got to be really
precise with it whatever it's like no
you don't you have to
find a keyboard that you can trust now
it for different people that's going to
mean different things if you're on the
iphone you better damn what like you say
I'm a better damn well like the iOS
stock keyboard because that's all you
got if you're on Android you can do
swiftkey if you're on it you can do the
stock keyboard you can do this keyboard
from the hardware manufacturer they
always put a crappy keyboard on but if
you like it you like it if you're on
Windows Phone you better like the
windows phone keyboard for me between
the windows phone keyboard and the stock
jellybean keyboard I can just fly and
not because I'm accurate but because the
autocorrect works with me and it Noah
great what you know and it substitutes
the right words so that's so that's the
thing and just to kind of to kind of
wrap wrap that up to answer that final
question our physical keyboards the
thing of the past yes they are they are
I mean they're they're already being
sidelined and put on two mid-range
devices there hyatt these two high-end
devices these big ol side sliding things
like the Photon Q which I actually liked
quite a bit you know those are those are
those are yesterday's news I mean
physical keyboards add weight they add
thickness they add complexity they and
they add more parts that could actually
get ruined over dream exactly where that
ok so you know just to answer my answer
to the question is ok which is the best
software keyboard in the business funny
people are gonna laugh right now Windows
Phone it is it is yeah second law second
best software keyboard in the business
is iOS they figured it out from day one
um they actually figured it out first
but you know windows phone was actually
better and for me the third one would be
and this is the coolest thing about
Android you can buy any android phone
and just add swiftkey to it so just
think about it the phone will cost you
in Norway like I don't know five hundred
arrows just add 10 arrows extra to that
price or five arrows extra I think it is
right there for what is for the app by
swiftkey yeah and that's that's whatever
android phone you get just add that and
you'll be golden it'll be fine here's
the point I think we need to try and
rate stuff like this is that that's my
point is that you have to find out
what's going to work for you like for me
the stock jellybean keyboard beats beats
every everything else he on Android for
me like that's what I want to use and
that's you know so you have to find out
what it is especially if you're making
such a big leap and I don't know if
there are not many bigger leaps in the
mobile space right now than the one that
a user using a physical keyboard
when he moves to a touchscreen keyboard
like I mean that's huge that's a big you
I shift and it dates and it's painful
for a lot of people but you don't you've
got to do unless you want to be stuck in
mid-range phones for the rest of your
existence yeah you know what the coolest
thing about software keyboards is you
know to our listener it's the fact that
there comes a point where since you know
that the phone will predict what you're
typing you can actually type without
looking at the splits really cool when
you learn how to do it's really cool you
remember the moment you remember the
moment just as well as you remember the
moment when you could learn how to type
on a real keyboard I'm without looking
exactly wow I can do this and you're
like doing it in your pocket you're like
oh this is great yeah but yeah anyway
we've we've got it we've got to wrap it
up thank you both listeners for your
free or mail and and for for listening
obviously thanks to all the listeners
who sent in may always still have so we
got a lot of pieces this week we're
gonna have to push them some of them to
to next week but before we kind of wrap
it up here this has been a great show
i'm sorry that Brandon is not here to
join us for the for the wrap-up and high
made you uh do you have closing thoughts
for us before we head on out to the rest
of our day closing thoughts is this has
been a crazy year michael hasn't it with
the season with everything i mean you'd
raise the awesome job reviews and I'm
his life you know I'm really liking what
the panoramic looks I I can't wait for
next year to see how many you know
innovations we get because it's just
crazy right now I i love you know before
like 23 years ago it was like everything
was iphone the only cool thing out there
was iphone and everybody was just trying
to catch up and i just love the fact
that this time everybody's just asking
about other alternatives and that's you
know for everybody that calls me a
fanboy i just i did i crack up inside
because I'm not and I'm more I'm more
apples biggest critic which is something
you know I'm just everybody's biggest
critic and I think that we are on a
Segway to something beautiful coming up
next year and I just can't wait I think
you're right and it's it's it's as Joe
Levi off and says it is a wonderful time
to be alive and it's a great time to
follow the technology space because this
year has been absolutely outrageous with
a lot of innovations where we're seeing
some of the fiercest competition we've
ever seen in the space which is which I
didn't necessarily expect because we now
have fewer relevant players in the space
than I think we've
