pocket now calm we were a little
disappointed when after the launch of
the windows phone 7 App Store there were
no third-party apps that could take
advantage of the live tile functionality
in Windows Phone 7 live tiles allowing
to see dynamic information whether it's
sports scores a stock quote the current
temperature or whether you have a new
direct message on twitter well there is
one such app that has just entered the
marketplace it is the weatherbug
application and it has a live tile we're
going to think you throw it in this
video let's get to it alright so we're
going to take you through this from the
beginning because there are some
settings associated with this live tile
and since we've never seen any settings
associated with the live tile before
thought would be interesting to go
through the entire process so we're
going to start off in the marketplace
we're going to download the new
weatherbug application that takes
advantage of this live tile
functionality so here we are in the
market and it's loading sometimes it
takes a little bit while for all of the
apps to stream and even though we're on
Wi-Fi right now I'm going to dial into
apps okay slide over we're going to go
to all I'm trying to get to the screen
that shows you the new apps because that
is where weatherbug is listed here it is
weather bug
it's free very good so we're going to
install it and buy it we'll come back in
a second after it's done downloading and
installing and show you what the live
tile settings look like because they
only occur the first time you open the
app okay the app has been installed so
we can go back to the start screen here
slide over to the right and we get
weatherbug down here now I'm going to
add the live tile to the Start screen
and to start off it's not going to be a
live tile until we go into the
application and mess around with a few
settings so here goes welcome to
weatherbug for windows phone 7 this app
offers whether delivered to your live
tile as well as weather alerts and
notifications so here you turn on push
which will push the notifications to
your device and you can also have
weather alert notification so this will
bring up the toast notification service
if there's a tornado or severe storm in
your area and a special weather
statement has been issued which is
really great so we can press + or the
checkmark and we're going to put in a
zip code here
and so it's found my area and I'm going
to check off or automatically it's
checked off use this area as the live
tile location i'm gonna hit save and now
it's going to pull in the weather and
we're going to jump back to the start
screen in a minute you're going to see
the live tile and here we go a live tile
now that has the temperature I've been
tracking this over the last couple of
hours it seems to update at regular
intervals of about 30 minutes not a
hundred percent sure about that but as
you can see it says the area glen mills
and a temperature of 39 degrees and it
even gives you a little icon of the
current condition so we hope to see a
lot more of these live tiles that give
you dynamic information on your Start
screen that's really one of the big
promises with Windows Phone 7 that you
don't have to dive into apps all the
time to get certain glanceable
information so again weatherbug is
freeing the windows phone 7 app
marketplace and you can check it out if
you have a windows phone 7 device or
when you get one thanks for watching and
please thumbs up this video if you liked
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
