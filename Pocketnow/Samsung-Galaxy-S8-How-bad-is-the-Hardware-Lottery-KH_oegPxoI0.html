and I feel it's time we addressed the
hardware lottery a tale of two Samsung
galaxys after spending your hard-earned
money you might end up with an inferior
product I getting all the doom and gloom
out of the way this is a fairly common
practice for many smartphone
manufacturers there's a lot of stuff
going on inside this phone and Samsung
needs to produce millions of these
things to fulfill consumer demand so for
each individual component inside the
phone Samsung might turn to a number of
different vendors to fulfill that demand
this has caused a bit of a controversy
on the s8 which we're going to get into
here in just a bit but throughout
Samsung's history we've noticed them
pulling different camera sensors some
galaxies will use a Sony sensor some
galaxies will use the Samsung sensor and
of course the most obvious difference in
different galaxy models is the chipset
wear throughout most of the world
Samsung will use their own home-brewed
Exynos processor but in north america
especially to get that CDMA support they
have to turn to qualcomm samsung is not
the only manufacturer that has to pull
pieces from different suppliers similar
to samsung storage controversy Huawei
this year also got themselves into a
little bit of hot water with fans in the
different storage chips they were
pulling for the Huawei p10 even Apple
can find themselves under scrutiny for
the different radio and chipset
suppliers they turn to to produce the
iPhone on the hold this Hardware lottery
doesn't seem to overly affect the
individual phones which consumers are
apt to purchase at its best when there
are differences they're typically only
differences you would notice under
scientific conditions when two phones
using different components are
performing side by side we can end up
spending a lot of money on these things
so we can get cranky about benchmarking
scores but real-world performance is
again usually pretty close but we do run
into a problem when a company advertises
a certain feature and then doesn't
deliver on it the early specification
pages for the Galaxy s8 showed ufs 2.1
storage but a number of Galaxy s8
shipped out with you FS 2.0 storage and
when that hardware change started
getting reported by tech publications
Samsung pulled the specification from
their product page and it might not seem
like such a huge deal
to 2.0 versus a 2.1 it can't be that
significant and upgrade but with my
Galaxy s8 plus using ufs 2.1 and my s8
using 2.0 we have been able to charge
some pretty significant differences in
storage performance does this tank my
daily performance on the galaxy s 8 no
it's still a solid performer and I'd be
hard-pressed to notice any significant
differences in daily operation unless I
were holding this right next to an SI +
and performing the exact same operations
throughout my day but again if a company
advertises one thing and delivers
another I can totally appreciate why
consumers are going to be upset by that
I have to believe Samsung is
legitimately working towards fulfilling
consumer demand using the highest
quality pieces and parts that they can
assemble but if you aren't actually able
to fulfill what you've promised then I
think you need to disclose that
information to your consumers in a more
public fashion and ultimately that's the
biggest takeaway for me in discussing
the hardware lottery more often than not
I'm upset more by a lack of disclosure
then I am by these individual minor
differences from phone to phone just
having the information available through
a simple google search those of us who
really care about what storage is in our
phones will have access to that
information and the vast majority of the
smartphone buying public will still
probably be none the wiser but if you
try to handle this situation quietly say
you remove one of the line items in a
specifications page then those of us who
do make a lot of noise on the Internet
are going to feel like you're doing
something really shady and that we need
to alert other people to a potentially
anti-consumer situation more than
anything else before we go rushing for
the pitchforks and the torches I think
we just need to remember that making a
phone is a very complicated process
because I think we need to save the
power of the internet echo chamber for
those few times where a company really
does try to misrepresent a product or
when there's a consumer safety issue of
play and of course we want to hear from
you how do you think companies should
handle disclosure for those times where
there are differences in the hardware
components in their products drop us a
comment down below this video
those are kinds of conversations I love
getting into as always thanks so much
