now calm and in this video we're going
to take a look at the HTC heros home
screen set up with the widgets now this
isn't too dissimilar from the widgets
that you find on the omnia two that we
recently reviewed so we've multiple home
screens we can swipe to the right and
swipe to the right again we have three
home screens in this case to which we
can add a variety of widgets we can add
time widgets and launcher widgets and
stock widgets and weather widgets all
sorts of things and of course you can
add new widgets to this area you can
even download new ones it's a very
similar thing to how it works on the HTC
hero so let me zoom in a little bit and
we're going to go through this so on the
HTC hero there are seven home screens
which is actually a little bit too many
in my opinion the reason I say it's too
many is because if you want to get to
the one all the way to the right you
have to slide your finger to the right
to the right to the right and here we
are there's no way to quickly jump over
to the right the trackball helps a
little bit but again you have to swipe
swipe swipe swipe and then you're over
to the left it's a little bit cumbersome
and as we're going to find out
throughout this video and future videos
the HTC hero is slightly lacking in the
hardware department it needs a faster
processor or more RAM when you start to
add a lot of widgets things get a little
bit slow anyway let's take a look at the
widgets that we have here so right now I
have a next appointment widget with a
dual clock widget and some icons here to
launch programs now we can move any of
these widgets around although we're out
of space the way you do that is you tap
and hold and you actually get to see
where you can possibly move a widget and
that helps you keep everything aligned
very Square and flush now if I tap and
hold mail I'll have an open slot over
here if I remove this new a point the
next appointment widget I'll open up a
variety big swath of space up here where
I can place various icons and as you saw
earlier if you want to remove the nikon
you just bring it down here to remove
and it goes away now to add a widget
there are two ways to add widget
actually you can just hit
+ button down here or tap and hold on
the home screen and then we get a
variety of widgets that we can choose
from and we're going to go through all
of those in a minute but first I want to
talk about scenes so if you press the
menu button you get something that's
called scenes and later we're going to
go through the whole Android interface
to explain exactly how the Android
interface works compared to windows
mobile and other mobile platforms now a
scene is a pre-configured set of widgets
you've won called social which puts for
example Twitter on your second screen so
you can easily send a tweet there's one
called travel which has a variety of
ways to keep track of how the weather is
in various cities and what time it is in
various cities you have clean slate
which is obviously clean here is custom
one this is one that I particularly like
and it's I like it a lot because it's
very clean it gives me access to only
the things that I need to see so the
screen screen dims a little bit as it
loads my particular custom home screen
so this is the home screen setup that i
really like i get a small clock at the
top not too big i get some icons of
things that i want to see next
appointment and a battery meter which is
actually an addition that i downloaded
from the android marketplace which I'll
talk about later to the right there is
nothing I like to keep it clean and
actually it's to the left and to the
right I have the the current weather and
what's really great about the HTC hero
is that it knows what city I'm in
without actually putting it in so if I
travel to Philadelphia it will say
Philadelphia the current temperature if
I travel to New York City it will say
New York City and the current
temperature if you tap on that widget
you will get a forecast for that
particular city and for those of you
that use Windows Mobile you'll probably
think this is familiar this is the same
weather tab that you get on the HTC
touch HD HTC touch pro2 touch diamond2
there's a lot of elements taken from the
windows mobile touchflo interface put on
to the HTC hero in fact if you open up a
task manager it's a third party
application on the hero the home screen
interface is referred to as touchflo so
there you have it so I want to press the
back button then we have another set of
shortcuts over here to dial favorite
people so I can tap on their name to get
there to call their phone
here I have a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth switch
a link to camera but go over to the
right nothing is there because again I
like to keep it very clean so let's
start customizing a panel let's say we
want to add certain things to this panel
I'm going to click the plus button to
bring up the list of widgets now we can
bring up a list of shortcuts we can take
a bookmark that comes right from the the
web browser on the hero so we can put a
link to Google and there it is quite
simply and we can go back to the plus do
a shortcut to say Google Mail label or a
certain mail inbox if you have multiple
email accounts configured you can also
link to a person in your contacts list
or to a program is safe there's a
program that use on a regular basis
let's say you use the program called
backgrounds a lot and backgrounds is a
really cool program we're going to go
through it later that lets you change
all of the backgrounds it comes
pre-configured with a ton of
great-looking themes that you can have
so let's go into the next item HTC
widgets this is the widgets that HTC has
created that are a little bit different
than what you get on say a g1 so we can
have this bookmarks widget which i think
is actually kind of a cpu intensive
thing that i wouldn't want to have on
and there are two visual styles just a
list or very iconic based bookmark
selection so we can place that on the
screen and it says no space on the
screen drag to another screen to place
and see bring it up sometimes it's hard
to tell it to go over to the next screen
here it goes i rolled the trackball and
here it is this is a list of bookmarks
that I've got on my device but let me
take this off and remove it back to the
screen HTC widgets we can do a calendar
the calendar is really fantastic
actually and you can change the style
from this standard calendar it looks
very similar to what you find on
touchflo 3d or even the iPhone or we can
go to simply the next appointment item
which is really really handy to have so
you know where you're supposed to be so
I'm going to go with the calendar and
again it needs more space so I'm going
to drop it right here and it's a really
great calendar application because I can
click on a certain day and it will bring
up what's happening it'll also
give me the weather for my particular
area just like you get on again touchflo
3d you get this in the calendar tab okay
so let's throw this away and go back to
the list then you have clock and there's
a variety of clocks you can choose let
me show you we use the trackball to go
over this is very very touch flo 3d
looking i'm sure you'll recognize that
began dual clock or a very artistic
clock kind of cartoonish and of course
as with any of the widgets you can just
move them around on screen let's do the
dual clock and we are going to put put
it down here and we'll remove it so
we're not going to go through every
single widget I just want to show you
kind of the cool ones that are left so
wave footprints which is another feature
from windows mobile devices we've mail
which is another feature from windows
mobile devices that lets you flick
through your mail messages just like you
get in touch flo 3d and they're actually
a few different versions of this this
particular one lets you flick through
like so we're going to go back messages
music people which you've already seen
it lets you let you look through
favorite people photo album again comes
from touchflo 3d you can flick through
pictures photo frame really cool idea
with photo frame what you can do is you
can take a picture from your photo
gallery and basically have a photo of
say you know your your friend or your
spouse or whatever what have you on your
main screen so i don't really have that
many pictures on here but i'm going to
take the first one that i see i have no
idea what this is and you can also
resize it drop it and now you have a
little picture frame right on your home
screen so that you always see the
picture of your spouse when you turn on
your phone not sure if you want to have
that but if you do that has that option
really interesting widget and let's go
back down see what else we have we can
do a search we can do settings we can
choose any setting really from this list
to put on to the home screen so with one
touch you can turn on Wi-Fi or gps going
down the list further we have a really
cool Twitter widget
looks like I just got a text message
from down Webster so we can have two
different styles of the of the of
Twitter we can have the small widget or
we can have the larger sort of widget
that lets you see more at one time so
let's go with that one and I wants me to
log in here but I haven't configured my
Twitter yet so we won't go there let's
go back to the next one we have weather
and stocks and stocks is pretty cool
it's very touch flo 3d like I'm sure
that's not a surprise to you at this
point and actually didn't select the
right one stocks here we go and there
are several different stock styles you
can have a small ticker a larger more
in-depth thicker as you saw before and
it looks like I selected just the
standard ticker though I'm imagining
this to use a lot of battery and CPU so
again these widgets aren't really well
optimized for the device I think they
use a lot of power and the device could
benefit from some some better
utilization of the cpu and ram so
overall i love the ability to customize
my home screen this has been one of my
biggest complaints about the iphone is
that you can't do much with the home
screen you have a bunch of icons and
then you have another page of icons but
at least with the hero and android
devices you can have next appointment
and you can see at a glance your battery
level and you can turn Wi-Fi on and off
in one click or you can click on an icon
for to dial your friend or text them
very quickly or to see your how many
messages you have all in one screen or
if there's more information that you
need you can go to the screens on the
right there are seven of them which i
actually think is a little bit too much
i wish HTC is offered maybe a one two
three four five six seven button along
the bottom to allow you to jump from
screen to screen or even remove screens
if you're not using all of them and make
it easier to go from side to side so
that's it for the whole sense UI widget
based interface on the HTC hero we're
going to be back soon with a lot more on
how the whole Android interface actually
works with the notification systems the
whole menu system and how things
actually work compared to say windows
mobile device that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
