pocketnow.com one of my favorite
features of Android 2.1 and above is the
live wallpaper did you know you can
actually get a ton of extra free live
wallpaper from the Android Market in
this video we're going to go through
some of the best ones that I found for
live wallpapers for your background on
your Android 2.1 or above device let's
take a look okay so to do this who
really I just spent some time here in
the market I searched for a live
wallpaper
most of these are free there's a couple
that cost money I'm going to show you
one that cost $2 but I actually think
it's worth the price you'll see why in a
second so let me jump into the wallpaper
setting and I'm going to show you some
of these that I've picked up I'm going
to save this one for last at the top
this one's called Cube live wallpaper
you just saw you can either choose a
cube or a multi-sided object to spin in
the background and there are some
settings you can change the background
color to a variety of different things
pretty customizable and so on and so
forth and let's go down a little bit
we've something called living colors
this is another freebie very very simple
kind of hypnotic with some colors
exploding we can change some of the
settings change the colors and so on so
if we set this wallpaper again very
simple it just hangs up in the
background gives you some colors pretty
fun it's going to live wallpapers again
scroll down we have something called
mary jane free which shows you a certain
botannical in the background of your
phone with the leaves kind of moving
gently so that could be fun let's go
back and go down a little bit all these
are built in here's one that's really
cool it's called pond clock live
wallpaper you can actually play a game
of a pond right on your phone you can go
into settings and change some settings
like the game mode where you can
actually interact with the background or
it just goes by itself I want to show
you it with the interaction so I can
grab ahold of one of these ponds and I
can play pong in my background if I'm
bored or I can just let it go by itself
and you can see the computers playing
against me right now so that's sort of
fun even if you have a lot of icons on
the screen you can still move around
paddle so that's pretty cool jump back
in here
this one's called silhouettes which is
again another hypnotic sort of basic
wallpaper that just has a little bit of
motion so if we stop we can see the
clouds are kind of moving and the trees
just a little bit very simple see what
else we have that we didn't talk about
yet the matrix of course this is the
what you would expect you get these kind
of green symbols in the background sort
of from the Matrix movie and there are
some settings associated with that how
fast the character goat characters go
how big they are and again everything
I've shown you so far is free and you
can just get them by searching for
whatever the title is in the Android
Market so there's anything else I want
to show you down here let's go to the
top this is the one that actually costs
two bucks but I think it's really well
worth it you're going to see why in a
second it's a koi pond on your phone and
there are a lot of settings you can
change the number of fish you can change
the fish speed lots of other settings
but it actually has some cool
functionality so here it is we've got
these fish in the background and now
what I can do actually is pick up an
icon and drop it and it will actually
feed the fish so let me move an icon and
I'll slide over to the left and you'll
see these little things come down
they're actually a little Android robots
that are that look like fish food sort
of and when you do this the fish come
onto the screen and there's a little
Android guy and the fish are going
towards the food because they want to be
fed some other things you can do you can
tap on the fish which will vibrate your
phone and the fish will sort of run away
and there's some more Android food so
pretty fun again this one costs $2 it
probably uses up more battery life than
the other ones because it's more graphic
intensive but I find it very relaxing to
have fish swimming on the home screen of
my Nexus One I don't know about you so
I'll make a list on pocketnow.com of all
these live wallpapers that I've talked
about and please in the comments there's
a live wallpaper that you like and that
you use let us know maybe we'll take a
video of it if it's really cool please
give the video a thumbs up if you liked
it and subscribe to our channel for more
smart phone videos that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
