honeycomb is the big news in android
today specifically that honeycomb
android 3.0 is only going to be for
tablets not for smartphones of course we
never let that stop us before so let's
take a look at honeycomb on your smart
phone okay this is my t-mobile g2 and it
comes out of the box running Android 2.2
also known as Froyo I've shown you in
previous videos Android 2.3 Gingerbread
via a custom ROM called CyanogenMod ROM
specifically CM 7 the 7 is what makes it
gingerbread vs. 6 which is a an Android
open source project build of 2.2 or
Froyo so that out of the way if you take
a look at this it looks like honeycomb
and honeycomb is Android 3.0 and we've
only seen that on one product that's the
Motorola Xoom tablet and in the Android
SDK for developers but you can see up
here I've got a little bit of an
interesting blueish color to my
notification bar icons I've got this
neat little Tron style analog clock
widget I've got these guys up here these
are a couple of widgets I'll show you
what they are in just a minute you can
see that I've got the the honeycomb font
up there with it's folded paper look to
it coming over here I've got very blue
themes in fact you can see blue around
there in fact if we come into the
settings come over here into the phone
settings and look at sound you'll notice
up here that these little dropdowns
have a blue hint to them in fact if we
come in there to volume you can see that
there's this blue glow around the
outside of that modal dialog box with
this nice blue underline to it I still
have some green remnants now why do I
have a green remnants in there instead
of the honeycomb blue
simply because this is not honeycomb now
honeycomb Google has hinted to us
without saying it specifically is not
going to come to smartphones now that
doesn't mean that Android 3.0 won't be
ported or or deployed to a smartphone
it's just not built or designed for it
instead what we have here is a feature
of CyanogenMod 7 which is called
right down here theme chooser now theme
chooser is an app that well it's named
appropriately so it lets you choose
themes now these themes aren't like the
themes that you're used to for example
on ADW launcher we've got a video coming
up very soon that shows you some theme
ability on that so you'll want to make
sure that you subscribe to our video
channel so you don't miss that one it'll
probably be out this Thursday of course
if you're watching this sometime in the
future it might already be out but
subscribe to the channel anyway so you
can make sure you don't miss that but
what this feature does is it lets you
download and install apks either from
the market or from other sources and
sideload them and that's what i've done
here that let you redeem everything so
here is a theme called system here is
honey bread that's what I'm running
right now here is cyan bread and droid
Ian's he's a really cool guy I like his
stuff but today what we're talking about
is this honey bread theme all you need
to do is go onto our website at
pocketnow.com find the article
associated with this video it will be
entitled honeycomb on a smartphone or
something to that effect and download
the apk
now of course prerequisites you do have
to have CyanogenMod 7 at least nightly
22 if you're running on the t-mobile g2
like I am you can tell if you are not
because if you aren't you'll have that
that theme chooser app and if you're not
then you won't so that's the first
prerequisite second you'll need to
download this from the link at the
article third you'll need to install it
fourth you'll need to come to the theme
chooser app and select it now here's one
thing I don't like about the theme right
now
take a look at the button down at the
bottom see that apply button it's hard
to see isn't it yeah especially when out
here it's even hard for me to see off
camera we're gonna go ahead and apply it
now watch when I press it because
there's another gingerbready thing see
that that was nice and blue nice and
blue kind of an indigo so kind of cool
now what it's done is it's just applied
that theme and because I've already
applied it in the past that's all I have
to do but if I were applying this theme
or another theme for the first time then
I would need to reboot my phone because
some elements specifically the UI
elements up on the top that are core to
Android can't just be replaced while the
phone is running so they're all ready to
go I just have to reboot to apply them
so I've already done that in this case
so I don't have to bore you with that
but from that point there you go you've
got it it looks very nice you can see
the really cool honeycomb like wallpaper
the honeycomb like coloring up there now
you notice that nice cool screen
transition this is launch or pro yet
another launcher that you can download
from the marketplace Brandon's going to
be doing a video on that in the next day
or so
so again if you haven't tuned in to our
channel and subscribed now is the time
to do that next up this widget the
analog clock comes with it so all you
got to do is drop it on there new Sonic
cool little animation that goes around
so it's not just the hands that animate
it's the whole clock really kind of cool
next is these guys now these you've seen
before you just haven't seen me running
these skins on them first off is you've
got beautiful widgets and this is their
their new super clock with the new
battery status indicator and I'm sorry
guys I know how you guys like seeing 100
percent battery stuff but I've been
doing this all day and haven't had a
chance to charge up so I'm at 36% with
very heavy usage but you can change out
the weather icon with a battery icon
which is really kind of cool down
underneath it I've got a four by one
weather and I've got a weather skin on
here that lets me choose or lets me see
it in kind of a more gingerbread style
to change that you go into weather skins
and the one I'm running now is called
glowed
which looks really kind of neat on there
and of course you can choose any of the
others you can even download stuff just
directly to your phone so really kind of
cool I like how they've done that but
very very much into into the Gingerbread
theme so that is pretty much all of it
of course we want to see what you do to
make your phone look like honeycomb
rather than gingerbread and I think I
said that wrong just a minute ago but we
want to see how you make your phone look
very honeycomb like so please take some
pictures and comment on our article over
at pocketnow.com
if you want we would love for you to
shoot a video and show us what it looks
like on your phone in operation and just
tag those on his video comments to this
video very cool stuff give this video a
thumbs up if you like seeing stuff like
this and of course head over to
