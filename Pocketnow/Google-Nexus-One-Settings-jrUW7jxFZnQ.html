pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to cover all the settings you can
change on the google nexus one i think
that android more than any other
operating system for a mobile device
really allows you get in there and tweak
and change a lot of system settings the
nexus one is definitely no exception so
start turn on the device and we'll go
right to settings and we'll go through
all of the different settings that you
can change on this device starting with
wireless and networking so from here you
can turn on airplane mode right now
Wi-Fi is on and it's scanning for a
wireless network or you can tap on Wi-Fi
settings to sort of see the the Wi-Fi
networks that are around your area
bluetooth is turned off right now you
can change Bluetooth settings if you
want to connect a hands-free kit or
Bluetooth headset or something like that
then down down here you can click on
mobile networks and check off only use
2g networks which saves battery of
course and I'm on AT&amp;amp;T right now so I
have no choice but to use the 2g network
unfortunately you can see little G up
there I'm not even getting edge right
now which happens once in a while
usually I get a strong edge signal which
is obviously much slower than 3g so
let's go back another screen let's go
into call settings from here you can
change fix dialing settings and you can
also change your voicemail settings we
can turn on call forwarding and if we
tap on additional settings we can we can
change whether call waiting should be
turned on so kind of basic stuff that
you normally don't really play with so
let's go into sound and display some
stuff in here that we want to talk about
so we can turn on silent mode so that
this phone stays silent if you're in a
meeting or you're in a movie or
something like that we can change the
ringer volume quite easily and you can
hear how loud it gets that is way too
out ok you can change the media volume
to determine when music is playing or
when you're moving around the operating
system how loud things are can change
the phone ringtone obviously there are
tons of
pretty interesting ringtones already
included on the device and i really like
digital phone if that works the best
okay we go down a little bit we can go
to phone vibrates so the phone can
vibrate for incoming calls another way
to notify you that somebody is calling
then change the notification ringtone
and you get a course a big list of
options it's when a text message comes
in or something like that we can change
the pulse notification light which will
blink down here when you've got a new
message or a text message very handy so
you don't have to go to your phone turn
it on and we still a little bit of
batter you can just glance at your phone
and see if you have a new thing you need
to action on we can turn on audible
touch tones so that means that when
you're using the dialing pad you hear
the sounds audible selection so please
sound when making a screen selection
which for some may be kind of annoying
let's see how that works so you can hear
that sound so I'm going to turn that off
we can turn on haptic feedback when you
do a lot of things on the google nexus
one you get a little bit of buzz buzz
feedback when you press these buttons
down here when you open the application
tray you can save a little bit of
battery life by actually turning that
off SD card notifications so when you do
something with the SD card it will play
a sound we have orientation in most
screens you can just jump quickly into
landscape and this way if you turn that
off that won't happen anymore in case
it's kind of annoying for you so go back
down also here's something you may want
to change animation you can change if
you want some odd animations or all
animations by default the google nexus
one does a lot of screen animations so
if we close out of here it fades out if
we go into settings it fades in if we go
to the the application tray the icons
kind of folks are in and a nice
aesthetically pleasing way but of course
all of these things use a battery life
so if we turn off the notifications or
the animations i should say you really
won't get those anymore so if i press
home it just goes away if I tap settings
it just pops up which actually makes the
device feel faster and it saves a bit on
battery life so you may want to keep
that turned off we can change screen
brightness and we can turn on automatic
brightness let's see
it looks like with no screen brightness
you can still see the screen and you're
going to save a ton on battery life if
you leave the backlight off but of
course outdoors make it difficult to see
the display and we can change screen
timeout so you can again save on battery
life by having screen automatically shut
off by a set interval limit of 30
seconds right now let's go back to
location and security also we can check
off use wireless networks to determine
location by Wi-Fi under mobile networks
kind of using the triangulation we can
also set an unlock pattern if you want
to do that security and you have to do
that to confirm and then now when you
unlock your device instead of just
sliding to the right you do a quick on
lock pattern but this has been an
Android for a very very long time and of
course I'm going to turn it off by going
to uncheck create and now I don't need
to enter a pattern we can set up a sim
card lock we can have the passwords be
visible as we type along which is always
handy because with an on-screen keyboard
you're never quite sure if you're
touching the right letter and there's
some other stuff down here for grid
credential storage that we're not going
to go through we can go into
applications and you can check off on
that allow installation of non-market
applications if you're getting
applications from third parties on the
internet and you want the device to
accept these things we go to manage
applications to see all the applications
that we've installed from the
marketplace and right now says computing
so it's looking up and seeing how much
space these are taking up and from here
we can go to sort by size so that now
twitt droit we join at the top is listed
as having the largest footprint and if
we tap on any of these we are taken to
some more information and this is
standard Android stuff we can uninstall
and clear the cache to get back some
memory or we can force it to shut down
if it's misbehaving running services we
can see sort of a task manager of what's
running right now of course the Android
operating system can multitask so right
now I've got a few things open and
running and then this is I haven't
really been here development so some
tools for developers who are making
applications for Android accounts and
sync will allow you to determine which
accounts are synced syncing there's very
good Facebook integration with google
nexus one also
google account integration so for our
email and for calendar and things like
that you can turn that on and this
little symbol in the center is my
microsoft exchange account which is
turned on and is sinking and it's
automatically syncing if he can you can
turn that on and off to save on battery
life and data transfer if we go into
privacy we can have it use your location
so that when you are using a google
search it knows where you're calling in
from or where you're searching from so
that provides relevant results you can
factory reset from here it's a hard
reset some stuff with SD cards shows you
how big the SD card is so 3.69 the nexus
one comes with a 4 gigabyte card off the
bat although it's not listed as you know
that large it's slightly less and it
says how much available spaces you can
unmount the SD card for safe removal and
internal phone storage right now about
160 megabytes of available space
applications go to the the internal
storage by default right now you can't
store them to a microSD card on the on
the nexus one although that's expected
to change let's go to search and see
what's there we can go to google search
settings and we can show web suggestions
leave search history on can even in
managed search search history if you
want to see sort of what you've been
searching for and also this is pretty
cool searchable items so you can choose
what items in your phone are searchable
so that when you do the sort of global
search you can determine whether it's
pulling YouTube videos or contacts or
apps or music right now youtube and
music is unchecked makes it a little bit
faster that way and let's go back to the
previous screen ok so let's go into
language and keyboard we can select the
locale hear and determine which keyboard
you want to use it's on English
obviously right now on-screen keyboard
settings for the android keyboard you
can have it vibrate on key breast which
is pretty cool like the HTC hd2 really
allows you to really feel for the keys
and know when you've hit a button we can
do sounds on keypress all that may be
annoying to some people auto
capitalization voice input which we
showed in a previous video pretty well
done and then also quick fixes show
suggestions and autocomplete things to
help you type a little bit faster
and not make so many errors on the
on-screen keyboard and user dictionary
you can change words and add words to
the user dictionary in case you're
typing a strange word and the device is
constantly trying to correct you in
continuing on we can go to date and time
here you can have the the time
automatically update which so is good
you can switch to a 24-hour time format
where you can choose the date format
depending on where you live you may have
a certain preference and finally some
cool stuff down here and about phone we
can go to system updates to see if
there's a new update for for the system
there are none status shows you your
phone number the signal that you have
this is really really neat battery use
it shows you how your device is using
battery life so that you can sort of
attempt to cut down on things that are
using the most battery so you can see
that thirty percent thirty six percent
of my battery usage is from voice calls
and you can see sort of the progression
down there and you can tap on these
items to get sort of some actions so I
tap on display and then it tells me what
I need to do to cut down on display
usage of battery so i read your screen
brightness phone i know there's not much
you can do their android live wallpaper
which does use a little bit of battery
life it shows you their how much CPU
it's using we can also go to Wi-Fi and
see go back to the Wi-Fi settings to
turn off Wi-Fi perhaps to save on
battery life you get it even a drill
down by application so email right now
using just two percent of my battery
life and you can now see everything else
here the firmware the colonel system
tutorial legal all that good stuff so
that was just a quick look at all of the
settings on the google nexus one there's
a lot of things you can change in any
android device but the google nexus one
really extends that even more by giving
you more things to sort of adjust about
the system so that's it for now on the
settings on the google nexus one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
