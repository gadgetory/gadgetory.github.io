2009 it's hard for us to forget since we
were reviewing one of the best-selling
smartphones of all time the HTC Touch
pro2 aka till 2 even if it's only been
four years since it's launched these
were very different times back then
slide-out QWERTY keyboards a stylus on
resistive touchscreens and Microsoft's
Windows Mobile operating system more
important codename the HTC rhodium the
touch pro2 was ahead of its time it may
seem small free today the fact that it
was one of the biggest phones of its
time it was beautifully crafted with a
metallic chrome ring on the borders and
was packed to the gills and features
it's gorgeous three point six inch WVGA
display put the hvga panel on the iPhone
3G of the time to shame and it's 528
megahertz processor along with 256
megabytes of RAM and 512 megabytes of
expandable storage we're great
specifications for the time as well now
the real story about the hardware was
HTC's purpose for this phone it was
meant to be a business and multimedia
powerhouse and indeed it was it was one
of the first phones with dual
microphones and had an amazing stereo
speaker system at the back this allows
you to have a better experience watching
video and with conference calls which is
the reason why they even included a mute
button at the back this was also hands
down the best slide-out keyboard ever
made it was one of the first offset
keyboards in the market in the second
HTC phone to include a tilting screen so
the experience writing long emails was
unmatched one of the things I missed the
most about this phone was the software
its last update was the HTC Sense 2.5
running on top windows mobile 6.5 HTC
sensor touchflo 3d as it was known was
the most elegant and complete UI of the
time back then when you needed
third-party applications for basic
things like Twitter YouTube the weather
or stock information HTC Sense had it
all out of the box if Samsung's motion
gestures amaze you on Galaxy phones
today HTC Sense was first and allowing
you to respond to phone
by just flipping the phone on its back
and using the speaker aside from other
automated services this was also a truly
open operating system where you can
access the file system and even the
devices registry and tweak whatever you
wanted with it heck I even ran Android
on a microSD card at some point so there
was really no limit to what you could do
with this phone using this phone was
great because back then one hand the
usability was actually a feature in the
hardware buttons were designed to let
you navigate everything with ease once
you add that experience to others like
the keyboard productivity focus of the
software with office mobile integration
plus some amazing call quality and
battery life and this phone made a lot
of happy users back then sadly one of
the main reasons why this platform died
was its move to persistent storage back
with Windows Mobile five the more
updates the phone received and the more
clunker it became an its resistive
touchscreen was also not a sensitive as
the capacitive displays of its time and
the fact that Microsoft was reluctant to
adopt WebKit on Park and Internet
Explorer just made the phone perform
like an old lady when compared to the
iPhone or even some of the Android
phones back then and now I'm not going
to waste your time talking about photo
or video quality because back then these
things weren't really important in the
three point two megapixel camera on this
phone without a flash then do a really
good job bottom line even with Windows
Mobile holding this phone back from the
experience we deserved we miss these
times back then less wasn't more HTC did
an amazing job in giving you the best
experience for your money the touch pro2
went on to be one of the best selling
windows mobile phones of all time
available in all carriers and different
variants and yes the deserved praise it
was a beautiful phone and we all can't
wait to see HTC gain the sort of
popularity that it had with this phone
once again that's it for our throwback

much for watching did you own this phone
