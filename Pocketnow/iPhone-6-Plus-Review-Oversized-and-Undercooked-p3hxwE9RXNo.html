smartphone craze Apple caved and
announced not one but two newer bigger
iPhones how well does iOS scale is the
biggest iPhone worth it
let's find out hi I'm Taylor Martin with
PocketNow and this is our iPhone
six-plus review brought to you by
Squarespace
the biggest changes in the iPhone this
year are in hardware and that's a
perfect place to begin for starters
Apple has gone back to a unibody design
trading the flat edges from the last
four iPhone models for rounded edges
that blend into a completely flat
backside which is oddly reminiscent of
the original iPhone the only break in
the casing is for some polycarbonate
spacers for the antenna in late April
claimed eyesore for many the iPhone 6
plus the larger of the two is
unapologetic about its size it's taller
and wider than most other smartphones
with similar sized displays like the
Oppo find 7 a but it's also incredibly
thin just 7.1 millimeters thick it's so
thin Apple couldn't manage to fit the
camera housing inside the phone so it
protrudes about a half a millimeter out
of the back which makes the phone rock
when on a flat surface the iPhone 6 plus
isn't exactly lightweight like previous
iPhones either it's a hefty 72 grams
plat paired with the slick rounded edges
in the two-handed nature of the phone
make this an unusually dangerous
combination it feels like it might slip
out of your hand at any given moment for
that very reason we felt more confident
carrying it in a case that's not to say
the phone isn't built well though it's
built with an exceptional precision
that's evident from the way the glass
just flows over the edge of the foam and
how the mute switch firmly snaps back
and forth and it feels substantial
however both new iPhone models have
faced some controversy of their alleged
susceptibility to bending user reports
of bending iPhones have spread like a
wildfire across the internet but Apple
maintains that the number of official
claims of bent iPhone 6s are minimal
less than 10 as of last week we'll put
it this way every phone is susceptible
to some degree offending under a certain
force however aluminum phones in
particular don't have the ability to
bounce back quite as well as say plastic
basic science will tell you that
through normal usage our unit shows no
signs of any warping or bending of any
sort internally Apple has added and
upgraded a few things like the new a8
chip which is a 1.4 gigahertz dual-core
cycle-on CPU and power vrg x64 50
quad-core GPU and also tweaked some of
the storage options confusingly leaving
16 gigabytes dropping 32 and adding 128
for power users it still has just one
gigabyte of RAM and an 8 megapixel
camera though the 6 plus comes with
optical image stabilization and the
battery is much larger this time to
offset the new display size 11 point 1
watt hours or 2915 millionth hours Apple
also introduced NFC for Apple pay and
Wi-Fi a total ever is the biggest
upgrade of all at 5.5 inches in 1080p
resolution the IPS LCD is in line with
most other flagship displays it bears an
acceptable pixel density of 401 pixels
per inch and comes with extra vibrant
colors high contrast and a very wide
brightness range that said it does air a
little on the warm side still it's a
gorgeous display that is perfectly
suited for all sorts of media
consumption
it's what Apple did or didn't do to take
advantage of that space that leaves us
most perplexed and that brings us to
software the iPhone 6 plus ships of the
brand-new iOS 8 we've covered it in
detail multiple times now over the
course of several videos visually not
much has changed since last year's major
UI overhaul control center is a little
cleaner and you may notice some minor
differences here and there but for all
intents and purposes it looks the same
most of the changes are behind the
scenes like extensibility which allows
third-party integration in various parts
of the OS when sharing a photo or a
webpage there are more options than ever
before included in the stock share menu
you can toggle specific services off or
on and rearrange them based on your
needs third-party keyboards maybe one of
the most requested features of all in
the keyboard settings you can select
which keyboards are active and the order
they appear you can even disable the
stock iOS keyboard while gesture typing
on an iPhone is nice we found that the
overall third-party keyboard experience
is jerky at best third-party apps can
also now display information in
Notification centers today page most of
these widgets are simply news feeds or
general information for
certain apps but which is like Evernote
and cheat sheet provide a certain
utility not previously found on iOS
other improvements include healthkit
family sharing for sharing app store
napkins purchases across up to six
accounts improved spotlight searches
with wikipedia cards or movie info from
IMDB Shazam song recognition from Siri
and hands-free Siri activation while
charging as far as specific software for
the sheer size of the iPhone 6 plus
Apple did almost nothing to take
advantage of the extra display space an
extra row of icons was added to the
homescreen the entire UI now rotates a
full 360 degrees Apple also included
reach ability which we haven't found
very helpful and some applications
display in a multi pane view but there
are no software features included that
truly make use of the 5.5 inch display
iOS 8 has the potential to be one of the
most impressive software updates from
Apple possibly ever don't get us wrong
it's still the same iOS we know and love
and third-party support is nice but
Apple failed to capitalize in some areas
and over-promised in others if anything
I OS 8 feels like a rushed product the
upshot is that the performance is
seemingly unaffected iOS 8 on the 6 plus
is as fluid as ever opening apps zooming
scrolling switching apps and everything
else is snapping and extremely smooth
everything from unlocking the phone with
touch ID to launching the camera happens
in an instant and we have yet to
experience any lag performance is
top-notch gaming on the larger 1080p
display is more comfortable and
enjoyable than before and it never skips
a beat one of the most surprising and
impressive aspects of this phone is its
loud speaker positioned along the bottom
edge it isn't the most ideal location
seeing as it's easily blocked and muted
with the palm of your hand however it
has some punch to it it's plenty loud
and has a surprisingly full sound
in that same vein speakerphone quality
was great we had no trouble hearing
colors even in very noisy environments
that said regular call quality was more
muddy than we would have expected we'd
call it mediocre at best data speeds on
the other hand have been great on
Verizon Wireless here in the Piedmont
Triad of North Carolina also great is
battery life we were a little worried
the extra display could affect the
stamina if Apple didn't properly scale
the battery inside it did we have no
trouble whatsoever in lasting a full day
on heavy usage on days of lighter usage
we were able to last well into a second
day of usage on a single charge for more
detail on battery life be sure to check
out the full review on the pocket now
site we're quite pleased with the camera
as well it's still 8 megapixels but
that's perfectly okay shots and full
daylight managed to capture tons of
detail and the pictures are vibrant yet
accurate contrast is great and there's
even a nice D focusing on close-up shots
at the very least pictures are a little
cool but the new built-in photo editor
works wonders on photos with optical
image stabilization we figured low-light
shots would be noticeably better not so
at least not initially low-light photos
turned out just like before
muddy muted oil paintings the 6 plus
seems to capture more light at the
expense of detail despite its Hardware
stabilization however slide your finger
up just a hair to bump the exposure
level and your low-light shots might
turn out even better we did so - some
success in several scenarios overall the
camera on the 6 plus doesn't disappoint
it's a little upsetting that OAS doesn't
dramatically improve night shots but
we've been very pleased with most
pictures we've taken with the iPhone 6
plus and trust me that's a lot of photos
and all the iPhone 6 plus is exactly
what we imagined it would be nothing
more than an oversized iPhone and while
Apple did little to take advantage of
that extra space it made up for it in
other areas like speaker quality battery
life and even performance if you're
willing to take the plunge on a 5.5 inch
phone well not for everyone you might be
surprised by how useful the extra screen
actually is the phone is perfect for
anyone who watches tons of video plays
lots of games excessively texts or IMS
and browses the web this is a phone that
provides extra screen for
doing more and for that we'd say it
delivers quite well once again Ann
