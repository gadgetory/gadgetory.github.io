hundred comments every day sometimes a
thousand and we try our best to respond
to as many as possible but it's kind of
difficult then we love a lot of your
comments so let's do something different
once again I'm hi Mary Vera this is
pocket now and this is our pocket out
daily recap for last week so last Monday
I asked you what should the pricing be
for the iphone 5c the news were about
the fact this was gonna be the cheap
iPhone and obviously everyone's gonna
try to be aggressive about it and we got
721 comments out of which for example
Keith axel Russell Rio says
realistically speaking 329 23 99 and
that would have been the perfect price
tag I feel that we now know exactly how
much it costs which is kind of
preposterous it's just too expensive to
be considered a budget entry-level phone
and I kind of think that Apple doesn't
see it that way if the price tech would
have been around 329 probably 350 would
have been compelling obviously
off-contract no giggling production says
Apple will never price anything low and
you've got a point right there
definitely Apple is not aggressive when
it comes to pricing some people thought
about that with the first-generation
iPad because of how tablets were
extremely expensive back then but it's
not the reality right now and heck saw 3
14 says is it my turn to bid one dollar
Bob and yeah come on down you've been
selected for the price is right and if
you don't know what I'm saying you're
probably too young to drink last Tuesday
asked you if you thought that Microsoft
always plans online nokia because well
it ended up buying it for a very very
cheap price when compared to even skype
so we've got better than 21 comments out
of which for example bradley launcher
says Elop was a trojan sent from
microsoft to destroy nokia mission
accomplished and um he said it another
youtuber says seven billion is a lot of
money to you and me but for company's
largest nokia that is nothing nokia got
ripped off by microsoft and i do believe
so i mean think about how much money
Microsoft paid for skype skype which
doesn't have an assembly that doesn't
have hardware doesn't build anything
skype is just a software product that's
an idea nokia is
the biggest smartphone maker in history
in the past and now it's pretty much a
seven billion dollar company that's
owned by microsoft good point in video
fanatic Thirteen's imagines Microsoft
thinking oh no google bought motorola
how will we keep up ah we shall buy a
dying company as well my mom and no it
wasn't really a dying company they ended
up killing the company and then buying
it then last wednesday asked you if
you'd like the Galaxy Note 3 the Galaxy
Note 10.1 2014 or the galaxy gear
because Samsung had just had their
identity fuh and we already knew what
they were going to launch this fall and
so far for example we got 736 comments
Jake wood says I like the note 3 in the
note 10.1 the galaxy gear is kind of
gonna eat and too expensive and I mean
three hundred dollars for a SmartWatch
with a bad camera a small display and an
unproven concept I get your point it's
too expensive and my neon City says I
definitely like the design of the note 3
however it's just too large for me and
that's the case for a lot of people the
Galaxy Note lineup is not for everyone
it is a good thing to try out it's
always something great to try something
new I love the note 2 it's probably one
of my favorite bones but then again I've
got big hands and then PC dreddit Oh are
says I'm getting the note 3 and slapping
nova launcher on it and I'm good to go
and you clearly have never owned the
galaxy note before the S Pen is pretty
much unusable without touch with so
sorry to reveal this to you but nova
launcher won't do much for you yes a lot
of things will work but not really what
you would buy a note 3 4 then on
Thursday I asked you if you're still
considering a galaxy gear after some
restrictions that were revealed the news
were about the fact that the galaxy gear
will only work with Android 4.3 when
certain specific restrictions that are
pretty much based on galaxy phones and
their api's and so we got 367 comments
and one youtuber said absolutely not
it's not worth it i'd rather just get a
phone instead of it just buying a phone
companion smart watch and think about it
when you get the nexus 4 for two hundred
dollars two hundred dollars 250 for the
16 gig model which
still more affordable in the galaxy gear
it is pointless to have an accessory
that'll just save you three seconds to
pull your phone out of your pocket
that's my opinion as well definitely
great comment and Firestar pwns says I
never considered it because i have a
pebble and it's extremely overpriced and
you're right if you consider what the
prices for the pebble you consider with
the prices for the galaxy gear and yes
you get a color display here and you get
a camera that you're never gonna use um
yes I would definitely recommend that
you consider the pebble at least start
with the pebble see if it's something
that you need see if it does solve your
problems and then probably sell it on
ebay and get the galaxy gear ever you
want but so far I'm not sold mr. French
h21 says I'm still getting it it's
because I plan on getting a note 3
anyways LOL and if you're getting a note
3 it does make sense but you're not
getting any subsidy for the watch man
you've gotta have a lot of cash to buy
that thing hey you can notice I'm not a
fan of the gear sadly and then finally
on Friday I asked you if the Nexus 5
would be more attractive to you that
were adequately priced and have great
specific patient's because the Nexus
lineup has lately been more of a
pushover phone not really popular and
well we've got this device from LG at
the FCC that's clearly a nexus 5 and
it's got great specs we got 686 comments
out of which one youtuber set yes if
priced between 350 and 450 for me the
price range would be from 350 to
anything below four hundred dollars for
it to be a budget phone because that's
the way the Nexus lineup is sold
recently and aside from that it's going
to be sold without a contract most
likely and without a subsidy four
hundred dollars is already steep unless
again even if the specs are great if
they want to continue with that base
model of no subsidies four hundred
dollars is already a lot and then I'm
Doris Allah says I'm waiting for the
Nexus 5 and hope to keep the low price
for the device you know if the specs are
great and Google with their whole
subsidy of the google play store model
could figure it out they would really
really disrupt the market they would
drop the prices on almost every
smartphone in the market and yeah if
they would get carrier subsidies it
would be even better that's it for last
