another real camera review where if we
try to review our smartphone cameras in
the same way that we might test a
standalone camera today we're taking a
look at the cameras on the moto z2 force
we'll get part of the conclusion out
right now for those of you who are too
impatient or somehow can't figure out
how to skip to the end of a video but
this is a well-rounded and competent
smartphone shooter this year Motorola
opting for a dual-camera sensor
introduces a lot of really fun features
to the mix I'm happy to see that adding
these features has not gotten in the way
of a very streamlined and consumer
friendly app with that summary out of
the way if you're watching this video
you probably do care how this performs
in a variety of real-world situations so
let's kick this off with exposure
saturation and white balance these dual
sensors work in tandem for every photo
you take one is color the other is
black-and-white and that really helps
with clarity and contrast the z2 relies
on a really slick form of spot metering
which we'll talk about a little bit more
when we get to the autofocus section
largely wherever you drop that auto
focus indicator you're going to expose
properly for the subject that you're
trying to capture and I'm really happy
to see that this phone doesn't mind
delivering a dark background if there's
a high contrast situation like a white
flower and direct sunlight while most
smartphone cameras tend to overexpose
and the z2 isn't an exception to that
rule it does manage to walk a nicer
balance between these i popping vivid
images and really capturing the subject
that you're trying to focus for after
dropping the focus it was a coin flip
whether or not I felt I needed to adjust
the exposure further now what might get
in your way is the saturation we're not
over exposing images but we are really
pumping that color on almost all phones
this is usually fine for blues greens
Browns other earth tones but once we
start trekking into warmer colors we can
start to clip yellows and reds but
happily the white balance is mostly on
point for most of our setups we're
dealing with really warm California
sunlight and the v2 is playing with that
color information in a really pleasing
way subjects in shade can sometimes
present a challenge but this phone is
preventing the overall output from
looking too icy you can shift photos and
videos over to the black and white
sensor a native black and white image is
produced and that is a cool effect it's
a nice
high-quality image though I don't know
that it's so much better than taking a
really high-quality contrasting color
image and then just shifting it to black
and white in editing I'm a big fan of
getting up close to a subject I really
like macro shots pushing the camera to
its softest creamiest bouquet and here
the z2 is a somewhat mediocre performer
the minimum focusing distance is a
little further away than what I'd like
and these image sensors are a little on
the smaller side closer to an iPhone or
an LG g6
so we don't have the nicest softest
natural bouquet from the lens and sensor
and that's where software is going to
come in is the premiere feature for this
dual camera shooter is that these are
matched fields of view and this produces
by not Killer image data that the phone
can take to artificially blur the
backgrounds of your shots this is a
first-generation concept for Motorola
and unfortunately it kind of shows the
software effect is pretty aggressive and
no one's going to confuse this kind of
processing for natural lens depth of
field blur off of say an interchangeable
lens camera we're not dealing with a lot
of resolution so zoom performance is
about what you would expect for a 12
megapixel shooter at the far end of that
zoom we're blown up the image a lot so
there's a lot of image degradation
though I really like that the zoom
action is a swipe up through the camera
interface we're going to be talking
about the app later but there's a lot of
lumia inspiration on how Motorola laid
this software out low light and night
shots came out better than what I was
expecting this phone doesn't have
hardware image stabilization it's all
software processing like a lot of phones
in this space minus the pixel you do
have to hold on to your shot just a
little bit longer as the camera is
sampling image information but when you
do you end up with some really clear and
crisp exposures a blind rear camera
selfie in really low light conditions
was not difficult to pull off and the z2
is just fast enough to pull out some
good candid creeper shots discreetly
it's at night and in other high contrast
lighting situations that we can see
there is a little bit of lens flaring
but nothing overly destructive to the
frame but the main Achilles heel you'll
probably want to disable HDR when
shooting at night it's really hard
keeping the phone stable for a series of
exposures to layer up all that
information and speaking of high dynamic
range this is a good it's somewhat
inconsistent performer I've got a bunch
of shots where this one does a terrific
job of reining in
highlights and boosting shadow detail to
make sure you've got information across
the whole picture but I would say it was
about one out of five test shots where
this would just become a shadow
brightening mode and we would start
clipping highlights one of the most
difficult experiences to unpack on the
Moto z2 force is the focusing system
it functions unlike any other phone that
I've used in the past you slide this
little indicator around on your screen
and then that becomes an auto focus
target I really like how that functions
because you can set this in place and
then as you move the phone around that
auto focus target stays put but the
phone doesn't feel like it ever
completely locks if you move
significantly even though the indicators
staying put it will be refocusing based
on that target location and because this
target indicator responds to sliding
around on your screen it can sometimes
make an exposure adjustment a little bit
more difficult if you don't perfectly
nail the exposure slider you might slide
your auto focus indicator off of your
subject because of this difference in
how autofocus works we weren't able to
perform our normal autofocus speed test
you'll just have to take my word for it
now once you slide that indicator on
your subject the auto focus lock is
actually really snappy
selfie performance is solid if
unremarkable solid exposures considering
I'm playing in almost direct light
decent exposures when I move over to
shade and when we're indoors or in
low-light conditions that front-facing
flash actually does a really good job of
acting as a fill light you don't get
this harsh spotlight effect on the face
it just sort of helps boost all of the
light information in each shot
respectable 1080p video and some good
sound but I don't know that this would
be a top pick for those of you who are
trying to do some vlogging on the go
shifting back to the rear camera is
talking about video we capture a very
high quality UHD video using software
image stabilization a lot of the
exposure and saturation performance that
we saw with stills is going to be
mirrored and video though obviously we
don't get quite the same benefit from
both sensors working together one of the
most important aspects of discussing
video is of course image stabilization
how well does this phone minimize
handshake and twitches and jerkiness and
the z2 does a better-than-average job
considering there's no hardware to
smooth out your shot the thing about
software it's still pretty easy to
confuse this kind of processing
even when trying to hold still I had a
number of shots that just had funky
twitchy adjustments happening where the
phone didn't need to be trying to adjust
the scene software stabilization depends
on this really sophisticated crop and
pan but once we start increasing that
shutter speed each individual frame can
start to get really blurry and when
we're trying to crop and merge blurry
frames that's where we can get that hazy
image processing effect and this is made
worse by one of my biggest pet peeves
when it comes to smartphone video
variable frame rate there's a hard
toggle between 30 frames per second
video and 24 frames per second video
when lighting conditions get dark
shifting from 30 frames per second to 24
frames per second means we get a longer
shutter speed from one thirtieth of a
second to one twenty-fourth of a second
and that's great for soaking up a little
more light but that also means you have
a longer shutter to introduce more blur
from moving the phone around looking at
some slow-motion footage we've got
options for 120 frames per second 1080p
and 240 frames per second 720p I'm going
to make the recommendation that you just
stick with the 1080p slow motion video
the frame rate and time reduction on the
720p mode is phenomenal and this is one
of the best phones that I've reviewed
for not dropping frames but there's so
much image compression happening that
this just looks kind of blurry and messy
where the 1080p does a respectable job
of sort of balancing out those two modes
and lastly we should talk about the app
and performance this phone overall is a
screamer
every interaction I have with it is
snappy and efficient and really the only
concern I have with the z2 taking it out
into the field is the smaller battery
it's pretty easy to drain this thing if
you're shooting a lot of photos and a
lot of video plus if you're a moto fan
that twist of the wrist to launch the
camera app is just a fun interaction to
have a nice gesture and it seems to work
a bit more reliably than say the volume
rocker activation on an LG g6 this might
be sacrilegious to some and a lot of
people are going to say this is just
copycat territory but Motorola has come
closest to delivering the app layout
that I loved on Lumia handsets those old
Nokia camera phones keeping the main
camera interface beautifully simple but
delivering a manual mode with these
great sliders that you can swipe through
very easily the buttons are large the
slider
easy targets to hit so this is
definitely a step up from some of the
other manual modes I criticized like
they're really fiddly sliders on an HTC
the only place where this app falters is
in the one new feature that dual camera
sensors can offer and that's in the
depth of field mode I don't know what's
going on with the image processing here
but once you activate this mode your
viewfinder becomes a slideshow the frame
rate drops like crazy in a way Motorola
is just working harder than they need to
here and it's not a great experience but
I rambled on enough let's wrap this up
with the final conclusion on the Moto Z
to force camera this phone is lean this
phone is quick it gets to the point and
for the most part I really enjoyed my
time shooting on it I think a lot of
people are going to appreciate software
that gets out of the user's way and
focuses on just the core photography
aspect of capturing an image or shooting
some video and of course some concerns
with video performance especially as we
start getting into lower light
situations
but I don't think people will be overly
bothered by image degradation until we
really start pushing this phone to its
limits the final verdict I don't know
that this is a better camera than what
we got last year on the g-force it feels
like a tangent a way to introduce some
more fun features with a few compromises
on things like Hardware image
stabilization I think most people are
going to be pleased good - very good
performance across a variety of shooting
scenarios and it's just another example
of the built-in cameras on Motorola
phones doing a pretty handy job of
outperforming the Hasselblad moto mod as
