shows that were actually expecting a
different screen resolution one more
surprises everyone with yet another
gorgeous one plus four ET and some
amazon alexa love is dis reach huawei
hardware I'm hi Mary vera and I usually
celebrate two days of the week one
obviously Friday's two is when I can get
a haircut this is pocket out daily the
official loose today began with deals
for those of you have thought that the
microsoft windows 10 mobile was dead
it's not what companies are trying
really hard to kill it if you're in the
market for an extremely cheap bone
Cricket Wireless has two Lumia 650 for a
dollar I did not forget any zeros or any
numbers they are offering the phone for
a dollar even if you don't need a phone
okay this is about that time where you
actually want to gift the phone to
somebody you know even if that would be
a terrible gift sadly and speaking of
deals up next is verizon as the company
has just picked up the new product red
iPhones in addition to the new iPads and
where the deals fall is actually not on
these products but in the fact that you
can actually swap them for whatever
current products you have the company is
offering some really good deals and
obviously it's not a one by one swap
you'll have to pay something but they
are offering some compelling choices you
can learn while description and say
hello to the new one plus 3t in midnight
black thank you 1 plus for listening
thank you for not just making this a
French exclusive I am a big fan of black
bones and this one is gorgeous the cool
part is that this is an exclusive 128
gigabyte variant and you're paying 479
dollars for it so yeah the reason why
it's more expensive than the rest of the
one plus 3t variance is because you only
get the higher tier variant in storage
but still I find it extremely worth it
for a product that has better
specifications and some of the current
flexes that have already launched this
year and one of the very interesting
teasers from Huawei back at CES was the
fact that its mate 9 was going to run
amazon
lexa we were really excited about it it
is already available for the main
tonight in the United States it is an
LTA update my units still haven't
received it you can bet that i fired it
up immediately to see if i had the
update but it's not very yet and verily
you will have to launch the application
and actually enable it to be able to
listen to you etc we will report back as
soon as we learn more please OTA and
finally the very hot uses they have to
do with the samsung galaxy s 8 yes it's
back of the hottest news it's got three
things to report on number one leaked
images that show us different color
options all three great the most
interesting is actually the fact that we
noticed some accessories and we're not
even going to dive into the expensive
battery pack I don't even care about
that what I do care about is this
interesting dock that apparently will
allow you to use your Galaxy S eight
could it be like Microsoft continuum
meaning like you can use it as your
computer user monitor your keyboard it
makes all the sense in the world and
apparently does dark cast all the
capability to provide that even better
apparently we're getting different
screen resolutions it's not what we are
used to seeing apparently we're getting
20 960 x 1440 which is wqhd plus this is
even more than the LG G six that's 28 80
x 1440 I get lost in these numbers but
even more interesting is the fact that
you can actually scale it down to
improve your performance this is
something that I noticed on the nougat
update of the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge
show this is all great but it leads me
to the question of the day we're just a
few days away from the samsung galaxy SI
it has always served to get you crazy
over it or are you skeptical in my case
after using the g6 it is going to be
really hard for me to move away from
that phone this s8 has to be amazing I
can't wait to hear about it leave us a
comment down below we looked into your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
if you want to get to literally over for
the video was filmed follow what I'm
talking out I've common hit that
subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one you also follow me
on Twitter hi nan discovery that I run
into the ground Matt hi Matt we better
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am hi Mary thanks
