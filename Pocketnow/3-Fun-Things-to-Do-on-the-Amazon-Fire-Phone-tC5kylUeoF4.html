now in this video is about the Amazon
fire phone but before we get to that you
guys know I like to pretend to be active
sometimes well did you know that Sony
makes an action cam for action II
environments I didn't know that until
they told me and now I'm telling you
check out this footage from the Sony
action cam the deal with Sony's action
cam is you can take it pretty much
anywhere from the halfpipe to halfway
out to see whether you're an extreme
surfer like these pro athletes or more
of a relaxed paddler rapids to
racetracks to bike trails to the slopes
the action cams image stabilization live
view remote and GPS combined with its
full HD resolution to make it one heck
of an extreme camera if you want to see
more action cam footage click the link
right here or the one down in the
description below whichever one works
for you head on over to the action cam
YouTube page and toss them a subscribe
while you're over there seriously go
ahead and do it right now we'll still be
here when you get back I promise
if you're just returning welcome back
and thank you for your patience let's
talk about the Amazon fire phone
Amazon's fire phone is something we're
still getting to know in the pocket now
Labs and our full review is coming soon
well it's not a perfect smartphone by
any means one thing that's getting lost
in all the press so far is that the fire
phone can be an awful lot of fun in a
lot of different ways here's three of
them Amazons fire OS uses side sliding
panels to add extensibility to most
screens and while you're perfectly
within your rights to use a bezel flick
with a thumb to trigger those there's a
better way a slightly tougher way to get
used to but a way funner way a way that
we call flick that wrist this is similar
gesture to the camera launch twist on
the Moto X but here it serves to deploy
those side panels it's reasonably
reliable once you get the hang of the
wrist action and while it's not exactly
more convenient you'd be surprised how
quickly you start to like it and how
soon you miss it when you're using
another phone in that same boat is the
tilt to scroll gesture in the fire
phones browser
something that manufacturers have been
trying to make work since 2008 if not
before the fire phone's Hardware finally
makes that possible here in a deployment
that works surprisingly well most of the
time and this one is a bit more handy
you feel pardon the pun because it can
make one-handed use that much easier the
fire phone's Firefly feature has gotten
some flack for coming off like a fancy
way to shop for things on Amazon and not
much else and while that is its
principal purpose it's also got some
cool secondary features you can let it
listen to basically anything you're
watching and in seconds it pegs the show
and gives you links to buy it learn more
about it and if you've downloaded
third-party apps that interface with
Firefly you get more info like its
Rotten Tomatoes rating the same goes for
music which Firefly identifies almost as
quickly totally eliminating the need to
download an app like Shazam it's also
really quick to launch with just a long
press on the side key
this last point might seem like a
cop-out but doing almost anything with
the fire phones dynamic perspective
display is usually more fun than on a
conventional panel we're not necessarily
talking about the obvious fun uses like
in games though that's a good time to
really the unexpected fun here comes
when you can just tilt the phone
slightly sideways to reveal things like
the status bar up top or descriptors on
the side menu or call times in the call
log or review scores in Firefly you can
set some of that stuff to be persistent
if you want but confining it to a glance
keeps the screen cleaner longer
something we used to love about Windows
Phone in particular and finally Amazon
has also loaded plenty of lockscreen
depth effects to make sure the unlock
experience doesn't get stale so those
four cameras on the front are constantly
justifying their existence
Amazon's first smartphone is a learning
experience for consumer and manufacturer
both and we'll delve more deeply into
that in our full review coming soon for
now we hope you've enjoyed a peek at
what amazon has made possible by
thinking outside their cardboard
delivery boxes and stay tuned for more
on the fire phone here and at
pocketnow.com until next time this has
been michael fisher with PocketNow
thanks for watching and we'll see you on
the next one
