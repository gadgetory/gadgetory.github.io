reality headset for its galaxy lineup
leaks point to Apple fixing a ton of
iphone bugs with iOS 7.1 point2 and
amazon wants to sweeten the pot for your
Memorial Day deals I'm hi Mary Mehta and
this week is kind of a week in my
country so if I go in my a for any
particular reason you kind of know why
it is this is parking out daily the
official news today are about Amazon and
its deals for Memorial Day weekend which
is happening very soon and obviously the
company is already taking advantage of
that and using their Amazon Android app
store to give you five different
applications for free which are not that
hot if you look at them but then again
you get ten dollars in credit once you
download these applications and judging
by the fact that most applications cost
the book just get the deals I mean
they're kind of worth it up next let's
talk about HTC as we've heard rumors of
the company working on a plastic variant
of the HTC One m8 and a lot of people
have dubbed this phone to be the ace the
One m8 ace yes I know and in this
particular case we've got some more
credible leaks again from efflux and
this time we do see large speaker
grilles we do see that the deaf center
of the camera in the back of the One m8
is gone it's pretty much just the flash
hole now and let's see hopefully this
phone will have a market Leah better
camera two up next let's talk about
Apple as the company is apparently going
to push iOS 7.1 point to be for WWDC
2014 which is happening just a couple of
weeks from now and the reason why is
because we've got two very famous bugs
one has to do with the encryption of
attachments on email and the other one
with I message for those of you that
don't know if you switch from iOS to
Android right now some of your messages
will be gone for those other people that
are writing you through I message as
apparently the phone can't detect that
you're no longer using an iphone so
apparently those bugs will be fixed and
aside from that hopefully we get better
battery life because it's terrible now
one very odd thing that Apple did like
four years ago was purchased the
exclusive rights for our company's
product it was liquid metal
and yes there are no products out there
from Apple that actually used its
technology except the sim card objectors
from the iphone and even though we still
don't know what Apple wants to do with
this the company has just renewed the
contract for one more year so we are
assuming that the company is still
planning to do something with the metal
hopefully bring us a product a lighter
iphone a lighter Mac whatever the case
may be I don't see Apple buying into
this just because and finally for the
very interesting news of the day one of
the cool things about Samsung is that
these guys take R&amp;amp;D seriously if not
asked the Galaxy Note lineup rumors
haven't if the company is working on a
virtual reality headset for the galaxy
lineup and apparently this part there's
already in the testing and it will work
with compatible galaxy phones and
tablets like the Galaxy Note 3 the
galaxy s5 and the idea is to give you a
more immersive gaming experience
interesting apparently this will be a
wired connection to your phone not
really sure exactly how this will work
but obviously it wants to compete with
the oculus rift but that leaves you the
question of the day um will you buy an
accessory like this a virtual reality
you know headset for you to play your
android games because in my particular
case honestly I I don't know I don't
feel that I want to I don't find it
compelling but leave us a comment down
