welcome back to another episode of the
Android power user a while back we at
pocket now we're faced with the
challenge our Android articles were
getting longer our videos were getting
ridiculously long we looked to see what
the root cause of that was and we found
out it was because there a lot of
different types of people who come to
pocketnow.com we have some people who
are power users and in all honesty put
me to shame you guys know your crap and
while the comments that you have left
fort for me for the fellow android users
and the whole community thank you so
much you've added so much to the
conversation to those of you who aren't
or weren't Android power users before
the series who are just coming to learn
the basics and kind of know what we were
talking about that's exactly why we made
this series we wanted to be able to
shorten those videos and articles to
just talk about the neat stuff the cool
stuff but we still wanted to include
regular everyday Android users and we
didn't want to do that just by kind of
glossing over and speaking above their
heads instead we wanted to lift
everybody up to the same level or at
least build a solid foundation upon
which we could do all kinds of cool
things down the road that's what the
Android power user was it actually grew
a little bit longer than we wanted it to
we had quite a few very very helpful
suggestions for topics that came in from
honestly you from all of you now of
course we didn't cover all of your topic
suggestions don't worry we still have
all of those suggestions there sitting
right there on my spreadsheet and as
soon as they can be addressed whether
that's in an upcoming article or an
upcoming video I will get to them if at
all possible thank you for sending them
in thank you for participating so you're
thinking where's the topic right well
the topic is we're done you made it you
now have all of the basics all of the
core understanding and all
foundation that you need to be an
Android power user you've made it
through thank you for being part of the
process now in the future when we're
doing articles when we're doing videos
instead of going back to the basics and
talking about routing or talking about
how to do one of the things that we've
covered in an Android power user video
we're just going to link right back to
it so all of you who have lifted up your
knowledge you can now have shorter
articles shorter videos and more of them
so we can handle and tackle more of the
really cool and interesting things
that's why we did it that's where we are
and we want to thank you for being part
of that process the future wow there's a
lot of stuff out there and we don't have
eyes everywhere so now all of you people
who were Android power users before the
series and all of our new friends who
are power users after the series you're
going to be our eyes and ears on the
ground when you see something you think
it's cool you think it's neat you think
it's amazing head over to pocketnow.com
there's a tip us button click on that
send us a tip if you want to talk to me
directly go to any one of my articles
click on my name you can send an email
it comes straight back to me I can't
answer everybody but I do my best to get
back to everyone that I possibly can let
us know what's cool and what you see out
there so we can research it and we can
share it with all of our friends here at
pocketnow.com it's been a wonderful ride
so far and we've just made it up and
down that first big hill the roller
coaster the rest of the ride is still to
come thanks for watching make sure you
subscribe so you don't miss out on
anything that we've got coming down the
pike for pocket now signing off for the
Android power user I'm Joe Levi
