plastic case but is that all there is to
the vanguard of Apple's new mid-range
iPhone category more importantly should
you consider buying one let's find out
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our video review of the Apple
iPhone 5c so in breaking out of its
five-year pattern of just recycling last
year's iPhone as the new quote budget
iPhone Apple seems to have felt the need
to make a statement with the 5c gone is
the finely crafted aluminum of last
year's iPhone 5 it's been replaced on
the 5c with a glossy polycarbonate shell
stretched over a steel frame that means
the phone feels rigid and robust and
it'll probably hold up to scratches
better over time than its metal
predecessors but it also feels cheaper
in the hand with skin oil and
fingerprints sticking readily to the
plastic body and of course the big
advantage to the plastic is you can now
customize your iPhones color beyond
black and white options and Apple offers
a line of soft touch covers if you're
looking to cover up the glossy body
without completely obscuring the color
you've chosen under the hood the
situation is much more familiar the 5c
gets its processing power from Apple's
a6
system on a chip backed up by a gig of
ram and either 16 or 32 gigs of on-board
storage in keeping with Apple's norms
that storage is non expandable and the
battery a 5.7 4 watt hour pack is
non-removable up front the display is a
vibrant IPS panel that boasts excellent
color and pixel density but it's four
inch diagonal size while convenient for
one-handed use is really starting to
feel small amid a sea of competitors all
of which feature larger displays none of
this is new or exciting necessarily the
iPhone 5 sees hardware story isn't that
of a trailblazer
but there's an awful lot of excitement
on the software side the iPhone 5c ships
with Apple's new iOS 7 which brings the
first major overhaul to the platform's
UI in its six year history we've
reported pretty extensively on iOS 7's
new interface so we won't go into too
much detail suffice to say if you were
comfortable with the way old iPhones
worked you'll feel right at home here
and if you felt the old platform has
grown bloated and stale you'll
appreciate the revised look of the new
build beyond just aesthetics our
favorite additions are the control
center which fills a big gap in
functionality between iOS and Android
and the revised Notification Center
who's today's screen serves as a pretty
handy virtual assistant overall iOS 7
manages to straddle the line between
consistency and new features very well
here it manages to be bold and beautiful
without losing the responsiveness that's
earned the iPhone it's it just works
reputation we tested the iPhone 5c over
the course of seven days in the suburban
Greater Boston and rural New York areas
network coverage and speeds on AT&amp;amp;T 3G
and 4G networks were solid as we've come
to expect and voice quality is OK not
outstanding but ok
loudspeaker performance is more
impressive the bottom firing speaker
kicking out a lot of sound and apple's
revised ear pod design isn't the most
comfortable thing ever but it gets the
job done and if you're planning to use
the iPhone is your personal media player
which you should as you might expect
it's an excellent iPod replacement just
try to keep your movie watching and
audio streaming to a minimum the iPhone
5c s smallish battery won't last power
users through a full day you'll want to
invest in an external power pack or
carry a charger around if you're
planning to run the 5c into the ground
on a daily basis the 8 megapixel camera
around back is the same one found on
last year's iPhone 5 and it still does
fine but camera technology has advanced
so profoundly in the past year that it's
now firmly out
it still delivers excellent photos in
the right light but there's a little
more digital noise than we've come to
expect and the lack of optical image
stabilization means low light
performance suffers compared to phones
packing newer cameras like the HTC One
Lumia 1020 and LG g2 now the five C's
camera is solid don't get us wrong it's
just not nearly as impressive as those
higher-end alternatives in short it's a
mid-range camera delivering better than
average results for its weight class the
finally general performance by which we
mean the usual day-to-day usage is
predictably outstanding the phone is
fast and stable and it executes almost
every task with the calm competence
we've come to expect from new Apple
products that's the reason people buy
iPhones they may not outperform the
competition on the spec sheet and they
may not offer the glitz and frosting of
more bombastic devices but they do the
best job of providing a well-rounded and
very consistent smartphone experience
generating the quote surprise and
delight that Apple has long prided
itself on eliciting the iPhone 5c may
not be the most surprising smartphone
out there but it's performance is sure
to delight most consumers PocketNow
gives it an 8 point 4 out of 10

newer iPhone 5s we have those comparison
