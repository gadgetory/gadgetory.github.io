reinventing its approach to design the
company sort of hinted to the you ultra
being just a stepping stone into a
broader result for 2017 and today we
finally get the opportunity to tell you
more about it I'm happy that I would
pocket now and this is the HTC u 11
remember the time when HTC launched the
One Maxx to complement the One m7 well
don't think of the U 11 as a complement
to you ultra as the U 11 is really the
company's flagship for 2017 sure they
are visually similar following the U
designation but 11 is to confirm that
this is the successor to last year's 10
u 11 continues with the company's new
liquid design mentality which consists
of 3d form glass a very complex process
that came as a result of a collaboration
with corning the result is a set of
curves on the glass that allow them to
blend with the aluminum almost
seamlessly at a glance and in the hand
you can't really tell where the glass
ends and the aluminum trim begins the
effect is striking and the feel is even
better the color is more result of a
vaporize deposition process to achieve a
very reflective effect which is
obviously not camera friendly a more of
a fan of this amazing silver option you
can also get the phone in sapphire blue
ice white and brilliant black the U 11
has also been fitted with all the bells
and whistles that it needs to compete
with other flagships they have a
snapdragon 835 processor met with 4 gigs
of ram and 64 gigs of expandable storage
there's also IP 67 water and dust
resistance something we've been waiting
to see from HTC for a while
we have a standard 16 by 9 5.5 inch
Super LCD 5 capable of quad HD
resolution the same punchy color that we
praised from the new ultra below the
display we also have the standard
fingerprint home button and capacitive
keys meaning those 5.5 inches on the
panel are all for content consumption
when compared to other devices the u11
is actually smaller than the iPhone 7
plus but obviously larger than the LG G
six Samsung Galaxy S 8 and the HTC 10
the camera offers some very interesting
changes that we cannot wait to test this
is an HTC ultrapixel 3 sensor that's now
nearly flushed to the chassis to achieve
this the ultra pixels are now of 1.4
microns and the company also upgraded
the aperture to F 1.7 the selfie camera
is also unchanged at least in what it
can do when compared to the new ultra
meaning you have 16 megapixels that can
become for ultra pixels even though this
is actually a very different process
that we'll discuss in the review
powering the show is HTC Sense on top of
Android 7.1.1 where we maintain that
same mentality of applications not being
duplicated visually it mimics a lot of
what we saw with the new ultra but with
the boost of version 7.1.1
which should mean we should have better
battery life thanks to the enhancements
of the latest and greatest version of
Android now there are a few things that
make this phone really unique for those
of you wondering exactly what you'll be
squeezing from this phone well that's
because there are pressure sensors
hidden under the aluminium trim which
enabled two extra buttons that are
programmable squeeze lightly to trigger
one squeeze harder to trigger the other
you can actually control the pressure
sensitivity of these the trick is really
cool and one I'm really looking forward
to giving a try for my personal needs
and for those of you complaining about
the death of the headphone jack there's
actually trick number two yes if you
want the headphone jack there is going
to be a bundled adapter but the u11
brings the same for you sonic
microphones that we praised from the new
ultra this allows HTC to provide active
noise cancellation to the bundled use
sonic headphones saving you the need to
invest in very expensive active noise
cancellation headphones that are also
very bulky
obviously we also have HTC's boomsound
HiFi stereo speakers for everything else
overall the HTC u 11 is a lot more than
what I was honestly expecting at the
briefing everything that we've wanted to
see from an HTC flagship is finally here
and we just can't wait to give it a try
