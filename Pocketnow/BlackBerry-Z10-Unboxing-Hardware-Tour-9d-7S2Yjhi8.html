with about as authentic and unboxing
experience as you can get this is the
blackberry z10 or z10 if you prefer just
got it literally two minutes ago from
the folks at research in motion and
we're going to pop open the box show you
what's inside i do not have a spec sheet
handy this is just a very quick and
dirty z10 unboxing look at that pretty
cool and there the device sits amidst a
field of imitation velvet or might be
real velvet i'm not sure this is quite
an interesting presentation it's very
very nice we can see the material there
like that right out of the box this
device I've just recently learned does
have a removable battery that's probably
not news to some of you but I was in the
dark about it so that's awesome it's
very light to check it out of here the
BlackBerry business card out of here as
well we'll take this insert out and see
what comes in the box I'm getting
started guides here the usual USB cable
we have air blackberry yes it is an
1,800 milliamp hour battery device also
comes with headphones in the box which
will be a big big array for some of you
and some of you won't care but that's
something we don't always see anymore oh
and in addition to a chamois a
blackberry carrying pouch I forgot about
these completely and that is wonderful
to see again and finally where it's just
a wall wart there nothing else in the
box
so first we'll go ahead and prop the
removable battery cover off speaking of
things you don't see on devices every
day go ahead and pop this battery right
in there battery cover is thin plastic
which we're used to seeing on some other
devices
hopefully I'm doing this right and I'm
not going to break my brand new review
device and see if we can get any audio
on the screen protector peel off that we
like to do back protector rather there's
a textured back
it looks like rigid plastic but it is
actually not it has almost a soft touch
quality to it that squeaks your one of
your fingers on it that's interesting
pretty cool and the screen protector on
the front
there it is the device is already
powering on so just a quick tour on the
right hand side volume up volume down
what looks like power standby in the
center there which is very interesting
nothing else on the right hand side down
on the bottom nothing
blackberry is concealed excuse me the
microphone is concealed under the black
right brand there up to the side
microUSB board another port power
standby up top noise cancelling
microphone we're assuming in a three and
a half millimeter headphone jack and on
the back here is that primary camera the
blood a new BlackBerry brand no longer
research in motion but in fact
blackberry and of course we have power
there's our front-facing camera the
flashing red light so you can't see it
is under the glass there as well that's
a quick look at the hardware the
BlackBerry z10 going to have a lot more
thoughts when I have a little bit more
time to collect myself but this is just
minutes after receiving our review
device from recess from not research
promotion from blackberry here in
Toronto lovely but rainy Toronto its
pocket now stay tuned for a lot more
