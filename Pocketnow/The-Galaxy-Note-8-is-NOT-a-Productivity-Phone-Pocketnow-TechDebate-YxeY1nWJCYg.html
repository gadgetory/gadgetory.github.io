where we examine controversial
technology topics and you decide the
outcome I'm Juan Carlos Pagnell senior
editor pocketnow.com joined this outing
by the man the myth the legend mr. high
made Iveta out on the East Coast how's
it going out there sir I'm doing good
but I'm going to need to find you
another introduction because I'm already
been the madam the man the myth and the
legend for how long you know it but it
works for you right I mean this is this
is a good moniker for you I feel so this
this week we've got in light of
samsung's upcoming announcement we're
taking a look at the father of the
phablet and this debate premise is the
Galaxy Note is not a Productivity phone
now do you agree with that premise do
you disagree with that premise remember
your answer because that's going to
impact the voting at the end of this
video I will be attacking this premise
mr. high mighty betta you are going to
be supporting this premise and just in
the interest of continuity because you
attacked the last premise I'm going to
be going first on this on this debate -
to support my lovely note here and to
defend it against this terrible terrible
clickbait tea title that we've created
for it so it's totally age before beauty
this time please go ahead
you know what I'll support that because
I'm younger and you're very pretty so
there you go
good I've got the time already excellent
we got two minutes on the clock
yes I do all righty let me know when
it's safe to go three two one now
multimedia phones smartphones screens
are getting really big but very few
devices do a good job of justifying why
we need to use both hands to operate our
mobile technology I mean you know some
of the more outlandish giant screen
creations here but one phone has
consistently been ahead of that
discussion and it's the phone that
started off the big-screen trend that is
the Galaxy Note now we have an excellent
reason to use
two hands when operating a mobile device
and that largely comes down to the s-pen
I know there have been a bunch of you
know manufacturers Steve Jobs your
fingers the perfect way to interact with
digital media but there are times you
need finer point control than the fat
pad of your finger you're trying to
scrub through text and you can't get to
the beginning or the end of a word you
need to cut images out of a website or
you need to draw or you need to doodle
you need to edit this is where S Pen
really shines and it's the signature
feature for productivity for a vast
majority of people who need to get work
done on the go I myself I'm a video
professional I need to cut video upload
and the note represents maybe probably
the best all-in-one package for that I
can shoot video from the camera record
off of the mics or off of a headset and
then when I'm going through my video
editing app I have the best possible
implementation for navigating my video
timeline this is a second more unique
experience that only the note can create
and on that I believe I have made my
case and I will see the rest of my time
to mr. Rivera oh my god I get an extra
20 minutes 20 seconds you're so nice
okay I'm very I'm very cost-efficient
there now for for your defense of the
premise mr. Rivera I will be timing you
on my Galaxy Note 5 I love you know
looking at that that's a blue important
no it's the white one it's not as pretty
all right so are you ready to go I've
got two minutes on the clock please go
ahead all right we are starting in three
two one
so the biggest question is what is the
size of your demographic one how many
people actually edit video on the go or
actually sign documents on the go which
is actually the only productivity
feature that I was ever able to use on a
Galaxy Note so bear in mind I've been
using the Galaxy Note since version 2 I
have been a big fan of the note for a
couple of things that have gotten lost
ever since the Galaxy Note 5 for example
I didn't really want a large phone I
wanted better battery life and back in
the day you would only get better
battery life from a gal
note the other reason really it was a
really cumbersome phone like it had the
first of all the size was an ergonomic
at all and then the second problem with
the Galaxy Note is because it includes a
lot of productivity software and this I
believe is the key the key is the
productivity software Samsung does a
really good job with their apps the big
problem is these apps don't talk to
anything and so I would always have this
problem where I would start jotting
notes on the Galaxy Note but then these
s notes would not sync with any services
or when they did start syncing with
services like Evernote at some point and
that actually lasted for very little the
problem was that they wouldn't sink
backwards like it wasn't a two-way sink
I couldn't start something in my
computer continuing on the note and so
you know it just completely defeated the
purpose because very little services
actually took advantage of the software
I guess the only service that right now
it takes advantage of the software is
actually Microsoft tools like for
example OneNote is able to take
advantage of some of these doodles and
scribbles but this actually only started
happening until the galaxy note5
and again the experience wasn't really
the same I'm not saying that there is
30-second warning
I'm not saying that there's anything
wrong with the option of having the
s-pen I consider it great to have it
there I consider it an added value I
just don't feel that it helps me beat
any better than how fast I can type on a
keyboard so I'm definitely not going to
be scribbling notes that's just one
thing that I'm never going to be doing
and that's just my perspective I feel
that it's not more productive than your
standard smartphone except for the fact
that the S Pen is something nice to have
that's me and clear two seconds to spare
excellent all right those are great
points now it's time for a rebuttal
we're going to clock up a minute on the
clock so that we can respond to the
talking points from each competitor in
this debate
mr. Rivera do you have a minute on the
timer for me sir yes I do sir three
actually one go I'm really glad you
brought up demographics because it's
something that I wanted to touch on is I
feel fine point control can benefit
pretty much anyone now no one's going to
say that the the note is an all rounder
phone this is a top-tier expensive
premium productivity device but if
you're a creative professional find
point control is where it's at and most
phones can get most things done for most
people but if you really want to take
your game up and not interact
with documents like when you mentioned
Microsoft services you're going through
an Excel spreadsheet that's really
tricky on the pad of your finger when
you click an alarming red sheet and then
also interacting with those individual
cells I will concede probably not the
best battery life but if you want the
best horsepower Vanguard features fine
point control stylus is the way to go
and the note is the only game in town
all right 15 seconds to spare you're
good man Wow all right I'm trying to
keep us on point here you know and when
I'm on point really pun unintended but
pun achieved okay let me get a minute on
the clock for you sir are you ready to
reply for your one-minute rebuttal
I'm ready all right three two one so I
come from the days of the Pocket PC
where the stylus is mandatory I get your
point I do agree that the fine point is
something that is actually beneficial
not in every case but it is I just I
feel that a productivity tool should be
able to be a tool I never have to worry
about the battery life on my drill
whenever I'm fixing something or the
most really good ultrabooks what makes
an ultrabook an ultrabook it makes its
the battery life the biggest part with
the Galaxy Note ever since the note 5 is
a non replaceable battery that you sadly
you know you don't get a better battery
life when compared to other smartphones
what makes the BlackBerry key one so
special is really not the keyboard I
don't care about the keyboard or the
feel I care about in fact that that
battery life is epic
really battery life is for me the most
important thing I hate carrying an
iPhone 7 plus in the city I have a large
phone and have to be carrying a battery
pack because I can barely scratch the
day with it I think that's the biggest
problem that for a Productivity tool to
be a tool a lot of basic things need to
be at ran like battery life all right
and clear so a ladies and gentlemen
there you have it the pros and cons the
attack and defense of this premise the
Galaxy Note is not a Productivity phone
now it's time for you to decide whether
or not the premise is true or false in
the upper right hand corner of this
video you're going to see a poll there
going to be 4 options and definitely
reads throw this read through those
options because it all comes down to
the title of this video did you agree
with the premise and do you still agree
did you agree with the premise but then
you changed your mind and now you
disagree did you disagree with the
premise and still disagree or did you
disagree with the premise and now we've
changed your mind and you now agree
definitely vote in that poll those are
your four options that will help us see
who was more persuasive during this
debate and then also to answer the
controversial question surrounding the
note is the note a Productivity platform
