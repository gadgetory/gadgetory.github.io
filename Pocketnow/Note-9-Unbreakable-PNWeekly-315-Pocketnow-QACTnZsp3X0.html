galaxy note 9 has a hard road ahead of
it it has to make up ground in sales
from the galaxy s 9 and it will have to
do so with few visceral upgrades so what
can Samsung do to prop up the biggest
chance it has against the iPhone put
fortnight on it the world's most popular
MMO is coming to Android and it looks
set to debut on a phablet more on that
in just a moment we'll dig into a couple
of follow-up stories as well on the
MacBook Pro and Blackberry ki 2 plus
reach you and the bitter pill for
everyone in technology that is the
tariffs tussle between the United States
and China the questions here how much
will your next grade crust excuse me how
much will your how much will your next
upgrade cost you and will you be able to
afford it plenty of questions to answer
we've got a bunch of tech Rascals to
give our best shot at answering them
from pocket now and xda-developers it's
episode 3 1/5 of the week blingy
recorded at 3 p.m. Eastern on Friday the
27th of July 2018 this is the show that
delves into everything that moves and is
technology from smartphones to tablets
and wearables it's the stuff you
probably couldn't make up even in your
wildest imagination
nations as a kid I'm Jules Wang producer
of this podcast and for one more episode
the host favorite XD a pal branded and
mini man hello to you hello and happy
Friday
someone's happy all right yeah here at 5
o'clock somewhere right always going to
be searching for that clock to just move
the hand over let's go on to our
favorite martial arts specialist what's
going on
what's going on everybody I would really
stop short of saying specialist let's
just put it that way I appreciate I
appreciate the kind words though I mean
you have to be showing off all your
skills man it's not just the personal
brand it's also the services that you
can provide to a whole bunch of people
would be it enforcing or protecting or
whatnot let's go over finally to the guy
who is on our YouTube channel the most
often it's Jaime Rivera how's your day
so far our guy who runs the Spanish side
of our video operations as well is just
appearing behind Jaime for a second as
he tries and shoots a couple of clips I
had to switch between like three
hotspots right now hello how are you I'm
in on Buddhas we sometimes lose
connectivity here which is the funniest
thing third world thank you as we as we
were saying while we were getting set up
for all of this it's one of those
Fridays and saying just that just now
I'm a has disappeared
there's ask the earth again yeah maybe
you have to cross your fingers for just
a bit here this is the worst just keep
going guys try and see what we can do
we'll be able to salvage things and make
sure that
we can get the latest out to you guys in
terms of the news and some hot takes as
well we certainly would like to hear
your hot takes on the Twitter's yeah
your thoughts your questions whatever
you want in there we'll answer them
Joshua is covering the YouTube side of
things in terms of chat and hopefully
we'll be able to see what's going on
over there he'll be able to chime in
with your relayed thoughts as well and
if you can't make it live here on this
program then definitely write us still
podcast at pocketnow.com is the way to
go for emails so any way that you can
contact us and would like to contact us
then please do so alright so um I'm
going to defer to you Brandon minimun
for a second here as he has a
continuation of a thought thread that he
made yesterday about the BlackBerry key
to mulling over what Joshua has been
saying in its defense
so go ahead Brandon no no I think this
is kind of like me joining your side but
I didn't think I've been thinking a lot
about what you said about the key to
last week and you see you described very
eloquently how you utilize keyboard
shortcuts to like copy and paste and
then quickly move between apps or the
speed key and how the keyboard allows
you to type with greater confidence and
accuracy and then it dawned on me that
the key to is something to be achieved
something to master it's like a it's
like an instrument that you need to
learn how to play by spending time with
all of its features and capabilities
embracing its quirks and by doing so you
end up with an experience that is in a
lot of ways better than your typical
candy bar phone so in light of that
realization I'm giving the key to
another chance
you really had an effect on me yeah I'm
waiting for the punchline wait that was
it there's no no I'm giving it another
chance I love the way he describes how
quickly he moves around now he uses
command C and command V for copy and
paste is a command there's a lot of text
that goes into a lot of places for me so
like that's that's my thing like it
Sochi if you're doing socials every
single day you're typing a lots and you
have to call
from one place to another I do use
buffer for all of my social stuff but
still like I have to do YouTube
descriptions and all that stuff so it
really helps in that regard and also
emails I mean pretty much every email
you have you guys on this on this panel
have ever gotten from me or in the last
like month or so has been off the key to
so interesting so you don't use Gmail
you prefer to use the BlackBerry hub
email solution no I 100% use inbox by
Gmail okay and mainly because of its
trips function that's the best thing in
the world to me it's no nice how they do
that exactly I use I have I have used
the hub as an easy way of just seeing
all of my social media like
notifications and whatnot but that's
about it here's the thing like like
blackberry the other day I'm big on
Instagram stories and I watch a lot of I
watch all your Instagram stories by the
way joshan just about everybody's and
blackberry the other day posted one
where they were like what's most
important to you battery life or camera
I'm like why are you asking this I know
why they're asking it I know it's it's
the the poor camera on the key to man
like really like what they've you know I
wouldn't mind a bad camera if this was
like the $200 phone what does one have
to do the other exactly like you can
have boat you can have both in so many
phones battery life on camera you know
you know what the worst part is that the
honor 7x is worth just $200 and it takes
better photos at the key - did you see
the honor 7x is on sale for like 160 now
until the end of July that's crazy crazy
these prices are gonna these prices are
gonna feel like a dream compared to
everything we're about to talk about
it's like free it's like it's like a
free phone
yeah I mean I'm just bracing myself for
what's to come in the next several
months here but I think we should all be
grateful for what we have currently and
in terms of what we have for the
keyboard phones especially if you are
that kind of person that just keeps on
typing and typing away then I think you
might have to deal with what you get
here so
mmm just do them yield just saying adieu
wheel yeah if you can afford that life
which if you probably are in your pocket
by the way that that like top socket
yeah how do you do that everyone has one
like do you really have you really
committed yourself to a pop socket
because I tried it for like a month and
I'm like this gets caught on my pocket
screw this thing like I just I don't
really have that issue too often but I
guess I'm more cognizant of it after
using it for so long I've been a pub
socket advocate for so long but this
this will help for the creatives in the
room right now having this here and
being able to lay it down because of the
kickstand this is your second monitor
for your camera Oh totally that's great
and I prefer the ones that are actually
more like a ring poles instead of the
socket hand because the Rings roll on my
finger I'm not a big fan like this is so
much more comfortable to me I mean ever
to each their own
Elsa wait way back in the day there were
some phones that had built-in kickstand
HDC even 4G whatever the heck it was
yeah but you couldn't yeah but you
couldn't put your hand in the kickstand
you know as much as I would like to talk
about kick stands here for the next hour
you're running behind and we have to get
things down here so let's talk about one
of our next favorite phones we're at the
future shall we let's talk about the
note 9 and that claims that it will be
coming out in early August because it
was forced to and well because there is
a lot of competition coming up in terms
of the iPhone as is traditional because
they always release late in the summer
but also because of Chinese pressures -
with vivo Oppo and a whole bunch of the
just putting out great international
products and seeing what they could do
to Apple find X the vivo necks those
have provided immense sales competition
going on in the world so I want to know
what's this this fortnight deal this
rumor of
having fortnight it hasn't yet arrived
on Android it's on iOS it's on all the
other major platforms but there's where
they might be soon it might make the
splash onto Android with the galaxy now
nine and that will it will be exclusive
for month just to the note nine so um I
guess so why don't you talk about this
one hi my first oh my god so I've got
somebody called Sam I don't know if
you've seen his gaming videos on our
Spanish channel with shameless plug well
I was trying to get to Sam but
apparently he had some work so Sam
yesterday was like dude dude fortnight
is coming out on Android today it's
coming out on Android today and he's
like out of the blue he's we're working
on the script for the day lien for the
video and he's like no I'm like what's
wrong dude and he's like dude we've got
rumors that now it's gonna be exclusive
for the note mine like WTF like I was
expecting it today because he is like an
anime he will not touch an iPhone Sam
will not touch an iPhone like he does
not want to and he's like oh my god I
can't believe this so I don't know man I
I think that it's a smart I think that
it's an interesting strategy from
Samsung the rumors are that not only
will the fortnight be launched with the
note 9 there will be exclusive that will
have minja which is probably the most
famous fortnight player he's gonna make
the B part of the announcement through
epic with epic games as well I think the
ninja goes yeah I think it's a cool
strategy from Samsung
I just I'm sad for everybody all of us
using Android phones right now pens for
tonight's like really cool like my son
is stuck on that thing we having good
Kevin's gonna be on that thing no not
the tech ninja exclusive I hope not but
I doubt that it won't be we've seen
exclusives like for example the razor
phone launch with this with Final
Fantasy I forget which version 50 other
desktop
yeah they launched with that but it
wasn't exclusive to to the razor phone
so Super Mario run was exclusive to the
iPhone for a while yeah exactly this
thing there are a lot of apps and games
out there that have been exclusive to
the iPhone that even
remake droid it's kind of the same thing
in kind of weird way kind of sucks but
you know kind of makes sense at the same
time I think it's great honestly because
this is this is exactly the kind of
stuff that I remember do you guys
remember when when we were first getting
into the smart like right before the
smartphone era began companies like
Samsung and LG would do partnerships
with big names yeah their phones and I
used to be like heavily into Korean pop
music and this is back in like the early
2000s and every new LG phone used to be
exclusively sold with certain people and
certain marketing and certain
celebrities as like the marketing
strategy so I think this is a little bit
in that vein so it makes sense to me I
do like it and mobile gaming is
incredible now floor tonight is just one
example I've been playing so many
awesome games it's on the oneplus 6
right now but it's a it's been a great
time to be a mobile gamer lately no game
will ever be as good as Titor I mean
yeah for sure I mean I don't think it's
a smart strategy because I wish that
they would launch you know that they
would launch fortnightly that day but
then if you own a Galaxy Note 9 you'll
get like an unlimited battle tas or
whatever it is that you get the perks
that you get just because you're in oh
yeah I feel good that would be better
than having the the game lock to just
one thought it isn't only and is only
the note 9 or it can it be like the way
the Jeezy album was where it was every
Samsung phone because if it's only the
note 9 will that actually make people
buy a phone just for the game that that
and the fact like for example a
shameless plug as well I'm working on
for everybody that's been asking for
after the bus to return it's returning
with the Galaxy Note 8 this weekend and
oh my god like this is not a phone for
everybody that's the other problem you
know but notice does that mean not the
phone for everybody so you know I don't
I don't I don't know what stuff I don't
think it's it's the best idea but we'll
see you know what there's a whole bunch
of yeah go ahead please I was gonna say
do you guys know how a phone identifies
itself to a piece
of software so I think they were like
serial numbers are through the play
store at least because I know that a lot
of interaction goes through with the
medium of the play store and like there
are certain white lists that things like
I mean we talked about this with the VLC
app with Huawei phones this week to
where they were banned from downloading
the VLC app from the Play Store well
yeah when I was going to say is that
there's a piece of software and every
phone called build build prop and that
identify it's kind of like a startup
file for every phone that identifies the
make and the model the screen resolution
and all that kind of stuff and in the
past it has been possible to edit your
build crop for example to take your
samsung phone and say that it's a nexus
phone so you get like google new Google
features earlier so so my guess is that
- once fortnight is available someone
will extract the apk all you got to do
is change your built your build prop to
say you have a note 9 and then you can
load it on I mean that's what's happened
in the past that is true xD a fashion
right there it's easy it takes it takes
notepad and just very basic knowledge
but it's yeah you'll find that when the
Galaxy Note 9 gets released and then you
get the how-to articles up and then LD
what are the most impressive things it
will be one of the most read things in
the world by the time it goes out I mean
we're talking about a company epic games
that is behind fortnight and they're
making hundreds of millions of dollars
they've been increasing their market
share in terms of this game and to not
have it on the world's most popular
mobile OS yet that's gonna be something
to watch out for and to say the very
least
so we'll keep our eyes on this one in
the meantime we shall move forward and
go to something that's also somewhat
related to the Galaxy Note 9 there's
been some speculation about revolving
around the latest announcement from
Samsung this unbreakable panel when the
Super AMOLED screens but instead of a
glass
cover surface that you have as with most
typical displays you have plastic yeah
where have we
plastic before oh my god no I know you
guys don't want to see my Galaxy s8
active man that thing looks terrible
yeah you go ahead Brandon it's the moto
moto force what does he force yeah it's
terrible mode what turbo to was the
first one that had that shatter shield
and everybody's complaining about the
scratchiness how easily it was scratched
and they also had a little snafu in
terms of the cover replacements because
you could get those liners covered
replaced for a certain fee and then they
didn't offer it for the z2 force because
it just wasn't economical it seemed so
yeah I sense that you have a lot more to
say about this Brandon I mean the the
moto shatter shield was just if you look
it's just not a good technology not only
does it make the screen feel soft
because it has like multiple layers of
plastic and not only is it more
conducive to scratches like super
conducive to scratches but it also is
like having like four screen protectors
on your screen it blocks light the
colors aren't as vibrant on a display it
just makes for a lower quality display
and like I don't I don't I don't know I
don't know if you guys know people or
yourselves
have problem with shattering phone
screens but like most people I know are
careful with their phones or they use a
case and this isn't a problem like why
do we need plastic screens we used to
have plastic screens back in the day
they were terrible awesome they're also
bad for touch response that's the other
thing it reduces the sensitivity of the
display increases touch latency just
overall no for the plastic screens
please so so for what I understood from
them from the news it was more like this
it's not a blend I don't know if that's
even possible but it's not necessarily
plastic there are glass components and
apparently what you're gonna be touching
its glass actually covered it on the
daily just like we recorded it like 30
minutes ago but yeah it's a
it's like if it's glass but there are
plastic components that allow it to be
indestructible for me it's like you know
if for the things that I care about
which is what I touch it that's glass I
you know I'm all open for it I mean the
biggest problem with with Galaxy devices
is this curve you know putting a case on
it makes it even more difficult because
the lips to protect the curve is more
pronounced so you know I find it to be
such an irony for you to have such a
thin and you know beautiful phone if
you're gonna have to be protecting it
with a case so for me it would be great
to have a phone that I would you know
not have to protect but I would I don't
know man we'll see I don't think the
glass is the best solution for the backs
for example so why don't you bring that
that whatever shatter shield material to
the back instead which is what I which
is what's most breakable lately and then
you know the front leave it glass sure I
don't know I don't know you know I mean
our yeah indeed well we just got six man
I should know that yeah
the news article was based off of just
the release so any insight that you can
provide if it's from Samsung or from
wherever else I mean that's appreciated
Joshua I was wondering what your take on
this story is I find it funny that our
replacement screens not a huge form of
revenue for these companies like but if
if if the screen looks good the way that
a Super AMOLED should look then I'm all
for it like it's it's fine like it like
Brendan said I I am careful with my
phones to the point where I've never
really shattered one I think I'm only
broken like one screen in my in my whole
career I've lost one phone and I've
broken one phone like that's it's a
pretty good record for a six-year career
so far
yeah so oh and that also does not count
drop tests so let's just put that in a
different category but I love that they
were talking about these drop tags these
drop tests they did 26 consecutive drops
from about four feet and it's like okay
four feets fairly average and that's
fine but of course there are all of
these different factors you could say
that a screen is unsure of all or
whatever unbreakable whatever you want
to talk whatever whatever you
name it but then you put it on a
different type of concrete a different
type of flooring a different type of
jagged floor and all of a sudden that
thing becomes breakable so I I stopped
short of actually believing when claims
like this happen because there's always
a way to break something yeah yeah yeah
and we keep name dropping Zak Nelson of
a jerry-rigged everything but we need to
have him on at some point just so that
we can like get this all set step out
and talk about Mohs levels of material
hardness because delivery is just
deadpan serious and hard on kind of just
boom right right in front of your face I
feel exact was just disappointed like in
a good way like he you broke it and he's
like oh I didn't want to break you like
I'm sorry because the innovations great
and the design is great well I mean
progress only get you so far right right
that's been it's bitterly boring with
phone durability tests I mean like
almost every phone that he's tested in
the last like ten months has been fine
and it was kind of cool actually to see
a phone be destroyed I gotta admit yeah
you gotta get that shelf filled up that
yeah the Shelf of Shame yep just a
comment quickly from the hashtag peon
weekly on Twitter we're not a little
apart you can place a glass panel on top
of the plastic panel the thing is with
an OLED display now attached to that
glass panel it's easy to damage it when
you drop the phone so there are a lot of
composition issues and who knows if
these companies will just add on a glass
panel anyways to this or these Samsung
because they own the technology you
would presume but who knows if they will
put another glass panel on it
interesting case so it'll be interesting
Joshua I know that you kind of cynically
talked about the kind of this revenue
stream from replacement glass that may
still be the case so we'll have to see
let us move on and talk about something
that is the intent of a topic from last
week so last week we talked about the we
talked about the light and the company
the upstarts that had 16 cameras on its
first smartphone and that how it's gonna
change itself with computational
photography and what not so this time
around we're gonna flip it to Sony who
has been very very on it when it comes
to image sensors for mobile phones and
they have just a Bude the first 48
megapixel sensor the smallest
in well just ever because that's how
mobile phones work and there's word that
it might potentially reach us during CES
2019 with the galaxy excuse me not the
galaxy the xperia x z3 so many names out
there can be confusing so we have given
the size that we have here I wish there
was the picture here of the actual
rulers that measured out this thing but
it's very small and when you're talking
about fitting in 48 million pixels onto
that space there's bound to be some sort
of loss that you're gonna have
diminishing returns so I'm wondering
who's bracing for this the most Joshua
would you like to start no you're
interesting go first I I don't know I
always Sony is always the one that says
we've we've achieved to this high
megapixel count and then you actually
use the camera on their phones and it
just doesn't turn out to be as awesome
as they they market it out to be
obviously the sensor itself needs to
have the right software backing it up
and that's when the sensor becomes part
of other Android phones but while I'm
excited for the sensor itself I'm not
excited for the phone it's been a while
since I've been excited for an
experience ends yeah someone maybe some
of my best memory is were with Xperia
phones early on with the xperia x1
that's a cool phone that was a beautiful
48 mega
I mean I um I'm cool with that as long
as I can see someone actually use it to
some sort of amazing ability like like
put that thing inside of a pixel fort or
a pixel 3 or something you know like
this is the question that I have about
this when was the last time that Sony
brought their best technology and lot
and launched it on an experience we know
they don't don't they tracked like they
what about the first 4k screen no but
the 4k screen was but when I'm talking
I'm talking about imaging it's their
imaging technology never makes it to the
experience first so my biggest guess and
you know cuz I did cover some rumors I
did cover some rumors so we've got you
know two flagship phones that are coming
up we've got the iPhone 10 plus which
there were weird rumors that mentioned
triple cameras might not and then we've
also got the Galaxy S 10 plus or pro
whatever they're gonna name that thing
which is also rumored to bring three
cameras now we know the amount of damage
that the p20 pro has done that phone you
know it's there are things about that
phone that are just really hard to
compare with any other device out there
well I mean I'll continue on here's the
point because they are so let's think
about what this p20 poro has done I mean
it was just that 140 megapixel sensor
that our Adams Elaine found to have been
really the difference maker in terms of
providing so much sharp resolution and
making sure that these pictures no
matter how far away they have they're
taken or wherever they're taken they
come out clean crisp and better than
even what the companion sensors have
done to remember certain TV shows and
movies back in the 90s back in the 80s
they would take a camera like they were
looking at like a robber or something
and then they would zoom in to like
their eye and then the detective would
be like deep pixelate and but
and hemisphere enhance enhance like that
that obviously didn't exist I mean you
can't create data where there is none
but if you if the sensor was like like a
tremendous amount of megapixels in
theory that should be possible if you
take a you know hundred megapixel image
of something and you zoom in you should
be able to get a tremendous amount of
detail so times you should write like I
mean it doesn't always work out so
perfectly but exactly that's always
what's safe is like when one has been
the last time that you are able to do a
hundred crop into a smartphone picture
and be completely satisfied with what
you see the 41 megapixel one oh wow
there are times when it has been pretty
good but it's not the most it's not a
commonality with smartphone cameras
that's not like the movies yet yeah
exactly
um one thing that I wanted to mention
real quick is I'm just looking at the
spec sheet that is here or just a spec
table whatever you want to call it there
are two things that really catch my eye
here the front-facing camera can record
4k video which i think is cool I like
that a lot and if there's good
stabilization and the envy lens is wide
enough because there's one thing I've
realized about smartphone cameras
they're always a little just a tiny bit
too narrow they're never just wide
enough especially for that 70 degree
range that's very stubborn exactly and
the other thing that I saw here is its
Android 8.0 and then below it it says
invalid Android Sony Edition indeed Sony
indeed we don't give enough we don't
give enough credit to Sony for being
such an innovator in terms of AOSP and
whatnot so I mean just to be fair it's
there are do they are doing their part
but in terms of making their own little
thing happen it's well it's not really
working out so hopefully things will
change so much as the seasons and
weather does hey because all right also
a 1080p screen so it's a Jaime's point
like the technology that they try to put
out often doesn't even make it into the
wrong phones so how far do you guys hear
me by the way you were spending on the
p20 Pro and then you just like someone
I was trying to say is I don't think
Sony's gonna launch that on an
experienced companies make these
announcements OMS have been playing with
this hardware for a while
we are set for an iPhone 10 plus launch
we're set for a Galaxy S 10 launch I
mean I think that these companies you
know like another Huawei phone with that
amount of technology in the camera can
make even more damage so I'm thinking
that probably Sony will just give this
technology to their partners which is
what they usually do mmm interesting
well we'll have to see what happens with
that as we move along here let's talk
about well let's stick with Jaime for a
second because I think there's a
resolution to one of the previous
problems that we've faced with the
MacBook Pro 2018 and that is with Mac OS
high sierra version 10 13 6 finally some
resolution on the throttling issues in
terms of handedly third probably third
party applications and seeing how they
handle under excessive heat or just
being able to actually work properly in
terms of making the intel core processor
run and also just keeping it cool so
talk to us a little bit about that and
what your revised assessment if you have
one is i'm still waiting for the next
generation like should i pretty much
stuck with a 5 year old computer up
until the third generation of the
current macbook pro just because of that
so just a heads up there is a fix
admitted to Mac OS high sierra apple
made a statement where they discovered
that there was a key within the within
the firmware that wasn't allowing the
computer to cool down correctly and so
they sent out the update and they also
sent an apology because obviously you
spent three thousand dollars at least on
this computer so that's so funny the
funny thing is Apple could have said
anything and you would have believed it
they could have said the flux capacitor
had a crack in it you would have been
like okay they you know
you know no I just listen Apple is just
so bad about experimenting with
technology oh my god they're slow to
adopt like we're still using three gigs
of RAM on the iPhone 10 man like
seriously I do understand that they make
very lean software I get that but that
doesn't give them an excuse to cheap out
on specific things just to be able to
make an extra profit I get it you don't
need the best than the latest specs but
you know whenever you do don't screw it
up yeah
to that point that you made Brandon I've
seen plenty of interviews featuring Tim
Cook and I've seen how hit sometimes his
eyes pop out and I'm just imagining him
saying Great Scott while he does that so
it's crazy
all right so finally this in this part
of the show at least we got to talk
about the Nokia 9 and it's done a great
job so far this hmd this global company
that's trying to get the phone out again
in terms of a Nokia brand and how do you
guys feel about $1,000 phone from this
company because here's the thing they do
fast Android updates they do clean
Android in general in terms of the look
and feel and really it's just the
hardware that's gonna be making the
difference here and what we're learning
from recent chatter I'm not gonna give
it too much credence here but it's gonna
look a lot like the Nokia 8 suraqa
which we played with and oh you see it
was a very fine looking phone very
premium feeling phone that was
approximately 700 800 dollars so I guess
there is a justification to maybe move
it up to that thousand dollar mark but
then again you're playing with the
iPhone 10 here and you're playing with
the next generation iPhone 10 whatever
the heck it's gonna be called
so what do you think let's start off
with you Brendan I think I've never used
any modern Nokia phone
that runs Android so I really I really
don't have an opinion I mean the the
eight Sirocco I think looks really nice
on paper it the specifications of
Awesome I just think it's a really
beautiful looking device but like have
you guys used any of these newer Nakia
phones nah not on the regular not really
and none of them are expensive that's
the thing so I I don't think I I think
that the product is a possibility but
like they're selling point like no you
remember the days you were running out
of patience with this connection guys
you're jumping between three hotspots
and Wi-Fi it is just all right finish
your point and then I'll say good I read
it it's just they're not gonna launch an
expensive dratted you they'd been
selling well it's pointless yeah yeah
it's a it's a weird off the strategy for
an HND at this point I have over here
back over here the Nokia 6.1 and it's a
very premium heavy feeling phone I
haven't been able to put in a SIM card
for it yet but I like it it's run smooth
much unlike some of the Snapdragon 400
450 chip with that like new fabrication
that 14 nanometer fabrication that's
supposed to be more efficient and more
fine
it's still chokes so having that over
there and making sure that it runs
perfectly that stock Android is there
and it's lovely like I found it pretty
good especially at that sub 300 price
point so maybe what I didn't want to see
it scaled up to that kind of premium
level I'm not sure I'm not sure if that
is the ethos of this current generation
of Nokia but then again make a count
though like that's that's the problem
just like we were saying last week that
what would a Microsoft Android phone
look like well it'll look like an
Android phone and that's basically what
it is you got to give it something that
is actually different no nine
we'll have at least the s-pen and other
phones have like wide-angle lenses or
different lenses or something like that
something that actually sort of makes
that price point make sense and if this
Sirocco $1,000 phone is just going to be
just like a really sleek design I'm
sorry but that's not gonna be enough
though I will say this
Nokia throwing in their hat into the
$1,000 premium price point tier like it
kind of makes sense to me because they
want to like keep up with the Joneses in
a way but the consumers are not going to
buy into it just because it's an
expensive phone I've heard people say
I've had debates like this with people
where they said if I have the ability to
buy a more expensive phone I'm going to
get it because that price point makes me
feel like I'm actually paying for
something that is premium but in this
case I'm gonna hesitate to say it would
be yeah and there's been some hesitation
in terms of its approach to Android
phones - I mean we've seen the getting
in the door strategy of remix ting a
couple of old Nokia phones of the glory
days such as the 3310 the 88 8100 the
matrix phone whatever you want to call
it mm-hmm so and there's only so far
that you can get with that kind of
strategy it's been good for Nokia so far
but again it's just about that mileage
and you have to make sure that some
point even though these are pretty good
stable of Android phones you have to
make sure that your product your flat
there's a flagship product that stands
on its own so that's the tightrope that
is being played here I want to thank
Brandon minimun for joining us for the
time that he could it's been a pleasure
and hey maybe we should make this a
little bit more often should you come in
hey let's do this again sometime okay we
shall see you later have a good weekend
have a good weekend see you guys see ya
and as well like this is the worst I
apologize it's I yeah I was about to say
it's getting worse so I need to figure
out what's up with the ISP definitely hi
may I have a few more beers for me and
for Joshua
you have a great weekend yes yes in the
amount that I've already had well make
sure at the very least you enjoy it see
you guys take care see ya there dude
all right right so in just know where to
which one to go first maybe I'll just
there'll be like a freak thunderstorm
coming in and it'll be alright and then
you'll be the last one standing I'm
totally available for whatever we need
coming up it's good to know we got the
hot takes out of the way so we do have a
couple of a of the broader topics coming
up or broader or them deeper dives
topics I don't know what term you yeah I
mean it's gonna be about how much people
are gonna be willing to pay for the
phones now if you thought that the
iPhone 10 who was that but it's
stretching that wallet sucking monster
that it was at $999 or a thousand $149
if you pot the 256 gigabyte version well
just you wait because we're in middle of
a trade war if you haven't noticed we
got this whole president Trump ethos of
making deals and if not walking away and
saying screw you everyone I'm going home
here's a bunch of tariffs you go would
deal with that and also just a whole
bunch of politicking around it in terms
of farm deals agriculture and whatnot
but we're gonna focus on tech because
that's what we do here so recently we
saw a couple of products from Apple
including the Apple watch the original
Apple watch at least so not even the
series one as Apple might have
characterized it but just like the Apple
watch sport Apple watch Edition Apple
watch if you remember those names then
there you go we also have a few fitbit's
on this list and apparently all these
are products that we're talking about
here are going to be affected because
they come under a tariff category that's
going to be considered for additional
tariffs anywhere from 10% as we've seen
with aluminum aluminum and steel up to
25% for other things I think
those would be for the agricultural
products but again there's a sliding
scale it's on a determined basis for
each category and we should expect more
phones more product what more laptops
even to come under this very strict
regime as we go into the next couple of
months as these tariffs get but proved
barring any situation changing in terms
of the trade picture with China so I
love that thing it is and I love that we
have been singing the praises of Chinese
phones at least to some extent over the
last couple of years and clearly these
these trade wars and these tariffs have
been ongoing but it only becomes a huge
problem once you put names like Apple
and Fitbit behind it and you know how
people are talking about it and it's
just like well I mean what do you expect
I mean like the u.s. already is not able
to enjoy something like the p20 or the
p20 Pro because of stuff like this
because of the American let's say the
the the ski the fried yeah the pride but
also the ski business that they have
around security and then on top of that
you throw these these tariffs on top and
now you know the the market just ends up
suffering for it and then it's only when
an incumbent it's only when something
that is very established in our
ecosystem like Apple when they get when
they get affected that's when everybody
jumps up in arms
it's the funny thing to me yeah it
precludes a lot of Chinese business from
being done with the United States we've
already been talking about with cyber
security concerns about these telecom
providers these a small way ZTE and
whatnot
getting dis done by National
Intelligence directors and it's been
this crazy that they were even talking
about so there was a White House plan or
some sort of national security plan but
that was really it to the White House
that meant nationalizing the 5g network
of this nation here so that's all kind
of conspiratorial this whole play
against China has been and then you talk
about well these Chinese businesses
like oppa vivo Xiaomi they want to
expand across the globe and they can't
get into the US market which is the
toughest to crack for these these types
because yeah first of all again that
schema snitch that you've pointed out
but also just the fact that it's it's
they're too used to you Apple and
Samsung and those are the two names that
you have heard because LG ranks a
distant third in our market at like a 17
or like 15% or something like that and
then Motorola would be next at single
digits how are they going to expect to
compete
first of all in an unlocked market that
still has yet to really develop and with
carrier partnerships especially with
that whole cybersecurity thing because
we know we talked about that huawei mate
empro getting at the last minute ditched
by AT&amp;amp;T and so yeah there's so many
different factors that lie in to this
and you know one thing that I will say
for the general consumer who is really
into these ecosystems Fitbit Apple so
knows all of these things that are very
clearly stated to be part of these
tariffs or at least affected by these
tariffs now you know why you're paying
so much for your tech it's not the only
reason but it's one of the reasons and
it's it's crazy that now we can actually
point because I remember when $1000
started to be the breaching point for
some of these smart phones we would
pointed that and be like why is this
happening and like we're really upset
about it now we kind of are being given
a bit of a reason it's not a good reason
at all so what I would say to a lot of
consumers out there if you're upset
about these tariffs causing this massive
price increase for all of your phones
and whatnot if you are the kind of
person that likes to get the new phone
every single year I'm going to reiterate
it seems like the magic number has been
7 for a lot of these phone lines if you
happen to have any phone after the 7th
generation of the iPhone the Samsung's
or even the LG's at this point like
you're probably okay like you don't have
to feel pressure to actually pay this
massive amount of money to get this
phone which is getting affected by so
many different things become so
expensive that you have to take out a
freaking mortgage to get one
yeah that's t-mobile our smartphones are
getting ahead our smartphones are
getting better and because they're
getting so much better you can actually
you can actually it would be worth it
for you to at least not go to another
generation or at least you don't have to
feel pressured to have to jump to this
latest generation and spend all that
money that's all I'm saying
I will remind the listener here that
t-mobile only covers the first $720 in
any in equipment installation plan after
that you have to pay that as a down
payment AT&amp;amp;T Verizon those are the big
guys and they seem to be able to be able
to finance all of the total price for
their things so I mean I'm not sure if
that has anything to do with the
situation as we go forward eventually
you're gonna see that there's some price
point B it but $45 per month mark or
something like that that's gonna be
really just I don't want to pay that for
two years so yeah yeah and there's also
the fact that ZTE finally has some
recourse in the United States because
not only has it started to get out of
those punishments that it incurred while
it was it was accused of breaching
sanctions breaching US trade sanctions
with North Korea and Iran businesses
over there they're finally getting out
of that and there was a fear for a time
that they would come under effect of
national defense bill where they would
be blocked the defense contractors which
are pretty much owe plenty of companies
that you already know in the United
States but they would be banned from
working with ZTE or while we in terms of
that getting supplies products of why
not so that's all defend and ZT seems to
be at some clearing point at some sort
of end of the tunnel can we finally
talked about the axon 9 because that has
been one of the axon 7 was one of the
most lauded upon mid Rangers of 20
sixteen in terms of what it brought
forward audio in terms of this
relatively conservative approach to
Android
it was 2016 so that was still relatively
conservative and then they were also
committing themselves to cleaner Android
runs starting with Oreo which was
supposed to come at the early part of
this year and now we're kind of left
picking up the pieces ZT is at least but
we're wondering what the heck to expect
at this point I mean how do you see this
Josh I think that okay ZT is one of
those companies that I have a love-hate
relationship with because like I give
them a lot of props for trying to
innovate like remember the acts on em
and yes the acts on seven was a very
decent device especially at the time and
I would be excited to see what comes
next after all of these after all these
sanctions that had occurred but the
thing is will they even have the ability
to to produce because I'm looking at
this article and I'm just saying that
you know sanctions would be lifted if
the Chinese company would agree to pay a
1 billion dollar penalty and they have
but they've paid up yeah so and they
yeah exactly so there's the there was
that and also a large amount of time
that ZTE was not able to perform trades
or to do shipments of their parts and
whatnot so there's there's a ton of
money that has been lost because of all
of this because of this ski business as
if that's gonna like the show title now
let's keep it but basically I would be
interested to see what their next move
would be in terms of what their next
device would be but I just don't see it
happening for a while while they recover
from all of this and I mean who knows
who knows who knows what it would be and
who knows what it could look like maybe
it'll come out in China and we'll get
some sort of so sort of look at that but
as far as it coming here to the US I
think it's gonna take a while for them
to have the resources and the the
ability to be able to do so comfortably
moved and they could be gone as well
because those punishments could come
back into effect if we seem to do a move
that the US Commerce Department doesn't
like or perhaps it's just gonna be those
tariffs that just nail them in and you
know and you know what I I'm not going
to get political at all but I I and and
this is very doomsday in a way like it's
very negative of me to say but honestly
ZTE unfortunately might just become one
of those companies that is a scapegoat
and if there are ever any problems
between the US and China ZTE might
unfortunately one of those companies
that ends up getting the brunt of the of
the crap that the US and so at this
point I'm not sure if Josh is I'm not
sure if Josh is frozen or if I have
frozen and I'm not sure if I've been
we've been traveling in time for a few
minutes or a few seconds at least just
when I am I am I think we're back or
looking either of us are back but I'm
not sure hope you're you were perfectly
fine for a good Montford for a good
portion of that there but basically when
I was what I was saying I don't know how
far I got in that it's just I'm just
afraid that a ziti might become one of
those Chinese companies that is a
scapegoat for the US government and for
the US economy you know like if if the
US and China trade wars end up becoming
like a very long form thing then ziti
just might become another scapegoat in
that and the whole thing these things
can happen again like you said yeah I
mean it's good to have aspirations it's
good to have phones that you want to
look up to in to grab but in terms of
being able to pay for them and seeing
that slip away farther and farther every
new cycle where you know one reason or
another you won't be able to get this
phone in your lifetime it's just it's
just unfortunate and I'll tell you one
thing when the axon whatever the case
may be next phone comes out we'll have
like internal celebration of sorts and
be like hey
cool yeah we'll be cheering on that one
yeah exactly
yeah all right finally this hour let's
let's take some bets here so android p v
Developer Preview the last Developer
Preview has been released and we should
expect it to come out in the next month
the final version of Android P we don't
have a final name yet we do know it's
gonna be Android 9.0 but as far as any
internal documents or internal source
and goes on all we have had is pistachio
ice cream at least in the like long name
and then there was also the statio which
was used in huawei customer service
transaction in I think Poland so that's
where that's where we have our sourcing
going on here so far we know it just to
figure out what this stuff might be by
the way just one quick thing I do want
to give a shout-out to the to the live
chat I have been monitoring it and just
just letting you guys know it's not that
we don't read the live chat I've been
reading at this entire time it's just
that whenever a tiny little question
might come up in the chat our
conversation kind of naturally addresses
it so I'm sorry if I haven't called
anybody out real quick yeah but yeah the
the chat has been ongoing there were a
couple of them that I wanted to call out
and then we ended up saying it anyway on
on-air okay so as far as what Android P
might be called why is pistachio like
the front-runner like I've always
thought pancake was gonna be one of them
and then just as a Filipino there's a
there's a little Filipino dessert called
Palmer on that I would love for it to be
so from my Filipino demographic here
like you know in the Philippines Android
P is Paul Barone which is all going to
we're just all going to agree it's gonna
agree that that's it and you'll like
whatever the official name is you're
probably just gonna fly to San Francisco
tear down the fiberglass statue and then
build one of your own
a huge pop around Android Lupino
gorillas will be taking over and that
will be it at Mountain View like that's
it I mean if it were up to me I would
definitely consider a pancake I actually
haven't thought of any answer myself I
was just busy just trying to like put
together okay so there's this and
there's that and I have not taken the
time to actually think what have I
wanted this for me this is kind of a
panin which in German meets blooper
because I can't think of anything right
now
so I L miserably as a host in this
aspect but you know what pistachios okay
I like pistachio ice cream
it's I don't know why well it's green
the nut is green and the that's why the
ice cream itself is green but still kind
of weird to see green ice cream if it's
not mint I don't know that's just me
anyways well they're just further prove
the point that we read the chats one of
the one of them says well I mean okay
you can have your opinions about Android
all you want but two there is one person
listed Android poop you know Oh
peppermint was another one - peppermint
I was thinking of peppermint I do think
that pancake makes a lot more sense but
whatever it might be what was it was a
popsicle one also but that's not really
a pastry popsicle yeah that's not really
pastry it's a dessert it's a treat it's
a you know why those sweet things but I
mean I did hear but that once what was
the the peppermint is well I think well
if you were to go with the poop emoji
because technically that's supposed to
be a chocolate ice cream cone top like I
think that would work out in some sort
of demented yeah exactly
well what would what would look good as
a statue I think it should be part of
the question right because I think a
pancake would be easy I think a popsicle
would be easy I think peppermint might
be a little tough like what would you
put peppermint candy you know it's candy
cane mm-hmm exactly so that's why I
think pancake is probably the
that makes the most sense because it's
just a big round circle that looks a lot
like the Oreo statue and then it's just
a lighter shade of brown put on a couple
of toppings too if you I mean that's
what the Oreo thing looks like I'm not
the order of thing though now that I was
thinking about the Oreo Oh logo that
they had for Android before it was Oreo
it was just the yellow and the white
circle in the center this one's a pea
which is you know kind of it looks like
a candy cane shape with the the
lowercase P and it has that striping in
the center so maybe I think I think it
would make sense to go with peppermints
that's my I think that's good me my
official bed 20 whatever man
okay fair all right I'll put 20 down
from pancake personally by will shake on
it and we'll agree and then whenever it
happens then
we'll be paying out there we go one of
our comments or said Pinocchio I'm like
what are you eating yeah I mean
high-fiber well speaking of the words
that start with psi M we're still
rocking my pebble one of the cum
interest did say that but we're not
gonna talk about that if but I will say
let's get the naming right it this is no
longer called a pebble this is called a
rebel okay yeah and has been rather yep
yep made from the offshoot of a pebble
and credit to a Fitbit for keeping
things going as long as they have been
and allowing the courtesy of being able
to offload this service the services
side of things so one more comment just
came in peanut butter
mmm yeah I mean what peanut Brella will
be the more kind of visible visceral
kind of thing that you could see and
touch and feel instead of a peanut
butter unless you want to go away PB&amp;amp;J
yeah like that interesting but hey we'll
have to see
hey it's been a nice show and
it's been a nice week I feel like and
hopefully you'll be under oh yeah
exactly I was glad I'm glad that I was
here to back it up on the other two who
were I'm the guest and it's so funny
because the two the two other hosts like
bailed I can't fault them for not
leaving already so I mean not again I
just think it's really funny because
like I'm having fun guesting on here as
much as I am and there's just funny that
was I mean Brandon at the bed bounce god
bless them but you know it started late
yeah I agree
we did start a little bit late that was
my fault I have my setup had some
everyone's fault that's not getting
let's share the blame on this one
because I feel like yeah yeah it's it
there's one reason or another end I'm
not going to debate what those reasons
are ah man well finally finally we have
an announcement to make and I'm excited
to be a part of it from next week we
will have a new host for this show
oh we've loved putting on for you since
2012 this will be one of many changes to
come we certainly expect for the better
with the goals of giving you more
perspective on the ever-evolving mobile
landscape as well as just us letting
loose and having fun and making sure
that you are - I've been very proud to
oversee the weekly for the past four
years I am grateful to be able to
continue to oversee the weekly for the
episodes to come but as you might have
guessed I took on this temporary hosting
position with the intention of it being
temporary since the departure of Juan
Carlos Becnel who we have nothing but
respect for I kept the lights on and
made sure that we had an interesting
show every week so we've gone through
the highs the lows together in a very
short span but I pray that I've done my
job of entertaining you it was a
privilege to serve the audience that's
you directly for the past several weeks
you will know who the new host is by
next Friday they are very capable very
gregarious
and have very good ideas for how we will
evolve this show for the times to come
