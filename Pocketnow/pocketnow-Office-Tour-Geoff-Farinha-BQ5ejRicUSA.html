calm and today i'm actually to show you
something that's totally different than
what I've shown you thus far you may
have seen that we've actually started to
give you an in-depth look at our setups
at home and how we bring the content to
you on pocketnow.com now so far Brandon
and Joe of both recorded their setups
geo had his server room and Joe had his
awesome triple monitor setup today I'm
going to show you mine if you haven't
seen Brandon and Joe's yet there's
actually going to be a link here and a
link here so please feel free to go
watch those let's go ahead and jump into
mine alright guys we're back and the
first thing I'm going to show you is
actually very similar to what Joe showed
you earlier he has the server closet
well my room we actually have the
utility closet which houses our
networking gear which is simple as a
modem itself a wireless router and then
an eight ports which we have lots as you
can see here lots and lots of cable this
is i have comcast so this is the comcast
modem that they give you when you have
their digital voice the cable the
internet the whole nine yards as you can
see they do a great wiring job and will
believe it at that but i didn't want to
show you that just so that i could show
that it does somewhat have a comparison
to joe's grated you know I don't have
the storage in my closet I was thinking
about putting it here I do have it in a
separate area but I don't of a server
like he does and I definitely nvm for
them i'm pretty jealous of that setup
it's really nice but moving on to my
computer where everything happens over
here we have a mid-2010 15-inch macbook
pro this is the i7 model I'd only has
four gigs of RAM I'm gonna be upgrading
it to eight eventually probably very
soon with all the video editing that
I've been doing for the high def video
and such but it is the 15 inch i7 it's
pretty fast IV hi-res screen on mine
which is very nice as you can see next
to it I have a 23 inch just a standard
old HD acer monitor which unfortunate is
a little hard to focus on too because of
the low light but as you can see here
it's showing pocket now with plenty of
space here on the sides no issues
whatsoever so what I like to do is I can
click and drag a window from one screen
to the other with the mac functionality
built right in which is very nice you I
can take this window here
bring it over here if I want to whatever
it may be for that matter it's a great
moderates a great sup helps me to be
very productive especially where I may
have email on one screen and a video on
the other or homework me being a student
homework on the screen research on this
screen itself so it just makes my life
easier you can see i also have a webcam
here I do a lot of the podcasting I'm on
the simulcast podcast where I represent
pocketnow absolutely so that's that's
part of my show I do have a USB headset
that I do use to record that show now
looking over here as you can see lots
and lots of wires now this is the
ethernet I do have wireless in my house
as I showed you the wireless router but
fit when it comes to uploading the video
I do want to use the hardwire huge speed
difference for me it's well worth it
next IV firewire 800 which goes to
external hard drive which I will show
you this is my mini displayport adapter
which goes to this second monitor here
then 2 USBS which is kind of the
downside with the macbook pro and then
from there we have the audio jack which
basically brings me to my next shot is
my bose companion speakers one here one
there the subwoofer is down below I
should see that this is my subwoofer we
have the nice magsafe adapter cyber home
low battery backup in regular USB
keyboard the reason why I have that
keyboard is because this macbook pro
does have windows seven on it using
bootcamp as well as the vmware fusion so
i'm able to use both windows and the
mcafee need to as a matter of fact I do
actually plan to running nice long hdmi
converter cable from the mini
displayport to my plasma over there
which I'll get to next now as I said I
have a lot of storage so on my storage
it's a little hard to see but on the
left here I have a western digital my
book studio this is the firewire 800
version which is a lot faster for me
that's only a 500 gigabyte it's a few
few years old next to that I have
another western digital just in my book
though and it's a one terabyte now the
reason why I have a one terabyte and a
500 gigabyte is it's it's funny you may
ask this one terabytes partition into
two spots 500 gigs of that is backing up
my macbook pro here with time machine
there the 500 gigs is a copy of this
drive so I've
strives before it may sound redundant to
you guys have lobster eyes before that's
the best way for me to keep track of it
so I'm guarantee not to lose it up here
I have a cavalry just a no-name drive
was a gift it's a 160 gigabyte I put
purely movies on there you know if I
want to watch a movie whatever it may be
that's on there then I have a
two-and-a-half-inch try this is my
portable drive for files mostly pictures
if I'm Alton over on the road I take a
picture from the macbook pro here it
goes right here then that glow you see
in the back is a USB hub which again I
brought you this cameras and have a
light but there's a lot of wiring going
through there as you can see down here
it's a rat's nest now again all my
editing takes place on this guy right
here it's on am design rain stand so it
makes a little bit easier for me to kind
of do my editing and more ergonomic
which I'll show you there that's all the
wiring coming through so it's a nice
design it's just an accessory basis that
takes your macbook or any laptop for
that matter and stands it right up and
I'll show you a better angle over this
way makes it a lot easier for me to use
it sit in my chair which my chair is
very different from most people's it is
the a kak makes this a company that
makes gaming chairs so AK and you can
see here it's the octane that's their
version of the computer chair now I have
a berber carpet didn't want to use one
of those plastic mats I'm not a fan of
them now I got this chair so you can see
here because it has the rollerblade
wheels so I'm able to move smoothly on
the carpet without an issue at all makes
life a little bit easier for me but I
would say this is a very good work
station for me I do want to upgrade the
RAM to the eight gigs because it will
make editing video that much easier and
that much faster as you can see here
this is my main device that I use
primarily and full time it is the sprint
EVO I love it came from the nexus one
before I do miss these the AMOLED screen
but hey what can you say king of
everything right I do like the size of
the phone it's easier for me to text on
it and Sprint's more let's say
affordable pricing for me being a
student works great as well now the one
other thing I do want to show you is
going to be my home theater setup now
and the small amount of free time I have
I have to do a lot of gaming now you can
see here first off it's a mess I
actually just got back from vacation
and I pulled this wall plate off right
here that's why all the wires are just
scattered because what I'm actually
going to be doing is getting a ps3
what's in the next week and I'm going to
be adding that and stringing up the
wiring through the little conduit we
have right there so I have to pull that
play it off that's why the wires are
just on the floor as you see right there
pretty pretty ugly but I have a nice old
receiver does the job it's about four or
five years old I have the new slim xbox
360 with the the touch controls you know
i just press here opens right up pretty
cool i know this isn't like plucking out
relative but again this is what i enjoy
and then many of you have comments on
the videos i have the high def DVD
player rest in peace and then of course
the plasma so this is basically where
all my editing and all of my digital
leisure let's say takes place everything
you see that I do on pocket now takes
place here my backdrop in our record a
video of myself is always of my TV in
that area over there so that kind of
gives you a better perspective of my
studio setup so once again guys this is
jeff Farina for pocketnow.com make sure
you stay tuned what we have coming cuz
is a lot of material coming a lot of
cool phones and more thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
