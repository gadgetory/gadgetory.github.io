the galaxy round we got some
high-quality images of the next iPads to
come and Microsoft is now encouraging
OEMs to make bones with windows phone
and Android I'm hi Mary vera and could
be that it will now be legal to do what
we've been trying to hack for the last
couple of years this is parking out
daily let's start the day off with some
official news is via Samsung is just
announced their galaxy round which looks
a lot like the galaxy s4 and the Galaxy
Note 3 both devices it actually keeps
the size and the specs of the galaxy
note 3 though a lot of people are saying
that the reason why it's round is for
you to be able to reach the other corner
of the device with one hand though I
really doubt it i mean this phone is
really big and still we have 900
something comments already on
yesterday's video telling us if they
would buy the galaxy round so Shimon
what do you think about this phone and
speaking of odd devices if you thought
that Samsung and Apple are the only
companies that would give us golden
device as well think again as HTC has
just shown as their gold HTC One in
their event in London and yeah I said
gold HTC one because this is a four
thousand dollar 18 carat HTC One and
yeah there are only four devices being
made for obvious reasons I imagine the
other ones are for order or something
and make sure you watch Michael Fisher
full video on what he thought about this
golden phone will probably never buy now
let's talk about iPads as we get the
first leaked high quality images of what
to expect from the ipad 5 and yes it
looks like an iPad Mini in every way
which is a great thing and we are
expecting for the internals of the
iphone 5s tonight it's at his iPad
though in previous years the iPad always
gets a little Trump and specifications
when compared to that generations iphone
so let's see exactly what we get october
twenty second when we expect these ipads
to be announced microsoft is up next as
the company has just unveiled their
specifications and requirements for
future Windows Phone 8.1 devices and you
know this is really interesting because
apparently one of the things we're
getting rid of as the back button as
Microsoft has confirmed that users find
it confusing and they're going to make
this part of the whole UI interesting
we're losing buttons now and they've
always complained about Apple just
having one button
your iPhone's but still apparently
another thing is that code will be
combined between Windows RT and Windows
Phone 8 so let's hope applications work
between the two which is just so logical
stay tuned for that and finally for the
very hot news of the day believe it or
not Microsoft is talking to Sam Sann
Huawei to convince them to bring windows
phone 8 devices to include Android as
well within and yeah that means Windows
RT products and Windows Phone products
which is really interesting so if you
think about it you'll now legally be
able to do a boot your current device in
the future which is awesome even though
we've been doing that for years with
Windows Mobile in the past though
Windows follows a different story but
still you know that leaves you to the
question of the day do you want the dual
booting windows phone with android in my
particular case I you know hey if it's
free of its included why not I just
don't find the practical use for it if
I'm gonna have to be dual booting I mean
if they can figure out a way to have us
open a window and have Android or open a
window and have Windows Phone the little
rock it'll be awesome but other than
that I don't think it's gonna be hot so
leave us a comment down below what do
you think friends of course for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and sour old
machine follow us on talking out our
