fun while we're wrapping up our full
moto g4 reviews we've gotten a number of
questions from folks on how the g4 plus
compares to the one plus three while
these two devices are aiming for
slightly different markets they are more
alike than they might initially seem
given the $100 price difference both
phones have 5.5 inch 1080p displays
AMOLED on the oneplus LCD on the
Motorola and fingerprint sensors below
those displays the oneplus has six
gigabytes of RAM to the Moto G 4 s 4
gigabytes of RAM but both have 64
gigabytes of built-in storage 3000
milliamp hour batteries and fast
charging solutions so what separates
these two devices first obviously is
processor power the oneplus 3 with a
Qualcomm 820 walks all over the Moto
with its lower power 6:17 the Moto is
plenty powerful to handle the basics
navigating the user interface scanning
your social media watching HD video it's
all good even playing moderately
graphics heavy games but the oneplus 3
simply out powers it in all categories
also for both phones arriving with 64
gigabytes of built-in storage the
Motorola does give media junkies the
ability to pop in a memory card for even
more space now camera performance is a
win for the oneplus 3 but these two 16
megapixel shooters are closer than we
would have thought the oneplus three
handles exposure a little better and the
camera processing comes out contrast
year but saturation is fairly similar
the Motorola camera app has improved
quite a bit over the last couple years
options are still really simple but we
do get full manual controls for
photography lower light shots are
interesting where the Moto lacks
Hardware stabilization but the oneplus
three still tends to jack the ISO higher
with a similar shutter speed and held
the Moto delivered a slightly darker
shot but there is a lot more chroma
noise on the 1 plus 3s photo for folks
who want to edit though the g4 plus
doesn't have an option to save RAW files
that we can find now moving to video the
Motorola only shoots 1080p at 30 frames
per second no 720p video no UHD no 60
frames per second options but you can at
least adjust exposure though the oneplus
3 has Hardware stabilization when trying
to hold still video from the two phones
is nearly the same in terms of jittery
handshake and
being at the display technologies these
screens are essentially a tie a 1 plus
moved to AMOLED this year and wins for
color saturation and contrast but the
Moto has a brighter LCD which is easier
to read outdoors and the sub pixel array
makes it a bit better for VR
applications or for folks who like to
keep their noses in their phones and
headphone playback is a substantial win
for the oneplus 3 as its posted some of
the best DAC and amp numbers we've seen
from any phone release this year the
Moto falls right in line with the galaxy
s7 which uses the built-in DAC included
with Qualcomm chipsets it's not bad it's
just noticeably outperformed by the
oneplus and will also give the
fingerprint sensor when to the oneplus 3
the larger sensor is easier to reach and
it's surprising that the g4 plusses
sensor doesn't double as a home button
once the screen is on and the phone is
unlocked this hardware appears to be
useless
lastly battery life between the two
lands really close running a media test
stream in 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 50% brightness the oneplus
drained 5 percent of its battery and the
moto drained 6 percent real-world usage
matches that benchmark his battery
longevity is too close to call between
the more powerful processor on the
oneplus and the brighter screen on the
motorola
recharge speed goes to the oneplus
though the Moto was snappy with a 42%
recharge after 30 minutes on the
included charger but the oneplus
achieved a 53% charge using the dash
charger in the same amount of time so
let's wrap this up where do we stand
between the Moto G 4 plus and the
oneplus 3 the exciting thing about a1
plus is the bang for buck pushing a
flagship processor into a mid-range
price tear the Moto G 4 plus is an
extension of that conversation
delivering many of the same terrific
lifestyle features at an even lower
price point $100 price difference here
certainly includes some benefits like
headphone audio quality in a faster
recharge rate but outside of folks
looking for the slightly better camera
performance or the better graphics power
the Moto gets us really close to what
many people might be looking for in a
daily driver phone the effects of lower
cost manufacturing are working their way
across the whole smartphone industry we
see the gap separating a $400 phone from
a $600 phone is shrinking and the gap
between a $300 phone
and a $400 phone is a roading - as

positive reinforcement for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos bag now some gadget guy
on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next comparison
