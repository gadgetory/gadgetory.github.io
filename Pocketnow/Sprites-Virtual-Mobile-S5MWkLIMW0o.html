pacquiao calm and a friend of mine
recently had to buy a new touch pro2
because he bricked his tighten too after
installing a glitch program there
apparently wasn't compatible with his
device well unfortunately for him he
never backed up any of his PIM data
which is his contacts SMS and other
information I asked him why you never
back to anything up and he said it was
just too much of a hassle to download
any backup software or to sink his
device to his computer luckily he had
some of his contacts saved to an older
phone and I showed him a simple
application called sprite backup which
lets you save everything to your memory
card which he was pretty appreciative
well sprite has created another
innovative backup process and the
program is called virtual mobile and
this is a beta program and it allows you
to save all of your contacts call
history pictures text messages calendars
and events on to their online server
called virtual mobile the premise is
similar to microsoft my phone but seems
a little more appealing and sprite has
been in the back of business for quite
some time now so they can be pretty much
trusted so before you can begin using
this program you will need to register
for a free account and i'll post Linkin
Park another calm as to how to do this
after registering you will be sent an
SMS message that will give you download
instructions to your windows mobile
device after downloading and installing
you will need to input your account
information and select your settings
like I've done here so I can also add
contacts and SMS and call history photos
and calendar and when you are done all
you have to do is hit ok and then we can
just sink now so it'll begin connecting
to their server of course this is going
to connect to media net because i'm on a
tMT's network ok so as you can see the
sync is complete and i will show you
online exactly what the program has
uploaded to the website ok so on the
website we actually see what we've
uploaded so today I've uploaded pictures
i also have uploaded some new
appointments upcoming appointments and
it shows you this on the right hand side
which is pretty neat and it'll also give
you all of your contacts so this is
pretty nice because you can just click
on each one but i'm not going to do that
right now because
I don't think all my friends want new to
see their phone numbers and you'll also
shoot the SMS messages that you've
received or sent out it also give you
call history but i'm going to show you
near that right now too if you want to
pick any day throughout any time of the
year you can also pick one of those so
if you have any any appointments in the
past that you'd like to see you can also
do that so this is virtual mobile and i
will post a link on par kinetic comments
on how to get this is a free program and
it's very easy to use unlike some
programs that back up online this one is
actually created by sprite back up the
makers of many backup programs thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
