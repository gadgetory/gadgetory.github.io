evening everybody and welcome to the
last bucket now live episode of 2013 i'm
anton the United managing editor and i'm
joined today by the editor-in-chief
brandon minimun all the way from the USA
I Brennan hello it's it's been a long
time since I've been here but Tony said
if I come on the live he will give me a
treat and I want to know if the treat is
what I said yes it is you said you give
me a tree why does the tree what well
I'll figure it out maybe I'll shoot you
over a liter of blanca what is glinka is
like moonshine right it says yeah the
Romania motion so gentlemen we because
since we don't have a lady not just yet
gentlemen we will have a shorter episode
this time because it's probably the last
time we are seeing each other in 2013
it's going to be a 45 minute episode and
we're going to talk about all things
2013 recaps and your prediction so
without any further ado I know I know
Brandon love this this sentence I'm
gonna hand it over to him yes alright so
I kind of want to hear from you guys you
know we did a series of articles about
our biggest disappointments of 2013 who
we thinks going to disappoint next year
who we think is going to win next year
and I kind of need from you guys and
know what you're expecting to happen
next year it's a huge year in mobile
because we're going to get a redesigned
iphone we're going to get a redesigned
galaxy s5 and a galaxy note 3 with a 2
year refresh cycle HTC there on the the
opposite end of that they're going to do
the the smaller refresh for the HTC One
to as we're calling it so big year in
mobile so let's go with Baldwin let me
see if I can unmute him yes and you
should be able to talk now ok good
morning hey morning everyone Hayward
where are you from so I'm originating
from Chicago but I went here in
California for vacation so it was almost
seven quite about seven seven in the
morning here so you can I don't you did
you get up early for the
irony of other things to do uh actually
I am switching the thing working this
nice so he's here for alive yeah I hear
so what to kind of frame the context
what what phone are you using so I had
an HTC One for tmobile last May and I
held it for six seven months and then I
I gotta know I i'm using my no i don't
know i look upon this this is a this is
a moto x for tmobile also that would
that I picked out out unfortunately a
week from when they mentioned they had
the $350 or under fifty dollar discount
oh so so you're using the Moto X right
now which is a phone that there's just
so much love for that phone but and
because there's so much love and because
it's such an important phone for
motorola and google they're going to
upgrade it next year where do you think
the upgrades will come do you think
it'll be screen resolution or battery
life or more customization stuff well i
was i was hoping for more about that
earlier basically my uh my workflow tim
wolfe not meeting demands but i'd like
i'd like my phone last like my old old
brick phones three days so well and
since they had the moat droid maxx for
verizon the I want them to bring them to
bring that the Moto X Baldwin or
whatever device I've got some advice to
make your phone last longer stop using
it just use it less yes and it's it's
funny though because like I'm sure
you've had days Baldwin where you use
your phone you know to check some email
make some calls like moderate use and at
the end of the day you still got a
little juice left and it's it's not that
bad or or do you just find that like
every day it's just it's dead by 1pm
well let's start well the thing is I've
started using smartphones with uh the
galaxy speak and that was a
disappointment and I manage my
expectations super for smartphone since
then
but so I you know that feeling when
before you could actually last your your
phone three days before a charge and I'd
like I mean you've improved screen the
solution you've improved processors
stick to that for probably for just a
year and use the use I guess even a
Snapdragon 400 or 600 and right bring
your battery in two three four hundred
thousand of 400,000 really am three or
four thousand five yeah I would love I
would love a 300,000 milliamp hour
battery that was and we probably start
off a jet plane out of that yeah you
could start of many cars with such a
large battery so so do you think that
there's going to be a focus on battery
life in in 2014 and if so where will the
savings come from I don't know uh well
with what are really doing so so good
with battery life on their phones they
should be pushing that instead of 40 or
I don't know even to gain for that
matter so you think that instead of
maybe going forward with battery
technology and having smaller and larger
capacity batteries OEM should probably
drop the specs and go with lower specs
but the same battery in order to get
longer better life is that yeah yes yes
I mean I'm go back to that time when we
we had our phones last three days oh
yeah I didn't I hope we would complain
about them being like slow well they're
not flow right now whoa there there was
a point I mean we there's like a line
drawn in the sand now where this year
phones almost every flagship every
flagship phone that was released
Snapdragon 600 or 800 is just fast it's
it's nice fast it responds as fast as
you can so there's really no need to go
to a higher higher spec processor unless
you increase the screen resolution which
is going to have the next
a 20-foot is it 25 24 40 x 1440
resolution at 2k is coming yester 2560 x
1440 they already have about that opal
and 78 thing or something right there's
some phone the n7 is is the tablet but
out there there is one phone out there
that has that insane resolution well we
want to talk more about screen
resolution because I'm I'm really
excited about 20 I got to get the exact
dimensions before 2560 x 1440 it's the
same as my 27-inch imac okay let me say
again tits 2560 x 1440 and that's the
capital q HD which is quarter 4k or
something like that all right well we're
gonna we're gonna thank you for for
coming on baldwin as is nice talking
much i appreciated happy holidays and
happy new year happy new year babe I
like it Brendon d do you think that we
we will this year start complained again
about the so-called two key I mean to K
is really full HD because depending on
who you ask people regard 1920 x 1080 s2
case so 2560 x 1440 is not really a 2k
but it's as they say half a 4k now with
720 going 1080 we said that there's no
need but we said that from qhd to 720p
to do you think will complain again
going from 1080p to that so-called 2k
well you know people are wrong about the
jump from 720p to 1080p because there is
absolutely a difference and and if you
put the other side taking care of it and
and if you put two phones side-by-side
720p screen and a 1080p screen with like
the difference is 330 PPI versus like
400 PPI 420 PPI you can still tell the
difference I think Steve Jobs was wrong
when he said that over 300 PPI is more
than enough because the more I look at
an HTC One for example i look at my
iphone a 326 ppi and i can i can tell a
difference it's not high resolution
but really from 1080p to 2k I come back
in a year and and want to punch myself
but I can't imagine that you can tell
the difference you know like what I mean
I mean text text might be slightly
sharper but but video is gonna look
probably the same you know we were
talking about just that i think it was
in the last week's episode and we were
asking some technical questions whether
regular 1080p content displayed on a
full screen 2k display would be inflated
and hence smoother but i think we'll
have to get Joe on that well you know
what I think might be interesting is you
know remember upscaling how held DVDs
which of course are like in less than HD
resolution were upscale to 1080p with
the progressive scan DVD players that
were out and you really didn't tell a
difference it still looked like crap I
mean the source has to be in high
resolution but people are saying that
upscaling to 4k because software has
improved because you have to be able to
fill in the detail kind of algorithmic
lee because there is no detail to start
people are saying that that's a lot
better so maybe maybe going from 1080p
to upscale 2k as something that might
actually look okay and then there are
the OEM applications like sony used to
do with the sharpening the edges and and
stuff like that let's see what hi Otto
thinks about this because I know that
he's a little bit more knowledgeable
than than the usual Tony I've gone hey
isn't awesome good to have you back yeah
that's gonna be back what do you think
about this old 1080 p qk Corey let me
take you to Devon's up your phone and um
well you know I think it uh I don't
think there's really going to be much of
a difference that you can tell on a
phone in terms of in terms of you know
seeing pixels like you can between 720
and 1080 ah but I watched a video from
marques Brownlee a couple days ago about
you talking about the Oppo find 7
and and uh just briefly touched on 2 K
versus can any fee on a phone and he
made the point that you know it's not
just about being able to tell the pic
from the parts yeah you can you can see
a different quality in the screen
whether you can tell officials or not
it's kind of like he said you know he
said it's like looking at a 1080p TV
versus a 4k TV it from a few feet away
you can't see the pixels on either one
but you can tell the poor kid looks
better I think I think that's because
like the 4k TV is newer and newer stuff
has better processing in it it's got
better panel technology so I think
that's a good point that the quality of
2k panels will be better maybe just
because they're coming out a year after
1080p I think it is is that what he's
suggesting yeah I think to a point I
mean it's a he she also made a point
that you know it's it's probably not
going to be the first the first 2k
phones probably are not going to be the
best phones in the same way the first
1080p phones like a droid DNA were not
the best phones they just didn't have
the horsepower to you know to keep up
with that because the the processors and
everything at the time were made for
1080p displays we're probably going to
have that same kind of effect with 2k
display so things like the Opera fine 7
are probably not going to be the best
phones but I mean they'll be a great
starting point and then you know
probably in that nearing the later half
of 2014 we're probably gonna see some
really good at 2k to high Crom think I'm
sorry gonna have to go ahead I don't I
personally think that the BPI rating on
the phones will make it or break it
because it all comes down to pixel
density a 4.7 inch 1080p display like
the one on the HTC One could probably
have a better overall image then say
seven inch or nine inch 2k display I'm
not saying a six-inch 2k phablet but it
also the BPI rating effects directly not
only the image but the sharpness of
content being displayed of course stuff
aside like technology
tft-lcd vs super amoled or contrast or
brightness or color reproduction talking
only about pixel density I think that's
the main thing which om's have to mail I
want to ask potentially a stupid
question and this may not be an
answerable question our vision people
you know 2020 vision if you could
ascribe a ppi to what you see I wonder
what it would be I really do I mean
maybe you want to find out the the
real-life BPI yeah like at what point do
you look at a picture unlike a big
display of this and you cannot tell the
difference Orson's real life aside like
LG's TFT LCD versus super-mo I have you
know surprised I was hearing myself at
one point talking i'm not i think i
think somebody covered that one time and
said it was somewhere around 300 maybe
330 really well then like yeah you're
right and i think that if we recall the
the iphone with the retina display
that's what Tim could try to emphasize
that's why they called it actually the
retina display because they said that
that gets as close as possible to the
higher limit of human vision and it's
true a 2020 vision most people can't see
above 300 ppi but some people have
Superman vision 20 15 2012 and they can
say you know they can see pixels on the
HTC One hi I'm so before you leave your
prediction for the first 4k phone when
are we gonna see it earth 4k phone um
did you see how but it how quickly
Brandon just jumped in and just forgot
about 2k yeah let's get skip past it
already come on I mean you know oppo
seems to be the pusher of the newer
screen resolution so possibly Oppo or
maybe a smaller company like you know
who like your company that just came out
with the first 2k phone before op oh
yeah yeah well what company is that I
think it was up oh and then it was HTC
with a butterfly oh it's like some
no-name company that just came out with
the yeah that's the just couple of weeks
ago you just insulted a lot of people
Brendan
oh well you know it's true it's a
no-name company it might be good Appa
was a no-name company and they they're
doing pretty pretty well this year a lot
of a lot of good press I have to thank
you very much for for joining us yeah
thanks for having me um hopefully i can
see you guys at CES yes we will be there
just drop us a tweet and we will
definitely meet up awesome until then
have an awesome awesome you here yeah
thanks for having me on guys take care
man see ya heah Tony before we continue
on what do you traditionally do on New
Year's Eve uh eat a lot drink a lot
party a lot not necessarily in this
particular order but yeah that's the
meat of it uh that would be a good
progression actually to it to assure
that you feel okay in the morning so do
you go to like do they have like like
parties that everyone has a party and
there's a all the time a restaurant or a
club who host a party and party actually
starts around noon when you're with the
family and you're having the lunch or
dinner and then you go to visit your
friends and then you gather with your
friends somewhere home you eat any drink
again and then at a certain point in
time nine or 10 or 11pm you go to your
reservation and then you continue
partying and next morning on the first
you wake up and then you pick up where
you left off and so on so I shouldn't
expect to hear from you on the first
well I'll probably be a little bit
hangover on my flight to Vegas on the
second but I'm counting on myself being
strong all right just stay safe I as
good as long as I'm not driving the
plane yeah um let somebody else please
don't drag the point all right let's
talk to Aaron and let me find him in the
list and unmute okay good morning good
morning Erin what do you have behind you
it looks like a bios box of some kind no
it's just a book shelf where I keep all
my spare computer parts nice while I was
talking about the telecommunications
nailed to the wall on that wooden plank
oh thank you
yeah that's the stuff yeah that where
your internet comes in it is I met my uh
my job so and and just just for me to to
feed my vanity what is your internet
speed haha 75 down 35 up okay so you
just fed my vanity and I have that I
have that exact change need and if i
could i guess you guys have verizon fios
there mm-hmm and if you do speedtest.net
you get like 80 down yeah it's wonderful
it's it's crazy I mean there was such a
jump in bandwidth from like 2006 to like
eight and you can get we just replaced a
t1 line that was one point five megabits
down and up I remember back in did you
use Napster back in the day no I'm not
that old haha well so so Napster you got
to select your connection speed because
it determined how fast your download and
upload was and they had they had dsl T 1
and T 3 and T 3 was like it was like a
thousand dollars per month and I think
actually the speed of t3 back then was
like ten down it's just unreal how far
we've come anyway Aaron we're talking
about 2014 in 2013 who what company
disappointed you in 2013 um HTC I I read
a lot of your reviews on the HTC One and
in the subsequent devices and I really I
like them but I just never have been
able to get on board with their software
um and just it they make a beautiful
phone but I feel like their software
really just turns people away yeah I you
know I kind of agree with you what
really helped was when the google play
edition HTC one came out because the rom
was leaked and so you could get any HTC
one root it and put on the google play
edition rom would that make you happier
haha um yes probably would I actually
have a galaxy note 2 right now um
and I I keep it with pretty much stock
software it's rooted and and all that
but it's still running TouchWiz um I'm
you up can you get a rom for the note 2
that's stock Android but also maintains
the basic functionality of the S Pen mmm
not really no that's a shame that would
be a great clip yeah would like even if
you didn't have air view and all those
other things if you could just use the
stylus as an input method with stock
Android that would be pretty great I
think I think there's a couple roms that
will let you use it like just to open an
application but you can't really use it
to for writing or anything like that no
pressure sensitivity or anything like
that yeah let me ask you something Aaron
you talked about the software side of
HTC phones do you think that the
software end of HTC phones is the only
thing HTC has to change for next year in
order to succeed hmm become argument
this because i think that software is as
brandon implied changeable you can flash
roms you can do anything with it plus
HTC is so invested in sense 5 and sense
5.5 and six with blinkfeed that i'm not
sure they will give up for me I think
it's the battery and it's the camera
I've heard rumors of the HTC One to
maintaining the same for megapixel
ultrapixel camera they have not learned
if the rumors are true so for me it
would be the camera so back to you well
um there's just two things yes I would
agree with the with the camera statement
it it really is a disappointment um but
you know Samsung has a huge market share
of just smartphones and I feel like it's
really just their advertising they have
advertised so well that people everyone
knows what the galaxy phone is but
nobody really knows what the HTC One is
true when you walk into the verizon
store it's not what you see you see the
motorola and the Samsung devices
everywhere and I don't understand
smaller sections I don't know each other
how that happens because you have HTC in
the beginning of the year saying that
they're going to spend my god
million dollars marketing the HTC One
but you know I saw this this tin foil
catamaran thing and Robert Downey jr.
and and like hey Bren listen hilarious
television commercial that's all right I
think that's like they tried to make
something that was viral and catchy but
i don't think anyone sits there and
thinks what does HTC really stand for
like no one cares if it if it stands for
hilarious tin foil commercial or
whatever you just said Tony um so what
what do you think they can do next year
too to do what they're supposed to do
this year um well I would like to see a
bigger refresh than it sounds like
they're going to do I'm just because I
think that they'll need it to compete um
the HTC One this year kind of just fell
flat and my opinion is is not to rebrand
the same product I believe in
redesigning and rebranding so that's
just my thought interesting and it's
interesting you say it fell flat because
in some sense it did in terms of no one
knowing about it but another another
sense it was reviewed positively across
every you know reviewing organization on
the planet and he's a really nice phone
it's a nice one except for the camera
which is so glad you guys bid because
despite people in in review saying that
this camera is not good HTC still
promotes it on facebook if you if you
like them on Facebook you see them in
your timeline camera camera camera but
the camera sucks i don't i don't
understand alright Erin well thank you
for thanks for talking and happy thank
you very much i look forward to 2014 and
so are we take care but let's let's talk
to sams i think Tony whoa whoa whoa whoa
yes yes before we talk to sams let's dr.
Brenda I you know I said so so what are
you still using the same devices that
you were using the last time I asked you
what devices your reason I
currently using the Lumia 1020 and the
story of me and the 1020 is interesting
because as much as I love Windows Phone
and as much as I love windows mobile I
was an MVP back in the day I couldn't
get my head around windows phone as it
is today because I'm heavily invested in
Google services i use google plus I've
got facebook pages to maintain so my
day-to-day operation required me to do
more than just answer emails or browse
the internet but I have somehow managed
to find a compromise and yes the 1020 is
now my daily driver not because of
Windows Phone because of the camera
because I take a lot of pictures and
everybody knows I'm a camera freak yeah
yeah you know I use the the 1020 for a
period of time this year and the camera
is mind-blowing but I need my photos to
be available on all my devices after I
take them and you just can't do that
with the 12 10 20 so what's your
workflow like to get the pictures off
your camera I'm either skies driving
them or I'm just using a cable to
download to my computer which is
sometimes mmm iffy because i'm using
macs and windows phone on a nokia phone
does not really play well with an apple
computer mm good point um yeah the sky
drives a good solution because there are
apps for iOS and Android for SkyDrive
and Windows but then it's only uploading
that 5 megapixels photoset it's like
it's like it's like it's like you're
going to or it's like a dead end street
with the ten pony for me well yeah but
there are also bros with that that
41-megapixel raw image not the raw raw
image but the Ford 41 megapixel image is
always there on your on your phone for
you to download on your computer or for
you to generate a new 5 megapixel image
by refocusing reframing and and all the
others stuff nakia talks about and brags
about and for good reason yeah ok now
let's go to sams let me unmute you and
ask you where are you from right I'm
from India you are from India welcome
yeah let me ask you the following thing
what's your best phone for 2013 and
what's the most anticipate
phone for 2014 in your particular case
ok so for 2013 I am a bit confused
between Nexus 5 and the HTC One so
you're talking about your best load of
2013 yeah so the nexus 5 can be a daily
driver with the stock android kitkat
running on it the down point is the
camera like it's not that good but it's
not the software update made a big
difference in it yeah now it's a quite a
bit fast but not as good as other
mobiles in the market it is it is funny
that you mentioned the Nexus 5 and the
HTC One and then you say that the nexus
5 has a board camera Brendan here's a
question for you you have used both the
Nexus 5 and the HTC One we know the
camera on the HTC One is not stellar do
you think the nexus 5 has a better
camera than the HTC One yes then low
light no but I mean at some point you
have to like weigh the pros and cons and
and I rather have worse low-light
performance and better general
performance than just terrible general
performance yeah yes so Sam's from what
I understand then maybe a google edition
HTC One would be the perfect phone for
you with stockings be done on the HTC
hardware yes okay and what are you
looking forward to in next year i'm
looking forward to coked displays as
there was a rumor from Samsung's Galaxy
s5 that they may be coming out with the
curved display except do you think dude
you rather have a curved display like
the flex LG flex or like the galaxy
round galaxy round because actually that
would be fun to use and it will be a new
technology so dlg flex is good but I
would rather prefer
a newer technology like a bit more
curved you're actually the first one who
prefers a side to side rather than a
top-to-bottom curvature it's interesting
do you think it will help you in your
day-to-day usage I mean if you use your
phone and landscape mode then it will be
a little bit weird to see the video like
this uh yes can be like I guess um it it
it also depends Tony I think if you use
the phone to make calls a lot because in
that case the Flex is more natural but
if you're doing more typing I think the
round might be a little bit more palm
palm fitting you're holding with in time
I fail to see any advantages of curved
screens on phones so I said that I'm
saying it i will continue saying that
maybe on a larger screen maybe i'm a
tablet probably yes oh maybe owes the
ultimate is when you can take a phone
that's flat and you say i feel like i
had 12 beaker so you curve it right
there and then you curve it more and
more mana that i can agree to yes Sam's
well how about data are you a tablet guy
are you using something right now I am
on the ipad 2 still but i was planning
on upgrade to the ipad air all rather
the ipad mini wouldn't read in his plate
so we are you a hardcore apple fan or is
it just that the you have an ipad and
you want to keep it iPad because i was
about to ask you wouldn't it be smarter
to wait and see what happens at CES and
maybe at mwc before you make the
purchase yes yes sure sure the tortoise
it's our decision between the air and
the mini with retina display which way
are you leaning I was leaning onto the
mini because it's handy yeah yeah I
think that's the better choice that the
the slight downside is that the ipad air
screen is slightly more colorful than
the ipad mini but you don't even notice
it after you use it for a while so I
think the mini with retina Spy is a good
choice yeah okay Sam's before we move on
do you have any final
thought no final thoughts no final
thoughts in this case I will wish you a
Happy New Year and I hope to see you
around in 2014 as well yeah thank you my
man bremen back to you Tony yes please I
have a question please should uh well
it's not a question it's a it's it's
more of a it's a prediction I have and
I'm wondering if you agree or disagree
with okay let me ask you something hey
Brendon don't you have a prediction you
want to share with us yes yes let me put
put it forward now I think 2014 will be
a year of a new industry created and
that is smart watches and you might say
well maybe it was already created this
year you've got the pebble and you've
got the galaxy gear but I I think we are
in the two thousand six days of how do I
say that we we are in the early days of
the SmartWatch just like in 2006 there
were smartphones but they all sucked and
then what happened 2007 well and I if I
may quote you on that and I think one of
the beaches our recap pieces for 2014 or
maybe it was for 2014 predictions you
said that the SmartWatch industry will
not take off until Apple releases the
iWatch and redefines the entire concept
why do you think that Apple is the one
who sets the mark because you look at
the pep o and you look at the galaxy
gear and they all have so many
compromises their third sis there's
there's battery life their screen
technology the fact that these screens
are flat why would you want a flat
screen on your curved wrist that doesn't
make sense why would you want to plug in
your watch every day I know the pebble
goes several days without needing a
charge but i think that the i think the
the watch industry is is is perfect for
for a reimagine a shin of the total
concept i think apple is going to do
release a watch that it's completely
different and I think they're going to
do something with kinetic charging where
it trans it creates motion in your wrist
and it charges the battery as you use it
throughout the day which will be as
freakin revolution if you think about it
and
then they're going to put that
technology into the iphone you know they
are and you know they have a patent on
it so no one better copy that so what if
what if somebody beat LG to the market
like LG has the g flex which we all know
what is and now recently we've heard
rumors of a trademark of the LG G arch
SmartWatch how about that yeah you know
what LG is gonna do is they're gonna do
the obvious they're going to make a
curved screen that's going to be like
the Galaxy gear oh you can swipe there's
like a camera I mean this is all obvious
you and I could sit in the room and come
up with a galaxy gear and the LG watch
or whatever it's so unimaginative it's
it's literal it's literally shrinking a
phone to your wrist and you can't do
that it needs to be rethought from the
ground up so you think it's up to Apple
to either come up with something new or
convince us that whatever they make is
whatever we need like they did with the
iPad nobody wanted the tablet until the
iPad and then Steve Jobs said that
that's why we are here because we need
to show customers what they really need
yeah I think it's the first thing I
think is up to them to do the innovation
I think Samsung had their chance they're
not going to start from this from
scratch and what other company out there
as the imagination and the resources to
really do an amazing all the resources
there are a lot of companies having the
resources but it's it's that tricky part
when you have to combine imagination and
the resources both of them together
that's the tricky part that's the tricky
part ah pick somebody else before our
eyes I want to talk about smart watches
because I think it's very interesting
let's talk to Kelvin let me find him in
the list and unmute him try now Calvin
hello oh hi I hear you where are you
from Kelvin I'm not from the United
States so nice yes Bart hi i live in
maryland maryland not too far from here
I mean I'm up in Philly ever been to
Philly no well it's kind of lame here
they've bagged the cheesy but that's
that's pretty much it okay Kevin what do
you what do you think about smartwatches
do you have a pebble or a galaxy gear
you want one or do you care right now
not so much well I mean I remember I
used to like Wandy um the Chinese type
of smartwatches they could make college
fit but now not much not not so much
anymore because I don't think dear
perfected until there's a SmartWatch
witches um I should say almost as good
as I think a SmartWatch should be I
don't really care that much of a smart
watches right now hey Kevin did you see
that lame samsung galaxy gear ad hahaha
I want on this lift no I haven't seen it
but I've heard of it search for lame
galaxy gear it's a three minute video of
like some some guy trying to win over
some girl with his watch and it just it
oh no planet would that be the case all
of those scenarios they're just they're
just that it makes the technology look
so intrusive rather than like passive
and you know you kind of but but I'm
with you that you know I'm kind of
sitting on the sidelines and waiting for
or whatever is going to happen next do
you think speaking of wearables do you
think that a google glass and other
similar products are going to be very
popular in 2014 yes I actually do
believe um products like Google glass
would be e come very popular in
14 as long as they have a good price um
I I personally am interested in Google
glass but uh um as long as Google makes
a good price way I'm pretty sure
everyone would like it because it's how
much it is how much willing to pay for a
google glass um um about at most four
hundred dollars so 400 us out that's a
lot I'm surprised you said what would
you why would you get a google glass
what would you want to do with it um I
guess I'd show off to people you'd show
off to people well it's easy for you
because you already have glasses so you
can just attach the thingy and you're
good to go yeah Stefan tree that would
be pretty cool um and then of course
they're doing the prescription glasses
so that you know you can get your
prescription and stuff I'm also
interested in Google glass because I'd
like to like I thinking of sometimes I
think about how to be able to implement
it in school like in school work so for
example like I'm doing Matt a and like
that kind of stuff I a mean I think
would be awesome if they could find a
way to bring it to schools just like a
way now you're trying to bring tablets
into schools I think and I want to pick
Brendan's brain on this I think that the
entire Google s concept was a proof of
concept and I'm not saying it will die
but we will not see a huge development
in that particular wearable market what
do you think Brendan yeah I'm kind of
with you on that i think it was i think
google put something out there to see
how much enthusiasts in there would be
for it and there has been a lot of
enthusiasm on a one to ten I'd say
there's a seven or an eight and I think
that they were looking for a nine or ten
to aggressively develop it and make it a
mass-market product in fact they were
supposed to come out with a mass-market
product by the end of 2013 worth a yep
that was like so I think that says
something about its future you know you
can still buy one for 15
hundred bucks but i don't think anyone
well a lot of people have bought them of
course I'm really skeptical about this
wearable idea I think that it tries to
get out of the way uh in terms of you
know you know something your phone out
of your pocket or even glancing at your
wrist you just live your life but in
fact I think it gets in the way I think
it makes it ten times worse if I'm
having a conversation with you and I've
got this cameras staring at your face
it's it's just weird it's it's gonna
it's going to be a while i think maybe
maybe in in three or four years but i
don't think society is ready for
everyone to put on this headgear Calvin
do you think 2014 will be the year of
phones of tablets or wearables I found a
phone so you think that will see
innovation yet again what do you think
what do you predict for next year um I
predict a finally 64-bit processing for
android um 2k displays and yeah that
that has a high chance of happening with
the Snapdragon 400 410 I think that's in
five now the fourth that is actually the
first quad-core processor for quote from
Qualcomm and they will probably show or
bit you said quad core I'm sorry for
64-bit yeah yeah very good well Kelvin
thank you for joining us and thank you
for your predictions you'll have to come
back and let us know if you are you were
accurate appreciate it thanks many to
you later MA oh hey yeah hey yeah Tony
yes please i was about to get the last
full but in case you have 10 more
minutes we can talk a little bit more
and then have that alaska yes I wanted
to ask you some questions you ready this
is this is my this is my answering face
um I want to talk about the iphone 6
okay and you know for years now there
have been rumors of bigger screen died
phones there are rumors of the iphone 6
of a bigger screen there are rumors that
there will be mold
models one with you know a smaller
screen one with the bigger screen and
getting the finally going to make a
bigger screen iphone this year I said
that there will be no way on planet
earth that Apple has a smaller iPad and
yet we have a smaller iPad I think that
if Apple really wants to stay on the
market and really wants to hold on to
that declining market share which they
have and wants to stop the decline they
have to bump the screen size because
even a mini feel like the one mini or
the galaxy s4 mini is at this point
larger and screen size or equal to the
iphone 5 or 5s so I think they need to
go with the flow have a new product
maybe will not call it phablet and I'm
sure it will be innovative but I think
at the same time they will keep the
regular iphone so they'll probably have
to display sizes which will be
completely strange for Apple but they
have to do it are they going to bump the
resolution for the larger mount
absolutely yes really it's not gonna
piss developers off well they they were
pissed off when when they went from the
iphone 4s to the iphone 5 and maybe they
will not make it any taller but maybe
they would find a compromise like maybe
two cages doubling the iphones
resolution as it is today and then sold
everything with pixel doubling yeah i
think that's the only reasonable course
of action because then they can do pixel
doubling so that would be what would the
resolution be we would go in the top of
my head I could not tell you it's going
to be 1920 x what's he at 646 40 times
to this is going to be a weird
resolution 1920 x 1280 all the iphone
five resolutions is weird as it is now
and the four and the 4s resolution was
also i oh yeah i was doing the wrong
math anyway so um Tony why don't you
take the last car okay let us talk to
Matthew Matthew let me uh unmute you
okay you did it yourself welcome like
thanks validate where are you from um
for the cable it in France you're from
the UK but you live in friends what do
you want wrench a yes I did I've benefit
nearly 10 years excellent
and and and I think you've got a little
bit a little bit of both vaccines there
from French and British I get that some
sense I wanted to ask you if you have a
specific topic about what you want to
talk about or should we just go with
some predictions for next year since
this is the main topic of the day
available and may be able to wondering
if you ever think Google Play business
works Kamali you come on the US cos I've
I'm ready HTC one I love it but why
Google why are they available out for
you but you and me like oh I know your
remaining yeah I I think that reason
behind that is the exact reason why you
are not available to purchase devices
from the Play Store but in five or six
countries I think that there's a
specific nuttin I think this is a
specific marketing reason for that but
thankfully you can have a google play
edition Rahman that thanks to XDA
developers or action not so proud a mad
let me switch to you and the issue it
again using action yeah yep so I think
you will not be able to purchase one
officially in in your country or in my
country or anywhere else outside of the
US but thankfully we can do that now
yeah and by the way I'm 11 the first 4G
networks in our in our even a whole
country which I'm probably the only one
in the whole area within 20 miles using
it and what are you receive a prime
probably an hour from the city and about
20 down and five up whereas my blonde
Lions like five down and one up he
should you should enter your phone to
your computer yeah well I would but my
kids per month oh my she's like nine
eggs yes that's a lot of data Wow how do
you even know him closed well we can get
16 here and how much how much do you pay
for it I don't okay and how much does a
regular person living there pay for that
about 30 to 40 good
that's acceptable euros hmm that's Excel
and sigh what I'm at another's x yeah
it's about 50 bucks that is really
really good with unlimited minutes and
the Melissa Tait text and actually if
you go over you just get startled Wow no
overage charges how can somebody get
over nine gigs well I do batteries what
would you really like to stream youtube
videos all day long no no no just
watching your guys oh I'm sorry it's our
fun well don't you try to use Wi-Fi when
possible well the I have Wi-Fi because
i'm in college university harm but then
you record proxy and the speed is worse
than my home connection I was about to
see Brandon would you use Wi-Fi with a
4G connection with 20 megs down and a
man get per month allowance would you
ever turn on Wi-Fi I mean not not in his
situation where the Wi-Fi is slow but if
the wifis fast then you know its battery
savings data savings she at university
seem faster because it's like 40 down
and 20 up gosh so uh let's move to the
prediction and recap stuff so uh yeah
seaking them I think I've so critics
muffins well it's kind of become a well
if you think about everyone has one its
its consumer super super bowl now no no
one really thinks about it well it
depends on where you want it true Julia
and idea and again in sort of yeah
Wesson's so countries smaller okc and
but i think probably more likely
wearables and you know and sort of life
bring the prac the repressed performance
ratio down light up like to make it like
motogp example that brought pretty
decent specs for like next to nothing
for most people brandon he's right up
your alley with the wii remorse around
yeah that's you made a good point about
the motorola G we really didn't talk
about that but that really I think
changed things and change the way that
pricing might be done next year maybe
we'll see the continuation of these
great yet budget devices that are
capable and very affordable that'll be
awesome I just wish that the Moto G had
a better camera yeah Matthew what do you
think who's gonna have the hottest
fastest best smartphone next year I love
physically referring to best-selling one
but the the best smartphone which will
answer your mind Brandon and the rest of
us our needs personally I'd say HTC
unfortunately it looks like that start
this financial markets it disagree with
me because they make it yet they make a
pretty phone but they no one sees it
like it's not selling anything because
there's a lot of comments like people
seeing that you know I would have bought
the HTC One if it had an SD card
expansion or if it had a battery which
was removable but I think that that's
just a small but but but actually
something forget about this is that
that's this little fella I can have an
SD card this fashion and the USB Drive
because the USB on-the-go which is a
long pure for that that's another thing
you have air in your pocket maybe losing
Remini or one little thing that to me i
displease family young net and and also
one who sees it I've actually HTC phones
if i put pretty much sue sees as a as
USB storage as if it was in it internal
SD card and here i can play videos and
stuff in it it's just like a little
still sticking out yep and also sony has
that new USB thing but i don't see
myself carrying something like that
would you bring them no I don't like
extremities on my devices
I always figured you'd be the guy who
has some some sort of a bling bling gap
thing on a lanyard on your phone I may
use differ charging up I feel of all I
must have the original Nexus 7 still in
KitKat and that she is fun it's already
two different operating systems I think
it's actually the difference and I use
USB on-the-go made to charge use this
pinch the battery and pull it into this
I far something as a charger so
basically I've got a big giant battery
to go what is your biggest tech wish for
2014 Oh a universal messaging system
that everyone can use for example I'm on
Android baby as a show here but all my
family's life my phones and all the hell
uses I message and yeah there was like
oh I message me like no I'm on Windows i
won and what are the cup as platform
solution yeah but whatever one of people
will accept yeah I'm with you there
Matthew because same thing with me I
everyone all my family members all my
friends use iPhones and that's one of
the main reasons i use an iphone you
know fifty or sixty percent of the year
and when i go to android i like go dark
they can't send me pictures and videos
and like it dis around just in case shut
i pod the touch nice running i was six
no Bothans the classic hey yeah um well
we'll talk about that later alright
nothing will thank you um thank you for
joining us and for uh thank you you guys
are modified my just promote the show
down below you do it promote your
channel marketing ok now you are locked
I i will apologize it's is been stagnant
for a year by my new resolution is to
get back into making videos and making a
regular basis rather than just once a
year there's I got about a city that
subscribers but they haven't had
anything for a year so like get some
videos out and it's going for a cruise
channel do it yeah thank you Mary
content coming and happy can say oh whoa
hey hey Tony you want to wrap this up
first I want to ask you what your new
year's resolution is well I had a pretty
big list for 2013 out of which I have
ticked off every entry so I'm probably
the the one thing which I want to do
next year is to move into a different
location to either purchase or lease an
apartment but I'm else I'm pretty much
set that was bored I know it was boring
but for this year for instance I wanted
to lose some weight and I lost 30 kilos
I wanted to change my car and I did I
wanted to be more successful in what I'm
doing professionally and you and I know
that I managed to do that and of course
quitting smoking or stuff like that is
always on the list and it will always be
on the list but that aside I might not
left with any more stuff I can wish for
i just hope i will remain healthy and
strong and the rest I can take care of
myself well that was more interesting
there you go and what what do you wish
for 2014 oh well I don't really do new
years resolutions I figure that it's
always fun to do them and to write them
down because next year you look back and
you'll see that you failed some of the
points yeah but my perspective is that
if you want to make a change in yourself
you start today not on january first
gonna lose weight don't eat the doughnut
if you want to be more successful we're
a little harder today you know I mean
like I think I think I new year's
resolutions are a little bit of a
cop-out which is why most people don't
do it because if they were gonna do it
they do it today they would start today
and so I don't think then to agree with
you there yeah but for census for a
sense of playing along I need to lose a
little weight you know I 30 killers I
would disappear but maybe maybe it will
be 10 pounds or something I have become
fond of the desert you know and my wife
likes to feed me so you know whatever
combination wife is leading to come the
gym and eat as much as you were yeah
there's these pages
any final thoughts when I think that's
what I'm looking forward to 2014 maybe
CES is around the corner next week by
this time next week I'll be on a plane
on my way to Vegas baby asleep or she is
I think Sony is going to have a new
phone new tablet I think she is is gonna
be like it was like it was last year
yeah there's going to be a lot of
tablets and a lot of Chinese
manufacturers are trying to become
successful successful dumb I think we
want like that you think about shaving
it i think yeah I think Samsung will
continue to have its own advantages you
know hydrazone events and kind of ignore
CBS rusty desk hopefully there will be
so now the regime announces that English
crossed yours brother I should I we die
well happy when I was like I think
everybody of me out here today or have a
full of the elephant we will be here in
twenty fourteen again everybody thank
you very much of a range charter Blanca
ground or go to meet you again next year

years and with that Brenda net
