the 1+5 have just emerged visually
iPhone 8 rumors have begun to debunk the
theory of an iPhone 7s and it seems that
Fitbit has already gotten into some
explosive troubles of its own
I'm hi Mary Vera and this t-shirt makes
it at all difficult for you to take me
seriously I'm sorry I just I I couldn't
help myself this is PocketNow daily the
official news today start with the
product I would have loved to cover on
an April Fool's Day bear with me here
Amazon has just announced its new echo
look I I know the name is just okay so
here's what it is it's a camera that
you're able to use to take photos of
yourself so that you can see how you
look it's even got this smart
application that helps you decide with
clothing to wear so instead of buying a
mirror that will cost you a lot less
than the $200 at this camera cost you
now have a smart nerd to a certain
degree you can even use this in
conjunction with an application to tell
you which clothing fits you better this
is probably one of the most vain
products I've seen I can't wait to see
if this becomes another fire phone other
official news have to do with the Casio
WS D F xx the product that I told you
would CES that you know what the w SD
f10 should have always been this from
day one
well the F xx is now available on so it
cost you the same $500 SPF 10 the
difference is that it now has everything
that the f10 didn't have like a
standalone GPS in addition to
applications that actually work because
now it runs on Android 2.0 Android wear
two dot oh that would be so we cannot
wait to get our product and tell you
more about it in our review but so far
from everything that I saw at CES it's
kind of worth it now let's move the
spotlight over to Fitbit the company
that sells the most wearables in the
world is apparently having a lot of
trouble with explosions on wearables and
this is something you actually don't
want happening to you we've got photos
of people that already have burns in
their arms and even though the cases are
isolated meaning there aren't that many
it is
you know something to worry about
particularly because this is happening
with the Flex - which is the product the
company sells the most so we can't wait
to hear what's going on here as well the
spotlight over to the iPhone 8 and
iPhone 8 plus and believe it there are
hotter news today that'll happen later
we've got some trusted sources claiming
that apparently there is an iPhone 8 and
there is an iPhone 8 plus meaning the no
holds bar full design all amazing phone
is apparently going to be the flagship
and it makes you wonder exactly what is
going to happen to the iPhone 7s so my
personal theory is that it does make
sense that right now Apple is still
prototyping it's kind of early for the
company to make a final decision over
what it's going to do so it makes all
the sense for the company to want to
jump all the way to the 8th and for the
company to launch a 7 s meaning a more
powerful 7 as the mid-tier or I don't
know what you would want to call this
one to also launch alongside just to
prevent the 7 meaning there could be
some interesting feature that the 7
won't be able to do that the 7s would
probably do stay tuned we'll keep you
posted
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the possible one plus five
we've got the first possible leaked
render of the phone and it looks a lot
like the one plus three T which is
actually great but it seems that it
brings a dual camera now bear in mind
the only complaint that I had with the 1
+ 3 T during our review was the camera
which got fixed to a certain degree with
nougat but it still is not the best
camera out there particularly for a
phone that wants to compete with
flagships so if this is the case that
oneplus is finally figured out the
camera and a dual camera will be the
approach I can't wait to see that but it
leads me to the question of the day how
about if you tell us what would your
wishlist be for the 1 + 5 what would you
love this phone to have in my case
honestly I just wanted a 1 + 3 T with a
better camera that was it and why not
add some water resistance I mean
honestly 1 plus if you would charge me a
little more money for a 1 + 5 + +
that will include water resistance I
would be totally on board leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion brands you know the way it
goes if you want to get bit looser li ER
