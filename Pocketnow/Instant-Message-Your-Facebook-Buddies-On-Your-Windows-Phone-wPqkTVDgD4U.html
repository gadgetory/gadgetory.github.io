the facebook website from your internet
browser on your mobile device and you

show you that right now ok so as you can
see after you've loaded the program and
logged in it'll show you your online
friends and which ones are available to
chat so I can chat with Eric right here
and just double click and then I can say
hey how's it going and you can either
hit Send or hit enter and wait a second
frame to respond so as you can see he
responded he says pretty good how are
you doing I'm good and send that
says oh good what are you doing well

MFA's book comm link directly from this
program you can also go to the phone
book for your contacts online to

the website you can also go to the
developers website and make a donation
if you prefer another cool feature about
this is it allows you to take photos or
videos directly from your windows mobile
device and post them to your wall or
profile picture so if you wanted to post
something to our wall we can go onto
here and it will take us into our photos

second there we go it's done okay so
that's pretty cool you can it's pretty
nice to be able to update your photos

change your update status so how do I
work the instant message freeing for
facebook that was my question a couple

free and it's from XDA developers and i
