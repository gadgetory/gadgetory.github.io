pocket now calm and this is the software
and features video for the eaton glofish
be 900 most of windows mobile devices
that are coming out have some kind of
interface replacement that covers up the
boring plain ordinary difficult to use
windows mobile interface so you have
touch flow and touch flo 3d and the sony
ericsson xperia x1 will have its own
kind of interface replacement and on the
glofish be 900 we have spb mobile shell
which is a little bit cheating because
you can get spb mobile shell for any
windows mobile device but we like mobile
shell because of what it does to your to
the interface here so we can go from
screen to screen by swiping our finger
we can see our favorite people here the
next pain is programs and we get really
neat animations in spb mobile shell this
isn't really eat NS doing this is just a
piece of software that's been out there
for a long time but it's a really nice
addition out of the box this is what the
today's screen looks like it's a little
bit cluttered for my taste it puts some
programs here that you can launch in
that sort of thing there's a soft button
down here for spb mobile shell which
will take you into the screen that i
just showed you i'm going to exit there
there's a speed dial button which will
bring up a little blue squares that you
can assign to people that you call quite
often so that's good okay now I'm going
to go into the start menu and show you
some things the starter menu is not
touch friendly unfortunately all the
entries are kind of small requiring you
to use your stylus to kind of select an
item because it's more precise I'm going
to go into office mobile to show you the
on-screen keyboard options that come on
the v nine hundred and obviously this is
the standard Windows Mobile on-screen
keyboard but II 10 includes one keyboard
called easy keyboard and it's really a
bad name for it because this is not an
easy keyboard it's not even a standard
QWERTY keyboard layout and it's very
difficult to use so I'm probably going
to stick with the standard regular
keyboard it's unfortunate that there's
no good on-screen keyboard because
obviously this device doesn't have a
standard hardware keyboard that you can
use to type looks like we're have to use
something like touchpal to fill that
void okay so let's go into the program's
menu all the icons look very sharp it's
a VGA screen the white is very white
there's a lot of contrast it looks good
this device like the samsung omnia has
an accelerometer that works in any
program so let me show you what that
looks like I'm going to zoom out a
little bit in pen and then I'm going to
tilt the device and it's a very fast
screen rotation it's actually probably
faster than the HTC touch pro but how
fast is it well let's compare it to the
samsung omnia I think that would be a
really good comparison so I'm going to
turn on the omnia and I'm going to make
sure we're in the same screen I'm going
to get to the program screen alright
let's see which one's faster 1 2 3 I'm
gonna need a little bit of help there
let's try it again let's go the other
way looks like the v9 hundreds faster it
doesn't have that fancy screen rotation
so it doesn't look as cool but it it
snaps into place very fast very fast
screen rotation speed on the v nine
hundred and there are a few settings
that will allow you to change the
sensitivity of this and so on I'll show
you that in a little bit all right now
the program's let's go through some of
these programs games GPS it's all
standard stuff but in multimedia we have
some interesting things this device can
actually act as an FM transmitter so
that if you are in your car and you have
music on your storage card you can
switch to a certain band that you see on
the screen and you can tune into that
and hear the music from your device
pretty nice so you don't have to buy a
standalone FM transmitter it's pretty
unique feature and then we have FM tuner
which makes use of the antenna you're
probably hear static right now because
we're on the euro band that got to
change that back to us it doesn't stay
on the right one for some reason and I'm
going to open up the antenna and you'll
hear it gets pretty clear and what's
great is that it's got a feature called
auto scan so if i go to my favorites and
I go down here through auto scan what
does I'll do is it'll scan for the most
clear stations in the area and the
result is that you get a list of all
these stations that come in pretty clear
and we're indoors right now so this is
pretty good for being indoors listening
to radio on a woman's mobile device to
the right of that is mobile TV player
which allows you to get DV dvb-t it's
hard hard thing to say TV broadcast if
you live in Europe or Asia or other
parts of the world pretty much anywhere
but the United States and I'll show you
that in a second so here we said we have
a drop-down to select the region and if
we select try to select the region
United States isn't anywhere to be seen
on this list of course so unfortunately
we're not able to test that feature okay
moving on to the right we've named card
manager which is that program that will
allow you to take a picture of a
business card have the text converted
and saved as a contact I haven't tested
that yet but I will for the full review
coming up soon let's go down the list
phone we have nothing terribly
interesting a link to SMS speed dial and
that sort of thing going over to
utilities we have a button that will
allow us to hard reset the device we
have a backup utility very simple backup
utility doesn't do that much it's not
like sprite backup or spb backup or
anything like that down here we have an
interesting program called memory
optimization what you can set it to do
is automatically reset your device at a
certain time every day the reason being
because you get programs in in system
memory and you may want to reboot just
like you would want to reboot your
computer after a few days I really don't
see the need for this hopefully the V
900 won't need to be reset every few
days I mean this is a very high-end
device and also you can set it to
restart after a certain amount of memory
is reached or gets to a certain point
all right let's move down the list we
voice commander instead of microsoft
voice command so you have to train this
one unfortunately let's go in the
communications manager Communications
Manager is well done it's it's skinned
with this kind of blackish color scheme
very finger friendly going down the list
further we have an SP be SBB menu over
here settings for the spb mobile shell
and then we have streaming player which
allows you to look at videos from ma
youtube com out of the box when those
mobile doesn't let you
videos and that's pretty much it let me
take you into the settings menu where
there are some interesting entries okay
there's nothing in the first tab but in
the second tab we have some settings for
the accelerometer so we can change the
sensitivity of it but we can also set
exceptions which is really neat so if
you're in a certain program and you
don't want the accelerometer to work you
can turn it on here this is something
that the S that the samsung omnia should
have because there are some applications
like the phone or perhaps your inward
mobile you don't want it to go into
landscape you always want it to be in
portrait this is a great way to do that
going down the list further we have
other standard things and then we have
TV out settings fortunately this devices
come with the cables needed to do TV out
so we have standard you know red yellow
and white and then on the other end is
just standard mini-usb like so and then
there is a pass-through mini USB port so
you're not blocking your mini USB port
you can use it still to charge or sync
or anything like that even if it's
connected to a projector or a monitor
and you're using up yours using the TV
out functionality the interface is
pretty simple you can turn on the TV out
you can change the TV format the
resolution comes out as vga you can't
change that it you can't scale above VGA
and that's unfortunate because on a you
know a flat panel TV it doesn't look
that clear
and finally on connections we have
nothing really usual here again we have
a connection manager and that sort of
thing I got the this device to work on
hsdpa here in the United States working
on AT&amp;amp;T because it has the UMTS 850
bands so that's that's good news and
finally a note on performance you
probably have seen by now that the
performance of this device is very good
it's got a 533 megahertz Samsung
processor the screens come up quickly
the screen rotation is quite fast it's
almost instant I don't want to use that
word because instant is instant this is
not instant but it's it's very fast all
in all I'd say the software on this
device is solid though it's buggy at
times there are times when it doesn't
come out of standby or it becomes
unresponsive which it really shouldn't I
think it's just a matter of getting the
ROM right and I think eaten will issue a
new rom sometime soon we've got a lot
more to cover on the e10 v 900 it'll be
covered in full on the review at
pocketnow.com coming up in a few days
but that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
