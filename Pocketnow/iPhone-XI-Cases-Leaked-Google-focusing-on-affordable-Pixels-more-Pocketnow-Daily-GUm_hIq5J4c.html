liking are apparently already being
blessed by case makers Google seems
committed to giving us more a
smartphones which we understand means
affordable and Huawei is going all out
with 5g wouldn't have been happening
pretty much a week from now I'm Jaime
Rivera and Google i/o is over we still
are going to stay here with Google in
San Francisco more to come on that this
is PocketNow Daly the official dousset a
begin once again I don't understand that
this is a pattern or what more Apple
deals the new air pots the brand new
ones if you want them 140 dollars on
Costco if you want to get the wireless
charging case that's gonna cost you a
hundred and eighty in combination still
it continues to be the thing where Apple
product continued to be discounted
finally Apple now let's talk about 5g
and Huawei as the company has just sent
out press invitations for an event to
happen in London May 16 and from what
the reports and from what we have it's
apparently going to be a 5g event
reports have it that this is going to be
that 5g variant that was leaked of the
mate I think it was the may 20 X I
believe whatever the case may be stay
tuned I mean it's already starting now
let's move the spotlight over to Android
q obviously there are so many good
changes that are coming to it but there
are also some changes that a lot of
people did not notice and well that
wasn't really disclosed by Google
Android Beam is dead for those of you
that were using Android Beam which i
think is only like three of us because
Android Beam was so terrible it's now no
longer we don't have an alternative
except what you have in the files
application which is actually quite
seamless if you know how to use it but
yeah Android Beam it was nice to not
meet you and let's continue talking
about Google there have been more
interviews there have been more
discussions with executives the company
is confirming that they are committed to
affordable smartphones affordable pixels
at least for the time being so I guess
we now understand what the a stands for
in pixel 3 a pixel 3 affordable seems
that whatever other phones we're gonna
be getting going forward they will
continue with this mentality of giving
us the high-end and giving us the
mid-tier that actually is also capable
of the
which is good news I'm really having a
great experience of the 3/8 and finally
the hottest news today I have to do with
iPhones and the designs we don't want
pretty much whatever case makers get the
hold of molds and everything this is
when we pretty much have a confirmation
of what the design is going to be it's
kind of early which makes me wonder if
it's that we're getting this phone at
WWDC which I I don't think it's gonna
happen the last time there was an iPhone
announced at WWDC was the iPhone 4 so
now I don't think that's gonna be the
case right now but yeah the stove design
which is horrendous
but let us know in the comments down
below as this has progressed I mean have
you started liking the design more or
less because in my case I mean I can't
believe this is coming out of the oven
from Apple I honestly I don't like it
that's just me leave us a comment down
below let me know your opinion friends
again if you want to get the news
earlier follow us I'm talking about
comments if you have to put our channels
English and Spanish for more videos like
this one you follow me on twitter hi
managers quarter dead are on instagram
at hey Matt Lee better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I'm hanging out with it I think so
much for watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
