in Las Vegas now let's see what the
Samsung Galaxy Tab pro 10.1 is all about
i'm michael fisher with pocket now let's
unbox it and as I mentioned Lydon folks
at the Samsung Galaxy Tab pro 10.1 the
Wi-Fi only version with 16 gigs of
storage because Wi-Fi only we're not
seeing a Snapdragon 800 processor in
there when in fact seeing a Samsung's
calling at one point nine gears
quad-core and at one point three
gigahertz quad-core processor it's the
big little it's the Exynos 5 octa if you
want to call it that with a 10.1 inch
screen around front which we're gonna
take a look at in a second other
features as expected two gigs of ram 8
megapixel camera and so on so let's go
ahead and get the device out of the box
here we're not expecting too many
surprises in terms of look and feel but
it will be very nice to get this device
side-by-side with some other samsung
note devices and some other tablets see
how it stacks up size-wise pull the Box
aside there well get rid of it down
there and it seems a good place for
owning a Galaxy has its rewards yes
Samsung is positioning a lot of Galaxy a
lot of app bonuses a lot of software
tie-ins as the kind of galaxy premier
experience a giving away I believe they
said they're giving me like $500 in free
software we'll get into that a little
bit in the full review but there's the
call-outs for the specs once again go
ahead and put the tablet itself aside
which feels quite nice actually in terms
of weight I think we're looking at 469
grams there but we'll get into that in a
second here's some of the welcome
material for the Galaxy Tab pro to tell
you what you've bought the wall charger
the cord nothing terribly new there
let's get these out of the way and just
as long as we're stopped why don't we
take off these screen protectors
now we're ready to get to business
okay so I've brought the exposure down
just a bit so you can see this texture
on the back of this device of course the
comparison device from the note family I
have is a black note 3 sorry about that
that's gonna give us all kinds of new
problems but you can barely see it there
if I just find a middle ground and
exposure there you can see that this is
exactly the same except of course it's a
black version and a white version and in
addition to color differences there are
texture differences here the soft almost
well not quite as fake leather feel on
the note 3 is sacrificed on the white
version of this this is just like the
white notes the note 10.1 yeah the Tab
pro 10.1 is just like the note 3 in the
white version which means that it is it
feels very plastic and you can hear that
it's not it doesn't feel quite as good
as I'm sure the black one does and back
out at a reasonable distance here we can
see the size comparison between this
landscape tablet in this portrait
phablet otherwise we'll get the note 3
out of here and before we turn the
device around well note the 10th 8
megapixel camera on the back and the 80
to 20 milliamp hour battery underneath
it which Samsung says should be good for
10 hours of video watching or web
browsing 10 inch 2560 by 1600 super LCD
it is not the AMOLED that we that we've
come to expect from samsung devices but
we will have to see we've read reports
and we recall from our time in Vegas
that this is a pretty vibrant panel as I
recall home button down below
multitasking button not a menu button
the back key is still on the right hand
side might trip you up a little bit if
you're coming from a non Samsung device
they are the only manufacturer I can
think of the only major manufacturer
that keeps the back button on the right
hand side and to the left 2 megapixel
webcam up top we have a swipe screen to
unlock that sounds fine we'll take
another gander at the at the top row
here hopefully yeah we got a little
focus there that is our IR port there a
lot of Samsung protectors on the sides
I'm not going to peel every one of these
off that'll take hours I'll do it later
and volume rocker here power standby on
the Left which we pressed earlier taking
you around to the side there is
right hand-side speaker port as well as
microSD expansion to give you more
storage than the onboard 16 gigs no
special Samsung dock connector on the
bottom we are well beyond that era
thankfully microUSB to charge this
device and we're bringing around front
if you want to see what it looks like
alongside a another modern tablet or a
depending on your definition of modern
this is the first generation Nexus 7
here's how that stacks up in a
silhouette tests get you a little bit
more a little bit more room there there
we go and continuing the trend of just
slightly outdated technology this is
Apple's third generation iPad almost
completely obscuring the tablets a
different aspect ratio but a much bigger
device just to tell you what it feels
like in the hand you know I mean this is
not this is not bad I just hit the home
button and it took a sweet second power
on let's go ahead and get in there all
right sweet there's the home screen
Android 4.4.2 we are running KitKat that
is wonderful but if you don't want to
spend time in this kind of classic
interface which we're used to seeing
Samsung's magazine UX is here it's
anybody's guess as to how long it will
last given Samsung's new arrangement
with Google or how much will change but
we're looking forward to trying it out I
mean this is gonna be fun it's been a
while since we've had a new tablet UX to
play with for an extended period so this
is going to be a lot of fun and this
display looking pretty good right off
the bat I'll tell you that device for
the positives about the device in the
hand very very light very very thin at
7.7 millimeters as I mentioned before
downsides does feel a little bit
plasticky but of course our expectations
were already set for that when we were
unboxing a Samsung tablet that's it for
the quick unboxing folks tune in to the
outro for instructions on how to get
your feedback into our forthcoming
review of the Tab pro 10.1 as I may have
mentioned this isn't the only Tab pro we
have in the house the 8.4 inch model is
on its way to tailor Martin for an
unboxing and review as well so stay
tuned next week for a lot of tablet
content from pocket now down below the
description or alongside it rather is a
like button down there please click it
if you enjoyed this unboxing you leave a
comment below if there's a specific
question you want answered from people
like me who can handle this device if
you think you're buying one I will do my
best to answer your question in the full
review or in one of the comparisons we
run PocketNow michael fisher social
