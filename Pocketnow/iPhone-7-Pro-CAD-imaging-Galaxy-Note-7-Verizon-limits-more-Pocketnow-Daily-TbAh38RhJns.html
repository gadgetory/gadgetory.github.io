7 pro might land better speakers after
all separate rumors claim the carrier
variants of the galaxy note 7 might hit
some specification this is probably the
time to give apple's new operating
systems a try I'm high Meadow iveta
still with a massive cold and it's the
best time for the tropics to choose to
bring us rain right this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals those of you that are waiting for
the new pebbles but could consider the
current ones well the pebble time steel
notice the steel refurb sadly but the
steel is currently available on eBay for
89 bucks I know there's also it brings
us up to 110 dollars but it's still a
very very good deal that we would hire
this just consider another official news
if you've been considering giving iOS 10
or a mac OS Sierra a try this is
probably the best time as I pause just
decided to launch the public beta for
these new operating systems so yeah it's
pretty much the same thing that you get
on beta to have you been trying to
developer build or if you know somebody
that is so there's a lot of stability
improvements I currently have a lot of
trouble with the battery life indicator
but everything else seems to work just
fine I wouldn't have this just to give
it a try and speaking of Apple we've got
some very interesting cat images of what
we assumed to be the iphone 7 pro iphone
7 plus or iphone 7 whatever the name is
going to be we see the dual cameras and
if you've been wondering if we are
getting or not the headphone jack this
one doesn't include it in addition to
the fact that it seems that these
speakers at the bottom are actually
stereo speakers it's not the whole mimic
where one is not just the speaker it's
just the hole for the microphone just
keep aesthetics apparently that's not
going to be the case they tune this we
can not wait to learn more I've all must
really need that iphone 7 because
Samsung is having a great time with the
Galaxy s7 curly 26 million units sold
and believe it or not the most
interesting part is the company is
forecasting that it's going to start
making a ton of money better profits
then it did back in 2014 when we had the
galaxy s4 which was the last time of the
galaxy s lineup actually sold like
hotcakes this is great news the galaxy
s7 is actually
a very good phone up to the point where
it continues to be the favorite of most
of us and we cannot wait to see how that
forecast ends up landing when it comes
to its final results as we hear a growth
of up to twenty percent and remedy and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do with the samsung galaxy note
7 mainly because there are some very
conflicting rumours here we've heard
that we are probably getting the
Snapdragon a 2 3 processor in addition
to six gigs of RAM but we've got some
benchmarks of the apparent verizon
variant and listen to this 4 gigs of RAM
Snapdragon 820 not the specs that we're
expecting this is pretty much a galaxy
s7 what we're getting here on the
chassis of the galaxy note 7 that's not
necessarily good news mainly because
that's the mistake that Samsung made
last year and then they made their phone
obsolete by the time they launched the
galaxy s7 lineup so hey it leads me to
the question of the day would it really
concern you that the galaxy note 7
brings the same specs as the galaxy s in
certain carriers with that lure you away
from these carriers just to get the
phone in my case it would seriously I
really do want a more powerful note if
not that I find it pointless but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends you know the
way it goes if you want to get the news
