interesting breed of smartwatches some
companies choose to go fancy and others
choose to go sport it's really very hard
to find one watch that fits both
criteria something that's kind of odd
considering that the most popular
SmartWatch in the world is designed to
be both the Huawei watch too
disappointed some for being mostly a
sport watch given the elegance of its
predecessor so for those of you looking
for a fancier offering it's time to see
some more I'm hiding a bit of a pocket
now and this is the Huawei watch 2
classic ever since I was invited to the
launch of the Huawei watch 2 I
immediately said let me know when the
classic is ready I mean don't get me
wrong the shiny accents on the regular
watch are fine but I really wanted more
of a watch after receiving the most
insane box over FedEx Ground I was
finally able to unbox the Huawei watch 2
classic presentation is nearly identical
to the sport sibling and the same goes
for the accessories you get the same
wall adapter the same proprietary pin
connector our complaints of the first
Huawei watch charger now gone as this
one seems to include more powerful
magnets to secure the charge the new
classic comes in a titanium color that
has quickly grown on me I mean smart
watches today are either black or silver
so this is a good way to stand out from
the crowd I'm not really a big fan of
leather band so I decided to pimp things
up a bit with an aftermarket option from
Amazon for around $20 the Huawei watch
new classic is a 48 millimetre watch
that weighs a hefty 47 grams so yeah
it's clearly targeting people looking
for a larger and heavier watch we have a
390 by 391 point 2 inch AMOLED display
that can get very bright and under the
hood we have the Snapdragon wear 2100
768 megabytes of RAM 4 gigs of storage a
420 milliamp hour battery and ip68 water
and dust resistance the classic doesn't
include LTE capabilities though you can
take phone calls through the speaker and
there is GPS tracking include
the main difference between the regular
Huawei watch 2 in the classic is the
added aluminum now notice I did say
added because there is still plastic in
the casing on both sides I actually find
the Huawei brand on the plastic to be
tacky on the side I mean when have you
really seen a classic watch showing you
an engraved branding on one of the sides
and then other differences at least with
the units that I perceived are LTE on my
sport model and the classic uses a
thicker 22 millimeter band when compared
to the 20 millimeter band on the sport
model so yeah you won't be able to swap
bands between them and the differences
with its fancy predecessor is that the
Sapphire went out the window in favor of
Gorilla Glass and everything else when
you compare both new while we watch 2
models you're actually talking about the
same watch and that's great see we
always approach the fitness is second
only to the quality of the puller m600
when it comes to Android wear and the
reason for that is because this is the
only other platform that I know that
calculates your training zone to be able
to measure the intensity of your workout
and since you've got the same heart rate
sensor you can seriously just look for a
sport band on Amazon and use this
classic to go to the gym the rest is
Android wear 2 which I'll admit I'm
still trying to get used to I miss the
old cards from the old user interface
and I'm not really a fan of having all
notifications look the same or the fact
that these can really be unreliable
still there are some positives like
these new complications on the watch
phases and while wait does an amazing
job at providing a vast array of options
to choose from
you've been watching the pocket out
daily you'll probably notice that I've
been using this watch for a better part
of a month complaints of the first
generation watch like not handling
direct sunlight well are gone and
battery life is also very acceptable
reaching the end of day with around 50%
of charge
to conclude I mean seriously if we were
to stack all of the Android wear
offerings for 2017 I think that we'd
agree that Huawei is offering one of the
most complete options you have a very
elegant watch for day to day that you
can also easily switch over to become a
sport watch if you'd like it's that
particular versatility that I praised
the most do you need a SmartWatch you
know the answer for me is no but if
you're looking for one this is probably
one of the best ones though bear in mind
