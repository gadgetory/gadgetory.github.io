pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to cover the built in software on
the samsung omnia pro be 7610 samsung
has done a lot to cover up windows
mobile when they've really skinned
almost every part of the operating
system we're going to take a look at the
interesting things now but will cover
everything in full in the final review
coming up soon on pocketnow.com so let's
start off and turn on the device and
zoom it on the screen a little bit ok so
we've already talked about the home
screen interfaces I'll put a link up at
the end of this video if you in case you
want to jump back and see it let's go
into the start menu and we're going to
cover a few things here so we're not
going to talk about the settings right
now because we're going to cover that in
another video there's a lot of things
that you can change on this device let's
go down the list a little bit let's
going to the media player which is
actually really fantastic this device is
divx artif ID so it can play divx video
and really any other video format you
can throw at it which is great because
even HTC devices can't play that many
video file formats so you probably have
to buy core player for twenty or thirty
dollars which is ridiculous but but
fortunately the omnia pro has a
fantastic multimedia player so if we go
into landscape right now it will kind of
go to a cover flow like display which is
not as nice as some other devices but
it's pretty cool so we can kind of flick
flick through our music tap on an album
cover it goes off to the side and and it
will play and if there is no album art
like as is the case here it it will sort
of put a default album cover there click
stops so it stops playing I'm going to
go back into portrait going over to the
next side we have albums and we can
flick through something that's really
interesting about the omnia pro is that
when you flick scroll you get haptic
feedback you get a vibration that gets
it gets faster as you flick faster and
as you get slower it goes tick tick tick
tick kind of until it stops just really
interesting sensation haven't decided
yet if it if it really helps but no
other device that i know of does that we
can go over to artists we
go to video and here I have an episode
of the office and it starts playing and
this is a divx file and I can flip it
over to landscape and it will go into
widescreen there we go video quality is
fantastic it looks terrific on the
AMOLED display frame rate is pretty darn
high very smooth motion video and it's
great that you can just load up an SD
card or microSD card with video files
that you may have on your computer and
be able to watch them right on your
device without getting a new video
player and of course it has 3.5
millimeter audio so that you can just
plug in your headphones and watch some
content very nice let's move on here we
have the photo viewer which is quite
simple I've added some pictures here
from the snow folder so we can tap on an
image and it will open it up and if we
jump into landscape pretty fast screen
rotations we can flick from picture to
picture it's taking a second to render
it there because i think it's searching
the storage card we can double tap to
zoom in assuming it's pretty smooth we
can see over here in the corner where we
are in the picture double tap to zoom
out zooming is that as smooth as you'll
find on an HTC device but it's pretty
capable so very nice photo viewing
experience on this device and the AMOLED
screen really helps to make colors pop
quite a bit the device comes with opera
browser pre-installed its version 9.5
and it works quite well let's go to a
website just to see how it renders pages
and how quickly it does so I'm going to
slide out the keyboard and do pocket now
calm and let's see how long that takes
it's over Wi-Fi right now
okay so it's almost done they're
reasonably fast about 10-15 seconds
definitely not as fast as the HTC hd2
which really benefits from a 1 gigahertz
processor and a custom version of opera
mobile but definitely capable browsing
that is similar to other devices that
use this particular browser of course if
you want to get really fast browsing
you're using an over edge skyfire is
definitely the way to go it's going to
exit that moving down a list we have FM
radio which will only work if you of
your headphones plugged in camera we
will cover full camera photo quality and
video quality in the full review we have
scheduled which is really Samsung's
replacement for the default Windows
Mobile scheduled application of the
calendar application which works quite
well so you can tap on a particular day
you see what's going on down there you
can tap down on a particular appointment
to see the details of that you can
switch views from from week view here
which shows you your appointments and
you can tap individually on an item here
to zoom in we can go to agenda view
which is always handy and you can just
flick through and see what your
appointments are coming up in the next
few days so a nice replacement to the
windows mobile calendar application and
while you'll notice a lot is that the
omnia two and the omnia pro does a lot
of white text on a black background and
that's to help really text pop to take
advantage of the AMOLED screen and also
helps to save on battery life a little
bit the device is only lighting up the
pixels that it's using so the fewer
white areas there are on the screen the
less power consumption that's taking
place let's go down a little bit more
see what else we have here we have the
memo application which we talked about
in the in the previous video we have the
video editor which is a simple way to
edit some video that you take on your
device it's nothing too fancy this is
obviously not going to replace desktop
software we have file manager task
switcher which is kind of interesting we
saw this on the omnia to basically it
will provide a little thumbnail of all
of the tests you have open or the
programs and can flick through them in a
palm pre like way although it's just an
extra step it may be smart to link this
to one of these buttons down here so
quickly access that if you find it to be
useful we have streaming players so you
can watch videos off of em youtube com
we have a few games the sort of usual
games that if you've come to expect a
podcast viewer office mobile communities
which is essentially just a link to lots
of different online communities they're
really just simple website links you
click on facebook you can go to the site
you can upload pictures to facebook
which may be helpful you can also do the
same with a flickr friendster myspace
photobucket or picasa so if you've got a
lot of the lot of figures on your device
and you want an easier way to get them
from your device to facebook this may be
a helpful way to do them let's go back
into the start menu smart reader which
will convert a business card or text
that you take a picture of into actual
digital text and it works so so you
really have to position the card just
right we have a simple voice recorder
here although it works a little bit
better than the standard voice recorder
in Windows Mobile hello this is a test
and it comes through quite nice going
back down the list we have adobe reader
we have unit converter a lot of little
added extra things that that helps to
round out the offering here's the
standard Windows Mobile calendar in case
you want to jump back into that we have
a cool digital picture frame feature
which we we saw in the omnia what it'll
do is it'll provide a slideshow and the
time plus notifications so the idea here
is that when you're at work you could
put this up near your computer because
this device is so power savvy it doesn't
matter that it's turned on showing you
the time and the slideshow in the
background because it doesn't use that
much power so it's a nice little way to
use your device as a for another purpose
than just using it for phone calls and
that's pretty much it for installed
programs on the samsung omnia pro be
7610 they've really done a lot of things
to customize the interface and
to hide the fact that it's running
Windows Mobile the mo LED screen makes
everything look fantastic and the power
consumption is really incredible 2 i'm
at 71 % i've been using this device for
a day and a half now it's just it's
mind-boggling coming up in the full
review we'll take a look at all of the
programs in detail we'll talk about
battery life will talk about performance
compared to other devices and a lot more
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
