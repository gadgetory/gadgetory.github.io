announced we all go crazy covering it
then after a handful of videos we move
on to the next new thing how a phone
ages is just as important as that
initial experience so let's do something
about this seven months after its launch
how has the smaller Google phone held up
to the competition I'm Juan Carlos bag
now for PocketNow and here's our Nexus
5x after the buzz the five acts was
marked as something of a homecoming for
Google the original LG built Nexus 5
held on for a long stretch google
skipped a year of medium-sized phones to
introduce the Nexus 6 in 2015
Nexus fans received two phones and we
recently covered huawei 6p and another
after the buzz video but what about the
smaller option the 5x holds on to more
of the philosophy we came to expect from
earlier Nexus phones competitive
processor specs for a lower price years
ago this was novel it was fresh but
recently this has become an intense tier
of smartphone competition the bar has
been raised on these budget flagships
looking at this simple plastic shell it
feels fine in the hand and the two-tone
approach here resembles two-thirds of an
Oreo cookie it's as plain as it is
inoffensive tho button feel and tactile
response is rather poor the LCD here is
a respectable performer and 1080p
resolution is perfectly adequate for
covering daily smartphone use and the
always-on fingerprint sensor makes for
fast unlocking though some of the glance
style screen options still seem
inconsistently implemented by Google
performance is unsurprising and the
Qualcomm 808 chipset here is a well
known entity sliding through the UI
remains snappy and quick but this won't
blow people away is a gaming platform
now Google made a lot of noise about
improving the camera on this generation
of Nexus phones this is the best camera
I've used on a nexus outside of the 6p
but it's another area where performances
mid-pack opposite competitors we're
perfectly capable producing some great
looking still photos in daylight
slow motion video is much improved an
HDR processing is some of the best we've
seen on an Android well some of the fun
features like panorama performance are
disappointing it stitching together
simple scenes the video produced is high
quality but without image stabilization
it's kind of a twitchy mess handheld
video is always going to be moving even
when you're trying to hold as still as
you can
audio on this phone also fails to
inspire much excitement the speaker is
pointing in the right direction but
output is thin dull and prone to
Distortion
and this headphone amp is also one of
the weakest we've ever tested and it's
still prone to distorting at full volume
these numbers fall even behind phones
like the galaxy s7 which we would expect
given the price difference but the Nexus
5x isn't even able to unseat an Alcatel
idol 3 in speaker or headphone
performance and our experiences with
runtime and battery life have also been
disappointing running a media test
streaming 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 50 percent brightness the nexus
trained 9% of its battery putting it far
behind most of the flagships we've
tested this year so what were the
advantages of buying a nexus the price
is certainly attractive you lose out on
microSD card expansion but Google
currently lists the 32 gigabyte version
for 399 and pairing it up with project
Phi you can get it a lot cheaper though
when looking at hardware that's honestly
something of a tough call against other
phones from the end of 2015 and some of
the newer mid back price phones released
this year but then we come to software
and a major part of the conversation
changes do you care about having
up-to-date software do you want timely
updates when new versions of Android are
released do you want access to public
betas do you want to utilize services
like project 5 this hardware might be
plain and inoffensive but software is
king here clean sleek and update it
faster than any of Google's
manufacturing partners we should
absolutely care more about updates
security and bug fixes and it's not
always considered the sexiest but we
should all think that's cool we're not
too far away from the next generation of
Nexus phones and we're hoping to see
something exciting from HTC but if
you're picking up something basic and
are curious about Android N or project
Phi the 5x remains one of the more
cost-effective ways to dip your toe into
the pure Google waters as always thanks
so much for watching be sure to
subscribe to this channel for more after
the buzz reviews and hit that thumbs up
button for a little extra positive
reinforcement pocket now I'm Juan Carlos
bag nail you can chat me up on Twitter
and Instagram is some gadget guy and I
will catch you all on the next review
