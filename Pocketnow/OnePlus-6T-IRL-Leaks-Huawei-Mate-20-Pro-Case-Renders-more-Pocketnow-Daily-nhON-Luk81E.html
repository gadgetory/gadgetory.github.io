60 in real life and they look like the
real deal surrenders of the huawei mate
20 Pro emerge and confirm what we're
expecting and Huawei is pretty confident
that their Karen 980 will beat the 7
nanometer chip of the a12 Bionic I'm
high metal Iveta and it's Monday I'm not
complaining we've got a lot of work but
a lot of really cool stuff is coming up
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with the deals let's
just call them deal so if you're looking
for the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and you
don't mind the fact that it's got the
Exynos variant where there are some
people that will actually say that the
Exynos is better I don't necessarily
agree with that 128 gigs will cost you
eight hundred and thirty bucks and
they're selling like hotcakes on eBay
you can learn more in the description
now let's talk about Samson I mean their
headphones the icon X 2018 are good I
actually like them a lot
not necessarily the feel or the case but
they work really well still it seems
that the company is working on something
else they've just trademark Samsung buds
not galaxy buds just Samsung buds and
even though this is just a trademark we
don't know exactly what they are clearly
air pods are making a dent Samsung if
you want to compete just fix the case I
think that'll help a lot now let's talk
about Huawei as well the company in a
recent event just teased that their
Kirin 980 processor is going to
outperform the iPhone tens a 12th Bionic
and it's obviously hard to predict
because we don't have both chips but
obviously Huawei does and yes there are
the same transistors same architecture
but apparently Huawei is gonna provide
better performance and to that I will
say there's only one way to find out
give me that May 20 Pro and speaking of
that made 20 Pro we've got some leaked
renders of the phone rocking a case and
that case actually looks really cool the
back what that camera arrangement looks
really cool for those of you concerned
about the knotch
yes this is a significant one but
according to the source there is added
functionality with that notch so I'll
wait and see to believe and finally the
hot news today have to do with the
oneplus 60 which just emerged in leaked
photos and we see the teardrop notch
we see things like the on display
fingerprint scanner that's great but an
interesting twist is that even though
the source is claiming that there is no
headphone jack if you notice the case
that being used in the bottom one of the
science is clearly for the speaker the
other is clearly for the USB C port and
then the other looks to be for a
headphone jack so either they're using
an older case they're driving so hoping
to me that there is still a headphone
jack here but let us know in the
comments down below number one what do
you think about the leaks number two
what do you think about a one plus
sixteen without a headphone jack because
in my case you know I don't mind if
companies are making the move that's
fine it's just funny when companies make
fun of others for dropping the headphone
jack like Google and then eventually
doing the same leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion

news earlier follow us I'm talking out
