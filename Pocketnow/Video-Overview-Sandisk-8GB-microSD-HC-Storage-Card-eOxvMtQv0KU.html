parking
calm the people from Sanders contacted
me a couple of weeks ago to ask me if I
wasn't
stood in taking a look at their 8
gigabyte micro sdhc card so you know
that was an obvious yes I definitely
could have turned it down so what I got
is this packing and I got this letter
from them which is actually a press
release and it's actually a PR program
where they're publicizing Linkin Park
and common other top performers turn out
for Sanders wake up your phone party on
and Sunset Strip and some other things
so it's actually a PR program that they
have and the talks that they did
something in Los Angeles and in some
other cities were there they're
practically trying to get people to take
advantage of these micro SD cards and
enjoy the fact that they could bring a
lot more storage to their phones so
practically what we have here is a the
Sunset Strip block party guerilla union
etc from sandisk and inside well I got
an adapter normal SD adapter and then
inside I got the tiny little a gigabyte
micro sdhc card if you compare it to a
typical micro SD a micro SD card which
is not sdhc it's actually the same card
it's no different it's practically the
same size and the the only difference
it's it's different infrastructure and
if you ask me how do you know if your
phone or your device can play it it's
actually as simply as checking if your
device supports micro sdhc and HC is the
high-capacity driver that you're gonna
have to be looking for I know some
windows mobile five devices don't
support it and I know mostly or almost
all when Mike windows mobile 6 devices
do so i'm going to start loading a
couple of a absent to this card to see
how it performs and try to compare it to
a normal typical SD micro SD card and
see if it performs any better any worse
that supposedly everything is supposed
to be standard and practically the same
well a couple of minutes later and after
loading about 4.4 gigabytes of content
one of the things i did get amazed about
is for example my blackberry pearl here
does it really mention it supports sdhc
but it really does i mean
do have 7.6 kilobytes available and the
and the free space that I practically
have right here mentioned I also tested
it with other of my windows mobile 6
devices it does support them all the
time for example my HTC Herald or the
glofish x.x 650 or the ipaq 200 series
which I just got to review and it plays
them pretty well on each of the devices
it doesn't slow them down media plays
just fine you could say you're
practically holding a typical 2 gigabyte
microSD card which with the only
difference that it actually has more
capacity but it renders the same
performance in your device so I'm going
to try testing a little bit of
performance after this for performance I
practically chose to the windows mobile
6 device i have with the smallest
processor which would be my HTC harold
i'm going to try to transferring this
file using resco explorer from my
storage card and this is actually my
tongue gigabyte storage card which is
not its sdhc and if i copy this to my
documents it'll give me 8 830 9
kilobytes per second then it goes down
to 458 and then 2 314 on the tongue
gigabyte not micro sdhc card so I'm
going to switch the cards now and see
how it performs with the other one so
here we go now we have the micro sdhc 8
gigabyte card same file same operation
as we did with the other one try to copy
it to my documents and we get actually
see it rendering faster 11 99.6
kilobytes and then 44.1 really stable
real quick well actually we got faster
speed I like this definitely good why
don't we try I don't have much storage
space available so I'm going to try to
delete that one and here we go and then
we're going to go back
music then let's try with this seven
megabyte file copy to write documents
let's see what we get slowing down here
six 42.1 so obviously a larger file will
give it a bit more work but then it goes
to 76 two point four kilobytes per
second which is not bad at all
definitely the micro sdhc card rendered
faster performance in the end so what do
we have in the end we have eight
gigabytes a lot of storage out of which
7.6 gigabytes was the average available
in each device I tested we have a faster
car which is much better than what I
compared to a typical micro SD card this
cart is going to be retailing at 139
point ninety nine dollars u.s. dollars
so if you have the money and it's
definitely worth that I commend you to
go get one definitely really good from
sandisk this is pretty much it for
