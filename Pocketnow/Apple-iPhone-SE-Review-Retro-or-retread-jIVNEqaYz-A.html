and it's time to share our thoughts on
Apple's Mighty Mouse of a mid-range
phone I'm Juan Carlos bag now for pocket
now and here's our full review of the
iPhone se Apple is often criticized for
being very conservative with the
technology and design of the iPhone the
iPhone se is not a phone to blazed new
trails and this design is now entering
its fourth year of service dating back
to the original iPhone 5 this isn't like
the galaxy s7 looking kinda similar to a
galaxy s6 the iPhone se has exactly the
same layout as the iPhone 5s cases
covers and skins designed for the 5s fit
the SE like a glove this isn't a crown
jewel phone for Apple it's a practical
response to the fact that over 2015
Apple sold 30 million smaller iPhones
looking to the future that hardware will
have an increasingly difficult time
supporting new software and services
instead of reinventing the wheel the
exact same shell is used with new tech
guts packed inside and yet if Apple had
to recycle any phone design a company
could do far worse than the metal and
glass combo of the 5s it still stands as
this reviewers favorite look for any iOS
device ever built flat rectangular sides
with chamfered edges and no camera bulge
maybe the only build quality critique
was brought to my attention via
subscriber on Twitter that the mute
switch on the SE II is a little on the
loose side I no longer have a 5s to
compare but I can report there is a bit
of a wiggle on the SE the look of this
phone is either retro or recycled
depending on who you ask but the
internals are a significant refresh we
have a whole separate video detailing
exactly the tech inherited from the
iPhone 6s and what was left out but as a
quick rundown the iPhone se gets the a9
processor with m9 Co processor 2
gigabytes of RAM 16 gig base storage the
12 megapixel rear camera NFC radio for
Apple pay and identical headphone
performance the items left out no MIMO
antennas for stronger Wi-Fi signal no
support for LTE advanced a fairly poor
FaceTime camera no 3d touch or taptic
engine vibration motor and
a slower touch ID sensor the SE asks a
few compromises but overall it's a solid
hardware spread for the $399 retail
price now a four inch screen and 2016
won't win any awards but this is a
capable LCD panel with respectable
viewing angles and better than average
outdoor brightness comparing LCD to
AMOLED is old territory at this point
but the SE won't get is bright in
daylight and won't get his dim at night
as a Samsung flagship might we've got
the same resolution of 11 36 by 640 from
when iPhone started using widescreen
displays and this pixel density is the
same as the iPhone 6s text and fine
details will look similar there's just
less surface area across the front face
something really interesting happens
with iOS when we return to a smaller
screen everything just sort of fits like
it used to I don't think there was very
much ergonomic consideration with the
software design when Apple increased the
screen size from 4 inches on the
diagonal to 4.7 menus the notification
shade quick actions there's not a point
on the screen which can't be easily
reached but best of all is being able to
hit upper corner controls like cancel
options or back buttons it's been two
and a half years since I could reach
these with my stumpy thumb without
sliding an iPhone around in my hand
balancing a slippery device on my
fingertips or dedicating both hands to
using the device I like iOS a lot better
when used on this hardware outside of
the better ergonomics iOS is still the
same as it ever was
it's snappy and it's quick it really
doesn't get much simpler than touch
square get app iOS still does a good job
of getting to the point of each
interaction with the phone iOS 9.3 also
brings night shift to the masses where
the screen will shift to a warmer color
temperature at night which is a nifty
little trick to have built into the OS
and with those pros we have the same
cons we've been sharing for years I'm
not a huge fan of how settings can
sometimes be split between what's in the
app and what lives in the phone's main
settings I wish there was more control
over which default services are used as
I prefer Google Maps to Apple maps it's
disappointing that we still don't have
better app integration for sharing
content it takes an operating system
update to add a service to this menu and
final management has gotten better over
the years but we still don't
have the same control over our content
which we enjoy on Android there are just
a number of situations which still
require the assistance of an additional
computer like loading high quality audio
files to test the headphone playback
I can't just save them directly to the
phone from my onedrive account I have to
use iTunes Gaming is well represented
here from a horsepower perspective I'm
not going to bother with older titles or
candy crush style games the SE will chew
those up easily jumping directly to more
graphics intensive titles like asphalt 8
and Marvel future fight this little
bugger has zero issues providing a fluid
framerate the small screen though does
make interacting with some game elements
more difficult these controls up here
yeah my finger can't select those
options at all everything about this
phone is built to provide a tactically
efficient brief interaction and even
though it's powerful it's not an ideal
platform for marathon gaming moving over
to audio speaker playback is pretty
familiar for any bottom firing speaker
at this point it's one of the better
performers we can listen to but can't
match the clarity we enjoy from stereo
speaker solutions
now headphone playback is top not Apple
continues a legacy of packing solid
headphone amps into all iPhones punchy
loud the iPhone se is an almost
identical match for the iPhone 6s and it
absolutely shames the galaxy s7 for
output volume this little mid-range er
almost matches the LG v10 for overall
volume has a slightly higher noise floor
and more stereo crosstalk though this
Hardware shows slightly less distortion
testing using 24-bit 96k audio files we
do see a steep drop-off around 20k which
means this phone is downsampling 24-bit
audio but this will only affect high
quality lossless files those of you
listening to mp3s won't be affected by
this and if all of what I just said
sounded like gibberish to you the
takeaway is this is excellent audio
hardware for a phone more subjectively
using the stock EQ settings the bass is
fun and rumbly mids are well represented
but the highs are a little more stressed
than I would normally enjoy instruments
at the upper end of the EQ can sometimes
feel a bit shrill this of course is
highly dependent on what music you
listen to and what headphones you use
and you can of course adjust the EQ in
the phone settings when Apple said the
SE has the same camera as the success
they weren't joking this thing performs
identically to the more expensive iPhone
this is well traveled camera territory
the third inch sensor F 2.2 aperture and
lack of optical image stabilization
won't quite compete with Samsung and LG
offerings especially in low-light
situations but it's a solid performer
producing crisp images with
fantastically consistent color
processing best-in-class HDR output
high-quality UHD video terrific
panoramas and superb slow-motion video
to see how this camera stacks up against
other flagships we have a crazy in-depth
comparison between the iPhone 6s galaxy
s7 and Lumia 950 on this channel and
linked below this video what hasn't been
improved over the iPhone 5s is the
front-facing camera it's fine for a
FaceTime call but the output from this
1.2 megapixel shooter is pretty dull I'm
not a fan of selfies in general but this
camera isn't one I'd rely on seriously
for capturing memories running down the
hardware specs on the SE one might
notice that the battery is around 5%
smaller than
battery on the iPhone success happily
overall run time seems to be better on
the smaller phone than on the flagship
first of all Apple standby times are
always impressive seven hours overnight
resulted in two percent battery drop
when this thing sleeps it sleeps deep
using the phone throughout the day I can
easily make it to dinnertime with a
little room to spare on our video test
streaming 30 minutes of video over Wi-Fi
at 50% brightness the SE drained three
percent of its battery that's now the
best phone we've ever run through this
test our six month old iPhone 6's
drained 6% under the same conditions
likely owing to the larger and higher
resolution display this small battery is
pretty quick to recharge as well using
the Apple supplied charger you can
expect around a thirty percent boost
after a half hour plugged in so let's
wrap this up where does that leave us
with the iPhone se this is the most fun
I've had with an iPhone in a couple
years
inexpensive entry-level phones can
tackle the basics if all you want to do
is check your email and tweet than a
hundred dollar phone should handle that
well enough but this iPhone mashup
brings some serious performance features
to the mid-range smartphone market
covering the basics is just a lot nicer
when you've got powerful tech on tap
those faster transitions fewer instances
of hiccups or lags it's an overall
cleaner feel for a phone which
celebrates a brevity of interaction few
people will want to stare at a 4-inch
screen for a long period of time this
really isn't a great option for in-depth
gaming watching feature films or for
people with vision issues you'll never
need split-screen multitasking apps on
this phone but for a quick text or tweet
scan through an email or send
turn-by-turn directions to your car
stereo it's difficult to find any fault
with how snappy this little guy is I
know quite a few people personally who
will appreciate that idea interacting
with their phone less so they can just
get on with their day add in a very good
camera excellent audio playback and very
good battery life and despite a few
flagship feature compromises I think we
end up with something kind of special
this is only the second phone Apple has
purposely built to compete in the
mid-range and the differences here are
night and day over the 5c instead of a
plastic EMS we
have a practical premium small
form-factor phone which has the
potential to crush a good chunk of the
overall mid pack smartphone market and
it might cannibalize a good chunk of the
sales for Apple's 2014 i phone six the
iphone as he brings us back to the
original iphone ideals of quick clean
and simple right a personally buy any
device in the iOS lineup today the
iPhone se would have my cash as always
thanks so much for watching be sure to
subscribe to this channel for more
reviews like these we'll have the full
text review of the iPhone se up on
pocketnow.com in a couple days and hit
that thumbs up button for a little extra
positive reinforcement for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos now you can chat me
up on Twitter and Instagram is some
gadget guy and I will catch you all on
the next review
