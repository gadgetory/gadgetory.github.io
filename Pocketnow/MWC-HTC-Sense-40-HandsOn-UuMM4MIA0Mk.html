for parking out common actor see the HTC
One S yesterday at the press event let's
look at Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich
and obviously since four point oh its
implementation
so far you'll notice that well it
definitely sense four-point-oh is
completely different to what we were
used to in the past we still get the
sliding animations and let's see well it
doesn't go through the other way like it
they would sense 3.0 got the same box
and everything you'll notice that we now
have an appt train in the past we had
that phone button here and we were able
to customize HTC which was actually a
weird button because you don't really do
that a lot the bone button obviously got
a different sort of phone mask here for
ice cream sandwich done whatever
okay so we've got this cool UI that
tells us what to do choose what accounts
here tap the photo here and then
whatever want to get me out of here
okay let's go into the app tray you can
move around the cubes like this for
frequent downloaded applications in all
applications you can move at the typical
Ice Cream Sandwich way then for widgets
for example I'm trying to find a way to
get there you see apparently go to the
old way off there we go so we got sense
four-point-oh looks a little like
honeycomb used to looking obviously some
sort of ice cream sandwich for tablets
you can select your which is here see we
got some weird calculator share
different calendar widgets let's try to
use this one
try to drag it up here juice too big
try to get rid of something
try to get rid of this
ok remove that's full of a widget here
we want this agenda calendar here drag
it up
and let's see i want all calendars yes
please thank you okay and so it should
populate here let's see what it looks
like
kind of nice look at this whenever you
reach the top it separates bring
separators they're kind of cool let's
look at the med student feature
but within messages always threaten to
sue is
kind of sluggish by the way not sure why
probably this is not a final version of
ice cream sandwich versity the processor
escort definitely yes this the dual core
not the quad core so obviously we are
lazy some slugs here there everything
they go into the settings just like we
can our ICS and again we have that
separators really nice nice
implementations now one thing here is
the app tray this is one thing that I
really like the recent applications is
very different to what you're used to an
ice cream sandwich cause the dropbox app
this again go into settings a little bit
sluggish there but it's working look at
a very ugly picture there
and then we could obviously close
applications swiping up instead of
swiping to the left or right as we're
used to with the Galaxy Nexus so far
aside from that wellness look at email
and let's try to look for new email here
then we've got more emails as we talked
about earlier with our eyes and sense
for point only a couple of weeks ago
kind of an EQ why I'm trying to look for
let's see if there's any instrumentation
in the browser yeah here we go this is
what I was looking for the stacked
emails you see you get this little bar
here it's little arrow and tells you
that there are more emails that have to
do with the same email that's talked
about here with expenses and no I don't
have any experiences just look at the
browser now look for the browser here we
go
might as well obviously network probably
but when it's too slow to actually test
nothing really compares the same stuff
we're already used to these settings are
up here instead of a menu button at the
bottom that we used to see in the
package other than that well it seems to
be sense 4.0 is probably 3.5 on steroids
for do things nothing really big for
some obviously dual core is not really
doing sense for point of time going to
try to star in the park or bone dry for
show
conclusion somewhere after looking for
coffee thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
