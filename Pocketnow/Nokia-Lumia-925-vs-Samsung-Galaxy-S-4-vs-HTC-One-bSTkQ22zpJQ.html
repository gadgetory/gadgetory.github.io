still in london and we didn't want to
leave this Victoria house until we bring
you probably the hottest comparison the
Nokia Lumia 925 versus the HTC One and
the Samsung Galaxy s4 let's see the
differences so we have the samsung
galaxy s4 on the left the Nokia Lumia
925 in the middle and the HTC One on the
right obviously right from the start the
difference is that the Lumia 925 runs
Windows Phone 8 and the two devices on
the far sides run Android aside from
that the Samsung Galaxy s4 is built out
of plastic polycarbonate with Samsung's
hyper glaze coating on top of it which
makes it kind of slippery while the HTC
One is built completely out of aluminium
and I left the HTC One at this spot
because the Nokia Lumia 925 is also
built out of aluminum but while the HTC
has a complete aluminum back the Nokia
Lumia 925 has aluminum only around its
edges while the back is plastic now
getting back to the front of these
devices as you can see we got a full
1080p screen on the galaxy s4 and as
well as on the HTC One while the Nokia
Lumia 925 has a 1280 by 768 resolution
hopefully future versions of Windows
Phone will support higher resolutions
but the main difference aside from
screen resolution or platform is
happening at the back from left to right
the samsung galaxy s4 has a 13 megapixel
camera at its back with a single LED
flash the HTC One has a four ultra pixel
that is 4 megapixels on his back with a
single LED flash and the Lumia 925 has a
8.7 megapixel sensor on its back with a
dual LED flash and Carl Zeiss lens it's
basically the same sensor and camera
built as on the Lumia
9:28 but it has an additional six lens
which brings you more clarity and you
should watch another video we posted
explaining exactly the differences
between these now in terms of build
quality the Samsung phone as some might
say has a cheap build quality exactly
because they are using that specific
coating on top of the plastic which
makes it slippery and it's prone to
fingerprints it collects finger grease
like a champ the HTC One due to its full
aluminium back has a solid feel and is
cold to the touch at first and the Lumia
925 is probably a combination of the two
while it is cold to the touch around the
edges where the aluminum is it is
plastic heat on the back where the
polycarbonate is now this is a very
light phone and of course the HTC One is
heavier than both of them but if I was
to choose the lightest between the
galaxy s4 and the Lumia 925 I'd probably
say that the Galaxy s4 feels lighter in
the hand than the Lumia 925 and by no
means inconsistent and last but not
least of course it all comes down at the
end of the day to the answer to the
following question Android or Windows
Phone 8 now Windows Phone 8 already has
145 applications in the past or so it no
longer comes down to the number of apps
it all comes down to your preference
whether you like Android with the
widgets with blinkfeed on the HTC One
and with TouchWiz on the galaxy s4 or
you like the good old Metro lifestyle
style and that should be really up to
you
this was anthem from pocket knock down
for quick quick quick look at the Nokia
Lumia 925 compared with the Samsung
Galaxy s4 and the HTC One
we are leaving London one more Lumia in
our pockets thank you very much for
watching take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
