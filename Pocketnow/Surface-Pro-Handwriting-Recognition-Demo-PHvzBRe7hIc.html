surface pro is the stylus on the side
you can clip this off and flip around
the cover and you can do handwriting
recognition or drawing or take notes
like this so this is Adam Lang for
Pocket NomCom and in this video we're
going to take a look at the handwriting
recognition on the surface pro so by
default when you go into a text field on
the surface pro you're going to get this
touchscreen QWERTY keyboard you can
obviously just tap it with your fingers
but I'm going to switch to this one and
this is the handwriting recognition
panel Microsoft has been doing
handwriting recognition for a very long
time I think they may have started back
in 2000 or so in 2002 they brought it to
the tablet PC and it's been changing and
evolving ever since so right now it's
kind of docked to the bottom half of the
screen and let's see if I can write
something here
and I ran out space
so you can see as it's moving along it
tries to recognize the words and we
messed up a couple times because I was
writing very messily so I can put a
rewrite that word and this one I believe
if we do that it's going to separate it
so when you tap the words you can
rewrite certain letters and it will
usually try to figure out what the word
is supposed to be so that's in the email
and that's pretty nice let's go to one
note one note is a little different
because it also sports writing on the
page directly so let's see what I can do
here good
doing a pretty messy job here
and I am laying my hand on the screen
the Wacom stylus you can see there's
little point there as soon as this is
within you know about an inch you see
the point appears and that disables the
touchscreen so that I can set my hand in
now that's a handwritten and over here
there's a little button Inc to text and
we see that it converted it to text some
words did well some words are a little
bit off but if you just want to go keep
on writing notes in OneNote this is a
pretty nice so this method I really like
because you got a lot of room to
keyboard keep writing what
and back in the email it's a little bit
odd to be right in at the bottom of
screen the whole time but that's how it
works previous versions of tablet PC
operating systems allowed you to put the
input panel wherever you want it but
that kind of got in the way so
see what that word is nope there we go
so that time I just changed one one
letter and it guessed what the rest of
the letters were going to be and you see
up here I can undo that and go back to
the original word or it gives me some
suggestions of other words that I might
be thinking and a little X Allah
apply it and insert so overall I'm
pretty happy with the handwriting
recognition here it's gotten pretty
advanced it's very easy to edit in this
input panel so you can fix the mistakes
especially when you're writing extremely
messily but very usable very nice very
happy with that so that's the
handwriting recognition on the surface
Pro be sure to give this video a thumbs
up and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
