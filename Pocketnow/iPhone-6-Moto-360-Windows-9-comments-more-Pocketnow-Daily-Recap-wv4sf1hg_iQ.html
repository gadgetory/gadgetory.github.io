thanks for asking but that's my poker
face I wouldn't forgot to upload a video
yesterday and it was a Sunday man hey I
need some rest tommy hilfiger should pay
you for wearing his shirts on youtube
LOL and i agree that's right it's that
time of the week i am hi natalie that
this is pocket now and this is our
pocket out daily recap for last week so
on monday ask you what do you think
about the Moto 360 and the pricing
schemes as there are some retailers that
leaked information about two hundred
fifty dollar price tag and the device
being launched very soon we have such an
important te comments out of which our
says Moto 360 looks amazing but why
would i pay 250 dollars for just because
it looks good while i could get the gear
to which is more features and at the
same price and that's a very simple
answer not everybody wants to use a
samsung phone and that's the problem
with the gear phone another counter says
I want a moto 360 but wait until the
first reviews to see how it catches up
and that is a very good point Android
wear has not proven to be as hot as a
lot of people wanted it to be so yeah
wait for our reviews that's probably the
best thing to do then another commoner
says no because Android wear is buggy
the roundest play just seems awkward I
don't see smartwatches taking off at
least until Apple sets a standard and
you could be right you could be wrong
but we'll have to see what the iWatch is
this would not be the first time that
Google doesn't succeed with the product
and it wouldn't be the first time that
apple doesn't figure it out either then
on Tuesday I asked you what do you think
about the HTC One m8 for Windows the
device had just been announced that our
hands on was already live we have 130
comments out of which Jaya cost 6 says
does anybody here actually like Windows
phones and yes everybody here at least
in pocket now likes windows phones but
yeah I do agree a lot of people still
can't find an appealing the nick wheeler
stuff says oh I think we know you want a
dual booting m8 already and do yeah fine
I know I mentioned it all the time and
true it's probably annoying but there
was a point to that the HTC hd2 was a
great loan it was dual booting capable
it was so awesome and that made the
phone last four years and I guess I wish
I wanted the same from the MA then Omer
says it's a great device and I would
love to see an international variant
as for the dual booting I'm hoping that
the device will become the new HD two it
will be fantastic and we've talked about
that on the podcast we've talked about
that in the daily that would be like the
dream to have another HD two I guess
that's my point we wish we had another
phone like that which we could do
anything we wanted with that on
Wednesday I asked you if you would mind
to spend another year with the retina
display from Apple because the rumors
are that the iphone 6 in both variants
will have display resolutions that match
the retina display almost we have 963
comments out of which Hamza says apple
retina display is good we don't need 2k
displays if it ruins our experience with
lag while gaming just like Android and
well that's not really been the case
with the LG g3 but I'm sure that other
companies won't figure out 2k eventually
and ya 2 k's a little bit of an overkill
in my opinion especially when you prefer
to have more battery life and stuff but
then again the LG g3 is a good example
of a company that knows how to pull it
off and hopeful writer 14 says I was
really excited about this iphone 6 4.7
inch but they really do this s again
with the Rena display I'm done I can't
do it anymore and I'm not going to agree
with that first of all you really can't
see pixels from 720p on or the retina
display so yeah it's cool to have the
latest and greatest but I don't even
have 2k on my TV it's really pointless
to want that from a smartphone or else
the large review says 2k on a phone is
overkill I have never seen any pixels on
a phone even he just had 720p or 1080p
is totally fine and yes we agree with
that then on Thursday I asked you what
is the minimum amount of storage that
you can survive with as the news are
that Apple is apparently going to bring
16 gigs on the iphone 6 again but then
there's a bump 228 gigs as well and yeah
16 gigs is terrible we have 1161
comments Wow one of the commoner says I
can survive with a gigabytes because i
tend to clean my phone every week I am
very organized and the games and apps i
don't use I just delete them and I
redownload them if I miss them and my
god just thinking of doing all that is
giving me enough pain to not even think
about it I would
they're have more storage and Michael
best says 32 gigs of storage is my sweet
spot with the increased use of cloud
storage anything more than 32 gigs is
unnecessary in my opinion you have a
good point but it depends on where you
live there are countries like Romania
that have 100 megabits down or stuff
like that the data speeds that are crazy
and they are unlimited so it doesn't
really matter if it's on your phone or
in the cloud it's fine the problem is
when you come to countries like the
United States where there is a limited
amount of storage and there is a limited
amount of data you know you pay more if
you want more data and that's really the
issue not everybody can live with cloud
storage right now when carriers are
making a lot of money out of pulling
your you know your consumption then
seven NASA 64 gigs is perfect 32 is
pushing it but 16 is far too little and
that is my case that's the way I live 64
gigs is the minimum that I can deal with
but yeah my music library is 32 gigs on
its own so hey that's my case and then
finally on Friday I asked you what is
your wish list for windows 9 and Windows
Phone nine as the rumors are that the
company will announce its preview to
developers on sep tember 30th we have
754 comments out of which Chris lomita
says get rid of those damn tiles i miss
windows 7 and you're not really forced
to use the tiles unless you're on RT
obviously but yeah I do miss windows 7
as one that's mainly the reason wide and
go windows 8 and crimson k24 says less
than a hundred dollars this is OS 10 is
under a hundred dollars packing
microsoft office home and student with
it and windows 7 like and yeah windows
is extremely expensive for what you get
especially at times 10 is 10 is pretty
much free obviously have to buy an osm
computer for that to work but then again
you have to do the same with windows so
yeah the price tag the fact that you do
need office yeah you're right and yeah
windows 7 like you don't have the
options that people want to enable the
tiles fine would not be forced to use
them then Tyler Walker says I hope
windows 9 is free windows is a waste of
effing money especially when OS 10 is
free now and no it's not a waste of
money windows has its purpose a lot of
companies use it a lot of companies
wanted it's a enterprise platform it's
been built around that not really as
user friendly and that was the purpose
of
tiles and I guess the tiles haven't
really embraced or built that sort of a
desire from consumers but then again
yeah it should be free or it should be
priced so aggressively that people
really wouldn't care I mean if they told
me to pay thirty dollars for windows
even fifty dollars i would surely pay
for it but more than a hundred dollars
is just too much money thats it for our
