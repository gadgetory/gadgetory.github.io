sport product is what Jabra is calling
their new elite series of headphones and
we had a chance to check them out
I'm hi Midori Ben I would pocket now
reporting from me about 2016 with the
new Jabra elite sport all of pocket now
Ziva 2016 coverage is brought to you by
XCOM global
the concept of true wireless headphones
aren't really new but Jabra has spent
the last few years building very serious
fitness accessories and elite actually
mean something here the Jabra elite
sport are a very interesting breed as
there are no wires here the connection
with the phone is through bluetooth and
the connection between the earbuds works
through shockwave magnetic induction
technology the right earbud is the
master allowing you to use it as a
standard mono Bluetooth headset or you
can also make this work as a stereo
headset by simply getting the right and
the left one close to each other there
are also four microphones all around to
enhance call quality through passive
noise cancellation they are intelligent
enough to detect sound levels from each
side and deactivate microphones
depending on each scenario the ear buds
have different buttons on one you
control music and volume and on the
other you enable or disable noise
cancellation allowing a pass-through of
outdoor noise whenever you're doing
outdoor activities that require safety
by for example running or cycling the
demo prove that noise cancellation is
top-notch so yeah I actually do like the
addition of this noise pass through the
right ear but also has a heart rate
monitor and constant vo2 max testing to
determine your aerobic capability and
all this paired with choppers
proprietary software that has a nifty
couple of features to help you train
track your progress over weeks predict
how well you'd run depending on your
physical condition and even tell you if
you're recovering quickly or you need
more time to do so there's a built-in
accelerometer to track your reps on each
workout but the problem here is you
actually have to tell the application
what you're doing for it to track you
sadly sinking choppers software with the
services like Google fit doesn't really
seem to be available but you can use the
earbuds to sync with other third-party
applications to provide the heart rate
monitoring to these there's a selection
of ear gels memory foam tips and ear
winks for comfort and these are ip67
water and dust resistant for ingress
protection up to 30 minutes under a
meter of water Jabra is so confident on
its technology that its warranty covers
three years of water and sweat damage
something that's really hard to find on
competing products like the Jabra
Eclipse the elite have a nifty carrying
case that not only charges the elite but
also provides two additional charges
when its battery is full sadly here's
the catch though the battery life is
certified for three hours a pump making
these pretty much an accessory for a
half marathon and we're talking about
whenever you run average running speeds
the Dabra elite sport will be available
over the next few weeks for $249 and to
know if these are really worth that much
of a premium make sure you stay tuned
for a full review instead of paying
horrible roaming fees when traveling
abroad or the hassle of buying another
