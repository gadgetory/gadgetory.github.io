smartphone that Apple has ever made and
also one of the boldest departures from
what made an iPhone and iPhone people
have been dreaming about this amount of
change for years but now that we have it
Wow the learning curve has been steep
I'm high metal even with pocket now and
this is our honeymoon phase with the
iPhone 10 brought to you by deep brand
there was a time when every video
introduction of every iPhone was full of
complaints Apple was infamous for
conservative designs and iterating on
the side of caution yeah you can scratch
that the iPhone 10 is not just a
completely different iPhone but also a
completely different smartphone the
blend of stainless steel and glass feels
like if you're holding a polished
gemstone and a heavy one for that matter
the rounded corners on the chassis
remind us of apple's obsession for this
same design and iconography since the
first Macintosh if it wasn't for the
horrendous camera hump everything on
this phone seems to fall into place
perfectly
this device marks a ton of firsts for
Apple the first iPhone with an OLED
display the first time we see the bezels
nearly disappeared to an insane
eighty-three percent screen to body
ratio the first time Apple jumps to a
higher pixel density at 458 pixels per
inch even if you won't really notice a
difference when compared to the iPhone 8
at 750 P the largest and tallest display
on an iPhone at five point eight inches
diagonal at a nineteen point nine aspect
ratio and last but not least the first
iPhone without a home button now in
favor of Apple's face ID through its
true depth camera system the experience
of an all display iPhone is definitely a
shocking first impression now once you
set it up you will land into a lot of
familiar territory like with every
iPhone you can set it up automatically
by scanning an old phone or going manual
like I did you select the basics like
language Wi-Fi and go through the
activation process Apple's new trick on
this phone is that you now set face ID
instead of touch ID for years my
approach has been to set a complex
password as a backup but given my
skepticism over the reliability of face
ID this is the first time that I use a
pen password since the iPhone 5 you're
prompted if you want to set this up as a
new phone or restore from iCloud which
is what I ended up doing and you can
choose your backup within
once that's done you're taken to the new
home screen that's about the only thing
that remains old as the phone continues
to restore from iCloud Apple claims that
this device is packed with new
technologies to enable new experiences I
am going to have to agree but adapting
to these changes has been jarring for
example I spent the first two days
trying to press a home button that no
longer exists or getting used to Control
Center being at the top right and
notifications at the top left or the
rest of the unibrow and then there's the
problem that a good deal of applications
are still not optimized the apps with
pillarboxing worked fine just like if
you were using an iPhone 8 with bezels
but the other applications like telegram
are simply unusable with controls all
around the place and then there are
applications like Starbucks that seem
optimized up until you try to log on and
the application completely freezes
obviously this is par for the courses
it's a completely new iPhone but yet it
still feels like if it's in beta now
don't get me wrong not everything is bad
soy bean between applications with a
simple slide from the bottom is genius
calling on reach ability with a swipe
from the bottom is also very handy which
explains the whole wasted space below
the keyboard as a gesture area just the
whole concept of swiping up to go home
like throwing applications so the tray
feels very natural as for face ID well I
really have nothing to complain about I
love being able to just lift my phone
and have it unlock every single time
right about the moment when I'm ready to
swipe
maybe it's because I'm in New York's
current gloom in the fall and I really
haven't been exposed to direct sunlight
using this phone but it always unlocks
just fine and yeah it doesn't unlock
with my son trust me I've tried
many people have complaints about the
unibrow but after 10 years of bezels I'm
not gonna complain I just wish the user
interface would feel more like if it
blends with it instead of all this
wasted space
and emojis are also a fun little idea
definitely an example of how far the
truth the camera system can go just a
little disappointed with how out of sync
these animations are when you send the
final video but again this just seems
like a work in progress I've read some
of your tweets claiming great battery
life but that hasn't been my story I've
tried this phone on both AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile all around New York City and it
barely scratches a day of use while the
iPhone eight was great in this
department it's definitely too early to
judge though as these things get better
over time with iOS I also did a little
experiment with fast charging
I tried pairing apples $25 lightning
USBC cable to a 27 watt adapter from the
essential phone and this phone charged
from 10% to 50 in just 30 minutes so
yeah no need to pay the 50 extra dollars
if you can find an adapter with the 27
watts now if you decide to stick with
what Apple bundles in the box this
battery will barely go from 10 to 23
percent and around the same time so yeah
13 percent in 30 minutes is terrible
the camera has also proven to be an
interesting mix of experiences if we
talked about the primary sensors at the
back I can tell you that I'm extremely
impressed this camera is definitely a
delight in both day and night extremely
versatile in color saturation and detail
and I'm liking how speedy portrait mode
has become but again this is with the
primary camera those portrait selfies
are definitely still in beta I mean it
does do a great job with skin tone but
it simply never gets the borders right
for me at all or I guess it just doesn't
like my natural highlights and video
recording is definitely top notch again
if you're using the primary sensor as
iPhones are really good about
stabilization but sadly selfie video
continues to lack any sort of software
stabilization to conclude I guess the
best phrase to describe my honeymoon
phase with the iPhone 10 is by saying be
careful what you wish for because you
just might get it
it's not until you experience a
completely different iPhone that you
Stan why Apple took so long to change
its approach to hardware I mean if it
was hard for me to adapt to this phone
I can't imagine an average consumer now
I do stand by my personal motto that
change is great and Apple has proven
that it can leap for our competitors
like a champ what's left this to prove
if all this change is actually useful to
the consumer and that's going to be the
theme for the next batch of comparisons
to come in addition to our final review
coming very soon while that happens
might I remind you that this is probably
the most finger print prone iPhone I've
seen yet deep brand skins will eliminate
those fingerprints and add some grip to
your upcoming iPhone 10 or any iPhone
