be one of the best and most powerful
phones of 2016
but also one of the prettiest ones now
the difference between the words pretty
and durable depends highly on the
quality of the materials and with this
phone your mileage may vary I'm high
memory better with pocket now and this
is our durability report of the galaxy
s7 edge
just a couple of disclaimers folks I've
been using the galaxy s7 edge on and off
for the last few months since our review
period in March most of you know that I
do prefer sleeves over cases to protect
my phones and this was no exception
my main reason to come back to the
galaxy s7 edge after his stint in the
competition is mainly because of its
insane battery life and also because
let's face it this phone is gorgeous
does it matter where you go or what you
do this phone can definitely call some
attention now most of the experience
with the aging of this phone will be
part of our after the bus segment in the
next few weeks this durability report
will mainly focus on a recent incident
that happened then or was it terrible as
I was recording our review of the galaxy
s7 active I made the minor mistake of
pushing the s7 edge off the second floor
yeah I set that a second floor and to
make matters worse it fell over a bed of
rocks I obviously expect it to go
downstairs and pick up the pieces given
the fragile glass it's made of but it
turns out that this phone is actually
more durable than I thought for starters
the 7000 series aluminium trim this
pretty much intact with just some minor
scuffs here and there but which shocked
me the most really is this Gorilla Glass
4 at the back that pretty much only
received a minor single hairline crack
and by minor I mean you actually have to
look for it now sadly what took the most
beating is the camera up to the point
where it's pretty much unusable and bear
in mind I wouldn't be the first person
to complain about camera lens cracks on
the Galaxy lineup eh display at the
front survived the fall without a
problem and as notorious as Galaxy
phones are for scratch fingerprint
scanners believe it or not this
fingerprint scanner is still intact
the phone also works flawlessly after
the fall showing that even with
tremendous impact this phone continues
to work without a problem
sadly as surprised as I am with how
durable this phone is I because this
appointment is from a consumer
standpoint in getting this fixed Samsung
only has a meager six repair centers in
all United States which is terrible when
competitors like Apple will fix your
phone in every single Apple store across
the globe then there's also the concern
of how long it'll take how much it'll
cost and if the reports are true that
the water resistance goes down the drain
after it gets repaired sure there are
third-party repair shops or even parts
on eBay but with no visible screws on
the chassis this is something that I
really wouldn't recommend doing yourself
or at least something I won't try to do
on my own whatever the case may be I do
have to give props to Samsung for how
durable this phone is I mean hey
surviving a fall from a second floor is
just epic but I also have to give a
thumbs down for how complicated it is to
get repairs yes we know phones aren't
really designed to be dropped but that
mentality is also unrealistic in
real-world use expect thereafter the bus
segment coming very soon and I'll report
back on the experience on getting this
phone repaired how about you what are
