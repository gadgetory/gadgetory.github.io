pocketnow.com what happens when you take
an already fast foam like the galaxy s3
and put the fastest version of android
on it 4.1 jelly bean well we're gonna
find out in this video if got the
Samsung Galaxy s3 here running
CyanogenMod 10 alpha kind of a beta
alpha very early release but it's pretty
darn fast and we're gonna see how
project butter looks and feels on the
galaxy s3 let's get to it
okay so here we are this is the galaxy
s3 this is the International quad-core
version but there are builds of
CyanogenMod 10 early previews out for
all versions of the galaxy s3 whether
you're on t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T Sprint or
Verizon again it's early software you
have to be rooted we'll put a link up on
the video so you can get back to the
how-to root galaxy s3 video if you
haven't done that yet so I've been using
this for about 24 hours trying to figure
out if it's good enough if it's fast
enough who's really curious to see how
jelly bean which is the fastest version
of Android works on the galaxy s3 and so
far so good I'm really pleased let's
just move around real quick I definitely
want to get into the web browser and
also show you how this version of jelly
bean compares to a more official version
of jelly bean that I've been using on
the Galaxy Nexus here so we'll just move
around we get that buttery smoothness go
into the app tray boom no animation it
just comes up immediately which is
fantastic so let's move around a little
more folders open super quick we've got
the the UI operating at a very high
frame rate triple buffering a lot of
technical stuff going on which basically
just means that everything is super
duper fast now a little note here we've
got Google now but Google now doesn't
work like it does on the Galaxy Nexus on
the Galaxy Nexus you slide up from the
bottom and boom there's Google now on
the G gs3 here what you have to do is
put a shortcut there at least this is
what I found because I swipe up from the
bottom does nothing you put a shortcut
to Google here which you can find in the
app tray and that will launch Google now
as you've expected it to work
so let's jumpin the browser
try to see how the performances here on
the galaxy s3 running CyanogenMod 10
we're gonna go to a complex website
we're going to end gadget and we are
over a Wi-Fi network here right now so
it should be fast okay that is
ridiculously fast but that's too easy
that's the mobile site let's go to their
desktop version which is very long has a
ton of images and before it's finished
loading I'm going to move down the page
no checkerboards pretty impressive here
smooth the scrolling is SuperDuper
smooth moving down the page I don't see
any hesitation whatsoever
if we're going to go to Engadget kind of
hard to type from this view we get the
mobile version also very smooth jelly
bean does some really good things don't
want to do with that let's go back
accidentally hit that button go to the
desktop view and before it's done
loading we're going to try the same test
we're gonna flick around the page and
it's pretty good a little bit of white
boxing or checkerboarding going on but
not too bad on the galaxy s3 they're
both very very smooth and of course on
the galaxy s3 you're getting more
vertical pixels because you don't have
this button bar here you've got the bars
on the bottom speaking of the the
buttons down here let's see multitask so
tap and hold over here a little bit
faster actually on the galaxy s3 even
though on the Galaxy Nexus there's a
button dedicated for it but super fast
no hesitation I mean it looks good on
both devices but the Galaxy s3 is a
little extra interesting because you've
got that bigger screen and a higher
resolution display in terms of the
usable space because there are no
buttons on the bottom so so far so good
with the the preview version of
CyanogenMod 10 on the galaxy s3 there
will be Knightley's coming out for this
so there will be fixes to the little
bugs that still exist another little bug
here you might have noticed that in the
app tray I've got two cameras I've got
two galleries I don't know why it's not
that big of a deal I can ignore them but
it's you know it's a it's a hint that
there are some bugs with it so we'll put
links up on how to get jellybean for
your Galaxy s3 I highly recommend you do
it if you're brave enough to root your
phone and deal with a couple of
but I've been using this for 24 hours
like I said and so far so it was so good
it's dramatically increased the speed of
the galaxy s3 compared to even
CyanogenMod 9 a stable version I was
running just just a couple days ago so
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and thanks for watching that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
