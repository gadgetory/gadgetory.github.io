smartphone this new app is just for you
I'm Taylor Martin this is pocket now and
this is link bubble to this day action
launcher is one of the most compelling
third-party launches around tweet lanes
before Twitter's new api's put a cap on
the project was one of the most
interesting and beautiful clients on
Android and the developer Chris Lacey is
continuing to find ways to improve the
Android experience specifically by
breaking boundaries thinking outside the
box and fixing all those little
annoyances of the mobile experience one
by one this time lacey has fixed the
dystopia created by link redirects on
Android and web page load times the app
is called link bubble and it's the best
incarnation of the chat head style
floating window to date period without
link bubble when you click a link you're
automatically taken to a blank tab in
your default browser and force to wait
while it loads if that link happens to
be a redirect you're taken to your
browser of choice wait through a short
pause then you're shot into the
correlated app it wastes precious
seconds and frankly creates a jerky user
experience that doesn't always work as
intended leak bubble fixes that in a
beautifully simple way setup is simple
download and install the application
from Google Play open the app and set
link bubble as your default system
browser then set your left and right
share bubbles and set the text zoom or
incognito mode if desired that's it now
when you click links a bubble for that
link will appear on the left edge of the
display and the pages will load in the
background in the settings you can
specify whether those pages will auto
expand when they're finished loading or
not and if there is a redirect it
happens automatically in the background
with no runaround it's seamless
basically this allows you to load a
webpage you might want to check out
without interrupting what you're
currently doing you can load multiple
pages without ever leaving the app this
saves users from the boring wait times
that inevitably occur while waiting for
links to load if you ever wonder how
much time link bubble is actually saving
you just pop into the app and it will
tell you as well as other important
information to expand a bubble simply
tap it the page or pages will expand
from there it works just as any other
browser pinch-to-zoom load new links and
open and curl
if you so desire you can switch between
bubbles by simply tapping them at the
top of the display and if there are
youtube videos embedded in a page you
can quickly jump to that content and
load the videos in the YouTube
application closed just one tab either
back out of it by pressing the back
button or grab the bubble from the open
tab and flick it towards the bottom of
the display to close all tap to collapse
the open tabs into one bubble and flick
it towards the bottom of the display
link bubble also comes with a quick
share option remember those chair
bubbles you set up I chose buffer for
the left bubble and pocket for the right
to save a link for later I can simply
grab the bubble and flick it towards my
pocket share bo bo on the right corner
or if I want to send that link to
Twitter and Facebook simultaneously with
buffer I can flick a link bubble into
the upper left corner it's truly an
amazing display of the flexibility of
Android and the developers ingenuity
it's not overdone it doesn't pack in
frivolous features and it works exactly
as intended there is a period of setup
where you will have to specify
applications such as redirects to
Instagram YouTube or other third party
apps but as long as you select always
when prompted you'll only have to deal
with it once with the free version of
link bubble you can only load one tab at
a time from within one specified
application with leak bubble pro 499 in
Google Play to unlock the ability to
load 23 or as many links at one time as
you desire as well as the ability to
utilize link bubble from within any
application on your phone link bubble
has quickly risen to our list of top
android apps and we definitely recommend
spending the five dollars to get the
full effect of the application thanks
