smartphone this new app is just for you
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is link bubble to this day action
launcher is one of the most compelling
third-party launches around tweet lanes
before Twitter's new API is put a cap on
the project was one of the most
interesting and beautiful clients on
Android and the developer Chris lacy is
continuing to find ways to improve the
Android experience specifically by
breaking boundaries thinking outside the
box and fixing all those little
annoyances of the mobile experience one
by one this time Lacey has fixed the
dystopia created by link redirects on
Android and web page load times the app
is called link bubble and it's the best
incarnation of the chat head style
floating window to date period without
link bubble when you click a link you
are automatically taken to a blank tab
in your default browser and forced to
wait while it loads if that link happens
to be a redirect you're taken to your
browser of choice wait through a short
pause then you're shot into the
correlated app it wastes precious
seconds and frankly creates a jerky user
experience that doesn't always work as
intended leak bubble fixes that in a
beautifully simple way setup is simple
download and install the application
from Google Play open the app and set
link bubble as your default system
browser then set your left and right
share bubbles and set the text zoom or
incognito mode if desired that's it now
when you click links a bubble for that
link will appear on the left edge of the
display and the pages will load in the
background in the settings you can
specify whether those pages will auto
expand when they're finished loading or
not and if there is a redirect it
happens automatically in the background
with no run around it's seamless
basically this allows you to load a web
page you might want to check out without
interrupting what you're currently doing
you can load multiple pages without ever
leaving the app this saves users from
the boring wait times that inevitably
occur while waiting for links to load if
you ever wonder how much time link
bubble is actually saving you just hop
into the app and it will tell you as
well as other important information to
expand a bubble simply tap it the page
or pages will expand from there it works
just as any other browser pinch to zoom
load new links and open and curl
if you so desire you can switch between
bubbles by simply tapping them at the
top of the display and if there are
YouTube videos embedded in a page you
can quickly jump to that content and
load the videos in the YouTube
application close just one tab either
back out of it by pressing the back
button or grab the bubble from the open
tab and flick it towards the bottom of
the display to close all tap to collapse
the open tabs into one bubble and flick
it towards the bottom of the display
link bubble also comes with a quick
share option remember those share
bubbles you set up
I chose buffer for the left bubble and
pocket for the right to save a link for
later I can simply grab the bubble and
flick it towards my pocket share bubble
on the right corner or if I want to send
that link to Twitter and Facebook
simultaneously with buffer I can flick
and link bubble in to the upper left
corner it's truly an amazing display of
the flexibility of Android and the
developers ingenuity it's not overdone
it doesn't pack in frivolous features
and it works exactly as intended there
is a period of setup where you will have
to specify applications such as
redirects to Instagram YouTube or other
third-party apps but as long as you
select always when prompted
you'll only have to deal with it once
with the free version of link bubble you
can only load one tab at a time from
within one specified application with
leak bubble pro $4.99 in Google Play you
unlock the ability to load 2/3 or as
many links at one time as you desire as
well as the ability to utilize leak
bubble from within any application on
your phone link bubble has quickly risen
to our list of top Android apps and we
definitely recommend spending the $5 to
get the full effect of the application
