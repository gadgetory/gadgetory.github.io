celebrates 25 billion app downloads with
a sale and barnes and noble announces
new nooks I'm primary better downloading
as many apps as I can and this is
parking out daily ah the HTC One X plus
another one of the smart phones that
were drooling over this holiday season
just made a short appearance in an
undisclosed video it'll keep the same 1x
iconic design but it'll bring a new
processor that's a tickler 3 plus that
plans to bring quad-core along with LTE
in the same chip it also will bring
Android 4.1 jelly bean out-of-the-box
along with a new version of sensitive
4.5 the only problem with all this leak
is that t-mobile logo at the top which
kind of worries me and the reason why is
because most likely t-mobile does that
exclusive thing that ends up pulling
great smartphones like the HTC One S
from the rest of the market just for
them that's right google is now
celebrating their 25 billion app
download milestone from their google
play store by offering us deals starting
today and for the next five days you get
a lot of top paid applications for just
a quarter of the price and finally
Google will also be offering something
for music and books though we still
can't find any details on that now we
can't find a filter for these apps sadly
on the Google Play Store so if you find
anything share the links now after just
a couple of weeks since amazon announced
their new kindle fire lineup barnes &amp;amp;
noble is now offering their new nook
tablets which would be the nook HD and
then ugh HD Plus both tablets having
great screens that fall into right in
the territory along with great specs and
a great price tag though sadly if you're
looking for an android tablet my best
option for you would be the nexus 7
obviously unless xda-developers figures
out how to route that thing because
sadly barnes and noble sticks everything
into their own content and for some sad
news today Texas Instruments has just
announced that they will be dropping
their smartphone strategy if you wonder
why this matters well the current
generation Samsung Galaxy Nexus is
running a Texas Instruments processor
according to TI they are leaving because
they're looking for a more stable market
which is kind of ironic because it just
reminds me of how Intel dropped the
whole xscale processor years ago
and how they're trying to go crazy
coming back into smartphones and tablets
so texas instruments so long i did like
your calculators though and finally for
the frustrating news of the day we've
got no key offering us a full info graph
of y it's worth it to wait for the Lumia
920 one compared to the iphone five if
you look at the details it's really
compelling to wait for the Lumia 920
it's got a lot of great specs my problem
with milk is the fact that they expect
the whole month telling us why we should
wait for the Lumia 920 instead of the
galaxy s3 and instead of the iphone 5
and I think that Nokia doesn't really
get it that we don't want a piece of
paper we want them to start selling us
the damn phone I think no key should
just put their money where their mouth
is and that leads me to the question of
the day are you waiting for a Lumia 920
in my opinion I wanted a Lumia 920 it's
a great phone but it's kind of hard when
you get a galaxy s3 an iphone 5 right
now leave us a comment down below now if
you want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world don't forget to follow was
on Parker now calm please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I'm heightened it'll be better
