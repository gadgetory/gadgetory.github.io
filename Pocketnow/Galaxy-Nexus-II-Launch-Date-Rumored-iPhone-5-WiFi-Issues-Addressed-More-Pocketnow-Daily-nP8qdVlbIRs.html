Apple seems to be losing their minds
with iCloud and the verizon iphone 5
gets a Wi-Fi book fix hopefully I'm hi
mary vetta wishing that Nexus event was
happening right now and this is parking
out daily
now there's no better way to start the
week than with some google nexus rumors
this time we have reports of a probable
launch date happening exactly 30 days
from now which pretty much matches the
launch date of the Galaxy Nexus last
year now our biggest question would be
if we will get a lot of Nexus devices
from different manufacturers or if we
will only get the samsung I 9260 that's
been rumored recently my money is set on
just getting one device from Samsung but
leave us a comment down below what do
you want or what do you think will
happen lots of devices are just one now
AT&amp;amp;T has just announced the sony xperia
TL and their 4g LTE network that's
pretty much the same device that we had
some hands-on time over at Aoife and
berlin being dubbed the Sony Xperia T or
sony xperia TX now the added punch here
is that it will have AT&amp;amp;T 4G LTE and
also it'll be the James Bond phone for
their new movie Skyfall though I'm not
sure if this is only just branding or if
it will be the actual phone that the guy
will use in the movie regardless of what
happens i'm just wondering of AT&amp;amp;T wants
us to call this the Xperia TL Sony
Xperia T L or if they wanted shake that
not stirred in the review now an
interesting kick in Apple's iCloud
service is the fact that previous
mobileme customers were offered a full
year of 20 gigabytes of iCloud storage
as a compensation for losing mobileme
but the interesting news is that that
year ended today and we were supposed to
be expecting a renewal for 40 bucks but
Apple apparently has decided to push
that extension to the year 2050 and I'm
not kidding here so either this is
Apple's way of compensating mobileme
customers for getting lost with maps or
this is the longest lasting bug I've
ever seen and I will not complain for
the next 38 years I promise now fans of
the windows phone 8x and 8s by hcc are
in for a treat the company just posted a
full-size sample photo in their blog of
three executives using the front-facing
2.1 megapixel wide-angle lens camera and
to be honest with you were quite
impressed I mean the three guys fit in
the shot the color reproduction was also
great probably a little overexposed for
the taste of many but so far the camera
is as amazing as we saw at the press
event where we had some hands on
now even though this will be great for
having some Facebook bathroom shots I
know you're going to have a hard time
hiding that toilet and finally for the
news that will put a dent in anybody's
pocket Apple has just issued a carrier
settings update for the verizon iphone 5
apparently the device was not connecting
appropriately to Wi-Fi and the rest of
the data was coming from the limited
data plan now the problem here is that
apparently AT&amp;amp;T customers are now
complaining about the issue and the
funny thing is a lot of them are now
stating that they're losing hundreds of
dollars in their phone bill when they've
barely on the phone for two weeks but
anyways that leads me to the question of
the day are you having any problems with
carrier data have you checked your phone
bill I don't receive my iphone 5 until
the next two weeks but leave us a
comment down below now if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow was on Parker
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hina be
better thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
