introduced a control center that looked
very much like androids notification
shade I'm Joe Levi for pocket now and
turnabout's Fair Play
this is my Nexus 4 I'm running
CyanogenMod and I'm rooted but you don't
have to be to run Control Center you
open up the app and you've got a few
settings and it's all this nice yellow
minion colored theme to it we've got
general settings where you can go
through and do a whole bunch of stuff
including making the indicator icon
transparent hold off on doing that for a
while until the next couple upgrades
enable many of you I'll show you that in
a minute and then you can hide some
stuff if you don't want them to be there
so what are we talking about this is
your notification shade everybody as you
said if you've got an Android you pull
it down from the top you've got a tablet
you can pull it down from the other side
and get some different settings and
whatnot so that's that's what it is you
can control stuff right up in here your
music you can dismiss notifications all
kinds of cool things but it doesn't look
like Apple that a lot of you will say it
doesn't have to be Apple's the copycat
here because they've got their control
center which looks like a notification
shade that you drag up from the bottom
but it does look kind of cool right
that's what control center does you get
a hotspot that you can drag fun I've
anchored mine over here into the center
50% of the right side of my screen you
can assign that pretty much anywhere you
want except the top and once you do that
it just like you saw there very simply
you can swipe and get all of your stuff
here's your quick toggles your
brightness settings you can even even go
right into a brightness from there come
back here and we'll get back into it now
notice in that point I didn't grab
exactly in the center I was up above or
below so I'll come back and grab it that
time so you can still do your side to
side swiping without a problem you just
have to know exactly where it is to get
that and I've set mine to 50% you can
set yours above or below that you can
even put it down on the bottom if you
want this is just kind of as an example
and so I can maintain my my google now
we also have my
now playing music that I can start stop
scrub through wherever I want you've got
a quick lunch down at the bottom if we
want to add a new app down here we just
tap on that let's say I want to put in
what we want to put in nest so I can
control my thermostat really easy so
we'll just do that we'll come back here
and there is nest and we can scrub back
and forth you can also go back and forth
up here on your quick toggles very cool
so let's go ahead and take a look at
that compact version like I told you we
were going to come back into control
center and if I remember where that was
general settings enable many of you okay
and there's the many of you down there I
kind of like the full view you can see
that blue bar right there that's my
swipe area just in case you were
wondering what that was general settings
let's turn that back off
we can hide brightness because I don't
ever do stuff with brightness I like
auto brightness and then when we do that
we've just saved a little bit of space
in here as well really kind of cool this
has been a hands-on of Control Center
for Android by lone tooth it is
available in the Play Store for free
right now you can go and get a copy
there are certain things that they're
working on upgrading animations and
whatnot that will be coming soon so make
sure you keep an eye on it but it is
completely functional today if you like
seeing this kind of stuff make sure you
give the video a big thumbs up and make
sure you subscribe to our channel if you
haven't already done so why not share it
with your friends on your favorite
social media networks we're on all of
them on Twitter we're at pocket now and
I'm at Joe Levi thanks for watching
we'll get you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
