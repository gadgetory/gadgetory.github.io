phone unlocking bill seems kind of weak
and some iphone 5s rumors seem kind of
weird I'm hi meri behna and speaking of
weird there should be some sort of mix
between coffee and beer this is parking
out daily unlocking consumer choice and
wireless competition act I'm going to
say this first before I forget it but
for those of you that heard about the
wireless independence act will
apparently that's past tense or sort of
apparently they're changing the bill in
this new bill is sadly not as good as
the first one that we saw apparently
this new bill will just tell Congress
you know hey could you please look at
unlocking smart phones by the end of the
year and that's pretty much where things
are sadly apparently the bill or
whatever the White House was planning to
do in making unlocking smartphones legal
it's not really where we wanted it to be
but obviously not everything's been said
here just yet so stay tuned we'll keep
you posted and for those of you that
worried about nokia because of their
leaked document yesterday well they're
still pushing those horses there are
rumors of a new Nokia Lumia 928 reaching
verizon very soon and there are tons of
specifications that are quite compelling
but probably the most important one is
that apparently this will be Nokia's
first metallic Lumia I'm not sure if
that's going to be aluminum or what
material are going to be using that this
will be their first metallic phone or
probably metallic Lumia per se but there
are a lot of specs in a lot of details
on this device so make sure you hit the
link to the description this device
should reach big red very soon now let's
talk about some more iphone 5s rumors if
you were wondering what Apple's planning
to do to differentiate this device will
apparently there is this new supplier
out there that's going to be building a
new type of display for Apple and
apparently what this display is going to
allow you to do is actually use the
phone for fingerprint scanning for new
security measures and it just begs you
to wonder because we know that
fingerprint scanning is not something
new but it is really new on a display
and we know that Apple's really a late
bloomer when it comes to these
technologies most of the time Apple
leaves everything last because
apparently we want to figure it out
before everybody else does and that's
the same case about NFC is apparently
this device will also support NFC which
makes a lot of sense with passbook but
which never took off with Android so the
question is what will Apple bring to the
table to make NFC and fingerprint scan
different stay tuned now let's talk
about the HTC One a review unit has just
reached our Boston laps on the device is
as beautiful as you can imagine Michael
Fisher is gonna take it over a lot of
comparisons and obviously his full
fledge review but not everything is fun
and games when it comes to the HTC One
we've got some UK retailers already
complaining about shipping dates
remember that the HTC One was gonna ship
by March fifteenth but apparently some
people are already saying that it's
going to be delayed two weeks til March
29th now our review unit came in a
retail package so this could probably be
just the UK issue so stay tuned and
finally for the hot news of the day
those of you that were wondering of the
samsung galaxy s4 s design leaked photos
were real well there's already a video
of the phone and it does look a lot like
the galaxy s3 it's pretty much just the
combination of like the galaxy note 2
and the galaxy s3 although we sadly
don't see an S Pen there anywhere but
the interesting news is that it does
have this sort of stainless steel band
around it instead of plastic this time
it looks a lot like the old blackberry
bold 9900 I think it was so it's kind of
an interesting design obviously March
14th will be the date but interesting
enough we have more rumors that the
Galaxy Note 3 in the future will be
ditching AMOLED technology and there are
rumors of the galaxy s4 alongside bring
some sort of new AMOLED technology
probably not necessarily changing it but
I would probably change the name but
that leads you to the question of the
day do you like amoled displays or which
is your favorite display technology in
my particular case I love the super lcd2
and obviously now the super lcd3 I feel
that that had the most accurate colors
but tell us about you which is your
favorite display I know that a lot of
people like for example Michael Fisher
he loves the contrast of the AMOLED
display so leave us a comment down below
which is your favorite of course as
always if you want an earlier scoop of
