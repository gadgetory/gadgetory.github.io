curved smartphone in its global form but
we promised you follow-up coverage on
the US model and it became available and
now we're here to do just that I'm high
as a human with pocket now taking a look
at the LG G flex 2 for Sprint
if there's one thing to be said about
the G flex - it's that this thing is
flashy the arch design and the volcano
red back make it one of the most
eye-catching smartphones on the market
and the Sprint model remains totally
unchanged in that way the foam measures
nine point four millimeters at its
thickest point and weighs in at just 152
grams and it's just one of the most
comfortable phones I think I've ever
used a trademark feature of the G flex 2
is of course it's curved design which
conforms perfectly to the palm of your
hand and along your face and it makes
for a slightly immersive experience when
you're watching videos there's also the
rear mount and control scheme that puts
the power and volume buttons right where
your finger naturally rests and makes
room to fit as much screen in as little
space as possible what I'm getting at is
this phone is carefully designed to be
entirely ergonomic and it's one of LG's
biggest victories with the device packed
inside is the Snapdragon 810 chipset
sitting alongside three gigabytes of RAM
and in Adreno 430 GPU there's also a
3000 milliamp hour battery and a 13
megapixel camera with laser autofocus
and optical image stabilization an
increasing rarity in today's smartphones
another rare inclusion here is the
microSD slot with support for a maximum
2 terabyte card now the biggest
difference between this model and the
South Korean model that Michael Fisher
tested back in February is also the most
obvious one compatibility with Sprint's
spark LTE network the phone comes
pre-loaded with a bevy of sprint
applications
none of which we've really found
particularly useful but thankfully most
of them can be disabled or uninstalled
the one new feature that we're glad to
see here is Wi-Fi calling something
previously only found on t-mobile phones
you can make you cheap jabs at Sprint or
even needing a feature like this but the
fact of the matter is every carrier has
dead spots and it's better to embrace
that and be prepared aside from that
this is largely the same software
experience the Michael touched on in his
review there's still the awesome double
tap to wake function and its evolved
form not code and plenty of
customization options like being able to
change the buttons in your navigation
bar
especially on a 5.5 inch display it's
really nice to have a button to call
down the notification shade without
having to contort your thumb
there's also LG's peak function which
lets you slide a finger down the screen
and the display is off to preview the
time and any new notifications something
else you can do with the display off is
launch the camera with a long press of
the volume down key the viewfinder is
largely the same one that we found on
the g3 and we appreciate its clean and
simple UI even if it's sometimes a
little confusing the camera itself takes
pretty great photos in broad daylight
and thanks to oh is videos look
reasonably smooth as well but don't
expect the same story indoors once the
Sun is out of sight saturation takes a
pretty big hit and shots turn fuzzy fast
it's not unmanageable but if you spend a
lot of time in dimly lit areas this may
not be the camera for you when Michael
reviewed the G flex 2 his biggest
concerns were with the phone's
performance and battery life neither of
those things were particularly great
with my sprint unit but it's worth
noting that my time with the phone
showed significantly less lag than his
reports whether that's the result of a
much needed software update or a
difference at Hardware beyond the two
variants were not sure but beyond the
occasional one-and-done stutter I never
really ran into any major performance
issues apps and games ran smoothly in my
testing and I was always able to stream
music from Spotify in the background
without tripping up the phone but it's
quick to let me know when apps like
Spotify might lead to battery drain that
drain is pretty significant and no
matter how I use the phone throughout
the day it never lasts me more than four
and a half hours of screen all the time
this might be forgivable if you could
replace the battery on the go but with
the sealed in unit
you can't the G flex 2 is available at
scrimped right now with a retail price
of $500 and especially given the specs
inside and the great design that's a
really good deal the phone got a lot of
flack in the first wave of reviews for
its performance issues but at this point
I'm convinced that the only reason not
to buy it is because we already know
that the g4 is coming but even the g4
can't offer the same wow factor the same
organ omits the same pizazz and if
that's your thing maybe you should pay a
visit to the now network
that's gonna do it for our video review
of the sprint G flex 2 if you want even
more info on this phone might I
recommend reading a written review at
pocketnow.com but before you go there

channel for more video content and drop

once again I'm hi out to Houston and
I'll see you in the next one thanks for
