are back at the Samsung booth we're
taking a look at an awesome new feature
you might have known of the group late
from the Samsung Galaxy s4 which allows
you to listen to music with your friends
on more devices now Samsung is thinking
that a one step further now you can
share video let's take a look at how
it's done now first of all content that
can be streamed has to be local content
and for that we have to start the
application called group play on every
phone say you're with your friends and
you want to share a moment which you
have just captured in one of your phones
and as I can see right now they are
currently playing because I have not
stopped the master device
right now they are all in sync and in
the same group and this being the master
device which is streaming video to the
others let's just push play and you'll
notice that the entire suit friend
number one number two and number three
are watching the same thing but if you
want to take a step back and you want to
experience a widescreen image then let's
see then you just swipe it over and
swipe this one over to the adjacent one
quickly I've been told like this quickly
both Springs and also with the poor
screen and there you have it a wide
screen experience and everybody can see
a wider handle this of course perks it
video and we have seen the music sharing
which was on the s4 it's now on the note
3 too but the video sharing stuff is
exclusive to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
so that's also a novelty which Samsung
has brought to Aoife with the note 3
this was a short look at it
I've been anton denied for pocket now
michael fisher behind the camera stood
up keypad a number to stay tuned for
luck more videos thank you very much
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
