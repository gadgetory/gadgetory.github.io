we've been using the new king tube for
about a couple weeks now one of the
coolest features is the Kim studio that
you can access from any web browser
alright so this is the Kin studio it's a
civil Silverlight application that you
get to from the browser you go to Kim
calm and you can't login until after
your setup your kin phone with your
windows live ID after you've done that
on the phone you come to Kim calm and
you log into the studio with that same
lot ID and you get something like this
obviously you have to wait a little
while and have to take some pictures and
they'll show up here so this is your
timeline it shows i'm looking at may the
month we can look at in week or day mode
and we see some messages those from
different people there we have a spot we
have some context that we recently spoke
to on the phone some of them that don't
have pictures our exchange contacts this
does not the studio does not sync with
exchange but the King does and you also
have some cool multi-touch stuff going
on here you can shrink it that's kind of
cool anyway let's click on a picture
and it's going to load that picture and
you can click to the next one like so up
here we can upload it to Facebook
MySpace or Windows Live are more button
lets us favorite rotate it download it
or delete it you can go to the next one
here's a video this is a silverlight
you can watch your videos right here and
you can upload it to facebook or myspace
or download it or delete it and over
here is a map so this is pretty cool too
that's going to show you a map of where
we took the picture and we got some
multi-touch going on you can see some
other pictures are over there by the
river can see those and you got your
zoom and pan tools but multi-touch work
nicely alright we can go to some of my
other pictures that happened over here
there's the spot so that's pretty nice
oops and we got more pictures now you
notice the background is you know a
faded back photo of mine so if I want to
change that I can add a favorite it's
going to add to my favorites and the
background is going to change to that
newest favorite picture your item was
added to favorites there so I can go
back now you see that new pictures
Becker right back there pretty nice and
over here is a loop pretty similar to
the loop on your phone get your updates
from myspace Facebook you see them over
here Twitter onion you can favorite your
feeds so that they'll show up on the
loop in your phone I unfavorite at
Twitter so I don't have myspace the
onion Facebook kin stupid kin tips but
you can still access them from here
here's our pocket now feed you can load
any RSS feed here and then we are and up
here I can tap that and just like on the
phone we can update our status for
facebook myspace and twitter all from
the same place you can also do the drag
and drop into the loop I'm going to spot
there's raise info uses Facebook page
this is Windows Live information so it's
all separated I also check out your
photos and videos from this section now
they're all in a grid format we still
have our time line up here see the
minute a different layout more
thumbnails again we'll get back to this
messages you can see all your text and
mms also by the timeline you can't send
text messages from here you can't
initiate them these are people i called
contacts this is all of them i loaded
like thousands from windows live myspace
facebook exchange you can see them all
here you have favorites once without
pictures are from exchange so there you
go that's pretty much it King studio
great web-based management system for
all your photos and contacts and RSS
feeds and status updates and everything
for the king that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
