iphone 5s in the ipad 5 samson getting
ready for galaxy s4 developer edition
and Facebook quietly is pulling the plug
on their Facebook phone I'm hi Mary
Letta and please Facebook don't bring a
Facebook tablet next this is fucking out
daily the sorts day off with the odd
news LG is at a convention right now
showing off a new demo unit in this
smartphone as they call it is actually
special because the screen has no bezel
no bezel whatsoever and yeah it doesn't
have a front facing camera a proximity
sensor buttons anything it's just a
gigantic screen no sighs being mentioned
it's just being designed by this new TFT
oxide process that LG is bring in we do
know that most of apple products use LG
Display so it must be really cool even
though apparently it's not that bright
you'll probably never see the light of
day but it's interesting to see what
they're trying to do I believe you're
the future now let's talk about Samsung
the company is preparing their developer
edition of the galaxy s4 just like we
have on the HTC One already this device
will be available for both verizon and
AT&amp;amp;T as opposed to the HTC One which is
only available for 80 mt + gsm carriers
n well we don't have a pricing point all
we know is that the device is already
available in the Samsung website no
specifics on dates just yet in for those
of you that are curious as to how many
galaxies have sports have been sold 10
million is the mark already interesting
okay now let's move over to Facebook as
the company is quietly pulling the plug
on its HTC first further UK launch
because according to them they want to
focus more on building the software a
facebook com to deal with the complaints
that customers have and not focus on the
hardware you know just the polite way to
say that they're not selling many phones
it hasn't been pulled from AT&amp;amp;T but all
most likely happen and let me just
clarify this has nothing to do with the
facebook phone I mean the phone is
actually quite good the problem is
actually the strategy and speaking of
HTC two things number one they just sold
5 million units of the HTC One a very
good number of you asked me and compared
to pretty much every other smartphone in
the market and then on the other news
they just announced their HTC Desire 600
and it's great that they're adopting
vers right now and this is pretty much
the HTC m4 that was leaked it is an HTC
one with mitzi expects and it's actually
quite nice phone it's God sends five
it's got boom sound we still don't know
when it'll launch the United States we
will keep you posted but this is a very
good mid tier fun Sally Italian display
is not that hot though we'll keep you
posted and finally for the interesting
news of the day let's talk about the
iphone 5s and the ipad 5 rumor roundup
apparently there is a new type of
microphone at the back for the iphone 5s
and I've had five and well it will
improve video recording sound quality
and you'll also be getting a sort of a
dual flash at the back of the iphone 5s
we don't see this happening on any
tablet and Louis I firm that there is a
more news of the budget iPhone bringing
a plastic design and color options but
obviously it's kind of hard to know if
it'll happen or not but that leads you
to the question of the day are you
holding off for you know an iphone 5s or
and I've had five and your next round of
purchases for the next couple of months
you know judging by the manufacturing
dates of these product is hot kind of
hard to know they'll happen at WWDC
honestly I don't see it happen but leave
us a comment down below if you're
expecting any of these products in my
particular case with the HTC one in the
galaxy s4 it's a kind of a hard position
so let us know in the comments what you
think of course it's always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and told me
