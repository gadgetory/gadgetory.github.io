com we're here with this Hardware tour
of this samsung vibrant on this is t
mobile's version of the Samsung Galaxy S
series so first off you see we got a big
nice 4 inch screen here some capacitive
buttons at the bottom that's a menu home
back and search you can't feel them with
your finger so you're going to have to
look at them with your eyes to figure
out where they are there's no call send
or end button so if you're on a call and
you have to hang up you're going to have
to turn the screen on navigate to the
phone software and then find the end
button on the screen that's kind of pain
but we have our Samson logo there and
you see this screen is nice blue like
the other galaxies guest Isis we have
our speaker up here t-mobile logo and
their proximity sensor can you see those
and the ambient light sensor are up here
I have this nice silver finish little
silver rim around the whole edge and
your got your microphone down there just
one microphone the top is your headphone
jack and this is kind of nice got a
little door and slide a little door and
that's your micro USB port also doubles
as the TV out port and of course
charging and nice little door clicks
back gotta land yard hole see that right
there volume switch up and down right
there where your thumb would be and over
here is the power button which I really
like because see that you can just hold
it in your left hand there's my power
button volume control right there really
organ ahmud place from power button will
like that
and we got everything else the back we
have this really cool it's that it's
very shiny so we got fingerprints on it
already even though I cleaned it and you
got your speaker here 5 megapixel camera
no flash will test that out later big
galaxy s logo there and here's like a
lump it's like a reverse chin and how
most android phones used to have the
chin on the front now we have it on the
back not sure what that's for but uh you
got a little lip there feels kind of
weird your hand found that lip but it
might if you put it right there it's
actually pretty comfortable so the
device feels real light and really thin
let me see opening the back is you know
kind of difficult there's a little tiny
slit right there and you got to stick
your finger in there and try to pry it
open it's the slot is too too small for
like a coin so it's not easy there we go
this is all plastic yeah here's our
battery that's fifteen hundred milliamps
per hour we have our SIM card slot right
there and this is our micro SD slot two
gigs comes with it which includes avatar
the movie you got a little screws here
so it looks like we could take it apart
if we wanted to so there it is put this
back on samsung galaxy s vibrant on
t-mobile looking pretty nice and stay
tuned for more we'll go over the
software in a next video that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
