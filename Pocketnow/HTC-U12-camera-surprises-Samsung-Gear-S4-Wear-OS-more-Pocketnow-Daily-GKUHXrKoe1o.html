would be surprised that it's the EXO
mark Samsung's new gear s4 has been
spotted in the wild and not running
Tizen and if you truly want to bezel
this phone vivo is apparently taking its
concept to the next level I'm shiny I'm
high metal a well I'm shiny Rivera
apparently was the best joke yesterday
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with sales oneplus has
not provided official numbers yet as to
how many units they've sold but
according to them this has been their
best selling smartphone ever topping the
1 + 5 T and we have seen the results I
mean if you saw everything on Instagram
like the pop-up stores in New York and
San Francisco were crowded the lines
were insane and you know what I get it
there's a reason for that you can learn
more about the oneplus 6 in the
description with our video so you will
remember that concept smartphone that we
weren't able to catch at CES the apex
from vivo where there was a truly
business phone and we had the selfie
camera pop-up from the top there are TV
ads now showing this phone off meeting
and these are World Cup ads meaning it
apparently is going to happen we are
going to get this phone at some point I
can't wait to see when that's gonna
happen that was with the spotlight over
to LG as we were shocked at the fact
that the g7 think queue was not
available at AT&amp;amp;T we've heard rumors
that apparently there will be a V 35
that's going to be launched on AT&amp;amp;T and
now the rumors show us that it could
happen in August but apparently it's not
gonna have a knotch array and that
specifications are going to be
significantly better than the B 30 and
the g7 apparently the price tag is
already being teased for Korean variants
around 850 bucks so stay tuned and yes
we have heard rumors that Samsung is
going to ditch Tizen or at least there
will be a variant of the gear s 4 that's
going to be running where OS from
Android as it turns out famous tipster
Evan Blass is already found or has
discovered that there are people Samsung
executives already using this new watch
Aoife could be the time frame stay tuned
we will be covering Eva and I can't wait
to see it and finally the most
interesting news that they have to
with HTC as the company has just
announced the HTC u12 plus our hands-on
video of the phone is already live my
first impressions there as well it's an
interesting as I say in the video and
interesting iteration to what we've seen
in the past but the most important part
ok DxO mark has just provided the result
and we know that the top phone is the
b20 pro and right it should at 109 in
its score but the second phone right now
it's the HTC u12 plus topping the Google
pixel to topping even the p20 at 103 of
I obviously only spent an hour or so in
the hands-on so I didn't really see the
resulting photos but I guess now I
really want to review this phone but in
today's question let us know what do you
think about the you know the HTC you 12
plus and number two with this DX Oh mark
lure you to buying an HTC phone again
because in my case it seems that this
collaboration between Google and HTC is
starting to show some fruit I would
actually be willing to test one of these
phones I mean the feel was great
everything was great but the cameras
great alright leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
