galaxy note 4 reveals and beauty the
iphone 6 leaked show us that there is
not much Wow to expect and Microsoft has
just begun to tease what to expect for
eva 2014 I'm high memory that I am my
new motto for Monday's is to not
complain too much that is this is
forking out daily let's begin today with
the official news as Microsoft is just
in our press invitations for incident to
happen on September for that Aoife in
Berlin our own michael fisher and taylor
one will be covering this event live and
there is a lot to expect judging from
the teasers one of the devices we're
expecting as the Nokia Lumia 730 which
is the selfie phone that's being teased
but even more interesting is that if you
look at the oh and more you'll notice
that that hump looks a lot like what we
see on the Lumia 1020 currently so could
it be that we're getting the future
lumia 1030 let's hope now one thing that
we hope to see a tifa but we haven't
confirmed just yet is the future HTC One
m8 for Windows that's the rumored name
for this device and we've got some leaks
when it comes to specifications and I'm
not going to bore you with them they
look exactly like what we get on a
current one m8 it is pretty much a One
m8 for Windows though we expect that
there could probably some design changes
we're still not sure but some of us
assume that that could be a possibility
stay tuned more rumors and details
should emerge coming soon and for those
of either we're waiting for some Wow on
the iphone 6 you are getting a bigger
phone that's part of the rumors but
interesting first of all we get some
leaks of the front panel display that's
ready to assemble to a final back so
yeah it's going to look pretty much like
the current iphone 5s if you were
waiting for no bezels or very small
vessels because the phone was big that's
not going to be the case and for those
of you that wanted a notification LED at
a spot where it's not going to be useful
to you meaning the apple logo there are
some league logos right now and it seems
that it was not designed to glow either
so no hot links from the iphone except
for the fact that it's going to be big
no one device that is not going to be
big but that could prove to make some
headlines as the Samsung Galaxy alpha
we've seen leaks of the stove the
longest time we've seen all the metallic
chassis and then the plastic back and
the fact that it looks a lot like a
galaxy s5 only smaller and that we do
know that it doesn't have expandable
storage it seems we have some rumors
apparently this phone will be launching
on Wednesday as early as Wednesday we're
not sure that's going to be a launched
globally or the United States or Europe
or what's going to be the case but we do
know that it will look a lot like what
we've already seen in the leaks which
means it will look a lot like an iPhone
yeah and apparently there will be a 64
gig variant which is interesting judging
by the fact that there is no expandable
storage on this device it seems and
finally for the hottest news of the day
we get some first leaked photos of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and oh yeah it
looks hot first of all it's got the
metallic edges they got the chamfers it
looks a lot like what we've seen on the
Galaxy alpha only bigger and yeah we
have the faux leather backing as well
only in a very interesting and cool
pattern this is actually hot I mean the
phone looks more fine that looks a look
at galaxy note 3 only with the sharper
curves and stuff like that and we even
hear this trademark from Samsung where
the company wants a wraparound display
in the galaxy note 4 to be together and
we don't know how that's going to work
because judging by the photos that
doesn't look like a wraparound display
especially that things made out of metal
but that leads you to the question of
the day look at the photos and tell us
what do you think about the galaxy note
4 do you like what you see because in my
case honestly I've been a galaxy no user
since the Galaxy Note 2 I love the
Galaxy Note 3 and yeah I definitely want
the galaxy note 4 leave us a comment
