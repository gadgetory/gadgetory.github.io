calm i'm going to show you a few kind of
hidden features of the LG optimus 2x so
here we go first off you remember the
default keyboard turned out to be this t
nine key pad pad thing and if we go back
into the settings you can see we have
only the LG keyboard for input method
and you have some settings for this and
you can choose between qwerty or funky
keypad but there's some secret settings
if I hold down this button secret
settings appear and keyboard layout
turns out to have more options so this
is not in the normal settings and I can
go to kruti right there now this buttons
over here I can hold that down and look
at this I have handwriting recognition
so let's try this one this pose a little
box at the bottom and I can type by
drawing letters and it's kind of slow
but and there's no gestures for deleting
anything like that you got to use these
little buttons let's look at another one
the double box is a little faster
because i can type one letter over here
and one over there and it's recognizing
both not very well and the other one is
on the screen so this way i can type all
across a little screen so there's a big
age okay this is very similar to the
input methods on Windows Mobile from 13
years ago except it's a lot slower and
more difficult to use but we have some
handwriting recognition here so that's
pretty interesting another thing that we
missed is kind of a hidden feature if
we're typing you have some gestures that
we can do so my curse is right there if
i get i can hit it and it'll move
and you can hit it up and you can it
down you can hit it this way so really
kind of a silly gesture I don't know if
you see anybody on the street doing this
make sure hold on to it also will fall
out and anyway we also have those kind
of gestures i'm home screen i can tilt
it and it's moving around it's very very
awkward to use now we can also use the
tapping gesture in the gallery so today
we're looking at some pictures and you
can't and it goes the next one
okay so there's some silly little
features in the optimus 2x that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
