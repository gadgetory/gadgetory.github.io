Nexus is not one phone but two and so
for the first time ever those in search
of a new pure Android smartphone have a
choice to make
I'm Michael Fisher and I'm here to help
you make it this is PocketNow
and this is Nexus 6p versus Nexus 5x
carrier agnosticism is woven into the
DNA of the Nexus line what does that
mean Nexus phones are sold unlocked
directly from Google and so while
they're priced quite competitively
they're still generally more expensive
upfront than what you can get from a
wireless carrier while you can finance
either of these through Google's project
Phi we're going to assume that most
folks will just be buying these outright
and that means people stand to save at
least 120 dollars by going for the 5x
instead of the 6p so how much do you
really lose opting for the cheaper of
the two the most striking difference
once these phones power on is in the
display this isn't really about
resolution even though the Nexus 6p
offers a pixel density 22% higher than
the 5x on a screen half an inch larger
more important here is the difference in
technology the stark contrast and heavy
saturation of the AMOLED panel on the 6p
make the 5x look washed out and dead by
comparison the 5x nonetheless has two
advantages it's warmer whites are
preferable to the sickly Bluegreen
whites on the 6p I know our camera is
causing the opposite to appear to be
true here but that's an illusion trust
me and the 5x panel is also more
readable in direct sunlight but the six
peas colors and contrast are so rich
that everything just looks more alive on
the larger phone if you're a display
junkie your decision will be a pretty
easy one flipper out of the backside and
the gulf widens the 5x is LG's sequel to
the Nexus 5 of 2013 and as such it
features a similar light weight build
made from injection molded polycarbonate
that means it's soft to the touch and
very lightweight almost too light on the
other
phone wha we had no Nexus legacy to call
on when designing the 6p and as such it
drew on the all metal roots of phones in
its ascend mate line the 6p is heavy
it's 30% more massive than the 5x thanks
to its machined aluminum chassis whose
chamfered edges are slightly harsher on
the palm the Huawei phone is also
significantly larger so it's the less
convenient choice for those who often
need to use their phone one-handed it is
thinner than the 5x though and that
combines with its higher-end industrial
design to make it feel every inch the
more expensive handheld the so called
visor stretching the width of the 6p
might make you think that Huawei's got
the superior camera too but in this case
appearances deceive these phones pack
the same exact shooter from Sony twelve
point three megapixel sensor with an F
2.0 aperture laser assisted autofocus
and 4k video recording on screen the
difference between their outputs is
striking but this is another deception
brought about by that display disparity
take them off the phones and
side-by-side these photos are nearly
identical there's the occasional
difference in exposure or white balance
in these specific samples but they're so
minor that they can be explained by
minut differences in focal point or in
small variations in lighting in the few
seconds between captures if you're
really looking for a consistent
difference between the two it's tough
but maybe try to spot the green tint in
a few of the six piece photos a tint
that becomes quite pronounced when using
the flash the Huawei phone makes up for
this apparent quirk though with a higher
resolution selfie camera that does a
much better job in both daylight and
low-light and added features in the
camera app on the whole specifically
that includes burst mode a higher frame
rate in slow motion video and electronic
image stabilization of those it's
probably the latter that makes the most
significant difference between the
cameras in Full HD recording mode the 6p
does generally produce a steadier shot
while walking
Google says the 5x lacks those added
camera features because it's hexa core
Snapdragon 808 processor doesn't pack
the oomph of the octa-core Snapdragon
810 and the 6p and that's true across
the spec sheet actually the Nexus 6p
offers three gigs of RAM to the smaller
phones two gigs and it's faster memory
as well the Huawei phone also comes in
larger available storage options and it
brings a battery that's twenty-seven
percent larger can you tell the
difference between these phones based on
the specs in some cases not really in
others it's too early to tell each phone
runs Android marshmallow and the feature
load is almost identical across devices
so in a straight-up side-by-side
comparison there's little difference in
metrics like app launch times and in
gaming I can't really tell the
difference unless I'm playing a very
high demand title with its quality
settings maxed out and even then it's
negligible in games like asphalt 8 sky
gamblers air supremacy I mean I suppose
the 5x does stumble somewhat more than
the 6p in everyday animations and the 6p
seems to have smoother inertial
scrolling in some apps like Chrome it's
not much but it is a little bit of extra
polish that reminds you that you're
using a higher-end device that polish
extends to the acoustic experience as
well with its dual front firing speakers
the Nexus 6p is the hands-down winner
and out loud playback besting the single
speaker on the 5x
here's what we couldn't test yet battery
life for one thing we just haven't had
the phones long enough and for another
these are on two separate networks we're
using the 5x on t-mobile us and the 6p
on project five so a direct comparison
just as impossible at this point and the
same goes for voice quality but rest
assured we will cover these aspects in
our separate full reviews of these
smartphones lastly there are the
minutiae the little idiosyncrasies that
make each device special both of these
have their power standby keys located
above the volume rocker but the 6p makes
that awkward arrangement a little easier
with a textured finish on the power
button to tell them apart the 6p also
pulls ahead where glass is concerned it
uses fourth generation Gorilla Glass on
both the display cover and the camera
visor compared to Gorilla Glass 3 on the
5x the Nexus 5x does get a jab in that's
small but important to some folks its
notification light is bigger brighter
and cooler if you ask me the takeaway
here is a duo of cliches google has come
very close to delivering the best of
both worlds but you still get what you
pay for the Nexus 5x is very much like
its 2013 4 runner in that it delivers a
lot of capability and a fair amount of
style for a very competitive price point
but it's no show horse it's the phone
you toss around without worrying too
much about scratching it up the one you
buy because it's a good deal
not because it's delivering a high-end
experience if a premium feel is what
you're looking for the 6p is obviously
the way to go it's got a much nicer
screen a more powerful processor better
fit and finish and block rocking audio
you just need to shell out a bit more
together if you're thinking that's an
obvious conclusion spend more to get
more you're right not all these
comparisons can be profound but it is
exciting that for the first time in
Nexus history buyers have a choice
between affordability and super high
quality in the same generation and the
differences here are straightforward
enough that choosing shouldn't be hard
at all as long as you're honest with
yourself
what you want and how much you can spend
we're going to fill in some of the holes
from this comparison very soon folks in
pocket now full review of the Nexus 6p
and 5x stay tuned for that and keep
yourself sated in the mean time by
living vicariously through us as we
unpack these devices in our Nexus double
unboxing live now on our channel page
till next time this has been michael
fisher captain two phones on twitter
thanks for watching we'll see you real
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
