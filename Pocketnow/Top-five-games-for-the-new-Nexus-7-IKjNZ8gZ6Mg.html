and you're looking for fun and exciting
stuff to install on it look no further
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
these are the top 5 games to install on
your Nexus 7 mobile gaming isn't what it
used to be and honestly that's a good
thing
while platformers are still fun from
time to time we're no longer limited to
moving characters in two dimensions with
only one or two actions mobile games
have broken into the third dimension and
as a result gaming from smartphones
tablets and alike is better than ever
and one of the best devices to do your
gaming on is with one of the most well
rounded and affordable tablets on the
market the new Nexus 7 unfortunately not
every game is compatible with the 2013
Nexus 7 and that means you may have to
do some digging to find some awesome
games to play well we've done some of
that digging and testing for you and
we've composed a list of five of the
best games you can play on your new
Nexus 7 one of the most impressive
mobile game franchises to date is modern
combat basically it's exactly what a
mobile optimised version of Call of Duty
would feel and look like though I'm sure
Gameloft would deny any sort of relation
to or inspiration from Infinity Ward's
creation it's your standard first-person
military shooter with an in-depth
campaign fairly smooth polished graphics
tolerable controls and even an online
multiplayer mode at $6.99 it's one of
the more expensive games you can get for
your Nexus 7 but if you're into
first-person shooters it doesn't get
better this on mobile the only thing
that would make it better is the ability
to play the game with a controller which
is possible a game that doesn't
necessarily need a controller to be fun
and entertaining however is Riptide the
first version of the game was incredible
especially for it being a mobile game
but the second version gp2 is even
better in essence you race
rocket-powered Hydra jets around
watercourses against other racers
there's both a career mode and online
gameplay and the graphics are fantastic
the various tracks are beautiful and
throughout gameplay virtual water
splashes are thrown onto the display as
to remind you how impressive the game
truly is best of all this game is only
$2.99 and well worth it if you're into
Hydra racing
zombie games are all the rage and have
been for the last couple of years
evidence of just that is that two of our
top five games are first-person zombie
games the first of which is into the
dead
unlike most zombie hack-and-slash games
and into the dead you're not holding up
and killing every zombie that comes your
way instead you're running for your life
ducking in and out and dodging zombies
you can pick up weapons from scattered
crates and shoot some as you dodge
others the controls are super simple
it's fun to play and it has tons of
replay value it's free to play with tons
of in-game purchases dead trigger is
also free to play and it's more along
the lines of your standard zombie
survival game you're in the midst of a
zombie apocalypse and you have to
navigate your way around a city overrun
by the undead basically shoot everything
in sight and stay alive there are oodles
of guns and other unlockables we're not
necessarily a fan of the freemium
gameplay but this one in particular is
awesome and if you're looking for a
third person shooter with similar
mechanics be sure to check out mad
fingers other popular title shadow gun
finally real racing 3 I'm not gonna live
Need for Speed Most Wanted would have
been included in this list of a real
racing had it been compatible with the
Nexus 7 unfortunately it's not an
asphalt 8 would probably make the list
if it were available but it's not out
yet so Real Racing 3 is the next best
thing the graphics are amazing for a
mobile game and the gameplay is buttery
smooth the mechanics are great
the downside to maintain and upgrade
your car you'll have to simply wait it
out or spend your hard earned cash to
speed up the in-game time no less it's
still a great game for your new Nexus 7
