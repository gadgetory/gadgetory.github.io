lines are here to stay
chair tones reveal that Samsung is
making a little less money than Apple on
phones and deals on that Google Nexus 6p
g escape the phone a new life I'm Jaime
Rivera and believe it or not we haven't
only lost an hour here in the East Coast
but the Sun just decided date Monday's
as well this is parking a daily Believe
It or Not Monday is full of deals and we
start with some of the hottest phones
the Google Nexus 6p is right now on sale
on both Google Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H for 425
bucks on the 32 gig variant which is a
major major discount but then again if
you're interested in spending a little
less money the Nexus 5x is also
available for just 340 bucks and some of
these retailers are even giving out a
case if you buy the phone which is just
making it even better and while you're
at it hey if you're stopping by Best Buy
or Amazon or even Motorola comm you have
the advantage of the Moto X pure edition
is currently also on sale $100 off yeah
I know just 300 dollars for this phone
is a crazy deal but there's a catch it
only lasts for three days so hit the
link of the description to learn more of
the limitations and since we are talking
about money it's very interesting to
learn which company is making more money
per phone right now yes Apple is the
king of that but then when it comes to
the Android space oddly it is not
Samsung believe it or not it is Shoni at
$26 per phone when compared to Samsung
at 23 but obviously if you do the math
over which company sells the most phones
it is clear that Samsung is taking a lot
more money into its bottom line but yeah
26 to 23 that's a very interesting
figure and since we're talking about
numbers we also saw some tear downs of
the galaxy s7 today and believe it or
not it cost Samsung two hundred and
thirty seven dollars to build each
galaxy s7 compared to Apple which is
only spending two hundred and twelve now
yes this is only manufacturing cost that
doesn't include marketing distribution
overhead everything but it is just crazy
to know that five hundred dollars being
either spent in something else or we're
just being ripped off
and finally the very hot news that they
have to do with the iPhone 7 we get some
leaked renters and learned two very
interesting things about the possible
device to come first of all the antenna
lines are here to stay Apple is just
apparently rerouting them through the
corners of the phone but they're still
there and we also noticed that the
cutout for the camera is getting larger
which could mean that we are getting a
larger camera sensor or it could just
mean that this is a design choice
anyways regardless of the case we would
love to know in the comments down below
what do you think about this design for
the iPhone 7 do you consider it to be
worthy of all the money you're paying
for it in my case after the LG g5 where
the antenna lines are gone I don't but
we'd love to know your opinion in the
comments down below you know the way it
goes if you want to get these news
