pocket now calm we just got a hold of
Windows Phone 7 build 6176 for the
windows phone 7 emulator there's a lot
of new stuff to talk about so let's get
to it okay so if you remember the last
emulator image there was no phone but
finally there is a phone so let's take a
look at what it looks like you're gonna
notice the emulator is a little choppy
at times and I found that sometimes it's
choppy and sometimes it's fast it's just
I guess the time of day so here we are
on the phone we can bring up the dial
pad and make a simple call you can hear
the dial tone I'm at a press call and we
are connected now what's kind of
interesting about how Microsoft did the
phone is that the dialer is actually an
overlay and let me show you an example
if I go back to the start screen we get
this iphone like notification at the top
if i go into another application like
calendar the notification stays and if
we click on it it gives us a little drop
down with a little bit of transparency
in the background which is kind of cool
so you can still see what you're doing
and not totally interrupt the task that
you've got at hand we can open up the
dialer through this button or we can
bring up the in phone options by tapping
here we can go on speaker phone
bluetooth hold at a call and that sort
of thing so just a neat way I think that
Microsoft implemented the phone with in
Windows Phone 7 series so lets back
let's bounce back into the phone i'm
going to go into my phone book i've only
got one contact that i've added here
it's dudette i'm going to tap on dudette
and her phone numbers should come up
okay there they are you can call dudette
right from the screen or you should be
able to use quick dial actually so i'm
going to go back to the previous screen
and whoops click on phone again and go
into the dialer let's see if i can do
quick dial you it's not implemented yet
but I'm sure that it will be on come
prime done so let's go back to the start
screen now a few things to notice on the
start screen new is a interesting
animation when you click and drag around
tiles so watch
move around messaging and before you got
this kind of very orderly like movement
of the other blocks the non-active
blocks but looks look what happens they
sort of bend and twist as you move
messaging around so kind of an
interesting little animation and the
broken heart icon which implies that
you're going to take it off your Start
screen has changed to just a thumbtack
with a little line through it so I'm
going to close that and here we are back
on the Start screen now something else
that's new for the Start screen is
through this emulator version you can
add contacts so let's see if I can
remember how to do that so I'm going to
do debt oh there it is I tapped and hold
held on it i'm going to click pin to
start and dudettes should show up
somewhere here it is down here and
what's kind of cool about dudette is
that you get a little little animation a
little peek animation so you can see
this is their caller ID picture and it
kind of bounces up and down kind of a
cool little little feature there okay so
another thing i want to show you is that
if we swipe to the left and go into our
program list now if you tap and hold on
any of these you get a little a couple
of options three of them right now are
not active for this particular one
because it's a stock program but if we
go to another app say OneNote maybe
it'll work here maybe not you can rate
and review uninstall or pin to start so
I'm going to pin one note to the Start
screen and there it is down here and it
adds to the list of things that you want
to see on a regular basis okay so
there's a few other things i want to
show you first of all we can go into
email setup this has been cleaned up a
little bit so we can add facebook and
outlook and windows live I've tried
adding a variety of accounts it still
wont synchronized which is a shame
because we really can't get a full sense
for the email experience and in the
contacts experience and the calendar
experience until we can synchronize it
with these services so hopefully in a
future version that will be working okay
let me show you zoom because there's a
new thing there obviously we can't
synchronize with a zoom service because
it's not really a connected emulator
although internet does work oddly we can
go into radio this is kind of funny one
of the stations actually works
um see if we can get fairness so kind of
kind of funny no other stations it up oh
there's some other stations k WS Oh
perhaps that's some internet streaming
service so let's go back to the previous
screen let's bounce into the new office
application when we saw office in the
last version of the emulator it was
horrible it just didn't make sense but
it's we're starting to see how office is
going to be an awesome experience in
Windows Phone 7 so let's bring it up
here we're taken into the office hub
which is sort of a place for all things
office we can mess around with OneNote
OneNote really hasn't changed you can
make a note you can add a voice
recording to it kind of basic stuff and
if we click on all it takes you to take
you to a screen that wants you to
personalize your copy of office so i'm
gonna type my name here just for good
measure click OK and take you into your
notebooks go to the previous screen will
swipe to the right through the Metro
interface and we can go to the
SharePoint screen where we can see are
the documents on our company's server
you work for a company that has
sharePort sharepoint or we can go into a
new document for Word Excel or
PowerPoint so I'm going to jump into
word and show you really the new
features here so here is some
information about about the new version
of word changing changing the text color
and the size and the quick styles and
just a really cool tutorial that walks
you through how you can actually use the
program to make real documents on your
device which is something that we really
haven't seen in previous versions of
office for windows mobile so I'm going
to hit on the pen here so I'm going to
go down here to the application bar i'm
going to open up a new document and as
you could have seen just a minute ago
there was there waiting cursor awaiting
cursor right at the top three little
dots that go across i'll show you that
again in a minute so i'm going to type
on my keyboard i haven't figured out
copy and paste on here yet i don't think
it's implemented but we can double tap a
word to highlight bring up the little a
button down here and change the font
color okay so that's new that's pretty
basic stuff but very very necessary we
can also change it to underline what's
kind of annoying is that every time you
click on a new style
it's out of that screen hopefully that
screen will stay on until you have it
closed okay so another thing we can do
which is very very cool is annotations
right within the document so this is
going to be very handy one of your
co-workers or your friends or colleagues
send you a document with markup on it
and you look through it and you say okay
I don't like this word so you go down
here to an annotation and say this word
is bad ok now you can click off of it
and it will save the annotation so that
next time I click on it it says Brandon
that's me said this word is bad very
handy keeps track of annotations in a
way that we really haven't seen before
in a mobile office application clicking
on this button that I just clicked on
their shows you the currently open
document so it's kind of like your
document tray we can go back in here we
can send off this document through email
right from the office application so you
don't have to go into email and add the
attachment it's all done right here or
you can save it so I'm going to save it
as hello this is a test I'm going to go
back to the office hub and here we are
hello this is a test is saved let's jump
back in one more time to the word
application and see if there's anything
that I miss so you can search for
certain things we can also open
documents as I mentioned and save as
just as you would in regular office so
pretty robust it's really looking like
office on windows phone 7 series is
going to be awesome it's jump into Excel
real quick some changes have been made
here here's a really cool-looking sample
workbook and panning is a little choppy
right now because it's an emulator but
we can tap on a chart we should be able
to zoom in if you double tap should be
able to edit it haven't really
experimented much with this see you the
options that we get so we can format
cell save send save as so stuff you
would get on the desktop we can also
look at annotations or add our own
annotations just like you could inward
just trying to see if there's a way to
edit this shark this is a sample
workbook I'm going to make a new one
real quick looks like you can't make a
new one oh here's some interesting
looking
sheets this is the application tried
this is the currently stored documents
on this emulator so likelihood to pay
okay so here is another sample
spreadsheet and it has a little wonder
what this means it has a little speech
bubble here I think this means that
there are annotations there we go right
here some blue annotations that shows
what anna has said about this particular
document really cool stuff finally let's
go into PowerPoint see what that looks
like so there's a sample PowerPoint
presentation you can swipe you should be
able to add a new page so let's see what
happens like this this is obviously not
a final button down here so i just added
the word test i think i added an
adaptation but i can't really be sure so
here are the two saved documents i can
very quickly cycle between them it's
going to be really handy premiere it
looks like we can email add annotations
and it's not really clear how this works
this program is probably the least
complete of all the office program so it
has some work to go let's go back to the
start screen see if there's anything
else that we wanted to talk about here
let me show you something in xbox live
to show you that waiting cursor I
mentioned so look at the top of the
screen this is what it's going to look
like when the system is thinking it's a
kind of good way to get it out of the
way and you can actually use the
application while it's thinking whereas
in Windows Mobile when you got the
waiting cursor you really couldn't do
much on the screen it really throws the
current state so we're going to continue
to look through this new version of the
emulator there's a lot of things in this
one so we saw the phone we saw the new
sort of physics engine behind the home
screen we saw that the way that you can
quickly add shortcuts from your home
screen or rate interview or uninstall
program then we walk you through office
there's probably a little bit more if we
find more we'll be sure to report on it
for you please give the video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw and that is
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
