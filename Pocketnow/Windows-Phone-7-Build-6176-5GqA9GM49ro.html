pocketnow.com we just got a hold of
Windows Phone 7 build 61 - 76 for the
Windows Phone 7 emulator there's a lot
of new stuff to talk about so let's get
to it
okay so if you remember the last
emulator image there was no phone but
finally there is a phone so let's take a
look at what it looks like you're gonna
notice the emulator is a little choppy
at times and I've found that sometimes
it's choppy and sometimes it's fast it's
just I guess the time of day so here we
are on the phone we can bring up the
dial pad and make a simple call you can
hear the dial tone I'm gonna press call
and we are connected now what's kind of
interesting about how Microsoft did the
phone is that the dialer is actually an
overlay and let me show you an example
if I go back to the Start screen we get
this iPhone like notification at the top
if I go into another application like
calendar the notification stays and if
we click on it it gives us a little
drop-down with a little bit of
transparency in the background which is
kind of cool so you can still see what
you're doing and not totally interrupt
the task that you've got at hand we can
open up the dialer through this button
or we can bring up the in phone options
by tapping here we can go on
speakerphone Bluetooth hold add a call
and that sort of thing so just a neat
way I think that Microsoft implemented
the phone within Windows Phone 7 Series
so let's back it let's bounce back into
the phone I'm going to go into my phone
book I've only got one contact that I've
added here it's dudette I'm going to tap
on dudette and her phone numbers should
come up okay there they are
you can call dudette right from this
screen or you should be able to use
quick dial actually so I'm going to go
back to the previous screen and whoops
click on the phone again and go into the
dialer let's see if I can do quick dial
it's not implemented yet but I'm sure
that it will be come Prime done so let's
go back to the Start screen now a few
things to notice on the Start screen new
is a interesting animation when you
click and drag around tiles so watch
move around messaging and before you've
got this kind of very orderly like
movement of the other blocks the non
active blocks but looks look what
happens they sort of bend and twist as
you move messaging around so kind of an
interesting little animation and the
broken heart icon which implies that
you're going to take it off your Start
screen has changed to just a thumbtack
with a little line through it so I'm
going to close that and here we are back
on the Start screen now something else
that's new for the Start screen is
through this emulator version you can
add contacts so let's see if I can
remember how to do that so I'm gonna go
into dudette oh there it is I tapped and
hold held on it I'm gonna click pin to
start and dudettes should show up
somewhere here it is down here and
what's kind of cool about dudette is
that you get a little little animation a
little peak animation so you can see
this is their caller ID picture and it
kind of bounces up and down kind of a
cool little little feature there okay so
another thing I want to show you is that
if we swipe to the left and go into our
program list now if you tap and hold on
any of these you get a little a couple
of options three of them right now are
not active for this particular one
because it's a stock program but if we
go to another app say OneNote maybe
it'll work here maybe not um you can
rate and review uninstall or pin to
start so I'm gonna pin OneNote to the
Start screen and there it is down here
it adds to the list of things that you
want to see on a regular basis okay so
there's a few other things I want to
show you first of all we can go into
email setup this has been cleaned up a
little bit so we can add facebook and
Outlook and Windows Live I tried adding
a variety of accounts it still won't
synchronized which is a shame because we
really can't get a full sense for the
email experience and in the contacts
experience and the calendar experience
until we can synchronize it with these
services so hopefully in a future
version that will be working okay let me
show you zoom because there's a new
thing there obviously we can't
synchronize with a zoom service because
it's not really a connected emulator
although Internet does work oddly we can
go into radio this is kind of funny one
of the stations actually works see if we
can
paratis so kind of kind of funny no
other stations in it oh there's some
other stations kws oh perhaps that's
some internet streaming service so let's
go back to the previous screen let's
bounce into the new office application
when we saw office in the last version
of the emulator it was horrible it just
didn't make sense but it's we're
starting to see how office is going to
be an awesome experience in Windows
Phone 7 so let's bring it up here we're
taken into the office hub which is sort
of a place for all things office we can
mess around with OneNote OneNote really
hasn't changed you can make a note you
can add a voice recording to it kind of
basic stuff and if we click on all it
takes you to take you to a screen that
wants you to personalize your copy of
office so I'm gonna type my name here
just for good measure
click OK and take you into your
notebooks go to the previous screen will
swipe to the right through the Metro
interface and we can go to the
SharePoint screen where we can see our
the documents on our company's server
you work for a company that has
sharePort SharePoint or we can go into a
new document for Word Excel or
PowerPoint so I'm gonna jump into Word
and show you really the new features
here so here is some information about
about the new version of word changing
changing the text color and the size and
the quick styles and just a really cool
tutorial that walks you through how you
can actually use the program to make
real documents on your device which is
something that we really haven't seen in
previous versions of Office for Windows
Mobile so I'm gonna hit on the pen here
so I'm gonna go down here to the
application bar I'm gonna open up a new
document and as you could have seen just
a minute ago there was there awaiting
cursor a waiting cursor right at the top
three little dots that go across I'll
show you that again in a minute so I'm
gonna type on my keyboard I haven't
figured out copy and paste on here yet I
don't think it's implemented but we can
double tap a word to highlight bring up
the little a button down here and change
the font color okay so that's new that's
pretty basic stuff but very very
necessary we can also change it to
underline what's kind of annoying is
that every time you click on a new style
it exits out of that screen hopefully
that screen will stay on
till you have it closed okay so another
thing we can do which is very very cool
his annotations right within the
document so this is gonna be very handy
one of your co-workers or your friends
or colleagues send you a document with
markup on it and you look through it and
you say okay I don't like this word so
you go down here to an annotation and
say this word is bad okay and then you
can click off of it and it will save the
annotation so that next time I click on
it it says Brandon that's me said this
word is bad very handy it keeps track of
annotations in a way that we really
haven't seen before in a mobile office
application clicking on this button that
I just clicked on there shows you the
currently open document so it's kind of
like your document tray we can go back
in here we can send off this document
through email right from the office
application so you don't have to go into
email and add the attachment it's all
done right here or you can save it so
I'm gonna save it as hello this is a
test I'm going to go back to the office
hub and here we are hello this is a test
is saved let's jump back in one more
time to the word application and see if
there's anything that I missed so you
can search for certain things we can
also open documents as I mentioned and
save as just as you would in regular
office so pretty robust it's really
looking like office on Windows Phone 7
series is going to be awesome let's jump
into Excel real quick some changes have
been made here here's a really cool
looking sample workbook and panning is a
little choppy right now because it's an
emulator but we can tap on a chart and
we should be able to zoom in if you
double tap should be able to edit it
haven't really experimented much with
this see the options that we get so we
can format so save send save as so stuff
you would get on the desktop we can also
look at annotations or add our own
annotations just like you could in word
just trying to see if there's a way to
edit this sharked this is a sample
workbook I'm gonna make a new one real
quick looks like you can't make a new
one oh here's some interesting looking
sheets this is the application trade
this is the
the currently stored documents on this
emulator so likelihood to pay okay
so here is another sample spreadsheet
and it has a little wonder what this
means it has a little speech bubble here
I think this means that there are
annotations there we go right here some
blue annotations that shows what Ana has
said about this particular document
really cool stuff finally let's go into
PowerPoint see what that looks like so
there's a sample PowerPoint presentation
you can swipe you should be able to add
a new page so let's see what happens
like this this is obviously not a final
button down here so I just added the
word test I think I added an adaptation
but I can't really be sure so here are
the two saved documents I can very
quickly cycle between them it's gonna be
really handy from here it looks like we
can email add annotations and it's not
really clear how this works this program
is probably the least complete of all
the office program so it has some work
to go let's go back to the Start screen
see if there's anything else that we
wanted to talk about here let me show
you something in Xbox Live to show you
that waiting cursor I mentioned so look
at the top of the screen this is what
it's going to look like when the system
is thinking it's a kind of good way to
get it out of the way and you can
actually use the application while it's
thinking whereas in Windows Mobile when
you got the waiting cursor you really
couldn't do much on the screen it really
throws the current state so we're going
to continue to look through this new
version of the emulator there's a lot of
things in this one so we saw the phone
we saw the new sort of physics engine
behind the home screen we saw that the
way that you can quickly add shortcuts
from your home screen
or rate and review or uninstall program
then we walk you through office there's
probably a little bit more if we find
more we'll be sure to report on it for
you please give the video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw and that is it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
