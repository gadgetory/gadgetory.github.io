the pioneer of cell phones and the
company that created the Droid campaign
which pretty much put Android phones on
the map yeah that company has written
quite silence as the Lenovo takeover
really if it wasn't for the leaks of the
possible moto razor foldable that have
spurred a lot of speculation their
spotlight has been quite muted the
company invited us yesterday to an event
and I know that most of us were there to
see that new foldable and instead we got
this this is the Moto z4 not quite the
flagship you were expecting but actually
part of a new strategy that has brought
us a new Motorola I'm how you met every
minute with PocketNow and let me tell
you more about that the most interesting
part about yesterday's presentation was
really how the company has reached
profitability how these last few
quarters have seen Motorola finally see
some green in the bottom line after
spending years in red they even call
themselves the fastest-growing OEM which
we debate but it comes at a time when
the market has contracted still if you
noticed the last time that we got a Moto
Z with flagship specifications was like
two years ago their new success strategy
has focused primarily on mid Rangers and
the Moto z4 is pretty much that the
bundle we received 2-1 boxes the unlock
variant with a 360-degree camera trust
me there are better moto mods but fine
it's a tall red box protected in plastic
and under it we have a foam front and
centre of which we will place to the
side below that we have an interesting
red box with a 15 watt charger a USB a
two USBC cable and moto gave us a pair
of their headphones since there is no
dongle in the box though they do seem to
be kind of forgettable Andre we have the
Moto mod which again we wouldn't put
money on but then again the Moto Z force
here and that's what this video is all
about visually if you've seen any moto Z
in the past you're pretty much seeing
this one but there's actually a purpose
for that see Motorola has decided to
extend its moto MOT strategy
a year so this phone is modular as its
predecessors the approach is kind of
weird though as we do have an
interesting lip in the design making
some of the moto mods feel like if they
weren't really designed to fit the
phone's body still they do work which
means your old moto mods are fully
compatible and even if we didn't really
see new ones there's still a good list
to choose from choices are mainly
focused on color options for this phone
with flash gray and frost white being
the two options now in matte glass
important changes to the design are
really the return to the headphone jack
like finally Motorola realized that we
customers actually prefer this this is
great
this year the display is also a more
modern six point four inch full HD plus
OLED at nineteen by nine aspect ratio I
say modern because there's now a notch
replacing the bezels and also because
there's an optical fingerprint scanner
on the display there are no dual firing
speaker sadly instead you have a module
that's actually firing to the top
instead of the bottom that's definitely
weird under the hood we have the new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 which yes is
mid-range but brings a more efficient 11
nanometer process there are four gigs of
ram 128 gigs of expandable storage a
3600 milliamp hour battery that's
compatible with 15 watch turbo charger
there's p2i splash proof nano coating
for water resistance and you can make
this a 5g phone with a compatible moto
mod now the company made a big deal in
the presentation about the AI
capabilities of its cameras and
everything that they built into here but
this is a single camera which is rather
odd in this day and age the primary
module is a 48 megapixels @f 1.7
aperture and 1.6 microns if you stick to
pixel binning which provides 12
megapixel shots and includes OAS and a
new night vision mode the company claims
in addition to portrait AI lighting it
can also record 4k video up to 30 frames
per second the selfie camera is of a
whopping 25 megapixels and also uses
pixel bidding to provide 6.25 megapixels
and 1.8 microns and video limitations
are 1080p at 30 we will need more time
to provide you our verdict on our full
review coming very soon now really the
biggest story is a
and the strategy because you get this
phone for pretty much $10 a month on
Verizon obviously I imagine you'll have
to sign a ton of papers and I'm not
exactly sure if there's a down payment
but $10 a month for this is definitely
enticing if you want it with the 5g moto
mod that starts at 439 with new
activations and I'd ignore the $4.99
unlocked 360 camera bundle if I were you
trust me I've had this moto mod for
years and I've never used it but yes
this is the Moto Z for not the razor
foldable that we were expecting I know
that there were many people disappointed
at the event but still wow factor aside
if we were to be fair
what we need is healthy companies that
keep growing and if mid rangers is
what's helping Motorola regain its
limelight and remain as a company that
competes I would rather give the Moto z4
a chance I mean for the price tag and
for what you're getting I think that
this is actually a really good phone but
obviously we would love to know what you
think in the comments down below let us
know if the Moto z4 is something you
would consider and while you're at it
subscribe to our Channel and hit that
bill icon as we publish videos every
single day also follow us on social
medias our extended coverage happens on
Instagram I'll also drop my personal
handles in case you want to see my
experience using cameras on these phones
in my day to day use please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw I'm high metal good I think so much
for watching we'll see you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
