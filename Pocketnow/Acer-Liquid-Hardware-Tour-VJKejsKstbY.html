pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour of the acer liquid s 100 this is
one of the more affordable unlocked
android options compared to the nexus
one it's about $100 cheaper and it will
allow you to get 3G in the US for using
AT&amp;amp;T the Nexus One will only give you
three G if you're running on t-mobile so
let's talk a little bit about specs
before talking about actually the
hardware on the device that's running on
android 1.6 not 2.1 like the Nexus 1
it's a quad-band GSM phone with tri-band
UMTS it also has HSDPA and HSUPA meaning
you can get even faster download and
upload speeds if the network supports it
it's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
though it's only clocking at 768
megahertz which is still quite fast and
will result in really fast device
performance the Nexus One clocks in at 1
gigahertz odd is 512 megabytes of rom
with 256 megabytes of RAM the display is
the same size as the iPhone it's 3.5
inches diagonal with WVGA resolution so
it's 800 down and 480 across the screen
is made out of glass it is capacitive
but you can't use multi-touch on the
acer liquid unfortunately it has a 5
megapixel camera on the back with
autofocus it is a GPS wife Wi-Fi bng
bluetooth 2.0 and it has microSD
expansion if you want to add more memory
so let's take a look at the hardware
we'll zoom in a little bit to the device
has a really interesting design with
this white border apparently the liquid
will come in red and in black I haven't
seen it in red only in black but what's
really nice is you get this outline of
whatever color you get the device in
around the whole device which is quite
quite nice so up here we have this
speaker grille and up here also there's
a proximity sensor but no light sensor
at least so you can't have the device
automatically regulate the screen
brightness down here we have some kind
of cryptic buttons that are quite
different than the standard Android
buttons so you could probably figure
this out this one's home although why
don't they just use a house then we have
search back and the menu button which
looks a little bit different than
the menu button that were used to on
other Android devices the front is
completely flush and it's very nice it
seems to have an anti grease coating on
it I've been using this for about a day
and really the screen is kept quite
clean as I mentioned the screen is glass
it is capacitive the device is actually
quite thick and when we unbox it we
thought that maybe it's not so thick but
it really does have a lot of a lot of
thickness to it it's about twelve point
seven five millimeters that's about two
millimeters thicker than the Nexus One
and the iPhone over here on the Left we
have a standby button so if we tap on
that it will unlock the device and we
can put it back to sleep on the bottom
we have a kind of this black strip that
does pick up fingerprints and we also
have a microphone over here and it uses
mini USB for syncing and charging not
micro USB like a lot of the newer
devices coming out over on the other
side we have a dual action camera button
for the five megapixel camera and then
we have a volume up and down rocker and
all these buttons are adorned and have a
nice silvery color that doesn't pick up
fingerprints on the top we have 3.5
millimeter for audio which is quite nice
on the back which is covered within this
glossy white coating we have the 5
megapixel camera with no flash
unfortunately the Nexus One does up a
flash then we have a speaker grille for
the speakerphone and for the the the
external speaker which does a really
nice job at projecting volume and we can
take off the back battery cover but
actually pulling outward like so and we
have the SIM card slot here micro sd and
the battery which is of size about
thirteen hundred and fifty mili amp
hours and we're going to talk about
battery life shortly so overall while we
liked the design on the acer liquid with
this white bezel and the very flush
touchscreen here the the hardware feels
a little bit cheap and we've tested a
lot of Acer devices over the years and
this has been a theme with all Acer
devices the build quality is just not
there compared to HTC or Motorola or any
of the other devices that they compete
against that said usually acer has a
lower price point than the other devices
which kind of makes it a good value if
you can compare it to what is out there
we've got a lot more coming up on the
acer liquid we're going to
talk about the software that's on the
device we'll talk about battery life and
performance that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
