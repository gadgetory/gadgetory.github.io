pocket now calm and this is the hardware
tour of the acer liquid s100 this is one
of the more affordable unlocked android
options compared to the nexus one it's
about a hundred dollars cheaper and it
will allow you to get 3g in the US for
using AT&amp;amp;T the nexus one will only give
you 3g if you're running on t-mobile so
let's talk a little bit about specs
before talking about actually the
hardware on the device that's running on
android 1.6 not 2.1 like the nexus one
it's a quad-band gsm phone with tri-band
UMTS it also has HSDPA and HSUPA meaning
you can get even faster download and
upload speeds if the network supports it
it's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
though it's only clocking at 768
megahertz which is still quite fast and
will result in really fast device
performance the Nexus One clocks in at
one gigahertz odd is 512 megabytes of
RAM with 256 megabytes of RAM the
display is the same size as the iphone
it's 3.5 inches diagonal with wvga
resolution so it's 800 down and 480
across the screen is mad made out of
glass it is capacitive but you can't use
multi touch on the acer liquid
unfortunately it has a 5 megapixel
camera on the back with autofocus it is
a gps y Wi-Fi bng bluetooth 2.0 and it
has microsd expansion if you want to add
more memory so let's take a look at the
hardware will zoom in a little bit to
the device has a really interesting
design with this white border apparently
the liquid will come in red and in black
I haven't seen it in red only in black
but what's really nice is you get this
outline of whatever color you get the
device in around the whole device which
is quite quite nice so up here we have
the speaker grill and up here also
there's a proximity sensor but no light
sensor oddly so you can't have the
device automatically regulate the screen
brightness down here we have some kind
of cryptic buttons that are quite
different than the standard Android
buttons so you could probably figure
this out this one's home although why
don't they just use a house then we have
searched back and the menu button which
looks a little bit different than
menu button that we're used to on other
Android devices the front is completely
flush and it's very nice it seems to
have an anti grease coating on it I've
been using this for about a day and
really the screen is kept quite clean as
I mentioned the screen is glass it is
capacitive the device is actually quite
thick and when we unbox it we thought
that maybe it's not so thick but it
really does have a lot of a lot of
thickness to it it's about twelve point
seven five millimeters that's about two
millimeters thicker than the nexus one
and the iphone over here on the Left we
have a standby button so if we tap on
that it will unlock the device and we
can put it back to sleep on the bottom
we have a kind of this black strip that
does pick up fingerprints and we also
have a microphone over here and it uses
mini USB for syncing and charging not
micro USB like a lot of the newer
devices coming out over on the other
side we have a dual action camera button
for the five megapixel camera and then
we have a volume up and down rocker and
all these buttons are adorned in kind of
a nice silvery color that doesn't pick
up fingerprints on the top leave 3.5
millimeter for audio which is quite nice
on the back which is covered within this
glossy white coating we have the 5
megapixel camera with no flash
unfortunately the nexus one does up a
flash then we have a speaker grill for
the speakerphone and for the the the
external speaker which does a really
nice job at projecting volume and we can
take off the back battery cover by
actually pulling outward like so and we
have the sim card slot here micro SD and
the battery which is of size about
thirteen hundred and fifty milliamp
hours and we're going to talk about
battery life shortly so overall while we
like the design on the acer liquid with
this white bezel on the very flush touch
screen here the hardware feels a little
bit cheap and we've tested a lot of acer
devices over the years and this has been
a theme with all acer devices the build
quality is just not there compared to
HTC or motorola or any of the other
devices that they compete against that
said usually acer has a lower price
point than the other devices which kind
of makes it a good value if you can
compare it to what is out there we've
got a lot more coming up on the acer
liquid where
to talk about the software that's on the
device will talk about battery life and
performance that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
