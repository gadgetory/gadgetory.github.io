from downloading corn i'm juan carlos
back now senior editor at pocketnow.com
blasting the signal from another rainy
night in southern california we went the
whole week without any inclement weather
from podcast podcasts and it's raining
again outside and I can hear sirens all
over the place Californians we are not
good when moisture descends from the sky
and joined as always this week with by
plucky podcast producer mr. Jules Wong
still out on location in a foreign land
I was going out there buddy boy it was a
dark and stormy night and I was writing
in my logs now it's how other pirates
and their ships can't get their crap
together really why you do this you
should be well and again I mean you know
the the obvious joke with some of the
subject matter we have up tonight you
know you're gonna tell a story about
pirates and that pirate booty argh no
pirate boot let talk about piracy not
really but like gonna save that for a
later segment in the show just you know
xxx hot hot sexy sexy girl girl boy time
with the Pens in the condoms Wow Wow
that's not at all really what we're
gonna be discussing okay you know Before
we jump in on the screen on your screen
you know conversations of that sort
because thankfully we have a sponsor
this week who I'm sure they absolutely
loved that lead into their business
let's let's get this out of the way
before we embarrass them any further
this week we really want to thank Jam

forward slash pocket now and we thank
them for supporting the pocket now
weekly yeah come on and slam and welcome
to the jam heck yeah buddy boy actually
you know what there is something kind of
cool to the notion of you know like if
you're running a small business
especially here in Southern California
I've been noticing a lot of companies
switching over to sort of tablet or
smartphone based point-of-sale systems
and so you know you're like you're a
food truck you're a small business
something like that and you probably
don't you probably have like the
per kid who's your IT department
something like that I think could
actually be kind of beneficial because I
know when I was working on government
contracts getting Department of Energy
facilities you know up to date on
security standards but using consumer
solutions was a really tough call so
having something like this having like
you know if you're running a business
and you want to check out what you might
need to deploy you know some phones or
some tablets out in the field
maybe check them out jam Jam comm slash
pocket now it could be it could be a
good fit for you and your small business
solutions yeah definitely would be great
to manage all those phones that the
carrier stores have right well you know
again I think they they're they're not
necessarily wrong in looking at iOS
devices
you know I think there have been a
number of solutions I see so many iPad
point-of-sale systems out here it's so
crazy to think that we went from cash
registers to just consumer grade tablets
and that's what we're trafficking
credit-card information personal
information shopping and loyalty
customer data and all that stuff's just
going through an iOS device and that
makes me a little squirrely but but if
you're doing that then look at jamp
because apparently not all the solutions
you need I mean you're way past the days
of just tossing a coin box and saying
well you just have to put in exact
change
no exceptions sorry sorry have you ever
worked like a like a fast-food gig or
like a like a retail gig or anything
like that no I've not not to man the
cash so because normally I was I was
some sort of like shift manager or
trainer so I used to work at a little
pizzeria in New Mexico every now and
then I'd have to I'd have to run a cash
register and it was crazy in the couple
years this is like from from the end of
high school to the like my second year
of college like it only took like three
or four years to go from dumb cash
registers that were just basically like
you know free calculators you could just
do basic arithmetic on them to like I'll
push the picture of the food and then it
tells me how much money to give you back
and oh my god the Dutchman's calculate
well not touch screens just like
literally big buttons that they would
put pictures of food on food and it like
how quickly that happened where you
would have to my wife also worked a cash
register at a restaurant in college and
like we would have to do all that math
in our heads we would have to calculate
sales tax in her heads and by the time
we were you know out of our second year
of college like all of that had been
replaced with these these point-of-sale
systems that we're basically like
picture book I'll push the button yeah I
mean yeah I mean it's better than actual
calculators and like a tax machine like
a tax receipt kind of printing device
that you use as actual receipt printing
paper now is it was it Jeff Bezos it's
saying he wants to make a grocery store
where they don't even have they don't
even have cash registers or checkout
yeah it was the Amazon thing Amazon go I
believe and they only have one thing
I've been Seattle and apparently they
just decided the in word of that concept
spreading you know 2000 markets or so
that got shut down so well you know it
was fun while it lasted but we're gonna
have to see how quickly they learn from
all this experimentation by the meantime
we're also experimenting with how we do
a podcast and we'd love for you to be
part of the conversation that's parents
and how might someone get involved with
us to like join the conversation or
contribute to the discussion of his mind
guys all you have to do is sign up for
Twitter that's it and then once you're
done with that it's I mean once that's
done you just track down the hashtag P
and weekly the P and weekly hashtag and
track what we're talking about as we're
talking about it live if you're catching
the live podcast we'll be able to
quickly answer your questions and
promote the discussion of what's going
on and if you just don't happen to be in
that sort of Jam then you want to go
into your email type in podcast at
pocketnow.com
send us your queries what not we'd love
to answer any of your longer form
questions and you know we appreciate any
of your feedback and and surprisingly
III don't know if you saw this one
coming but I put the word porn in the
blogpost of this podcast episode and
this has been maybe one of the most
aggressively shared podcast we refresh
this news 89 pageviews a record mm-hmm
and already we've got a couple people
using that PN weekly hash tag from
chamfered edges who I absolutely love
that Twitter handle shoppin all of a K
while getting my weekly slice of PN
weekly is well worth it cheers Cheers -
you don't think that's a that's a
healthy behavior since you should really
be watching that cart well yeah
especially if you know we don't have
those Amazon checkout services cuz you
never know what's gonna happen to that
that's stuff in there you need like oh
yeah there's a turnstile Amazon in any
way no they are definitely sponsoring
them and you know just a jump and
everyone else in the world coca-cola we
drink you I hear there's a new ginger
flavor out in Japan go get it
pampers what is one there's there's like
a funky Pepsi flavor that you can find a
Target right now it's like in a gold can
it's supposed to be sort of like a
ginger ale Pepsi I'm nervous to trials
I'm not the biggest Pepsi fan but I love
like ginger so I wonder if we actually
got a good version of that or if it's
just like you know it's sugar water with
like some isn't everything sugar water
with different source acid yeah but you
know we've had like a real proper
sarsaparilla like a really good old
timey root beer and they're really like
there's there's some really aggressive
flavor notes that go on in that you know
it's not just like like syrup you know
when you get like a really crappy deep
soda and it like coats your teeth and
your
feels all gross and fuzzy as opposed to
like a really light crisp sugarcane Cola
an old-timey Cola but then there are
other flavors other than just sugar and
it's like well-meaning and crisp I
really went no since I haven't tasted
that but you know what is definitely a
fun time that everyone can pretend they
can it's the holiday shopping guide I
know but I had to get us going since we
got a jump in and it is about this kind
of stuff and besides the target you know
there that you have where you can get
that Pepsi 1878 or whatever the heck
that label is you can also get a bunch
of iPads tablets smartphones
well maybe not necessarily the
smartphones that you might want but a
lot of other smartphones available in
other places and we've been able to
track down a whole bunch of things lists
numbers for you so depending on what
sort of tastes and needs that you like
and the price range is that you're
concerned about you can definitely take
a look you ever link in the rundown at
pocketnow.com and well you can just
search for a holiday shopping guide 2016
if you would like to uh check that out I
mean and actually you guys you know
putting this together the all of the
editors that were involved in this it's
just me no but I was gonna say is its I
thought it was you and Adrienne and then
I remembered while I was halfway through
that sentence that Adrienne is off this
week well he was off last week
congratulations to him I'm big shout out
to Adrienne and for getting his girl I
have an axe I didn't want it I didn't
know like if he was wanting us to break
that news but a parent we should just go
ahead and say fathered like close to
this time last year and and so we're all
very excited for him but you got to take
a little time off and
yeah everyone's just popping out babies
but you know what we're glad to have
another person in the pocket now family
right now so we should like put together
sort of an also like an extended pocket
now family post just like all the the
spouses and kids and stuff I think it
could be pretty sweet so maybe it was
slideshow thing let's let's take our
website design and just pull it through
every single little gimmick little box
that we can get in on that post that'd
be great i I think we can make that
happen maybe maybe for New Year's maybe
we can put something together to
kick-off 2017 and celebrate you know
what's new literally what's new
definitely so are there's resolutions
for K but definitely folks check out
that pocket now holiday shopping guide
if you're catching this just a couple
days before Christmas I what I love
about the guide is is how you wrote
literally Amazon Prime two-day shipping
won't save you if it's pointy it's over
you might actually have to like walk
your sorry butt into this store but if
your windows procrastinators I'm
terrible about you know waiting until
the last minute to get my shopping done
I did okay this year thankfully my wife
kind of kicked my ass a bit I mean this
list is pretty good you know it's
amazing how many places are offering
next day shipping now right yeah that's
kind of a very much a belts pulling kind
of get your butt in shape and do it
before it does you so so you know if
you're rocking some type of movement
tracking solution you can get all your
steps in you'll have to fight off crowds
of angry people who don't know how to
drive or navigate parking lots and then
once you're done with all of that
excitement I would say treat yourself to
a crisp light and refreshing old-timey
Cola and that would be a fun way to sort
of you know I would say just pop into
the chicken now and get the four piece
combo oh you can do better than that I
know what you going out there you you
doing some shopping for some other
people I think you need to add yourself
to the list and treat yourself
direct yourself no it's a bad 30 rock
I'm not 30 rock Parks and Rec refworks'
I'm trying to make their 30 30 bucks and
wreck but Twitter follower Abhishek is
totally on my side one of the best perks
of the holidays it's the best time to
get anything tech related so also if
you're doing a little shopping for
yourself I mean that would be a time to
do it or you could wait until next year
when but next iPhones will be coming out
of their cages much better now we can
properly know it's the it's the journey
it's not the destination um but we've
got some rumors and that some people
were messaging me on Twitter about this
- apparently there were some discussion
following one of the PocketNow dailies
hosted by hi mater Yvetta that there are
rumors are pointing to sort of maybe a
split release for the iPhone next year
we've got the 10th anniversary coming up
and while we've been looking at some of
the more exciting rumors surrounding a
high-end device we that might also be
backed up by more traditional iPhone
release strategy namely a 7s and a 7s
plus next to a potential iPhone 8
codenamed 4 yes so it makes this move
would make sense with what we've been
hearing about three iPhone models coming
in one being the big show boats of big
screen and curved screen OLED and absorb
home buttons and just this amazing glass
the prism of sorts and then a couple of
other models that are more conventional
that still have a glass body but just
have that familiar form factor from the
7 6 6 5 5 s 5c 4s for you became like a
Sesame Street song in Reverse but I
think this could be interesting I think
we've been talking about you know
flagship devices this more
from market in general and it's becoming
increasingly difficult I think for these
manufacturers to get out there and
really shake up what's become sort of an
accepted standard for how we put a phone
together and I think if we walk away
from 2016 if anything was positive about
2016 it was watching flagship grade
Hardware start sliding to the lowered
high-end tier to the mid-range tier
there were a handful of - and $300
phones this year that really kicked butt
in terms of Lawrence and bang the buck
ratio and so a company like Apple really
needs to do something to try and strike
up some kind of emotional response you
know part of buying a smartphone is that
emotional response of buying something
shiny and that's kind of that's one of
the things that factors into a high-end
or a premium purchase does it really do
the job better than a phone after price
really it doesn't it's not that much
better but there's something there's
something enticing about it or there's
something exclusive about it more than
just the price you know a lot of our
viewers were maybe a bit skeptical about
the porsche design mate 9 for example
but that's an exclusive premium product
with a label that means something to
certain consumers out there maybe not a
lot of the people who actually watches
podcast or listen to this podcast but
you know a certain set of consumers out
there will be very interested in
something like that so you can pull it
off then I think that's good ultimately
for the industry but I think it's gonna
be frustrating to a lot of tech fans
because I don't think those differences
are gonna come from really improving
technology beyond what we currently have
it'll be more appealing to an emotional
satisfaction and that seems to get
companies like Apple in trouble with us
more gear headed geeks I mean in terms
of a completely agnostic market point of
view we're seeing maturation it's this
is iPhone technically if this would be
10 and 11 at this point so you know
people are just figuring out ok what the
heck is going on and what do we need to
do to make sure that's
we have a supply chain that can only
supply so much of what we want for the
iPhone 8 which is with all those fancy
little things and you know Samsung is
trying its best to make sure that that
can happen it's other suppliers are too
but there's only going to be so many
units being made that I'll just stick to
what they're able to do more of which is
the iPhone sevens body and whatnot and
make sure that there's a price GILF that
there is a you know demonstrate a
demonstrable price golf and hopefully I
don't see Apple going you know be
magnetized towards the lower tiers with
this these releases because the iPhone s
a stalled project in terms of not
year-to-year iterations but maybe an
occasional thing so maybe we'll see
iPhone set at the 7s at 649 and then 769
for the iPhone 8 or maybe even more so
yeah I wouldn't be surprised if so if
there's an exclusivity I there there
okay I just started that sentence four
times late-night podcasts these are
awesome
um so exclusivity I think is is valuable
from a fashion standpoint putting out a
device not everyone gets to have this
device is one factor in being able to
charge more for a product or a service
and so I don't necessarily feel that
there's anything really terrible about
Apple engaging in a strategy where most
consumers will have access to a 7 s and
a 7 s plus and then somewhere around the
thousand dollar price point will have an
exclusive premium iPhone you know very
limited quantities very limited access
and showcasing bleeding edge technology
bleeding edge for an iPhone technologies
you know that to me actually makes a lot
of sense it's kind of thing that I wish
more manufacturers
would try to do like I would love to see
a Lumia 1020 style camera device you
know Panasonic tried to put out you know
a 1 inch sensor smartphone which
unfortunately just never really got the
got the handle of being a good phone
even though I'm sure it was probably a
respectable camera you know but you know
a company going out of their way to say
like we're only gonna make a very small
number of these and because of that we
have to charge much much more because
it's a limited design we're not going to
have the benefit of really ramping up
production on something like this I
think that's an acceptable conversation
to have with an audience and I kind of
wish a few more manufacturers would do
that you know really putting the care
and attention into making a one-off or a
limited edition or something like that
so I'm kind of curious to see like is
this really gonna be the true special
edition iPhone not like what we got for
the iPhone se well yeah I mean I think
this is the failure of the
democratization of the iPhone or any you
know smartphones because when you think
about it you know you have all these
options available to those who can
afford them or to those who have good
enough credit that they can finance
these options and say I mean $40 a month
very digestible to someone who can you
know pile on the credit or you know and
and then you come to the mid Rangers
that are only available from the
directly from the manufacturers or
Amazon or whatnot and there are a
one-time lump-sum fee of 200 300 400
$500 even you're kind of just okay so
costing way too much to about getting an
iPhone 8 and even with an iPhone se I'm
still kind of struggling by the paycheck
to gets to get to that and replace my
phone which isn't bad need of replacing
let's say so Jules I I agree I just kind
of feel like Apple's never gonna be the
company to properly democratize
technology like right now even even the
the more traditional Android players
like Google isn't the company anymore
critize technology I kind of feel like
oneplus can rightfully have that
conversation ZTE kwame with the honor
realm can rightfully have that
conversation
Apple Apple like I look at as so I mean
like the the because I agree with you in
that it's a frustration or it's a
failure for certain aspects of the
market especially for those folks who
might want one of these devices and not
be able to afford them but I kind of
feel like Apple properly launching a
premium a super high-end luxury product
even though it's not really gonna be
targeted for geeks like virtu you know
like it's covered in gold and studded
with diamonds and is made of sapphire
and crystal and all this wacky stuff but
it's got like a Qualcomm 400 series
chipset and a quad vgi 1/4 vga screen
you know like that's not good for
consumer for most consumers it's not
good for us geeks but there there's a
notion of the capitalist side of this
discussion we're having something so way
far out there I think is ultimately good
for the market as a whole to sort of
represent sort of the health of the
smartphone get someone sort of
emotionally excited about it and it's
sort of like walking into a car
dealership I mean we drive a Nissan and
I love drooling all over the GTR when
we're in the showroom and then I drive
home in the Sentra you know there's
something you know again it's about
getting the pulse up a little bit it's
about getting the emotions cranking a
little bit it's not always necessarily
just about the nuts and bolts bang for
buck we try and justify our purchases
after the fact you know we try and
rationalize why we need it as 600 700
$800 phone but then we start climbing
into like thousand $1500 territory you
know like that's just silly
but there's something still kind of
exciting about that notion I would go
against the oneplus being you know a
whole democratizing thing because they
fold up there immediately
oh no I agree I think there's still I
think they're still allowed at the table
it's a sub $500 phone I think they're
still allowed to have that chat just by
the the hardware isn't radically
different than a $600 plus pixel
well the way that they executed a thing
where they couldn't they couldn't just
my supply chain they couldn't do a snap
continue to set up Snapdragon 820 then
go to the center Guinea 21 3t they just
basically forced everyone and also I
agree I agree it's a I I well I don't
disagree is that the right double
negative to put it there no but I you're
right that they're they're trying to
move their brand upscale also but when I
look at a1 plus what move up the food
chain though they're climbing the ladder
I mean well maybe I view them more as a
Harley Davidson or like a mod car thing
where people you know try and just I
could I couldn't afford a real Shelby
Cobra but I got this kick car is that
what they're not like that you know what
I loved about Scion was they're really
working this like youth angle and these
are like inexpensive vehicles for hip
trendy young people I see so many old
people driving them and it's like a
reasonably priced car it's comfortable
it's got some fun features I think it's
fun to try whoa you guys are really
missing them now what you need isn't
like buying this car it is the Kia Soul
because you could give it this or you
can get that you can get with this are
you that you can get with this already I
I think that's we've already just had a
fifth copyright strike of the day this
is where it's at and so of using the the
p-n weekly hash tag from chamfered edges
an even speedier iPhone successor due to
the code name Ferrari perhaps and I
doubt that an iPhone 8 will be any
different in terms of performance
III can't believe that they're gonna
have a completely different chipset I
think it's gonna come down to things
like the build quality of the screen the
wraparound screen
the materials involved I think the
actual innards the guts or and I'll
probably come with more storage I think
the base model storage would probably be
higher cuz storage really isn't that
expensive
I think that'll probably be the
delineating factors or all of those
lifestyle and fashion accents not the
technology and storage while it's
inexpensive you can charge up the wazoo
for right well when you have no options
to expand it and speaking of phones that
can potentially expand storage we've got
some some interesting news about
Samsung's strategy moving into the
galaxy si Jules can you kind of break
down what the timeline is looking like
Samsung next year I was a little scared
there because you said expanding devices
well now that the Galaxy s8 is coming to
us in New York City in April we're gonna
get an unpacked event there
sorry like Hallam Samsung did usually
does its notes reveals it did so last
year this year for the note 7 last year
no 5 it was like both both of them were
in New York and now we see this in the
April maybe as we try and figure out
what the heck is gonna is going to be
the cause of this note 7 debacle like
why did it explode all these times that
it did and why the recall had to take
place especially after you know initial
recall where Samsung decided that they'd
fix the problem
so lots of questions that are still
hanging in the air and lots of questions
about the leaks to where in this there's
been a memo from top up from DJ code the
president of the mobile division who
basically just said okay enough of these
leaks
we gotta patch it up no more or a Galaxy
s8 talk make sure that the factories in
China I know about this because we can't
take this anymore
and you know as far as we know this may
be it for what we know about the innards
of the galaxy si it's I mean we've
already known a lot of this is also I
mean so we've been we've been covering
galaxy si rumors since the beginning of
the galaxy note seven debacle of time
this this would this would fly in the
face of a lot of the information we'd
been sort of trafficking in earlier in
that we were looking at a samsung
potentially trying to speed up or get a
little bit more aggressive with the
launch of the s and eight to try and
quiet the memories of the note seven and
this this sort of flies in the face of
that that notion that samsung might be
instead trying to take their time get
those last final pieces put in place to
make sure that this launch is as smooth
as possible and if that's true it's
that's a samsung that I want to see
that's a samsung that I feel is taking
their competition seriously and their
place in the market their consumer
relationship seriously that makes me a
bit more interested or at least willing
to sort of hold off and see what they
have to release for next year and not
worrying that they're trying to
accelerate you know we were talking
about that you know I think a month ago
maybe two months ago you know the the
fear of Samsung accelerating their
product timetables to try and get ahead
of this is in our pen in my opinion the
wrong reply to the massive disaster that
was the note seven yeah
and even but April though because we
heard later on you know even before this
revelation that maybe this was going to
be a more traditional launch after endo
you see or maybe dirt maybe even during
him don't we see but February March
timeline but April's kind of
unprecedented for Samsung to just wait
out because we've seen LG pull in their
releases more towards and obviously
we've seen Motorola sort of take over
the summer but you know they didn't like
they've been doing a little bit of
pulling in themselves too so
I'm not really sure what this means in
terms of fighting out the competition
and clearing the air or just making sure
that's they even have an idea that this
thing will not blow up on them as much
as the note seven did well you know
what's what's fascinating is Samsung I
think gets one mulligan I think this is
their their one big will we'll wait to
see how you respond to it situation
there are still reports that they're
what was one of the headlines that I
read on reddit that there are still more
note 7s out being used than all of the V
20s that have been sold so yeah yeah
you know these twenties three speeds and
also another phone that the moto moto
yeah and so when you you factor that
against the fact that I think most no
owners probably opted for an s7 or an s7
edge Samsung this this is like the one
do-over that they get look if they screw
up again then I think that's absolutely
disastrous for the brand but they had
built up so much momentum and so much
customer goodwill that one instance like
this means that they can they can make
this move they can delay their their
announcement they can delay their launch
and customers will still wait for them
to make their move to see what they do
and so so I think a number of people
will probably wait just to make sure
there aren't any major problems like the
phone but I think Samsung is one of the
only companies that could probably get
away with that the only other one being
Apple like if Apple were to make a
mistake of the same significance I'll be
really curious to see but but you know
it's one of those things in my opinion
and not really being the biggest Samsung
fan anymore this is the kind of reply I
want to see from the company we're gonna
take our time we're going to disclose
what we found in our investigation of
the note 7 we're going to make sure our
next product launch is great and that to
me is is taking their market position
seriously that's taking their
relationship with customers and handling
it with respect
and I love pencils the bring up I just
pulled up Twitter so we have a couple
more tweets from the p-n weekly hash tag
from Panzer Z robots hamsters and an
apocalyptic dystopia Kia Soul this is
how you advertise to the young people
he's got he's got the jiff of that Kia
Soul ad which is more of a camp stirs
and then also again from chamfered edges
pn weekly hope the extended unveiled
date would be ample enough to prevent
another note successor well from outside
it doesn't seem like any other larger
devices have completely unseated what
the note brought to the table like I
said most people went for the galaxy s7
and the SKA so could be a time for
Samsung to regroup like if they want to
walk away from the note branding because
they feel it's tainted then this is a
way that they could do an S and s 8 and
s 8 edge and an S 8 Pro you know it's a
way for them to tear their device
strategy in a slightly different way so
that customers don't mentally link you
know products that explode to new
products that are out there and then we
also have from Edie Edie maudlin the
oneplus brand was stable modern phones
oh the oneplus brand was modern phones
for a good price Samsung post-mortem
unpacked too much PN weekly I'll be
curious to see how oneplus handles 2017
yeah
for that reason just because we got this
weird refresh you know the one plus 3t
is is just odd timing for what we would
expect a company like oneplus to deliver
so it's an opportunity for them to show
us that they can also still do something
cool in the first half of 2017 but if
we're gonna be getting one plusses every
six months I think it's gonna start
falling prey to what is that the Osborn
effect where doesn't wait and they never
really by anything yeah I mean for me I
expect that this is more likely to do
with the Snapdragon 835 being there's
the biggest of big of pretty
improvements to the series so far so
maybe they're just hoping that
price will come in just a little bit
more before they start showing up
margins on that and that they'll
probably move up to a quad HD screen no
I mean that's the hope
no III think I think that that could be
you know that could be the next one plus
refresh is you know I they probably
started you know finding difficulties in
sourcing the 820 versus the 821 yeah
yeah just as a sort of chip fab was
getting moved over and once the 835 is
out then they move over to that and they
have a better argument to then also
tweak something else like screen
resolution so that they oneplus can
start having the same conversations
about things like VR yeah they're
they're behind I mean they're good at
making headsets for hard phones but
where's the rest of it yeah you know the
full the full strategy on all these
different devices and a company that
we're gonna be getting a much better
they get a full strategy well you know
we were talking about companies that
were trying to move up their device
strategy and it looks like HTC might be
trying to fill the void left by early
announcements and Samsung at the
beginning of 2017 they have something up
it's something big up its sleeve coming
January 12 and what for you yeah there's
this big invite you know for you and it
talks about the state HCC's but as a see
at the end but if they have it oriented
in a way that you know the you it
becomes more like a you so there's a
whole bunch of speculation about what
this could mean we don't think honestly
that they would launch the HTC 11 this
quickly although who knows they might
they might just capitalize on what's
going on the Samsung at this point but
maybe they could take a little bit more
time with development and such in the
meantime we do think that's what's going
on here maybe Under Armour development
they've been partnering with the
this company for device releases such as
was at the grip the health box those
came out last year and this time so
we've we've been on on like this on
again off again rumor train of HTC
working on wearables or working on a
SmartWatch or working on a fitness
tracker they were originally gonna be
working on a Qualcomm Talk follow-up at
one point there was a rumor back in the
day and nothing is ever really
materialized so now would be not a
terrible time for HTC with the sort of a
slightly reinvigorated coolness
reputation to deliver something that
could be like well I think it's the
right time for them to diversify I was
gonna make a terrible joke like I'm
telling you now it's gonna be a vive
phone and you know that was actually
gonna be pretty lame not that a vibe own
would be lame that might joke about
there being of iPhone was going to be
lame
so now explaining the lame this is way
better I was gonna say a strategic
partnership like Under Armour this could
be a good time for HTC to show that its
continuing to diversify its product line
so it's not just you know they did a
couple years ago right they had like a
whole thing about you know four
quadrants of life with smartphones with
yeah maybe VR health and then also the
recámara which was that camera that kept
getting on discount every tuesday the
Crestron the frustrating thing about
that is that they weren't wrong
you know what I mean it was they put out
this one product and this is kind of the
same thing I would hammer Samsung for
this to the the gear 360 had very little
sort of full company support behind that
product and it didn't sell very well
same thing with LG with their 360 degree
action camera and I guarantee you that
there are now people in the sort of
middle upper tiers of those companies
going well they didn't sell I guess we
shouldn't make any more and I think if
HTC had continued
proving and iterating they would be a
competitive force in the action camera
market they'd be able to build on that
for other products and services and
features and tie-ins to things like the
vibe and tie-ins to things like their
smartphones they would have inroads
there instead they put it out there they
sort of limped it out into the market it
didn't instantly become a top seller and
then they sort of let it wither on the
vine and too many companies let that
happen where they don't seem to be
willing to invest in the long term
aspects of actually having a product
like that which could be a good way to
differentiate yourself from the
competition yeah well I mean all these
low branches that come to an end in
favor of this whole idea of the trunk or
developing a truck a different trunk of
sorts so before we move on to the next
story I've got this from the p-n weekly
hash tag I want to throw this one at you
and just get your thoughts this comes
from Steve Becker do you think HTC will
ever be a competitive brand in the
future as in going head-to-head with
Samsung and LG what do you think Jules
yeah at this point it's gonna take years
and I don't think in terms of the
smartphone industry we have years before
to make this competitive again we're
well into maturation point and we're
just trying to find where that people
will disseminate information next and
it's still gonna be mobile it's still
gonna be you know that's you know
something that will cover it's just
going to be how how now and well it you
know a sturdy
well I encompass a forum that we will be
able to properly criticize a critique
and criticize we'll always be able to
properly criticize something like
something and still criticizes the crap
out of it but week was the proper word
for it no that was the right word so
this also from from Jonas Timothy your
mom goodbye and and so this is kind of
going hand-in-hand with what Steve
Becker asked do you think HTC should
make it
tablet laptop convertible and I don't
think so
I don't think so um not not not to like
step on new what I think HTC should be
looking at are what future markets there
are and I think a number of tech
companies whenever they start playing
overly defensive or they start getting a
little reactionary there's a notion like
Oh HTC should go back and make another
tablet or something like that and I kind
of feel like the tablet market is so
stalled right now that HTC going back to
make another one doesn't really bring
anything new to the table so it doesn't
feel like HTC's doing anything fresh
they could make the best tablet ever and
I think a number of people would go yeah
yeah and it doesn't really get people
talking like the biggest you know the
biggest boost for HTC over this year was
was kicking ass at the VR game that got
HTC the name HTC in those circles
especially in the gaming circles became
a hip company again and it's those types
of opportunities that I think HTC needs
to be focused on you you still service a
smartphone market you can still put out
carrier SPECT phones like the bolt which
I think are kind of mediocre at best and
then you actually focus the company on
what future markets will look like
exactly what you were talking about
jewels in that we don't necessarily know
what the next generation of mobile
interaction will look like but if HTC
can get ahead of the pulse it can get
ahead of the curve then I think the
company the company will be a cool
profitable competitive company if it's
just like oh well can they go toe to toe
with Apple for making smartphones I
think that that's sort of an over
discussion I think that's kind of that
bus assail retired yeah absolutely what
are you mixing all of our metaphors but
yeah I mean I think VR is their way they
have all the money towards that they
have all the partners towards it that's
just trying to get the Calvary to you
know move in one direction at the same
pace and just making sure that's
that they can make you know be part of
other alright so convertible tablets ice
think are still on their way up there
are they're still in the lower floors of
things relatively speaking
and if HTC can point up a killer
argument for making V mobile via are
much better than just from VR and just
shy of even full-blown stand up PC VR I
think that would be the killer app that
would come I agree but but also on top
of all that I think what you're talking
about they're not to put words in your
mouth sorry Jules but part of what
you're talking about there is also sort
of changing what it is what it means to
have an interaction with a mobile device
you know if we're talking Ken HTC makes
something which can compete rightfully
compete against desktop grade VR
solutions or is just head and shoulders
above current phone virtual reality
solutions we're talking about a gadget
which would probably also start walking
us away from the accepted way that we
interact with phones and tablets and I
and that's where I agree with you I
think if HTC can bring that to the
discussion then they will be competitive
but not competitive just yeah they make
a good smartphone that we know they can
make a good smartphone yeah they'll be
competitive in driving the bus they'll
be competitive in directing where the
future of mobile interactions yeah I
only hope that this ocean thing really
you know turns out and we get these the
you know touchless side these are Primus
side rails that you can touch and you
know all these interactions on sensor
why I mean we've sort of seen that with
a ZTE Nubia doing that kind of thing but
we haven't got much out of China I'm
telling you if this big announcement
that they've got in January's just like
we've made a Fitness band I Oh HTC I
mean big announcement and then like it
counts your steps
not a thing anymore I mean the money the
money from Under Armour is there so but
but it's like it's sacrificing HTC's
reputation to take that Under Armour
cash and it's now no no this thing this
this product whatever it is it is for
you yeah now sort of a piggybacking on
on that question from from Jonah's we do
actually have some news some rumors
pointing to a Chromebook yep from novo
so we've got the the yoga book we
actually did a review on pocket now of
the yoga book I've got mine right here
the Android version the Android version
of it I actually did okay so a lot of
people were talking mad shit about our
arms wanting to review the Android
version of the yoga book over the
Windows version of the yoga book and one
of the main things that I kinda needed
on this device was the predictive text
capabilities which aren't properly
supported in Windows 10 and so I
actually did I requested to review the
Android version because after using both
that Aoife I felt that the Android
version was actually the superior
product for a lot of what I feel felt
people were apt to do on it this the the
Android version I think actually made
more sense especially once you start
using this completely smooth surface
keyboard area sketch area you kind of
need a little software support to help
you make sure words are properly spelled
it does actually help improve your
typing an error rate so so you think
that androids cousin is gonna fare worse
off because of its lack of that feature
Chrome OS is just a Windows wannabe with
chrome and and like cousin and Chrome OS
fan maybe the app just threw their boots
through their computer
monitors at you Jules they are not happy
well especially now how dare you well
they probably they probably ran out
close the threat me after the whole you
know Hiroshi
law chimera saying that oh we're not
actually doing Andromeda so yeah that's
not that it's Google assistant all the
way people you guys should know this
well that that's where that's where I'm
torn I have very little um very little
interaction I've had very little
interaction with Chrome OS it's not
something I I it's not something that
that that really fits any part of my
workflow better than current phone and
tablet solution so I'm just the wrong
person to ask about this but I keep
seeing potential in the same way that I
still see some potential with
Microsoft's you know one OS for
everybody kind of strategy and for
Google to be playing coy about Andromeda
or that Chrome OS might not be making
that merge happening but we're seeing
all these indicators for Android apps on
Chrome OS and things like that you know
they're they're walking slowly towards a
more cohesive operating system strategy
especially a more robust operating
system strategy than what chrome
originally was sort of birthed as this
its web it's a browser everything lives
in the cloud you know now that that's
not really how people use their
technology and it's gonna be a while
before the infrastructure really
supports sort of just a dumb terminal
everything's up floating above your head
the kind of computing style but yeah if
we continue to put out good hardware
Lenovo is gonna put em into Chrome the
yoga book is really well executed
hardware it's not the best typing
experience but there's something so just
unique about it it's so well put
together that you can only I think it
can only help to serve uh it can only
help to benefit Chrome OS in general
even if it won't necessarily help
Chrome OS like explode like it's not
going to be some big top seller and
consumers are going to be salivating all
over it but you know improvement is
improvement and hopefully it sets the
stage for where we might end up on
Andromeda yeah well let's just hope that
improvement proves itself over time but
yes that is all so just a quick because
this is not this is not mean to be fair
we are PocketNow we're not like Pocket
tomorrow so no speculating about the
future why would we do that
from Abhishek in my opinion one of the
best HTC builds was the polycarbonate
build of the HTC One x+ completely agree
I miss that era of phones especially the
matte finish Lumia Polly carbs were
gorgeous
then from chamfered edges I'd rather get
the Windows version of the yoga book it
does feel weird with Android loaded on
it tongue sticking out emoticon I was
really torn there's so much that you
would I would have thought well I want
Windows 10 on this I want it to be more
of that netbook style computing
experience and yet I have one drive on
there
I have Word and Excel and PowerPoint on
there my Microsoft my core Microsoft
services are well covered and then I can
also fire up Marvel future fight do a
little gaming and I kind of feel like
for me personally I'm not gonna speak
for anyone else but for me personally I
kind of feel like the Android version
was the better fit and then also from
Steve Becker should there be more dual
boot Android Windows mainstream tablet
laptops or would that be too neat of a
product and unfortunately I kind of
think it would be I've played with a
number of sort of low-cost Chinese
solutions these dual booting
environments that I think it's just a
little too complicated for people to
understand things like how your storage
is formatted you know it's like I I know
I've got 64 GBS and then you're like
well 20 GB czar for Windows and 30 GB
czar for Android
how does that work you know so those
types of things I think might stand in
the way of accessibility and not to say
that you can't solve those problems you
can absolutely solve those issues but
for anyone who's feeling like they might
want that dual OS on one device strategy
I think emulation is probably a better
way to go yeah as a fortunately as it is
right now maybe they can like emulate
Windows 10 on an Android someday I mean
you know what once once we start seeing
Windows 10 with proper arm emulation
support out in the wild I wouldn't be
surprised but I'll tell you what I was
probably not going to be making that
transition or supporting those kinds of
products really that sold way better
than I was expecting for the second half
of 2016
well now I was only at this wacky chart
but essentially what this chart showing
us is out of all of the phones that
might have stepped up to fill the void
left by the note 7 the Sony Xperia XZ
became one of the highest selling
flagships of the second half of 2016 I
can't believe this I honestly look at
those numbers and I'm shocked I'm
shocked well I mean Japan had its
strategies shifted up and I think it's
doing them right so far so we have all
this talk about how the note 7 and is
just cratering Samsung's
brand and whatnot and then we have all
these other phones out there that were
launched in the second half of this year
that were kind of just kind of
milquetoast including what we called
well we called it the Xperia Z but we
called it up toast as well and you know
there were more interesting more
spectacular kind of you know releases
from Motorola from mates not really HTC
but from LG one plus it's been going on
there and of all things it turns out
that with 0.15 percent of the total
android market so far the sony xperia
is just killing it everyone else is
struggling to get out the point Oh 6.07
range and here we are we're just it took
like a couple of months for it to just
skyrocket so but we can we can kind of
explain some of these numbers right the
LGV 20 had a very limited release the
Google pixel also its initial launch was
targeted to a couple different regions
oneplus is still facing five week six
weeks shipping delays four orders placed
today and for the first time in recent
memory Sony actually got the x/z out to
a number of markets roughly close to the
same time as their Japanese release this
this really does sort of support our
hypothesis that when you advertise and
you actually ship ship products to
different regions those products seem to
sell better yeah exactly it's amazing
where little money towards the marketing
can do but yeah there's just too much be
happy for Sony or should we be angry so
here's the thing I'm I am ultimately
happy for Sony they're a company I try
very hard I want to like I've got my X Z
right here and there's so much about
this phone which is so much improved
over the xperia x the Xperia X was a
miserable range of devices for me to
wrap up reviews on by the time I got to
the X performance I was hating my life
with Sony and the X Z while I still
think there are a number of options out
there which might fit people better
especially in some of like the $400
range to where you can kind of target
the things that you want the things that
you don't this is so much improved over
the Xperia X and the X performance the X
performance was just an abortion of a
phone this is this is is more in keeping
with what we would expect from a
flagship device even if I do think it's
it's priced higher than it should be
ultimately this is what I would call
progress so if this is this is what
Spurs Sony to be taking more market
seriously especially the North American
market and to continue improving their
products then I'll call that a win all
right I mean it really I think it just
matters that era they're out there and
matters that they're available to buy
yeah I mean it's a great review pin
because we've been so stuffed with all
these devices lately and we just are
gave them back the side treatment well
he wasn't no actually I'm gonna fight
you on that that wasn't true it was it
wasn't that we've ever put Sony off to
the side and and and for anyone who's
watching this or listening to this if
you've caught pocket now coverage in the
past you would know that our
editor-in-chief Tony is a Sony fanatic
that is one of the brands that he grew
up with and he would never let a Sony
review opportunity just sit on the side
when we get these things we aggressively
cover them the problem with the X going
from the Z the Z 5 to the X we were
months behind in getting review units or
in being able to purchase them for our
region so by the time we got the X
performance here in the United States
and we could get our hands on on a unit
to review we the the X performance had
been out for months so it wasn't that we
pushed it off to the side is that Sony
sort of pushed North America off to the
side and then with the XZ was much
smarter about getting that getting that
hardware out to people to play with them
so that's reflective I think in these
sales numbers yeah in the case of the X
Z we did we did a better job at try and
put it all off not it's not really
that's more the fact that we've been
dealing with so many of these releases
and that you know some things take
priority over others because you know
they're the names and the in the past
performances of the brands
yeah talking about here or even just
like the newness of the brands in the US
so I mean just by default in those cases
like that that sort of had something to
do with our kind of my blaze and with
you know not only your malaise but also
your marmalade well know that that that
is absolutely accurate that that is that
is important I just feel like there's
such a current in our comments about how
we're anti Sony when really I don't know
that that could be farther from the
truth from the team of people who are
passionate Sony fans at PocketNow and
just you know sort of fans fans without
a country you know it's it's they don't
have access to these products yet they
really want to be talking about them and
the same thing kind of happened with us
where we never really could get our
hands on a compact at the most busy part
of our review schedule form eight nines
and pixels and LGV 20s if that one did
kind of get pushed off to the side
because one wasn't sent our way but the
x/z as soon as we we got the XE we were
on top of at least trying to talk about
it even though I know it took us a while
to get reviews out got a couple tweets
here from chamfered edges using the PN
weekly hashtag five to six weeks yet
they're 101 plus three T's giveaway can
take a week or under to deliver now
funny how certain youtubers got a
hundred one plus three T's to giveaway
and yet there's still like a month
backorder on customers trying to buy
that product that seems like priorities
are a little out of whack there then
from Panzer Z using the P n weekly hash
tag advertising and actually making the
product available leads to sales who
would have thunk it and then he's got
this really mind blown is really great
Jeff on that too and then from sunlight
hi PN weekly I'm proud to be a blind
user of an Acer Chromebook not a fan of
Windows though can't wait for Google
Play support that's really interesting I
I this is something that we we continue
to try and and look at how we might
cover it but it's something that
unfortunately
I have to admit we've been woefully
negligent and talking about some of the
accessibility issues on mobile
technology especially when we get to you
know I can't imagine that using an all
smooth surface yoga book would be the
best way to interact with technology for
someone who's maybe you know got some
sight issues and because it's so neat
like the whole thing about being able to
produce Braille input or Braille output
for or just even write like multimedia
content that that's gotta be a tough
time and very few sources can be able to
provide that kind of that kind of thing
so yeah it's it's tough to get into time
and you know but I think that at least
we should try as a public trust service
or something like there has to be
initiatives there I mean the tricky
thing is is obviously my perspective on
that is gonna be skewed as I'll be
looking at accessibility options for
someone who might be hearing-impaired or
vision impaired and I'm neither yeah
like my my opinion on the matter is a
little less valuable as to whether or
not I think something might be good but
shifting gears because we do have some
some politics to talk about and you're
gonna have to do a talk me through this
one I read our story on pocketnow.com
and I still can't quite wrap my brain
exactly around what's going on over at
t-mobile so t-mobile is being accused by
were currently were an advocacy group
watchdog thing called change to win that
its managers have been on the mandate
that's they should probably sell more
and you know attain sales goals that
have that you know just are you know
tougher and tougher the more that they
pile on and that has led to coercing you
know maybe you know their managers so
we'll just make it up
just fraud so you're thinking about you
know doing
you're putting Wells Fargo into this
situation in terms of making fake
accounts or whatnot then yeah you're
pretty much right according to FTC
complaints to the industry as a whole we
saw complaints jump ethically at
t-mobile from 21 per millions
subscribers to 29 per million
subscribers that's from between 2013 and
2014 and 2015 60 per million subscribers
and then in just a half year of 2016
that they logged 95 per million
subscribers and that that just pales you
know when you look at the others which
aren't even that bad 69 is the closest
that Verizon gets and Sprint is the hide
the highest total we see here is 21 so
now is there as that smaller to some of
the fines that were levied against the
other carriers for there are no
customers we haven't seen any
enforcement action or anything like that
you just yet but many employees have
been told you know or have told to
change to win that they've had you know
they've been pushing insurance policies
on their devices done phone insurance
other such services bundled accessories
extra lines and some of them so the
customer on the customer side 36% of a
2,200 person poll because 2200 customer
poll said that they paid more per month
no a 56% had said that they paid more
per month than what was advertised and
that 83% of 500 associates at t-mobile
and asked me not as was can't see things
and not as they didn't get their names
tell happy trying to say you're doing
fine they didn't give their names to
tell that they were under pressure to
cram services and products not
explicitly requested by the customer and
just you know some days they would just
put in
like a jump policy you know so that you
know you get the early upgrade program
and device insurance like they would put
in you know a job policy for a new
customer and then take it off days later
just to meet a sales bill for that oh so
that's I mean that's like the proper
shady where there's a behavior which is
which is demonstrably deceitful that
you're doing something which it's like
no confusion on the policy that that
can't be something that that was well it
tended to be done straight up like that
like they think you know that managers
even just you know jibe them a little
bit say you know if you well if you want
to make those goals and then maybe you
should just try and you know do that and
you know there's this one imagine who
says no one says I want to work at
t-mobile to do fraud but a lot of reps
do it because they want to keep their
jobs and they want to get the pay they
need you know a lot of low-income
workers at mobile they aren't bad or
dishonest people but there's just a lot
of pressure and there's been going
around in terms of employees trying to
get John Legere the CEO of t-mobile to
address these issues and he hasn't
really talked about this stuff this in
you know the whole scheme of things
where t-mobile is just like oh we're
doing something that's a yes what's next
well you know find out later and also
the splitting of the t-mobile one plan
where it's like you know there's
t-mobile one international like yeah it
just doesn't it it just it just doesn't
feel right with me especially because
they've been hammered time time again
about you know labor conditions at the
stores and also just the fact that the
you know it's kind of deceptive that no
contract offerings were no contract when
you have obligations for a device you
know you don't have a service contract
but you have a phone contract that you
had to pay off once you decide that
you're out you're out of t-mobile so
yeah it's just you know well that's a
pretty I was gonna say that's also very
disappoint
that it's that it's being handled that
way and that we haven't heard more word
from the top it's moves like that I mean
it was something similar where maybe not
in the same way that reps were signing
people up for services and then
canceling but something very similar
that I think it was 18 t just got fined
for recently where people were getting
signed up for services that we're adding
cost to bills and there was a class
action and I believe they were cramming
in there got caught up in something
third party services on the Biddle's
exactly this it is a very high party
service it's not a third party yes this
is this is way more incentive and if
complaints get in to the FTC and you
know they take action and there's well
maybe not during the Trump
administration possibly but yeah from
Panzers ii on twitter using the pn
weekly hash tag because of shady store
workers i now only do stuff over the
phone direct with t-mobile i've always
had to cancel random extras someone
saying that they've had first-hand
experience with this kind of practice
and then from ed maudlin it's very smoky
under the table shady crap and you know
we we always have these you know this is
one of the things that i think
especially over the next couple years i
i i i hope we see sort of a consumer
revolution in maybe we don't look to
these companies to help inform our like
daily fashion or style or identity you
know like yeah you know are you an
iphone person or a galaxy person are you
t-mobile or you verizon this is not a
team this is a multi-billion dollar
corporation which looks to extract as
much wealth out of the system as they
can to provide benefit for their
shareholders and yeah we should expect
you know good service and return for the
extraction of income of our wealth it's
not a friend of ours who's working to be
our buddy
it's a giant corporation which is
offering a service for a price and so
and
can wash it be clear yeah ed maudlin who
also is who also works with the MetroPCS
which is a subsidiary of t-mobile he
told me just now on the piano weekly
hashtag that it is the angry god of our
poo RP being average revenue per user
and historically t-mobile has had I
think some of the lowest in the industry
so if they can get those bills up and
one way to do so would be you know
putting in those insurance well yeah I
mean one way to increase revenue is just
to make sign people up for services they
didn't sign up for oh wow
so another sort of not political bummer
but just a sticky political topic that
we're running into especially what with
some of the political climate that were
apt to see from the people that Trump is
appointed to his cabinet people who have
been very vocal about trying to for
example weaken PFC seeds jurisdiction
over businesses and services
internet-related
is that we've gotten some replies from
18t and Verizon responding to the FCC on
some of the topics we've been talking
about where they have first party
content that can go out for free on
their networks but then other companies
you know their content counts against a
consumers data plan and something that
we feel this flies in the face of net
neutrality and this is absolutely one
reason why you know net neutrality is
probably going to be under attack very
very soon is because of these sort of
corporate interests if I'm if I'm a
major ISP I want you to use my services
so I'll make it painful for you to use a
competitor's because I I have content
and I also have the pipes that deliver
that content which I will make direct
conflict of interest I'll make it
painful with for the competitors who
don't have their own well and often it's
both of its I'm gonna make it painful
for the competitors and I won't make it
costlier for the consumers which to me
is a
lose/lose when those first party
services typically aren't as good as the
competition I have undemanding Warner
it's not as good as Netflix I like
Netflix better Netflix is easier to use
it's available across more devices
seamlessly and my on-demand is
constantly crapping out whereas you know
my internet connection isn't terrific
but for what it is your Netflix as the
service has never failed on me it's only
ever been my pipe from Netflix to my
house has failed on me and that's not
Netflix's fault yeah well I mean you can
always tune in to channel 1020 is it -
it's over here it's it's channel 1,000
is is on-demand Oh 1,000 not 10 to 1 ok
yeah yeah
well no I mean I'm sure it's different
on and every other thing but that's just
it is I often can't I've gone through
three different cable boxes I've been on
multiple support calls and you know I
can't tell you how many times I've
rebooted this damn and it still doesn't
function with the reliability that
Netflix can you know even when our
internet connection is running for crap
I can switch over to LTE and still watch
something on Netflix where I can't from
my dedicated home cable connection with
the same consistency and uptime and
Netflix can offer so I'm happy to pay my
what eight bucks a month for Netflix
whereas I'm paying a lot for cable
internet and an expanded TV package
which I can't fully benefit from from
Time Warner and yet we're watching the
industry start to make that I'm sorry
spectrum spectrum oh god I I just feel
so gross even just saying the word
spectrum it's just such a terrible name
for a company in an age where we're
trying to have conversations about like
you know mental health and child
empowerment and and autism and yeah yeah
and there's also the fact that you know
I'll just use this as my soapbox for
just a second but they're ruining New
York one
yeah they introduced a new L bar to it
so like they've squeezed away pack your
nin and you know in favor of rundowns
and weather information and also you
know weather and trend trans information
which is kind of nice but you know when
you're you don't need to know what
happens in you know in the next 15
minutes because they're on a wheel we
know what that we you should know what
the wheel is by now people but that's
just me
not even living in New York but knowing
about New York want some news it's
that's that's no fun but you know just
in in wrapping up this story here you
know what's fun but really oh what's
that porn oh okay we're done with 18 T
and Verizon no I'm good moving on
because um we're not really going to
talk about porn as much as we're going
to talk about lawmakers who want to
block consumers access to porn unless
you pay some kinda more extortion
they're saying it's not a tax and and I
love this logic it's the same thing you
know like my texts and relatives love to
say oh we don't pay taxes here in Texas
and then you're like any time you get on
a road it's a toll road you can call it
a toll you can call it a fee you can
call it a surcharge it's all the same
you're paying money to a government for
a service
welcome to paying taxes please
understand that yeah welcome to Texas
but you know tax it's in California yeah
that one almost works and I love you for
it but again it's one of those things
like you know I kind of feel the whole
idea is what am I getting for paying
that money and I feel like we do okay
here in California especially
considering we're subsidizing like what
you know six or seven other debtor
states that get way more in federal
funds than we pay in taxes and we
receive and
federal government but I digress this
largest economy in the Union people well
and I think we make up something like 15
percent of the overall United States GDP
and we just surpassed Great Britain as
one of the world's largest economies but
no that's cool that's cool we're gonna
we're gonna talk about you know you know
conservative politics and picking
yourself up by your bootstraps welcome
guys a ton of the United States that's
great it's great we're that we're the
wacky coastal you know left-wing no it's
fine it's fine if we want we want it we
want to fix you know getting money for
our taxes maybe we should just sort of
reset what states get what funds from
the federal government since we're all
about states rights right anyway yeah
Carolina WTF there's a bill going up in
South Carolina which would prevent if
you buy a computer in South Carolina
they they want to install either some
type of software or hardware which would
prevent users from accessing
pornographic materials online unless you
pay a $20 unlock porn fee yeah look and
then you can consume that content let's
beat let's parse this because I feel
like there are a lot more implications
than just first amendment things
so either manufacturers and retailers
having to install the program or opt out
and pay that $20 fee themselves or the
consumers you know having to deal with
the filter themselves and then paying
the $20 fee either way it goes to a fund
that is supposed to combat human
trafficking which is a very valid
problem and we should be doing something
to solve that but in a the link between
this all right so the Upstate I think
you know representative his name is Mike
burns I believe and he says that if
you're you know you
viewing pornography is a slippery slope
it leads to one thing and another and
suddenly all your suddenly participating
in the propagation of child porn and you
know well I think that scared to extreme
for some people he has a point
no no I I I would want to see like again
I'm not saying it's not true I see no
evidence for that slippery slope
argument in any kind of aggregate what I
would want to see is the data to back
that up if we're talking about this
being a public works a public good we
need to not just sort of throw out these
truthiness statements we need to
actually demonstrate that free and
accessible pornography on the Internet
has more than just a casual relationship
to human trafficking and some of the
dirtier aspects of online subjugation
and abuse of different peoples that are
traded for currencies I'm really trying
to be delicate about yeah how we're
talking about this because because that
is a very serious problem and we've seen
some progress in how these rings of
terrible people who put trade in
paedophile materials people who trade in
sex slave materials the federal
government state governments and
governments in the world have actually
been stepping up their involvement in
actually breaking some of these rings
online these rings that go sort of dark
web I don't think you know again not
having any data in front of me but I've
not seen anything that would suggest to
me that the consumption of freely
available pornography on the internet
the web that we can track has any direct
correlation to someone becoming one of
these traffickers of like really really
bad stuff
yeah so before we go throwing laws
around and extorting money from people
to consume content which doesn't harm
anybody it's something you're doing in
the privacy of your homes at home yeah
it's healthy in you know the way that
you should practice it I think that we
poorly educate people about how to deal
with this kind of material in the first
place so well and we're making itself
that from a species you're absolutely
right there I mean if we want to have
these kinds of conversations and one I
feel we need to be having them younger
and in a more educational setting for
though Apple that's only the way well I
don't know I mean like I I never would
have thought South Carolina being one of
those companies parts of the country
that was so hopped up on this sort of
nanny state idea you know that we're
gonna protect people from themselves I
know it's a part of the South sort of
nodes here's north or there's more
there's more to this because the
execution of this filter which is
available you know you'd be a market
solution so there's that but the
execution of it would block out material
obscene by state and federal definitions
that and we'd also have a flag down
system for people to use become a cloth
across unblocked obscene material and
that just opens up another can of worms
about and potentially blocking people
from actually are you know safe safe
legal in that consents contents you know
just put it in I'm always I'm always
curious to know who gets to decide the
Supreme Court can't decide on where the
line is for smut you know what for where
the line is on obscene they just sort of
know it when they see it right that's
always been the legal justification for
why you can't just create a
one-size-fits-all statute to block
obscene materials who gets South
Carolina what sites are blocked and what
sites are accessible and what
constitutes obscenity and what
constitutes
it's pornography yeah I mean it could be
obscenity could be anything at this
point you could just you know slap it on
you know WikiLeaks anonymous or what you
know what have you and - I don't know
there would have to be a filtering
system and it doesn't seem like as far
as the discourse on this bill would be
that's you know there there's been much
discussion or thought put to that and
you know the skins Republican backed
bill which is scheduled to be yeah
there's no surprise its Republic and a
republican-controlled General Assembly
in the Palmetto State right and you know
the National Party the GOP also had a
very strong crusade against it in their
in their platform this year and you know
it's just so of course we're talking
about freedom of speech we're talking
but you know we're also talking about
interstate commerce here because if
you're asking someone if you're asking a
company to install something that is not
required naturally that or you know any
other states
isn't that are then that should not be
like that well that's actually you know
and that's I'm glad I'm glad you started
going that direction Jules because it's
also one of the things we're getting a
number of comments from people we will
be getting to your tweets on this
because as you can tell I'm really
trying to not let my how infuriated I am
by this notion sort of override the
discussion and I'm not quite succeeding
but just in terms of is this gonna serve
the public good to have a law on the
books which generates funds when there
are so many loopholes there are so many
unknowns we have no idea who's going to
be in charge of you know rating
something on the internet as to what's
acceptable to consume and what's going
to be blocked
under this system and and this is
brought up by a Trina
using the p-n weekly hashtag and i guess
as much as most other kinds of porn
blockage this will affect mostly legal
websites but will have no effect on tour
sites or anything dark web related and
that to me becomes you are not actually
serving the public good you are not
actually preventing abuse you're
actually empowering people to go darker
to either circumvent and in essence
become lawbreakers by trying to
circumvent this policy or they're going
to try and find loopholes for purchasing
computers out of the state so that they
don't have this stuff pre-installed and
if this is we're making the slippery
slope argh
slope argument can't we also make the
slippery slope argument that if you
start installing crap on our computing
devices that monitor what kind of
content we can consume that eventually
that power will fall into the hands of
people we don't want to have that kind
of power over our computing devices
maybe not a pornography maybe the next
day it's any type of dissent in speech
and that's deemed unhealthier unamerican
isn't that the same argument can we make
the same argument about that kind of
policy I mean I don't know about you but
I'm looking forward to my first text
from Donald Trump I'm not so close so
folks here's here's one of the reasons
why I'm so incensed over this policy I
think it should be pretty clear by now
that I'm on the bleeding heart side of
the political spectrum I'm very
left-leaning but one of the greatest
failings of the Democratic Party in
particular in liberals in general has
been this notion of thoughtcrime of
trying to police content of trying to
censor speech every single time we speak
up against that type of Liberty it does
a huge disservice to what I feel is the
liberal cause in trying to raise boats
up for everybody and trying to raise up
all people from you know gangsta rap and
hip-hop in the 90s to video game
violence the Liberals have had a
terrible track record of trying to
silence this type of content where is
trying mute this type of speech now for
conservatives it seems to land a lot on
sex they don't seem to have the same
problems with violence but I find just
as despicable as what the Liberals did
with violent imagery what conservatives
are now trying to do in protecting us
from our carnal desires whether or not
you consume pornography or whether or
not you consume violent or aggressive
media if you're age-appropriate if
you're not giving this stuff to tilt
children if you're not letting children
consume this kind of stuff you're doing
your job as a parent you're doing your
job as a consumer then there should be
no government force standing in the way
of what a law-abiding adult should be
able to consume in the comfort of their
own home this is a liberty issue this is
not a conservative issue this is not a
liberal issue this is a freedom issue
and I hope those of you who are
motivated enough to potentially post
about this kind of stuff or write
comments on blogs or link to write your
legislator you will write your elected
officials to say this is absolutely not
the course we should be going and this
is absolutely not what we should be
spending our time on as we have very
real problems to fix in this country and
trying to stop someone from watching
porn and extorting 20 dollars out of
them for the privilege is not how we're
going to make America great again yeah
yeah in turn I really don't want to go
down the person road but I'll just make
this branch here and that this is
securing power and in in ways that you
know partisan parsing ways where you can
control the party because we've seen you
know the North Carolina gerrymandering
the rules changed where the governor had
to you know you know is being neutered
of his powers you know not being able to
change stuff and all that stuff like
this is going on in several places and
if I you know this extent you know lots
of you know the act of sex has been a
big
talking point a big point for
evangelicals for the religious right and
by you know enabling this to be
discussed in their platform in the
National Party's platform we see things
like this act like Utah's act where porn
is a you know is a public health hazard
that is you know that it's that kind of
platform that we get you know these
kinds of bills from this kind of
discussion where the problem you know if
you want to throw science off the if off
the table here is that we should be
probably be talking to our kids about
having you know being human being
sexually active and being you know
responsible for what we do on the
Internet in terms of I don't know maybe
not making mean comments bullying and
then being sexually depraved through a
long loop sequence of you know things
for yourself well and we've got a number
of comments here I do want to get to
some of these tweets Edie in chamfered
edges and Rina and Panzer been dropping
us some great comments in chamfered
edges in Singapore we don't give an F
about large porn websites about a
hundred of them have been blocked no
payment needed just VPN this is because
I've seen this brought up a number of
times like oh well I'll just circumvent
this if this becomes more of an issue
though like if more states start sort of
latching on to this idea of content
censorship the problem I have is VPN is
the practical solution it gets you
around the block but it in essence it
turns what was a normal free behavior
into a crime I don't smoke marijuana but
I don't feel that it should be a felony
you know I don't feel that you should go
to prison for a super long period of
time have your life taken away from you
lose the ability to vote in a number of
places because you had a certain
quantity of marijuana on you I feel
that's a very important freedom issue
especially if we're talking
about whether or not that really serves
the public good again it's about
criminalizing behavior and it becomes
about creating a thoughtcrime mentality
so yes we can absolutely get around I've
no doubt that you know someone will
install Linux on one of these South
Carolina laptops okay look all the porn
I can meet um it's that that like the
DMCA you know the enforcement of that
policy means that you have now
technically broken the law however
sillier and insignificant that law might
be whatever the the the financial
obligations you know paying your your
dues to the the government that you've
wronged you know what you know what I
just thought of you know I just thought
of so the bill applies to Internet
connected devices that you know can any
computer smartphone tablet whatever I'm
thinking that there's going to be a new
market for hard drives full of porn
binders for the women
yeah like that well you know if it
becomes the Underground Railroad of
sharing smut I don't know I've got a
couple little thumb drives and portable
hard drives I will happily I will
happily submit to the to the cause from
Panzers II I like drinking coffee which
is an addictive chemical meaning I am a
drug cartel leader hashtag there I mean
but that's just it you know like there
there are certain religious aspects of
our society that don't disagree with
that sentiment that any type of
substance like that which is
mind-altering to whatever degree means
that you're some sort of depraved
individual hey from I deal with
chemicals too I deal with I deal with
the chemistry bad chemistry like I'm
water oh you got to watch out for the
dihydrogen monoxide I hear that stuff's
brutal from Ed maudlin most politicians
are doing anything but watching out for
that without benefits of donations yeah
you know this this to me
the fact that they're conflating public
you know protecting the public with you
know sex trafficking yeah that that this
is their slippery slope argument just
feels like something out of reefer
madness it doesn't it's one of those
things we're all gonna laugh at it and
no one's really gonna take it seriously
and so it's it for people who feel like
oh well maybe you shouldn't install crap
on my computer to block my porn that's
like you know number 53 on their list of
things that they care about but for
people who really do believe that this
is you know like aw if we can block porn
that means gonna make our society so
much safe derp it's like number three on
their list of things that they care
about so they're much more apt to be for
it the people who are for it are much
more apt to join in the discussion
however misguided that discussion might
be as opposed to the people who are
against it because then there's also the
notion of shaming that individual but
you watch porn you're sick you know like
it's not that I'm defending the
consumption of porn it's that I'm
defending my right to do what I want
with my technology and not have an
outside force tell me what is acceptable
to consume and what isn't within of
course the reasons of the laws it
currently stands and the boundaries of
good taste as I see fit as a grown-ass
individual to police my own content
thank you mmm yeah stand up for the
adults inside of us oh wait hey pander
see they already sell USB drives was
pretty loaded porn
um well props cause it's less drugs oh
is that like is is that like the the
video servers behind like a flashlight
or something it's coming out of a adult
DVD comso NSFW people I don't feel like
I'll be like because this conversation
is
above and beyond the scope of what we
normally talk about here on
pocketnow.com that's sort of the
political aspects of this I'm gonna keep
coming back to the same the same part of
the conversation where we've been
talking about net neutrality where we've
been talking about broadband competition
this is another one of those aspects I
kind of feel like we keep getting beaten
up politically and so every single time
we feel like we're exhausted it's gonna
make it that much easier for someone
with an agenda to sneak something like

to remain vigilant we need to remain a
part of the conversation and we need to
be the geeks need to be the people that
other people can turn to for some
insight and for some balanced discussion
on this stuff and so I hope so there you
