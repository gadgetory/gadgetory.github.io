Park geun-hye calm and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly where we review five applications
in 30 seconds each and these are some of
the best applications that we found on
the android market so let's get started
so this application is called antigen
and it is free on the android market and
the cool thing about this program is it
has a few different control styles that
you use you can either use an on-screen
d-pad you can use a trackball if you
have one on your device so let's get
started I'll show you how to play and
we'll just let it start and now I can
use this on screen d-pad to move my
antigen around and it's pretty simple
all you have to do is rotate your
antigen move it up or down this little
difficult on the table but as you see
this game is pretty awesome this
application is called bubble and it's
free on the android market a cool thing
about this application is it uses the x
y&amp;amp;z coordinates of the accelerometer to
get a very precise level measurement you
can also use the x and y coordinates to
get a generic bubble level so at 0
degrees I can do that I can also change
it up to 45 degrees if I want to
position something on an angle the cool
thing about this you can change some of
the settings by going to settings I can
change the background I can also show
the angle show pitch and many different
other features so this is the dictionary
com application it is free on the
android market it's a pretty powerful
dictionary as well as a thesaurus so if
i want to search for a word on here
let's say i want to search for I don't
know something simple like happy and
then I can just hit search under the
thesaurus it'll show me many different
synonyms as well as antonyms we can also
view our recent search history and get a
word of the day the cool thing about
this application is also speaks the word
to you okay
paper toss is a pretty fun time waster
game there's three separate levels easy
medium hard as well as three other areas
in which you can play your game the
airport basement and restrooms so let's
just go to easy and I'll show you how to
play this game crumpled out a piece of
paper and we have this fan here that
tries to direct our piece of paper out
of the angle that we want to send it at
so I'm going to shoot it over here and
hopefully it goes in the basket and
there it is and this application is free
on the android market The Weather
Channel application is free on the
android market in this pretty powerful
weather program you can get current
forecast as well as an hourly breakdown
at 36 hour breakdown and a 10-day
forecast this is pretty cool because
most applications only give a seven-day
forecast you can also go to the map it
and view your current cloud formations
as well as rainfall if you get this play
but another cool feature about this is
you can also go to map layers map points
my places and you can also go back and
add new locations and this has been
another episode of the android
application weekly in which we review
