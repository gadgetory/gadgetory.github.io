everyone rushes to review it then we
move on to the next new gadget but Halla
phone ages is probably more important
than that initial impression let's do
something about this let's take a second
look at one of the hottest smartphones
of 2016 here's our Samsung Galaxy s7
after the buzz now before anyone gets
too upset there are going to be a lot of
criticisms here but we'll start by
saying this is a fantastic phone we are
dealing with a premium priced device
though so small issues need to be
addressed with a more critical eye than
what we might tolerate from a mid-range
err now in my time with the s7 I haven't
had any dramatic issues like when Jaime
smashed his s7 edge I've only had one
small drop from waist height onto
concrete while the phone was out of the
case funnily this was during our initial
review since then this phone has lived
almost exclusively in a VRS bumper case
which is as good a time as any to
reiterate that while this is a
gorgeously designed device I still don't
find glass to be the most practical
material to use for the back of a gadget
that people depend on for daily use if
only for making the phone more slippery
to hold on to speaking of this design
the way Samsung very subtly tapers the
edges of the glass on the screen also
makes it difficult to throw on a glass
screen protector you always have this
lip that catches lint and dust but I
don't like plastic screen guards so this
is what we're left with our last point
talking about how the hardware has aged
this fingerprint sensor is really easy
to scuff up a couple of weeks into
fairly normal use with no intentional
torture testing this button already had
some scrapes if your phone occasionally
ends up in a pocket or a purse with keys
or other light accessories then you can
expect this piece of hardware to get
messed up over time now looking at
performance this galaxy has aged fairly
well I haven't wiped out the phone since
initially setting it up like most
computers it does seem to have slowed
down a bit given the number of apps and
the amount of data stored on the device
but this is most noticeable during boot
it takes this phone a while to warm up
now
like the hardware maybe the most
noticeably degraded area of performance
on our review unit is unlocking via the
fingerprint sensor there's a longer beat
now in between hitting the home button
and getting to your home screen
otherwise this remains a snappy
performer opposite phones using similar
hardware even for all of Samsung's
custom software though it will lose
fights to phones which come with leaner
roms and from here were largely back to
most of our assessments from our first
review the speaker and headphone
performance is disappointing for such an
expensive phone the battery life is
still above average for this 3000
milliamp hour capacity water resistance
is rad and this is likely the best
all-rounder camera for how most people
will want to use a smart phone camera no
other manufacturer can compete with this
focusing speed and accuracy this is
still our favorite display on any phone
released this year and we're still
impressed with Samsung's build cramming
a normal sized screen into a phone body
which starts to compete against small
form-factor phones
Samsung has had a rough couple of months
and we're still watching to see what the
note 7 fallout will bring over the next
fiscal quarters but using s Evan for a
little more than six months highlights
the fact that Samsung was on the right
track for refining this product lineup
makes it even more of a shame that one
phone could so easily tarnish the entire
galaxy brand would we still recommend
the galaxy s7 absolutely both
figuratively and literally this phone is
a safe Buy and we want to hear from you
has your Galaxy s7 held up over these
last six months are any of you affected
by the note 7 recall staying with the
Samsung brand drop us a comment below
