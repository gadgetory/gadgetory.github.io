bringing a triple camera for the lens
and we're hearing wide-angle if you are
in certain areas of the world you'll
probably be lucky to get even more
specification for the galaxy note 9 and
blackberry maybe cooking up something
with a lot of battery in it I'm Jaime
Rivera and it's been a week of pocket
now while the audio thank you so much
for all your support I am definitely
gonna celebrate and so should you it's
Friday
this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
that I'm still not really believing but
it's seems to be real Walmart has a
current option where you can get a
refurb iPhone S II in addition to a plan
from Straight Talk where you get up to 2
gigabytes and this just cost 85 bucks
and I've been reading the post I've been
trying to make sure that this is the
real deal so she you can learn more in
the description apparently it is now
let's talk about iPhones as you know
that I've never really been a fan of
iPhones with until modems for no reason
other than the fact that battery life is
not any better and connectivity is not
superior when compared to Qualcomm
modems we have reports that apparently
Intel hasn't lost the contract for
whenever 5g comes to the iPhone it seems
that Apple is currently shopping around
but then that's the thing apparently
that's not gonna have it until 2020 so
yeah those of you the one in 5g on your
iPhone it won't happen next year
apparently now let's talk about
blackberry the blackberry key 2 is still
one of my favorite phones regardless of
the things I didn't like about it in the
review for those of you wondering what
the company is up to next we have a
codename ghost being tipped by none
other than Evan blasts apparently what's
gonna make this phone special is the
battery 4000 milliamp hours on a
blackberry with all that power
efficiency is gonna be awesome but we'll
see if it happens now let's talk about
Samsung as we've got some weird rumors
that say country is like Netherlands and
Netherlands only it seems that the
Galaxy Note 9 will retail in that
country with an option for up to 8
gigabytes of RAM a 4000 milliamp power
battery and 512 gigabytes of storage and
apparently that's going to be the only
country we know that Samsung usually
launches a more powerful version in
Korea but we're trying to understand why
just the Netherlands Samsung please and
finally the hot news today has to do
with the Samsung Galaxy S 10 s 10 plus
and whatever the name of the other
variant is going to be we hear that
there are three phones single camera
dual cameras and then the third one
brings triple cameras but we try to
figure out what that third camera is for
according to some trusted source it'll
bring a wide-angle camera that could be
between 13 and 16 megapixel
123 degrees of field of view there won't
be any OIS or any of those party tricks
that we already get from LG but yeah it
is a wide-angle camera which is awesome
in my opinion and today's question let
me know I mean what options of camera
performance would you like to see for
the Galaxy S 10 because I don't know for
me wide-angle cameras are the most
useful they're not the best implemented
but they're the most useful in my
opinion leave us a comment down below we
would love to know your opinion friends
