possible hardware renders and
specifications Google's pixel see goes
official being that Android tablet that
people still fumble with and for some
odd reason we have a ton of deals you
should seriously consider I'm hi Mary
that and my Thursday was spent planning
eight videos for this week and recording
them how was yours this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
some deals that you should definitely
look at starting with the Google Nexus
5x as both Google and some of the
retailers are now offering the phone for
three hundred and thirty dollars that is
an amazing price tag for the Nexus 5x
considering what you're getting but if
you're also in the market for wearables
the Apple watch isn't that on sale at
bestbuy now now it's not only target now
you get a hundred dollars off not just a
gift card on best buy if you're also
looking for the Apple watch and we've
got some more deals in the links in the
description as well other official news
come from Microsoft as the company has
now taken Cortana to the next step when
it comes to its multi-platform
domination plans now you get it in iOS
and Android out of beta completely free
and obviously with all the benefits of
Cortana and for those of you wanting it
to launch on that deep integration with
cyanogenmod OS well that is apparently
going to be available for the oneplus
one very soon and we should keep you
posted as it continues evolving will
definitely be testing it out and for all
seven of you that are in the market for
an Android tablet even though we still
do not recommend these well the coolest
one we've ever seen which is the google
pixel see that was announced recently is
now available on the Google Play Store
499 bucks for this tablet plus 150
dollars if you want the keyboard and
just to give you an idea the tablet
without the keyboard just completely
loses purpose the keyboard is actually
what makes this tablet cool that whole
magnetic catching in addition to the
fact that you wirelessly charge it that
way but sadly the operating system even
marshmallow is still not fit for tablets
we don't know what Google's thinking
here then yes believe it or not we are
still covering official news here now as
apple launches iOS 9 point to the
company has been you know offering the
beta for developers for a while now
and so far if you saw the list of
changes and improvements that you're
getting here you'd think that iOS 9.1
was terrible because there are a ton of
stability improvements here but you also
get some added 3d touch features for
other apple applications and some extra
integration but again the list is so
long i would highly recommend you hit
the link in the description and just
update your software as soon as you can
and finally the very hot Noli rumors
today have to do with the one plus three
as a we get rumors for this phone and we
don't really expect for this device to
be launched any time soon i mean the 1+2
was barely launched a few months ago but
we here to rumors number one apparently
the Snapdragon 820 processor is going to
make an appearance here which makes all
the sense in the world but in addition
to that it seems that one plus is going
to stick with a 1080p display here and
you know what we're not going to blame
them for the price tag in the fact that
your pixel per inch density on 1080p
with that screen size is really not bad
at all I feel it makes all the sense in
the world but still we also have some
apparent renders that the source claims
to probably just be concept designs you
don't see many differences here these
are real and not concepts but hey it
leads me to the question of the day what
would you add to the 1+2 that you would
like to see on the one plus three in my
case well I really have to test either 1
plus yet I haven't really tested them
yet I was just like I don't know a
different design option probably but
leave us a comment down below what is
your case friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video was filmed
make sure you follow us on parking out
comment subscribe to channel as well it
