developers and it actually brings more
stuff than we expected to the iPhone
Apple finally approves yet another
native app that brings google voice to
iOS and Consumer Reports still won't
recommend the iphone spoon all this and
more coming up right now hello everybody
I'm hi Nevada and welcome to the pocket
nail I review the shore we go through
all the week's cool and not-so-cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
as always let's start off with the cool
well iOS 4.2 has recently been released
developers and even though a lot of the
stuff there has to do with iPad there
are some cool things coming into the
iphone and the iPod Touch first of all
you'll get airplay which will allow you
to stream content like video and audio
not just like airtunes in the past where
you can only stream audio this time you
can also stream video with an apple
products and also certain peripherals
like I don't know TVs stereos it all
depends on what you have and another
cool thing is that you'll actually get
wireless printing to work with iOS
devices other cool features coming into
iOS 4.2 is that for example you can now
vote thumbs up or thumbs down on YouTube
videos you'll also get FaceTime links on
messaging and you'll also get more
restrictions for example you can now
restrict that users don't delete an
application on your iOS device which is
cool for parental restrictions etc the
funny part about this release is that
it's already been jailbroken sadly this
jailbreak only works with the iphone 3gs
for now and it depends on what bootrom
you have if you remember that kamikaze
way of doing jail breaks in the past
where you needed a PC and it's not
really like the jailbreakme.com feature
that we feature recently but apparently
you know the funny part is hey it's
already jailbroken so this means the dev
team is working hard things are going
good let's see what happens as of now
iOS 4.2 has a couple of bugs nothing's
perfect but the developers community is
stating that it's really cool for now
let's see what happens
speaking of wireless printing it seems
some companies weren't willing to wait
for iOS 4.2 to be rolled out one of
these companies is epsilon which just
released an application in conjunction
with big stream called print genie I
know weird name I'm not really even sure
it came out right and it's not the gina
that we've known it's ji and an eye but
anyways the thing about this application
is if you have a Wi-Fi enabled epson
printer and you're willing to pay 10
bucks for the application which is
currently on sale 47 you'll actually get
wireless printing through the
application on your epson enabled
printer and that's pretty much it is it
worth the seven or ten bucks well that's
really up to you do you really need to
print is it really gonna drive epson
printer sales well you'll never know and
will it be worth it considering iOS 4.2
is coming up next well it depends on you
again so think about it at seven to ten
bucks it's already available on the App
Store and go for your purchase if it's
really necessary for your printing
lifestyle I mean it's really not that
case for me but anyways out of a shocker
thing that happened this week Apple
actually approved the google voice
native application to work on iOS
devices meeting the iphone and the ipod
touch why is this a shocker well you
remember there was an application to
past months ago called GV mobile that
was actually full from the app store for
offering google voice to iphones and an
apple for some reason just said they
weren't going to support it well it's
out there again GV connect is the new
name for the application but it offers
every feature that you'd be expecting
for google voice on your iOS device so
you now have an option to not have to be
using the web application the google
offers you know it can be sluggish to
the times it sometimes doesn't work so
it costs three dollars it's not free but
again it's another option for the web
application if you don't want to be
using the sluggish version of the google
offers currently so let's see what
happens let's see if it continues
lasting and let's hope Apple doesn't
pull the plug again you know I debated
whether to leave this on the cool
section or not but the good thing is the
not-so-cool seconds coming so bear with
me here you remember the case program
for the iphone force ending on September
30th so that is definitely not cool but
the good thing about this is if you
remember
past I review we mentioned the telus old
manager in Mexico actually mentioned
that he was going to get a new batch of
iphone 4 devices as a September 30th
that would not have the antenna gain
issues so what could this mean could it
mean that actually as of September 30th
we're not going to get any more iphone
4s with antenna gate issues could be
just the rumor so let's see what happens
let's start off with the not-so-cool
let's continue talking about the case
program ending on September 30th and
let's talk about consumer reports not
recommending the iphone 4 again yeah you
know you remember that part where
consumer reports for said they would
recommend the iphone 4 is the best
smartphone out there and then a couple
of weeks later they would come up saying
no we're not going to recommend it
because of the antenna gate issues and
they would offer for you to use duct
tape which we're not going to use but to
be honest Consumer Reports is right you
shouldn't have to use a case for the
phone to work and that's how Apple
actually deals with it as of a September
30th let's see what happens that's it
for today's I review thank you very much
for watching any questions your comments
you have about this video let us know
what twitter.com slash pocket now tweets
are youtube.com slash crocodile video
that's it for now
