or stolen phone or because you want to
save your data and save yourself some
time in the future backing up your phone
is important I'm Taylor Martin this is
pocket now and these are a few solutions
for how you can backup your iPhone one
of the most notable features of iOS is
iCloud it is the stock backup software
that comes free of charge from Apple it
backs up things like mail notes
reminders and even your pictures to a
photo stream that you can access from
your computer you can also sync Safari
tabs of bookmarks across all of your
devices if you have a cloud enabled at
night when you plug your phone up and
connect it to Wi-Fi backups will perform
automatically it will back up all of the
applications and information on your
phone to an online account that you can
restore from later if your phone is
stolen lost or even if you're just
upgrading to a new iPhone from within
the iCloud settings you can manage your
storage and all your different backups
and you can see how recently your
devices have been backed up if you want
to delete a backup and start over it's
as simple as navigating to that device
and selecting delete backup one of the
downsides to iCloud is that it ties you
into apples ecosystem you can't take
your information using iCloud elsewhere
you can only restore it to iPhones or
iPads or iPods using contact backup
applications that are a plenty in the
App Store you can export your
information to csv or vcard files so you
can import to a google account or any of
your other accounts that you may have
they also allow you to merge any
duplicates and further manage your
contacts versus what the stock contacts
application allows the most common
complaint about photostream is that it
only stores the most recent 1000
pictures or pictures from the last 30
days and the fact that those pictures
can only be accessed from another Apple
device I use the instant upload feature
from Dropbox to upload all of the
pictures from a camera roll directly to
dropbox without all the limitations on
how i can access them or how many are
stored another option for backing up
photos is google plus it has an instant
upload feature as well that upload your
pictures directly to a picasa account
which is free and those pictures can be
shared immediately with your friends on
google+ staying within the Google
ecosystem you can all
so upload files to your Google Drive
account it accepts spreadsheets
documents PDFs photos and videos you
have a limit of 5 gigabytes but the
service comes free of charge it's worth
noting that I cloud is not specific to
the iphone you can also use it on an
ipad or an ipod and you can sync your
information between your idevices using
iCloud you can sync your notes your
reminders mail and everything else I
cloud offers between those devices with
relative ease take a note on your iPhone
and you will see it on your iPad after
the sink completes all of the other
services I mentioned in this video also
work really well with the iPad Google+
Google Drive and Dropbox that keep all
your documents and pictures secure but
help share them across multiple
platforms you can use all of these with
android or windows and you don't have to
stick to apples tight-knit ecosystem the
downside to iOS and backing up is that
there aren't a ton of third-party
solutions you have icloud and itunes but
you can't use a third-party service to
create an image of your device and pick
up where you left off should anything
come up you can really only use Dropbox
and other third-party applications to
back up some documents and pictures but
nothing really major like applications
or system data if you found this video
