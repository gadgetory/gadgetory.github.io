hardware around but what about the mid
tier I'm Joe Levi with pocket now this
is the htc desire 816 versus the HTC One
mini - HTC makes some great high-end
devices and we gave the One m8 one of
the highest scores that we've ever given
a device but that's a flagship phone
what about the mid tier luckily HTC has
us covered there as well in more ways
than one when diving to the middle HTC
had a couple ways it could go to keep
the price of the device down one option
was to make the device smaller the other
was to drop the specifications or a
little bit of both we already told you
what we think of the htc desire 816 in
our full review a mid to your phone with
flagship DNA similarly we've already
given the HTC One mini to the royal
treatment as well petite luxury for a
price how do these two mid tier siblings
stack up the first and most obvious
difference is size the desire weighs in
at 165 grams but somehow manages not to
feel particularly heavy in hand just big
you'd expect the one mini to to feel
smaller it does and it doesn't at the
same time the Mini is thicker than the
desire but it doesn't really feel that
way thanks to the gentle curve that hugs
your palm it's the height and the width
of the mini that stand in stark contrast
to the desire compared to each other the
mini lives up to its name however with a
four and a half inch screen the mini
isn't all that mini at all it's fairly
large in fact it's on par with both the
Nexus 5 and the Moto X both the desire
and the mini have 720p screens but
thanks to the smaller size of the mini
it wins out in picture quality 326 PPI
compared to the desires 267
both have front firing boomsound
speakers that are loud and clear
both are powered by a modest quad-core
Snapdragon 400 the mini is clocked at
1.2 gigahertz with one gig of ram
compared to the desires 1.6 gigahertz
with one-and-a-half gig ram their
cameras are both decent but not great
there are 13 megapixel shooters that do
well in good lighting but fall short in
the shadows
both are LTE capable but they both shrug
the 5 gigahertz spectrum and AC support
when it comes to Wi-Fi other than size
the software both run look almost
identical when it really comes down to
is build quality screen size and price
there's no doubt the 1 Mini 2 is better
built than the desire a 16 the mini is
solid and has just the right amount of
heft to it the design rate 16 is
slippery squeaky and attracts more
fingerprints than one would imagine
could be possible
although the desire is clocked a little
faster and has more RAM it seems to
respond just a little slower than the
mini now you won't notice the difference
in everyday use but it's there the
screen is really where most of your
attention will be focused with the same
number of pixels your deciding factors
will either be sharpness or the size of
the screen with the two being mutually
exclusive in this comparison
neither one looks bad but if you want
something big you want the desire
whereas if you want something sharp the
mini is the one for you lastly there's
price the mini costs around a hundred
pounds more than the desire is the build
quality really work that much probably
not but if you're looking for a mid tier
device either the HTC One mini 2 or the
desire 816 would suit you well
more on the desire 816 a whole bunch of
sample photos benchmark and battery
