the Motorola 1 and the 1 power with two
major Android updates guaranteed and
three years of security updates this is
definitely a very enticing offering for
Motorola this is TK for a pocket now and
xD 801 devices are generally running
unmodified versions of Android and
managed directly from Google roll
announced yesterday two different
variants the Motorola one and the one
power although intended for different
markets both definitely mid-range
devices with great specifications under
the hood the Motorola 1 supports a
snapdragon 625 SOC with a 5.9 inch
display and a 464 configuration as far
as RAM and storage there's also a 332
variant as well the Motorola 1 power has
a Snapdragon 636 with a 6.2 inch display
with a 464 configuration and dual
sensors in the back
now the best part of these devices is
not necessarily just the software or
even the hardware it's the fact that the
support that we're getting with this
device for the next three years starting
mid-september when these devices are
released they're guaranteed to major
Android updates which means pretty much

able to get Android PI on this we'll
also be able to enter get Android q

years of security patch updates
guarantee all the familiar features of
the twist and chop are still present

managed by google motorola still has the
ability of putting a little bit of a
motorola touch to those updates as well
