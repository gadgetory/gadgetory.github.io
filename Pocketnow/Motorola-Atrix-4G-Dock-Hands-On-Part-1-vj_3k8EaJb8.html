now we're taking a look at this motorola
device that plugs into the atrix you're
going to be using it for
with me kind of see how it works plug it
in here the Tegra 2
dual-core processor and
the wife of ram really shows its glory
so we have here is kind of a folio like
really folio done right so it kind of
looks a little bit like OS 10 and so
what you have down here is a dock on the
right side you can access the web here
goes on Firefox and on the left side of
this line here you get sort of the phone
functions are there so you can sort of
use the phone as like a little virtual
point here this is actually
you've got these virtual buttons on the
bottom so you can do things that may
cause you can browse the end market
gotta use your phone is issue that we're
really right there and even go
fullscreen you can rotate this is really
important and then go fullscreen I don't
see how the focus is really a really
interesting it naturally
blurry but not too bad so the idea here
is that this is a mobile workstation you
so we're going to go to Firefox here and
got pocket now are you voted multiple
tabs this is real firefighters and so we
can scroll down on the page but this is
all being streamed from the phone
yes Stefan phone can
but it's it's pretty darn about I mean
you're running a full-fledged firefox
browser here and
off of the even get a little pop-ups
here so they have a new email I'm their
name in the left corner
you can balance back to the phone at any
time of course by tapping the doc thing
at the top there there is a phone or by
hitting that the doc on the bottom right
so really just a minute to sort of
browse the web in a more fuller glory
and to get access to your phone on a
bigger screen and it works
we're pretty darn well let's see here
tab
you can hear that this is going to be
announced
open up a few tabs and I'm sure that it
would perform pretty well
closeouts
program Firefox we should be taken back
to desktop
little bit a little bit laggy
quit okay doesn't wanna do it other
brothers did we got down here we've got
file manager the tap on that it's going
to let you access the file manager on
your on your atrix kind of like a nice
clean boot file explorer type view
we've got a link to Facebook down here
and a bunch of shortcuts we can add
items to the dock
and that is this
laptop polio red fly style thing
actually gonna surround now you can see
on the screen says disconnected
we're proud of here from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
