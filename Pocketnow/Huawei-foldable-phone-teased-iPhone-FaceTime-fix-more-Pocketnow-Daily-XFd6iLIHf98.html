foldable smartphone during MWC as pretty
much the invitation confirms this an
official Samsung Galaxy F video and
Galaxy S 10 leaked images show both
devices in their full glory and nokia
has also started the senate advice from
the bc and hopefully we get the phone
that we're looking for I'm Jaime Rivera
and Diego's joke for today is that to
avoid spending cash on Valentine's Day
just go single dad joke this is market
out daily the official news today begin
with product launches and deals to a
certain degree those of you looking for
an affordable gaming phone the new via
magic Mars is now available in certain
regions and the specs are crazy starting
at 6 ago bytes it's a 399 I believe and
then 549 if you go for the 10 gig of ram
and more storage option and obviously
this is a gaming phone it's not the best
one out there but it's a very powerful
phone regardless now let's talk about
Apple we've got reports that the company
has finally figured out the whole bug
with FaceTime where your FaceTime call
would pretty much activate itself
without you knowing it and obviously has
left everybody skeptical on privacy when
it comes to Apple so expect an update
according to the source as of next week
I'm still gonna disable face times
period now let's talk about Nokia as hmd
has sent out press invitations for an
event on February 24th we don't know
exactly what we're getting and the
invite doesn't provide any sort of
teasers whatsoever all we know is that
it's in Barcelona we're gonna be there
and that we're hoping that it's the
Nokia 9p review we're hoping that this
phone is real after so many leaks and so
many rumors we'll see and now let's move
the spotlight over to Samsung as there
was an official video shown in Vietnam I
believe that was then pulled and
obviously you gotta love the Internet
the video is back another source now and
well it shows a lot of what the feature
is going to be according to Samsung and
so one of these images shows the
foldable smartphone being used by
somebody so I'm not saying that this is
the design of the galaxy f particularly
because everything else in that video is
not existent right now so does that mean
that we're not getting a foldable
product that's ready for the
mainstream until the future or what you
never know and finally the hottest news
that I have to do with Huawei and
foldable products because this company
is up sending out press invitations for
an event that of the BC February 24th
and it's got a V in it and that'd be
really much states that we're getting a
foldable product now it's very hard to
predict if this is gonna be again a
final product or not we're definitely
gonna be covering everything live but in
today's question let us know I mean what
are your thoughts on foldable products
lately I mean we've got so many
companies trying to showcase things and
in my case the only way that I would
care is if I do get that razor phone
from moto but that's just me leave us a
comment down below we looked in on your
opinion friends again if you want to get
