but for us in the tech world it means
the start of something important we call
it review season I'm heading that way
pocket now and let's begin by unboxing
the HTC u ultra I honestly think the
concept of unboxing videos was born with
HTC products mainly because back in the
day unboxing an HTC made pocket VC meant
a full experience we've seen HTC fumble
with the concept over time given its
difficulties remaining afloat but it
seems the HTC u ultra approves the
company has returned to its roots the
you old truck comes in the same flat
square with rounded corners that we've
seen since the times of the HTC One the
top of the box shows the product and the
gold engraving and the bottom shows the
full list of specifications you're
buying into as you slide the box from
the bottom you get the device on the
left and below it are some rather
unusual suspects unusual because first
of all I can't remember the last time
HTC shipped the phone with the case and
wow you even get a chamois here there's
also a sub ejector tool a USB type-c
cable a quick charge 3.0 wall adapter
and forgive by surprise yet again but we
even get the HTC high-res earphones with
USBC connector in the box
something that will cost you a hundred
dollars alone in some stores so yes just
for the unboxing experience alone HTC
clearly wants the position this phone at
the high-end but then that fully gets
confirmed when you hold this device for
the first time
I'm glad to see that we receive the
sapphire blue variant for our review
period honestly my favorite color after
our briefing in Vegas they'll be kind of
a nightmare to film but it's just hard
to not be dazzled by its looks the back
looks like if it's the gentleman and
alternative from certain competitors but
it's actually full glass mounted on an
aluminum trim and it seems to have some
sort of a coating to suppress the
smudges from initial touch so obviously
that's going to be hard to keep that way
but there's the include case to help
with that surely I'm not a fan of cases
like one is but then when you have a
camera hub this large the case actually
helps improve the experience while
putting this filler on a table so far my
first impressions are wow this phone is
beautiful it is unapologetically large
but that's something that I actually
like as this allows the phone to have
this commanding feel to it of course
this is just video one of many we still
have to set it up and start a round of
coverage so expect more information on
the HTC u ultra as we begin getting
acquainted over the next few days while
you're at it make sure you follow us on
social media and hit that subscribe

thumbs up if you like what you saw I am
a metal even uh thanks so much for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
