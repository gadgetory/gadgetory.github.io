at CES but Japanese smartphone maker
Freetail is at MWC 2016 with few
unlocked smartphones destined for the
u.s. from Barcelona I'm Michael Fisher
with pocket now let's take a look
besides the fact that it's bringing it's
unlocked offerings to the US complete
with support for North American LTE
bands 12 and 17 I was attracted to the
Freetail booth because of its diversity
of offerings in addition to the usual
Android slabs there were a couple
Windows Mobile devices on display and
you'd know I'm a sucker for these folks
a clamshell smartphone with dual
displays running android 5.1 this is
called the musashi and like most of
these weirdo models it's meant to help
convert the 40% of people still using
flip feature phones in Japan into
smartphone users Freetail was a little
dodgy on this but apparently it does
intend to introduce this phone to the US
market or at least make it available for
sale this spring and when it does it
should have a Western keypad for those
in search of something a little more
conventional to Freetail kiwami is a
high-end Android device for the power
users out there kowambe means maximum or
ultimate and you'll find most of the
usual specs here to support that the big
six inch quad HD display three gigs of
ram 3400 milliamp hour battery and a
fingerprint scanner beneath a 21
megapixel camera like all Freetail
phones it's powered by a mediatek
processor
I couldn't pin down anything more
specific but it's an octa-core model the
coulomb II will be priced at 389 in the
US the phone that's been getting the
most press because it's the newest one
is a little more modest named the ray
it's a 5.2 inch full HD smartphone with
an aluminum casing with diamond cut
edges frankly there's not much in terms
of visuals to make it stand out but it's
lightweight comfortable to use with one
hand and Freetail cells it will launch
with android marshmallow when it debuts
in late q - that's the launch timeframe
for free tells entire first wave of
offerings in the US by the way the
current plans include the kwame and
mid-range priori models rolling out
first followed by the Musashi and ray at
some later date other models including
the Windows 10 units are still a
question
mark further details as we get them and
a full reviews are coming to stay tuned
we've got plenty of unlocked smartphones
from plenty of countries here at MWC
