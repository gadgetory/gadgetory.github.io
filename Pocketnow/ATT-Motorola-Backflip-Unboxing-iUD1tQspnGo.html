pocket now calm and this is the unboxing
of the motorola backflip this is a tease
first android phone finally it has a
really interesting form factor it's got
a keyboard that actually starts on the
other side of the device it also doubles
as a sort of trackpad so we want to talk
about that in a future video but let's
get to the unboxing and compare it to
some other devices okay so here we are
very small nice little box and says
please don't text and drive let's look
at the back and see what they say in
terms of specs this android of course
version 1.5 not 2.1 which is the latest
obviously has Wi-Fi and UMTS can expand
up to 32 gigabytes with the memory slot
it's got a three point one inch hvga
screen so that's the same as the iphone
4 80 down and 320 across okay let's uh
let's take a look at the moto backflip
pretty interesting box here kind of
unusual so this kind of will goes this
way have a quick start guide in color
that talks about some of the keys on the
keyboard pretty cool have to take a look
at that later here's the device will
pull that aside for a minute let's see
what AT&amp;amp;T has included in the box the
standard charger which hooks up to the
USB port there we have a jack which is
probably microUSB nice to see we have I
have no idea what this is seems to be
some sort of alternative backing for the
device will have to look at that later
and finally a battery which is of size
thirteen hundred and eighty milliamp
hours and we have some other information
on the bottom of the box so let's push
this all side and take a look at the
back flip so don't text and drive
eighteen t wants you to not do that
which makes a lot of sense it's pretty
dangerous so here we are pretty small
device on the front a 3.1 inch screen
the iphone of course is 3.2 inches the
touch pro two is three point six inches
we have three buttons down here pretty
smooth flush front of the device pretty
nice on the back here we have the
keyboard it's very uncommon
to see the keyboard actually on the back
of the device and this is why they
called the backflip because it comes
forward like this and then you type from
here apparently also this area doubles
as a touch pad so that you can actually
operate the device I think this is how
supposed to work from the back we'll
talk about that later let's compare the
backflip to some other devices here we
have it next to the HTC touch pro2 let's
compare the keyboards very very
different style keyboards the keyboard
on the back flip is a lot more kind of
flat and the letters aren't aligned in a
staggered design as you'll find on the
touch pro two more very more so
grid-like we also have the camera
embedded within the keyboard that is
extremely unusual and it looks like
there's a little flash there let's take
a look at it next to the palm pre plus
on verizon very very different keyboard
designs next to another Android device
the google nexus one which has a
significantly larger screen and of
course it doesn't have a keyboard it's
also a lot thinner than the then the
backflip the backflip is quite thick i
must say feels quite thick in hand and
next to the iphone also has a much
smaller screen and is thicker the
motorola backflip has the motoblur
interface that rests on top of android
so it's really targeted to be well
integrated with social network so i'm
going to talk a lot about that interface
coming up in future videos so that'll do
it for the unboxing of the motorola
backflip we've got a lot more to say
about this device we're going to talk
about the software more about the
hardware the sort of touchpad on the
back and really the experience that this
device brings as the first Android
device on AT&amp;amp;T will be back soon with
more that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
