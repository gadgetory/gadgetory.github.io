one of the things I've noticed about
newer androids is the battery icon isn't
always indicative of the actual state of
charge in the battery now I don't know
why that is I've got some theories but
what I'd like to show you is an app that
we found that puts a widget on your home
screen that shows you the real
percentage and color codes it with the
state of charge it's really nice a
really good way to find out how much
battery life you've got let's go look
okay this is a one by one widget called
quick battery it's available for free in
the android marketplace and it's
something that's a little bit more
unique than a lot of battery apps and
that is it doesn't really take much
power self I mean it's kind of funny a
lot of the apps that monitor battery
state use a lot of power to run well
this one doesn't and it's kind of neat
not only that but it's got one other
feature and that is that you can tap on
it to launch a pre-configured app or the
developer wants you to see here he's got
this other app which is called quick
settings that he'd like you to download
and install and run it from there well I
haven't done that but i have installed
the app so let me go back to my home
screen and we'll drop it on right here
in an empty spot just like normal long
press on the home screen hit widgets and
we're going to scroll all the way down
to quick battery right there tap on it
and it asks you what style you wan has
various different styles i like this
alternative one activity to launch well
you can program that to pretty much
anything you want featured activities in
here battery use etc and then other
activities are apps and whatnot so you
can literally tap on it to launch any
app so if you just want to see what the
battery life is but not take up the real
estate with a non tappa Bulai con or
something that's just going to take you
to battery life or whatever you can do
that too and then he's got a quick link
here to download this quick settings app
so we're going to say done and i'll move
this right down here and you can see now
i know a couple of you have complained
the past that I've run videos with a
relatively low state of charge on my
battery and today don't get upset I
remember and I'm trying to run all these
videos with a full charge just for those
few vocal minority out there that the
like full batteries but today I ran it
down deliberately and that so you can
see I've got a twenty-nine percent
charge on my battery now if you look up
here in the status bar it looks like
I've got half a battery so graphically
about fifty percent versus just under
thirty percent that's a fairly big
difference if I've been running for say
six eight hours then i would expect just
by looking at this that I've got another
six or eight hours left of the same type
of usage that I've already put into it
but obviously I don't now this indicator
will drop off rather quickly the bottom
half empties out faster than the top
half it seems and I don't know if that's
because it's not as important to run on
a full state of charge as some might
think so manufacturers are trying to
make it look like there's more battery
life or for some other reason i don't
know maybe we're looking like an AT&amp;amp;T
iPhone charge excuse me a antenna
strength indicator where the algorithm
might be off just a little bit but this
is what's being reported back from the
Android operating system itself so it's
pretty not an accurate know if Android
says that that's what it is that's what
it is so looking at it right there it's
pretty easy to see now what I need to do
here obviously is charged up because I'm
getting down into the lower percentile
but I can take this move it around
anywhere I want on this screen just like
a one by one widget it's free it's
lightweight it looks pretty good I'm
really impressed with it and it's
something that will help you augment
that little not entirely correct
indicator up in the bar now one last
thing and that's this is the sprint
samsung epic 4g the complaint about
these battery charges and this indicator
being off seem to be affecting all of
the galaxy s phones and i haven't seen
anything where Samsung is aware of the
issue or even if they've
knowledge the issue but if you've got
one of the galaxy s phones whether
that's the epic 4g a vibrant captivate
an i 9000 or fascinate if you've got one
of those and you want to get a little
bit better battery indication download
this it's really fast it's really
inexpensive and you can't get much
better than free from the android
marketplace so take you right back there
so you can see it it's called quick
battery it's the app that we're
featuring today and if you've got other
apps that you think are indispensable
I'd like to know go ahead and leave me
comments give the video a thumbs up if
you'd like to see more of these helpful
widget type videos and as always make
sure you subscribe to the pocket now
video channel because if you don't you
might miss out on some of this cool
stuff so for pocket now i'm joe levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
