this is the first mobile phone that
Marshall has done it's an Android 5.0
point 2 lollipop device it runs a
snapdragon 410 is for 2 gigs of ram 4.7
inch 720p screen but the real focus of
this phone is audio so as you will see
you have two inputs or two jacks these
can be input or output side this could
be a microphone or microphone and a
headphone and then of course you have
the M button which is a dedicated button
that gives you access to all your
players now there's a few features but I
think what we want to highlight is the
global EQ so what's happening at the
moment is that Spotify is EQ built-in
Mixcloud dozen your local player might
not so we thought that this shouldn't be
a problem for consumers they should have
the same EQ no matter what they listen
to you so you're listening to this and
then let's say you're switching from
Spotify to maybe your local music and
then you will still have exactly the
same EQ so the cool thing is a consumer
doesn't have to worry about what's
available on the app that they're
downloading the other thing that we have
is we have the Marshall community which
gives you access to a lot of music based
on your genre and your location so if
you're in the Tallahassee and you listen
to hip-hop it will give you fees about
that music so it's not strictly for
people that are into rock and roll but
it is for music lovers with a maybe a
focus a little bit on alternative
lifestyle
the other thing that's interesting is
you will see we have this white this
white lining and it's actually the
screen is recessed so if you ever have a
flat impact the siding will actually
absorb all the
one of the great things is because the
device is quite stock we can work
closely with Android to keep the device
updated it's available in Europe at the
moment it's not available in States yet
that we are talking to operators so it's
now just a matter of making sure that
it's supported by the operators there
