much-anticipated update to the iOS
interface I'm Taylor Martin this is
pocket now and this is a walkthrough of
Iowa seven gold master edition we've
said it for years now Apple's iOS was in
need of a facelift and not just any
facelift an extensive one that visually
put it on par with its rapidly updated
competition iOS which debuted in 2007
still uses the same old interface with
minor changes that have been made along
the way such as the ability to apply a
wallpaper Notification Center and the
task switching menu in just one week
that changes unless you've been running
the beta since June on sep tember 18
apple will push its massive iOS 7 update
to the public for compatible devices
which consists of the iphone for a newer
ipad to a newer ipad mini and fifth
generation iPod so what's new what's
different from before visually almost
everything has changed starting with the
lock screen it has been given a much
cleaner appearance it no longer looks
cluttered and small but is now much
lighter in welcoming you can slide to
unlock from anywhere on the screen and
the camera quick access is still in the
lower right corner but blends nicely
with the rest of the UI you may also
notice two bars on the lock screen that
weren't there before in June on beta 1
these were arrows that pointed towards
the center of the display paired with
the subtle flashing text that reads
slide to unlock it was somewhat
confusing as if sliding up would unlock
the phone but these are no longer arrows
and it's a lot less ambiguous sliding to
unlock is clearly done by sliding from
left to right and the top and bottom
bars are for something else entirely the
top is for a much cleaner and more
useful Notification Center which is now
tabbed with a today section all and
missed like the rest of the UI it's
slightly transparent giving it the
appearance of layers almost as if you're
pulling a glass pane down to look at
your notifications the bottom bar is
something completely new to iOS control
center users have longed for a quicker
way to access and toggle settings for as
long as we can remember an apple did so
in a beautiful manner pull up from the
bottom of the display anywhere control
center allows toggles for airplane mode
Wi-Fi Bluetooth do not disturb and
rotation lock it is a slider for
brightness music control
blows air drop and shortcuts to the
camera calculator timer and a flashlight
toggle if you have a pen set you will
also see the new pen lock page which
looks similar to the dialer with its
circular dial pad like control center in
Notification Center this page is also
slightly transparent lending to the
illusion of working in layers once you
slide past the lock screen you will
quickly notice just how much has changed
about the appearance of iOS every stock
icon has been updated flattened and
given a cleaner look pay close attention
and you may also notice that not all the
icons are static the status bar is now
fully transparent the signal indicator
is a series of five circles instead of
the standard five bars and the battery
indicator has changed as well oh and the
new color palette is difficult to miss
Iowa certainly wasn't Dolan colors
before and it most definitely isn't now
before the colors were very tame and
mild now their vivid vibrant neon and
with the translucence everything seems
to match whatever color scheme your
wallpaper promotes speaking of
wallpapers iOS now offers dynamic
wallpapers which are basically no
different from live wallpapers on
Android however the static wallpapers
stock or your own are given a subtle 3d
effect when you change the angle of the
phone the wallpaper shifts in the
opposite direction to create the
illusion that the icons hover just above
the wallpaper folders have also been
changed only 9 icons appear at a time
yet now folders are paginated removing
the 16 application limit we can't say
however that swiping through a series of
pages within a folder is much more
useful you may also notice that
spotlight search is no longer accessed
by swiping one page to the left of the
leftmost homescreen the icon simply
bounce back and nothing happens to
access spotlight you now must pull down
on the homescreen a nice subtle
necessary tweak spotlight was never
worthy of an entire page to itself even
the Settings app and the app store look
entirely different with a new clean
white space interface they're the same
as before but they incorporate newer
cleaner buttons and the new gestures if
you navigate to a submenu or an
application page in either application
or any updated application for that
matter a gentle flick from the left edge
to the right will take you back to the
previous
page and all the buttons from the share
button to the pop-up menus have been
simplified with narrow typeface and
simple line icons speaking of the share
button it now reveals a more in-depth
sharing menu which includes airdrop and
separated sharing options and actions
the keyboard no longer has a dark grey
background it's now light gray to match
the rest of the OS and it too is flat
that said you will remain to see the old
keyboard in applications that have yet
to be updated the task switching menu
accessed by a double tap of the home
button is also new like other operating
systems it utilizes a car do I which
gives a preview of the current status of
the app and the open apps can be
dismissed by flicking the card up in
serie also accessed with the home button
has a new transparent UI as well the
camera application has to changed and be
given a few more options like a one to
one aspect ratio for taking pictures for
Instagram as well as real-time filters
and shooting mode but overall the camera
app is very simplistic without a ton of
built-in functionality all of the stock
applications such as reminders calendar
clock notes phone Safari context
calculator in everything else has been
flattened and streamlined with a new
design language but there's a final
point worth noting in all of these
changes there is one thing that hasn't
really been updated at all iOS sure it
looks different but it's virtually the
exact same operating system it has been
all along with no new ground-breaking or
inspiring features for some that's
perfectly fine others however aren't
satisfied with the purely cosmetic
changes that's going to wrap this video
