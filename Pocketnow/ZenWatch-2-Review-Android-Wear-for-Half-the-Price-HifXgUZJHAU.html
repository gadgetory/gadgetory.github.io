watchmaker is emphasizing style over
smarts for their second generation
wearables a soos is going another way
the company's newest SmartWatch has some
style but its main claim to fame is
delivering a solid Android wear
experience for half the price of the
competition
i'm michael fisher with pocket now let's
see what it's all about in our video
review of the isuzu watch - as you may
recall from our hands on at Aoife 2015
in berlin the zen watch 2 comes in two
sizes the one we're reviewing here is
the larger trim and while it's slimmer
than both its cousin and most of the
competition it's also substantially
bigger on its face it's kind of a big
square pancake of a watch if your wrists
are more slender you'll definitely want
to go for the smaller option despite its
added girth and thicker bezels does n
watch to make some compromises when
compared to its more expensive circular
competition removable though it is the
entry-level watch band is rubber
instead of leather the crown button
doesn't offer much mechanical feedback
and the back plate though pockmarked by
plenty of casing penetrations doesn't
feature the heart rate sensor that's
become something of a standard on
Android wear watches on the flip side is
where the Zen watch 2 gets the chance to
shine under the gorilla glass 3 sits a
320 by 320 display with a pixel density
of 277 pixels per inch that slots it in
slightly below the Huawei watch but
above the larger moto 360 second
generation at 1.6 three inches you're
probably not going to be able to tell
minut differences in resolution but you
will be impressed by the brightness and
contrast of this AMOLED panel as sue
showcases that display with a wide
variety of watch faces in 24 were
pre-installed on our demo device
there's no ambient light sensor here so
you have to adjust brightness manually
but that's common to most Android
wearables at this point the software
experience is a familiar one Android
wear 1.3 is powered here by a Snapdragon
400 processor and a half gig of ram
pretty standard and also standard is the
4 gigs of storage for music in terms of
responsiveness it's about average
with occasional stutters and dropped
frames in animation keep in mind we saw
the same thing on the new moto 360
though so this is less an indication of
hardware trouble than quirks of the
Android wear platform itself and those
quirks show themselves in other areas as
well like the card flip gestures that
only work when they want to it seems
like and voice command that does the
same it's working well in this shot but
that's because we had a camera on it
where the Zen watch to specifically
falls a little short is in these random
Bluetooth disconnections this happens on
every Android wear device the watch just
occasionally disconnects for no reason
but you'd think that this would have
been fixed after over a year on the
market whereas soos has differentiated
it's done so mainly on the phone
software side download the Zen watch
manager and you're prompted to pick up a
bunch of companion apps ranging from the
fitness tracking wellness suite to the
remote camera app we saw demonstrated in
Berlin this is surprisingly fully
featured to let you control the flash
and switch cameras toggle between photos
and video and you can capture shots
using either a tap or a wrist flick it
also gives you a live view finder
preview while you're doing it there are
a few nice surprises further down the
list - like a phone helper that brings
some of your smartphone's feature
toggles over the watch and though only
some of them seem to work at least on
our galaxy s6
fortunately the SOS function does better
this sends a custom text message to an
emergency contact of your choice with
just one tap it would be nice if this
feature could be wired into the button
instead but those functions are all used
up with the menu theater mode and
brightness boost shortcuts in everyday
use the Zen watch 2 performs its basic
functions well notifications come in
with a strong but brief buzz and the
watch can handle everything from
dishwashing to a brisk autumn swim
thanks to its ip67 water and dust
resistance the larger addition packs a
400 milliamp hour battery which usually
lasts us about one and a half days on a
charge and it's easy to top-up using the
included magnetic charging cable the
smaller version carries a 300mm power
pack so it'll probably need to be
replenished a bit more often but in
either case you're going to want to
charge each of these every night
a Seuss's strategy with the Zen watch -
is basically the same as it was last
year and it's pretty easily summed up
deliver reasonably good looks and solid
features for half the price it's this
value proposition that really stands out
sometimes it feels like smartwatches are
enjoying a bit of a bubble in this crazy
world of 300 to $800 smartwatches a soos
feels like one of very few companies
actually charging a reasonable price for
this accessory even if you spring for
the extra 20 bucks and get the leather
bands being offered by Best Buy or the
smaller more expensive model this n
watch 2 is a ridiculously good value
it's too big for most of our wrists and
we're very drawn to the more refined
look of the competition but for a
first-time SmartWatch buyer or someone
looking to make the jump to Android wear
without spending a lot of money
the ascend watch to does a very nice job
for the price just make sure to try it
on before the return period ends to make
sure your wrists are thick enough to
take it we've got a bit more on the Zen
watch - and our full written review at
pocket now check out the link in the
description below on October 14th and
yes we will have our moto 360 2nd gen
review up very soon here on YouTube and
at pocketnow.com till next time this has
been michael fisher captain 2 phones on
twitter urging you to keep a close watch
on your own personal Zen I don't know
what that means thanks for watching
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
