next up we're going to look at the
pictures hub the music and video sub and
the games hub so here we are with the
picture sub I'll just show you how to
get to it we can give it a lifestyle and
you notice that laptop shows a picture
there's also showing the best background
for the sub so first off we've got all
date and favorites you can store your
pictures by those different categories
or favorites for their date will show
what's recent and all just shows through
different folders and if we swipe this
way you see a few recent pictures just
show up there as thumbnails and you can
see when I press and slide they all go
transparent which is pretty cool let me
get to the what's new and this is
showing pictures that have been uploaded
by my friends to Facebook or Windows
Live so we can scroll through those and
we can tap on them to view them let's
see any good ones here about that one
so it's going to load the thumbnail
first see it's kind of blurry and there
are little dots up there showing that it
was loading and now it's all clear and
we can zoom and the comments show up
when you're all doomed out and you can
make comment right there as well can
slide and you can see the others and
this is actually doing something very
smart it's going to download the first
one and then while you're looking at
that one it's going to also download the
ones next to it so if you swipe you're
probably going to get a full res image
and then we're back to all so this
background can change it by itself or
you can change it manually so if I still
change it for me it's just going to pick
something randomly or I don't know how
it's going to pick stuff but I can also
change it manually so here we go and
that looks good so there we are your
background ok I want to go back to the
start there's the new picture our next
the music and video sub now this one is
really cool too we have our menu you can
if you just want to listen to music
that's on a device right away you can
press that play button and we had a
background image of where the recent
artists that we've been listening to let
slide here's my history those some
videos those are some artists I've been
listening to recently and there are some
albums then we get to New this shows
some things that I've recently
downloaded then over here is a marquis
this is work third-party applications
can show up so c1880 t radios there
and then back to the beginning so I go
to music we'll see all the music on my
device and I can press a letter and jump
to which one do I don't I've got it
there a letter that uh instead of going
like this flicks rolling the whole time
okay and you can go to an artist and it
shows their background image comes up
there you can swipe and see their songs
and you can see their bio unfortunately
the bio doesn't have hyperlinks and
there's no pictures view or related
artists tab in this version so you can
also sort by albums and get the album
art or songs there's your shuffle all
button and here's playlists
genres you just want to listen to some
hip-hop and back to artists of course
they also have videos there's your TV
music the movies I don't have any of
those their podcast you got audio or
video podcasts and that'll play course
now here's an interesting thing look we
can't scrub too fast forward see I'm
touching the timeline you have to fold
down the fast-forward button so that's a
little bit annoying
we're so many backs and you also got
radio this is FM radio we need to plug
in their headphones for the antenna but
that's how it works and we got
marketplace I'll go over that later and
lastly for this time let's check out the
xbox live so you see a little guy in
there that's the avatar that I made
really quickly on the phone and it's
popping up and doing stuff over there
and here's our game sub get see your
collection of games there's some other
games down here these are xbox a lot of
games you got the spotlight with some
news there's my avatar with gamerscore
in achievements and here's where game
invites or turn notifications would
appear wouldn't have any of those yet so
that's about it for the game sub we tap
and hold all you get is a refresh menu
alright so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
