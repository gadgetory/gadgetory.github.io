smartphone Fabul or tablet to buy you're
probably gonna want to do a couple
things number one you'll want some kind
of a case to protect your investment
number two you'll realize that battery
life is limited and you'll want some way
to extend that I'm Joe Levi for
PocketNow this is a hands-on look at the
HTC power flip case for the HTC One Maxx
this is the HTC One Maxx the Sprint
Edition and back here behind this case
is a non-removable 3300 milliamp hour
battery now that's a large battery by
any stretch of the imagination and even
with this very very large screen it does
a really good job at lasting for a very
very long time however since you can't
replace that battery you're gonna need
some way to get a charge whether that's
having a car charger or some other way
and portable battery or whatnot to to
recharge this whenever you need it
you're gonna have to have that also this
is a very unusual size so finding a case
for it especially a case with the flip
cover was not easy
luckily HTC has you covered and that is
this and no no pun intended this is the
HTC power flip cover it's somewhat
expensive coming in around $65 at least
that's what it was priced at Amazon when
we film this video it looks just like
any other flip cover right except it
doesn't notice down here if you will
these three little pins and on the back
this little raised button it doesn't
actually do anything it's just there to
kind of index the case which I kind of
like but what does it do and why is it
there well if you notice on the back of
this HTC you have these three little
gold pins now I've been a fan of these
for a long time they're called pogo pins
and what they do is they let you plug in
without plugging in so if you've got a
car dock or a desk dock you can just set
your device in and if it's compatible
it'll have three little gold posts that
will touch those
three little gold circles there and
you'll be able to charge while you're in
your car or it's on the dock put in a
case sure enough let's go ahead and
install this we're going to put it in at
this side first installs just that
easily and it looks good you've got your
front firing speakers real holes up here
on the back nice cutout for your
fingerprint scanner your flash your
camera and down here that HTC badge
you've also got some cutouts for your
microphones and whatnot down here for
USB charging and your mic down on the
bottom as well now the first thing that
I have noticed is this cover is very
heavy relatively speaking and I thought
that was just you know a sign of quality
but once you get deeper find out this
case has a ribbon that runs through here
and over to this side and this side
includes a 1200 milliamp battery 1,150
milliamp nominal inside it so here's a
case that adds no more bulk other than
what a case normally would and this one
doesn't add too much bulk at all you
still have a very nice finger grips you
still have access to your buttons
without going through any kind of
cutouts or auxilary buttons or whatnot
you've got this really nice stand
feature so you can set it on your desk
set it up like that set it on your lap
it works well it looks good it protects
your screen that protects your corners
and it's got a 1200 milliamp battery
inside so it looks great it's a
wonderful case I would highly recommend
it it costs a little more than normal
cases in normal case like this you're
probably gonna be looking anywhere from
40 bucks to 50 bucks
this one costs about 65 so it a little
it is a little more expensive but to
include an extended battery I think it's
very very well worth it one other item
of note you're probably all interested
in battery life right well with 3300
milliamp hours inside an additional 1200
ml amp hours in the cover how long does
this last you know what I'd love to tell
you
but I can't because we never ran it out
of battery we've had this thing for
about a week now and I have just barely
charged it one time so that I'd make
sure that I have enough charge for this
video it lasted a very long time now one
other thing to look at here if you'll
notice our battery icon has a little
green plus sign which indicates that we
are getting supplemental power from the
case through those pogo pins very very
cool as you can see this idea is
brilliant and it puts pogo pins to a
perfect use probably a reason why every
device in the entire world should have
pogo pins if not for this particular
reason for reasons like this that we
just haven't seen yet if you like seeing
this kind of stuff why not give the
video a thumbs up and share it with your
friends on any one of your favorite
social media networks my favorite is
Twitter where we're at pocket now and
I'm at Joe Levi thank you very very much
for watching for pocket now we'll catch
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
