brought to you by D brand to buy the
best fitting skin for your phone or
tablet please visit D brand calm here we
go we're looking at what will likely be
the two most popular models of phones
released in 2016 we'll be combining this
review to include both the iPhone 7 and
7 plus their premium priced devices so
let's see if Apple brought the heat for
these improved cameras first a little
housekeeping the sensors employed here
are similar to last year's iPhone 6s a
1/3 inch 12 megapixel sensor what's new
for this year is a wider aperture now F
1.8 and even the smaller iPhone has
optical image stabilization the exciting
new features on the 7 Plus which now has
a second camera sensor used to create a
2 X zoom this is a smaller sensor
approximately one over three point six
inch to pair up with a longer lens but
still fit the same housing as the main
camera jumping right into our exposure
tests in good light we see little
difference in still photo performance
from last year's iPhone even down to the
incredibly consistent image processing
blues and greens are well captured
providing terrific saturation clarity
and detail skies can be a bit grainy but
we don't see the blockier compression
issues found on some other phone cameras
browns and earth tones are rich and
vibrant but again Apple prevents these
colors from becoming exaggerated or
orangish yellow flowers in direct Sun
are holding on to find petal details
with only a few hot spots starting to
clip information and Red's are always
tough but the iPhone does better than
most and providing reasonable exposure
and pleasant but even-handed saturation
so these flowers aren't completely
washed out Apple's spot metering helps
rein in the exposure on white flowers
and afternoon light I'm happy to see
that once you tap to focus the phone
will allow darker areas to stay
underexposed when you tell the camera
what's important in your frame one thing
we noticed a bit more on this iPhone
noise reduction can be applied fairly
aggressively in shaded shots there's
still plenty of light here for a clean
photo but the iPhone is compressing this
down and producing an image which is
starting to look a little comic book II
once you zoom in now talking about white
balance the iPhones image processing is
amazingly consistent and the iPhone
handles warmly
very well delivering a delicious balance
between golden hues and the actual color
of your subject however we still think
this camera over reacts in shade where
there's really no need to push this cold
we're still surrounded by warm
California afternoon light and we'll
have a little more to say about this
when talking about the iPhones video
looking at dynamic range there's not a
lot of info to work with once the iPhone
finishes compressing a JPEG these are
tiny files and it's rare to see a full
res iPhone photo over 4 megabytes and
most are under - there's enough info to
slap a filter on top but trying to
rescue clipped highlights is usually
futile however this is the first iPhone
to support raw capture but not from the
Apple camera app we had to break our
rule here and shoot some samples from a
third-party camera app to look at some
RAW files average raw photos were
between 9 and 12 Meg or roughly half the
size of a galaxy s7 raw photo RAW files
aren't the prettiest to look at but they
provide a lot more info for folks who
might want or need to edit blowing out
the highlights of this pinecone shot
it's pretty easy to walk this back a
stop and a half and recover the picture
this would be completely impossible from
the finished JPEG now we're not going to
spend a lot of time on the iPhone app
layout it hasn't changed significantly
in features or organization what is new
though is this toggle here to switch the
zoom on the 7 plus it's a handy quick
action to get you closer to your subject
and speaking of that zoom it's a really
fun feature to have photos from the 7
plus second sensor aren't quite as nice
as from the main sensor the smaller
sensor size and aperture affect the
shots and in some lighting conditions
output can look similar to a selfie
camera but that's often still preferable
to just a straight-up cropped zoom while
the full 10x range can still wreck image
integrity staying below that maximum
zoom delivers a much higher quality
reach than any other phone we've
reviewed short of a Lumia 1020
this is a boon to macro shooters we're
very happy to see the zoom lens has the
same minimum focusing distance as the
main lens the iPhones close focus is
still a ways off from some of its
competitors but the second sensor more
than clears that gap often when you
change a lens's focal length that
affects how close you can get now this
might be one benefit of using a smaller
sensor on the zoom lens being able to
maintain exactly the same focusing range
for photos and videos the iPhones wider
aperture helps blur your background a
little bit more than what we could
achieve on the iPhone 6s but the
one-third inch sensor still keeps the
iPhone from playing with the same bulk a
we can generate from androids and Lumias
with larger image sensors and at the
time this review was shot Apple had yet
to release the software to blur the
backgrounds on the seven-plus so we'll
have to cover that feature when it's
released in a separate video if there's
any core improvement to get really
excited about
it's the spruced up focusing system the
iPhone 7 locks on smoother and more
consistently than the iPhone success
even when shooting in low-light
situations we had far fewer miss focuses
than when reviewing the iPhone S II no
manufacturer can compare to what Samsung
is doing this year but this system gets
Apple within striking distance of many
laser assisted Android phones and it
makes the camera easier to trust in
run-and-gun situations one area where
Apple still rules the roost HDR photos
are as good as they've ever been which
is to say they are excellent Apple does
a fantastic job of balancing shadow and
highlight detail where many other
manufacturers will just abuse color
saturation and clip highlights and
panorama performance is also still quite
good but our iPhone 7 plus was prone to
more small stitching errors than we saw
in the iPhone 6s a very minor but still
noticeable step back in performance here
but back to another wind the new
front-facing camera on the iPhone is far
more usable than previous FaceTime
cameras and finally outputs 1080p video
stills are very sharp in many lighting
conditions though we still wish apple
with loosen up a bit and give us a wider
lens you know your face is going to be
nicely captured but I don't quite have
long enough arms to also get enough of
the background in my shot for a good
vacation
and photo now the hardware changes like
image stabilization and wider apertures
don't help as much in bright light but
moving the darker scenes the iPhone gets
a solid step up improving low-light
photos we get better contrast and while
noise reduction is certainly cranking
you kinda have to push to that pixel
peeper range to see really destructive
blurring so just don't crop in that
severely and you'll be fine even without
resorting to HDR we get great color in a
dark street scene our creepy tunnel
shows off a tack sharp lens free of
flaring and fringing just look at how
crisp those light rays are as in bright
warm light the iPhone balances are
creepy gait almost exactly where I'd
want to see it a white gate lit by an
ugly yellow security lamp Apple nailed
it here our walkway shot shows the
iPhone perfectly separating the color of
these two lamps and also delivering a
darker exposure which is well in keeping
with the feel of this walkway at night
and a flower in almost no light an
iPhone 6s would have failed to focus
here but the iPhone 7 had few issues
locking onto this subject
it was slow but the phone only had to
rack focus once before finding this
flower of course on a shot like this
you'd probably just want to throw your
flash and both iPhones now have quad LED
flashes the iPhone continues to deliver
great color accuracy from these color
tone LEDs but having four light sources
the iPhone 7 seems to be more prone to
blowing out highlights in your shots
than phones packing fewer lumens now
moving to video the iPhone captures a
very similar UHD file averaging around a
45 megabit per second bitrate a high
enough quality to eat up 350 to 400
megabytes per minute of video another
reason why we're happy to see the 16
gigabyte model finally die video output
is very similar to photo output in terms
of color and exposure even down to the
graininess we see in uniform sections of
blue sky again far less blocky than a
lot of competitors but still just a bit
busier than we'd prefer for the
seven-plus zooming while shooting video
shows a pretty clean handoff between the
two sensors though very rarely the phone
will pop exposure and shifting between
these two cameras it's really good
looking video though even with the
larger aperture low-light videos will
often look a little flatter or dull
then still photos shot in the same
location the graininess is very similar
to what we might see on a Galaxy s7 but
we'd actually kind of like to see Apple
hit videos like this with just a touch
more contrast and in video we can get a
better look at image stabilization and
it's buttery smooth Apple has been
delivering well here for years and the
iPhone 7 nicely balances natural
movement against reducing handshakes
where this stops though is on the 7 plus
zoom increasing the focal length means
every single hand movement is magnified
and the phone just isn't capable of
raining that back in and unchanged from
previous iPhones the audio capture is
sadly still mono no stereo sound for you
human with two ears
it's generally fine but far from
top-tier most scenes
sound dull there's no spatial
information and while the wind and noise
reduction filters do their job well
often this produces a flat sound with a
little noise reduction warbling in
scenes with consistent noise floors the
iPhone would not be our top pick for
recording live music the iPhone 7
performed so close to the 6s we were
surprised to see noticeably poorer
performance in our exposure tests moving
from dark to bright and back big jumps
twitchy shimmery / Corrections and
aggressive white balance adjustments
this isn't very pleasant and we don't
see the pretty blooming effect which
last year's iPhone produced in adjusting
exposure and it does wouldn't be an
iPhone review without looking at some
slow-motion video capturing
240 frames per second at 720p or 120
frames per second at 1080 this is a
great way to play with time very few
phones can match what Apple delivers
here so let's wrap this up where's this
leave us with the cameras on the iPhone
7 + 7 + these shooters are very good
we're not really surprised there these
iPhones will be two of the most popular
phones of the year so these cameras will
be two of the most popular new cameras
used worldwide improvements to the
focusing system and increasing the
aperture are certainly welcome but we
can't shake the feeling that the core
photography experience hasn't moved much
from last year's iPhone 6s the sensor
size for example is now smaller than
most of the $400 phones we've reviewed
audio capture is falling further behind
the competition the new fun zoom feature
is only available on the larger phone
and we see a few small gaps in Apple's
usually bulletproof color and white
balance which will hopefully be
addressed in future software updates
Apple has the basics covered but people
who really want to drive this camera
will need to rely on third-party apps
and results might still fall behind what
you can achieve out of the box with an
LG or Samsung
now iPhone fans coming from a6 or older
will be very pleased with what's new
here and for 650 and 700 and $69 phones
thankfully folks springing for
base-model iPhones will finally have the
storage to really use these shooters
