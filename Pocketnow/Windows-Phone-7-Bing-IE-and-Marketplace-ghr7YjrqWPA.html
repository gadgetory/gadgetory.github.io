calm next up we're going to look at Bing
Internet Explorer and the marketplace on
Windows Phone send so here we are with
bein you can get to this just by
pressing the search button down here
from most programs that do not have a
contact sensitive search so basically
the homepage anywhere else besides music
and video marketplace email and contacts
or people rather so here we're get the
Bing we get little updates little
messages about this picture and it does
landscape and a microphone up here for a
voice we can type stuff so let's try the
voice
best buy
and there goes we got some best buy
results and it has a it automatically
went to local so here's our local Best
Buy's and we can swipe to see websites
about this bye there's bestbuy website
or news ok let's go to local and you can
see should be a little map there's an
address reading directions from my
location you can call them there's the
website and here here's the hours so
that's really good you can pin this to
your Start menu or you can share it on
email there's the map here's some
reviews and you can see what else is
nearby number two starbucks buy movies
hello who know there's the map
okay so that's been you can do all sorts
of searches
now let's try internet explorer so let's
do let's just go to the web results and
load up the best buy web page I'm on the
18 internet connection I believe now i'm
on Wi-Fi so let's see this load and we
have a menu you can add it to favorites
you can view your favorites you can view
your tabs and here's something
interesting that you don't see I can
totally interact with this even while
it's downloading so see that's not it's
a little more than halfway done but I am
totally browsing and reading stuff while
it downloads everything else and
everything is really smooth it's still
not finished down one and I can click on
stuff it's going to bort that finishing
the previous web page and now it's going
to start downloading that one
being a little bit slow
here we go so that's down low down but I
can also go to my tabs switch to a
different page start downloading this
one and then go back to that one that
one download some stuff and I can read
that this one's still not finished
downloading but I'm still I'm still
reading it anyway so that's some pretty
significant multitasking at least in
terms of web browsing okay that's still
downloading let's go back see what this
one's doing that one's also still
downloading but I can read it anyway I
can read whatever it has displayed so
that's a really cool great feature you
don't have to wait for it to finish so
here's my favorites unfortunately
there's no way to sync favorites with
your desktop so you might miss out on
that feature and I can add to favorites
okay settings I can change which mode I
want to be in mobile version of desktop
version i can delete history allow
cookies yadda yadda yadda this one is
almost done Talon we see a lot of
pictures there and this one is finished
there it is
very smooth really nice that you don't
have to wait for a top finish down one
before we can do anything all right so
lastly let's look at the marketplace
it's going to load up now this is where
we can buy apps and games and also music
well let's take a little while here
there we go so there's HTC has their own
little section of the marketplace we
also have apps
there's your all their different
categories just the top apps new apps
featured apps oh there's two updates
look at that updates already Wow well I
can update them all let's do that later
there's your games that's going to give
you Xbox Live top games new games free
games where you can sort by categories
you see while it's loading is still
totally responsive I rare
now let's go to music so this goes to
the zune marketplace
I love my internet connection what's
going on here
well sometimes it loads really quickly
they wear here's your artist of the week
here's some featured artists and here's
some new releases top albums and your
genre so let's pick one here which one
do we want about that one now I have a
zune pass associated with this windows
live ID so i can just tap this play
button and it should stream the whole
song or the whole album but it's also
showing by album so i can buy it and i'm
in a sense each or ten dollars little
thing but i have a zoom past i should be
able to download these you know without
having to pay so where is that button
here's the secret tip tap and hold now
you get a menu and there it is download
so I want to do that
so when i do the download it's going to
be drm protected but i'll be able to
play offline I don't have to depend on
an internet connection you can see
spending there it is downloading so
that's going to download the whole song
whole album with my zoom past that I can
listen to an offline it's not going to
be an mp3 format but it's going to be
something that can listen to on the
trainer inside tunnels so that's the
trick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
