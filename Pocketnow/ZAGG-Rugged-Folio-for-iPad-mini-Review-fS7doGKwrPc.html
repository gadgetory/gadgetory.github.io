keyboard option for your iPad Mini Zack
might have exactly what you're looking
for I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and here is our review of the Zagg
rugged folio for iPad Mini there's a
great divide between consumers who say
tablets are nothing but media
consumption devices and those who want
something more out of their tablet those
of you who fall into the latter category
may be interested in one of Zacks latest
products the Zagg rugged folio for the
iPad Mini to kick things off it must be
said that the rugged folio which is
available for the iPad air and both iPad
Mini models is a monster it's
unapologetic about its size weight and
thickness it weighs a whopping 1.5
pounds or double that of the iPad Mini
by itself meaning together the iPad in
case way to point to three pounds and
the two halves combined is just under
one inch thick this keyboard is not for
the faint of heart
then again if you're the sort of person
who will be looking into a casing
keyboard combo like the rugged folio
you're probably a pretty extreme person
to begin with or just clumsy it's made
out of a combination of tough
polycarbonate and silicone which should
help protect the iPad Mini from all
sorts of hard bomb stings and drops the
corners and edges are extra cushioning
their cutouts for all the important
ports and sensors and ready silicone
buttons for the volume control the
casing keyboard are built extremely well
and feel as if they could last a long
time and withstand more than a few
tumbles installing the case is a breeze
so long as you read the directions and
pay attention to how you're inserting
the iPad into the case it slides in
easily one way the other way not so much
the design isn't terribly unlike that of
some other zag keyboards for iPad like
the far more bare-bones version I've
been using personally for several months
the Zagg Keys covered like the more
lightweight option this model is
centered around a single hinge which is
strong enough to hold the tablet at just
about any angle but the rugged folio
also has many differences from the Zagg
Keys cover differences most would
probably consider improvements for
instance you should only have to charge
the rugged folio once every two years
yes
years also the casing keyboard are
joined with strong magnets not pressure
and friction like the Zagg Keys cover
magnetic connection means you can easily
pop the case into the keyboard with no
hassle whatsoever and better yet it
comes with four different modes case
mode is simply using the case without
the keyboard book mode means inserting
the case into the keyboard hinge
backwards so that you can keep up with
and protect the keyboard when you don't
need it
keyboard mode is pretty self-explanatory
and video mode allows you to once again
use the hinge backwards and prop the
iPad up for watching videos each of
these modes have a purpose and while we
don't feel we'd use all four all the
time it's nice to have such a versatile
case as for the keyboard it's something
that will take some time getting used to
for most the keys are quite small around
two-thirds that of the normal keyboard
and they're very close together the key
layout is also different from your
standard keyboard thanks to the size
constraints it's still a QWERTY but with
space so tight some keys come with up to
four functions which require different
combinations of the shift function and
command keys to access over the course
of a few months I've become very
familiar with the size and layout of the
Zagg Keys cover keyboard which is almost
the exact same as the rugged folios and
have no trouble typing out several
thousand word articles daily from the
tiny keyboard which really sets this and
other zag keyboards apart from most
other iPad keyboards however is the
backlighting if you're typing in the
dark the multicolored backlight makes a
world of difference you can adjust the
color and brightness by holding the
function key and tapping the down or
right arrow keys frankly we really like
the rugged folio not just for the
keyboard though the case alone is quite
nice and we have no qualms with popping
the keyboard often leaving the iPad in a
rugged case for everyday use the tough
sell will be the price for the iPad Mini
you'll have to shell out 130 $9.99
before tax you'll have to spend another
$10 for the iPad air rugged folio would
we recommend it if you're after
protection and a keyboard for your iPad
you could probably buy some other rugged
case and a keyboard separately for less
money but you wouldn't get quite the
integrated experience you get with a
rugged folio and you're not going to get
nearly the same battery life the rugged
folio may be on the expensive side but
what you're getting for that price is
well worth it folks thanks for watching
