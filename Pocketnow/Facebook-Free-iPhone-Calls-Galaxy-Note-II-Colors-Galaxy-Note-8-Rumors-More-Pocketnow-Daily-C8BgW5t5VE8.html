the US the Galaxy Note 2 gets more
colors it rumors into a galaxy note 8
from WC I'm high never leave it out I'm
wearing white for no particular reason
but this is parking out daily the Galaxy
Note 2 has just shown the world that
gray and white aren't enough Samsung has
just rolled out the phone in Korea and
both red and brown and even though we
don't really know when it's going to
reach our shores or whatever happened to
the black and blue colors that nobody's
ever seen from the Galaxy Note 2 you
will always want it in red anyways
didn't you speaking of the galaxy note
new rumors have Sammy working on a
native tablet with no capabilities and
even though the specs are kind of blurry
at this point apparently this device
will not be running the x and i was 5
octa processor that we've heard at CES
2013 apparently the device will be
launched at mwc which is just a couple
of weeks away and in our opinion
seriously Sammy what's taking you so
long now when it comes to awesome but
weird converge devices assumes
definitely takes the cake with their
padfone concept that's a phone when you
need it and then Doc's into a tablet
type device that allows it to eventually
become a tablet the concept is sadly not
taken off after two iterations but that
doesn't mean the Tony and I don't wish
we had a device like that I mean it's
really cool new rumors have a sous and
Microsoft already considering the fact
that they would like to bring these
capabilities tool Windows Phone device
now the only point we don't really get
us how they plan to make Windows Phone 8
become Windows RT eventually but hey we
can only dream and for those of you fans
of the LG optimus G new rumors have the
company working on an optimus g pro that
we'd like to dub the optimus g2 I mean
everybody's using the number of monikers
nowadays like the galaxy s3 for example
apparently this device won't be much of
a departure from the Optimus G that we
currently know same processor though
probably a boosted megahertz but it will
bring a 1080p display along with some
other benefits probably a better design
than just a glass on glass that we
currently know LG it's not really a fan
of launching anything at mwc but that's
pretty much the event that's coming up
next so we are expecting it to be
launched then we'll keep you posted
and finally for the interesting news of
the day Facebook has just rolled out
phone call capabilities for users of
their facebook Messenger application for
iphone customers it's really not
available for Android and it's currently
only available in canada because it was
tested there and the united states now
what makes this interesting is that this
is pretty much skype and if you think of
it skype was their partner for when they
launched pc to pc calling years ago so
that leads me to the question of the day
would you love to have this new feature
where you can just call your facebook
buddies over the application or you
stick the skype in my particular case i
mean skype is great but hey the facebook
is good i would give it a try leave us a
comment down below and if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
well make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hymen Ravenna again always thank you for
watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
