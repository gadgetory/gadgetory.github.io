giving the Oppo r7 in r7 plus a quick
look it's time to be greeted by the DHL
guy and start our full coverage I'm high
memory better with pocket now here with
our unboxing of the Oppo r7 before we
begin I'd like to start by giving a
shout out to a new documentary called in
search of the most dangerous town on the
Internet presented by Norn security I'll
admit I've always been very naive about
the consequences of being hacked until
now the film is about the most famous
hector's in the world and what they can
do and it's really hard not to be struck
by the fact that hey if it happened to
the most protected people and government
agencies in the world it could happen to
you and me I highly recommend you watch
the video in the links down below not
just because it comes from noir
insecurity the most trusted name in the
internet security business but because
it's probably one of the best
documentaries I've ever seen hands down
you won't regret investing these 20
minutes watching this film trust me
the start let's remember that oboes our
smartphones have only spent about the
fiying smartphone design we saw that
with the world's thinnest Oppo r5 last
year this year we have to opal r7 models
to review and we start with a smaller
opal r7 tearing the VHL packaging open
we are greeted with a small rectangular
box with a green pattern and oboes r7
drawn in the front centre something
different to the famous square boxes
that the company provides Oppo is still
famous by reminding us of the glory days
of unboxing experiences and there is no
exception here moving the r7 to the side
we notice a sim ejector tool a
transparent bumper standard headphones
an oboe CEMA spook rapid charger a
product we continuously praised for
charging a phone in 30 minutes or less
something that's truly hard to beat
these days you get two color options
with the Oppo r7 silver and gold and
thankfully we are greeted by the more
subtle silver design that I personally
prefer
once the plastic coating is remove all
admit it's really hard not to be struck
by this design at first glance surely
last year's r5 was larger and thinner
but at a cost of compromising things
like a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
this year's Oppo r7 looks and feels more
mature and balanced with a slightly
smaller 5 inch AMOLED display though
almost as slim as its predecessor the
2.5 the glass up front matched by sham
furred edges at the sides and slight
curves of the back of it a very pleasant
first impression and the aluminum finish
is cool to the touch for added comfort
Don is the significant camera humph that
we saw with the r5 now giving into a
more subtle lens at the back that still
protrudes by a hair those of you bumper
fans will like the fact that the
included case doesn't add much fog to
the phone but this phone feels sturdy
enough to not need a case and that's the
way I'm going to be using it for this
review period this particular unit is
the oppo r7s which came with a few
pleasant surprises like dual sim support
but with the option of using that same
tray for a micro SD card slot when
needed
one of my biggest complaints with the r5
was the lack of expandable storage and
that's clearly solved here for those
that need it the initial boot greets us
with the usual Opel logo and a new
version of Caloris this time version 2.1
backed by android 4.4.4 kitkat Oppo
spent a great deal of time telling us
how much this new version of its
proprietary OS has improved and we've
got a ton of coverage and even a full
review coming very soon to confirm that
make sure you don't miss any of it by
following us on social media you can
also subscribe to our YouTube channel as
well you can follow me on Twitter hi
underscore Tory better please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw I am hi Mary Lana thank you very
much for watching we'll see you on the
next Opel r7 video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
