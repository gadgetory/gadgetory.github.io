now calm and recently you saw our
fearless leader Brandon minuman give you
a run-through of his five must-have apps
for Android now it's my turn I'm
actually going to show you the apps that
I use most frequently and the most
useful must-have apps for myself
starting with pulse pulse is an RSS
reader that actually brings feeds that
you can assign yourself into a graphical
interface you can see right here it's
very easy to look at very easy to read
now basically what you what you can
actually do and scroll through these
feats here now I want to keep them on
one page so it's easier to use if you
pull your phone quickly and try and
navigate through if you want to add
different feeds you can actually press
the Settings button up here and that
will allow you to add feeds what's great
about this is you can actually scroll
horizontally from left to right through
the various stories for example if we go
down here to the pocket now stories we
can pick a story it will actually load
now on the screen now it might be tough
to see but it's text is highlighted here
so this is basically a text rich format
to start just so that it loads fast now
if you want to see the entire article in
its glory you can press the web button
and it will actually open up a in-depth
browser within the same application now
as you can see it takes a little longer
and that's why it does do the text first
by default so that it does pull up your
your feed and your article for you very
quickly once this does load will be able
to see the whole article in its glory
look at the pictures read the article
even post comments if we decide to so
now we can scroll through and as you can
see you can do everything that you could
typically do with the standard Android
browser you can zoom you can zoom in you
can zoom out it may not be the fastest
experience but it is the most readily
available from within this application
now if you want to go back you just tap
the actual article name itself and you
can continue to scroll through the
pocket now stories here or you can press
the grid button up in the top left
corner and that will bring you back to
your entire feed and once again the same
thing here we can scroll through pick a
story and it will load the text first
you want to play a video you can
actually press the video button it will
play that video for you from there so
that's pulse if you're a big fan of
trying to keep up with the news whether
it be tech news weather
be politics whether it be business news
you name it you can add almost any RSS
feed into pulse so I highly recommend
that application next up is going to be
Dropbox now I'm someone who's always on
the go i'm a student I'm a full-time
graduate student I also work full time
so I'm always on the go i always need
certain files with me whether it be
homework whether it be templates for
different documents that i may use for
my day job so by having a dropbox
account which is free i can also use
this dropbox app so by actually opening
up the dropbox application now as you'll
see here it will load it will show you
the icon very quickly what dropbox
basically is if you don't know it's a
cloud file service so you can actually
get your files into a cloud it's
basically a hard drive that's on the
internet if you don't know what a cloud
is and they're readily available to you
now so as you can see here I have all of
my different folders and I can scroll
through and you'll see these these
different folders here as well as
various individual documents that aren't
in a folder but let's say for example I
want to click on strategic management it
will actually open up that folder and
then you'll be able to see all these
documents that i have here whether they
be a document a powerpoint you name it
we can go ahead and open if we decide to
now what we'll do is actually will
download it and depending on what
software you have installed in your
phone it will open up that powerpoint
for you within that software so Dropbox
is very cool if you need certain files
to always be at your fingertips with you
when you're on the go whether it be
templates you name it Dropbox is a great
tool for that the next of my five
must-have apps is actually going to be
one that I'm using primarily as a widget
if we scroll over here that's going to
be beyond pod now this is the actual
widget here has a play button and has a
fast forward button this is the typical
standard widget if I was planning a
podcast it would actually have a podcast
title here this is a podcast player so
if we go ahead and actually open up the
applications by clicking on it as you'll
see here we have the various podcasts
now you can add any podcast that as an
RSS reader into that feed and then if
you want to actually play the podcast
you can go ahead and click on it and
then you can press play from there
what's very cool about beyondpod is you
can actually set an update schedule so
let's say every night you want your
podcast feed to check for new updates to
podcasts every morning every night at
1am
is what mine does so that why when i
wake up at five or six I have all of my
new podcasts already updated already
ready to listen to and I'm already out
the door it's perfect so again if we
want to press play we just press the
play button here and there you go is
actually playing that podcast now so
beyond pod is very useful very easy to
use and the fact that it does the auto
update makes it a win in my opinion the
next application on my must-have app
list is actually another app that
follows the same theme of being on the
go and that's logmein now unfortunately
app does have a pretty high price tag
for a typical app and that's thirty
dollars but for someone who is always on
the go and needs to possibly log into
their computer remotely this is a great
option for you it's very easy to use
very easy to set up it's essentially
dummy proof so if we go ahead and
actually go to the application list here
we can open up logmein and i've already
logged in previously i was actually just
using it about five minutes ago it will
give you a list of the computers you
have set up here what you do is you make
an account on logmein com you set up
that account with that computer and that
information is now saved so as you can
see I have my XP computer my windows XP
computer at my office and my iMac which
is actually right here in front of me
now let's say I want to log into that
imac I should go ahead and pick this
imac right here it's going to establish
the connection it's classy for my
password i'm actually it's going to pull
the phone off screen and enter the
password real quick okay i've entered my
password and you're greeted with a quick
tips screen that life should give you
some information on how to use
applications you can see you can pinch
in you can pinch out if you use two
fingers to tap that's your right click
one will be your typical move if you tap
with one finger that's going to be
actual click but let's go ahead and give
you the juicy details so the first thing
you're going to see is the login screen
for my actual imac here if you're a Mac
user this screen will look familiar to
you this is basically where I'm going to
type in my password yet again to lock
myself in so as you can see I've
actually clicked on the word blank now
just press the keyboard button which is
down here on the left and that will
bring up my keyboard and yet again I'm
going to pull the phone off screens to
enter my password so I am now fully
logged in and what you're seeing is my
actual desktop on this window here we
can actually pinch us to zoom right in
the last thing I was doing was actually
doing some media management within
iTunes you'll see all my movies here
matter within the actual iTunes feed
as you can see we have itunes here we
can of course zoom in zoom out now if I
want to minimize this application I
literally just put the actual mouse over
the minimize button and just tap
anywhere on the screen and that will
then minimize it for me now my imac once
again is right in front of me here and
your this is actually minimizing it on
my screen itself as you'll see that
sometimes is quite a delay but once
again for remote management that's a
small sacrifice to have this app is
dynamic and that you can turn into
landscape and actually use it in
landscape mode you'll see right here
this is actually a much better
experience it's a much better browsing
experience especially when you're using
the browser which is what I'm doing
right now we have google chrome opened
up and we can actually go ahead and type
in a website up here in the blank so
i've clicked on it once again i'm going
to press that keyboard button and we'll
type in pocket now you can actually
scroll over here you'll see that it
populated like it usually does going to
press the enter button and that's going
to load pocket now now it does load
first on the imac and then from there
has to actually beam this picture to the
phone itself what we can do now is press
the x button to get rid of our keyboard
and as you'll see we have pocket now
here ready to go now one thing this will
not play it'll play flash videos if
you're looking to do that with your
device however it won't play the sound
now that's how they basically are able
to offer you the best experience the
bandwidth would be greatly lost if they
were playing the flash sound to you so
you can watch a youtube video that is
flash or a full flash video but it's
going to be a little bit choppy the
frame rate isn't going to be the best
last but not least is going to be better
keyboard now this is an actual skin for
your keyboard you may have noticed this
is actually a dell streak which is a
5-inch screen device now the keyboard
that it comes with is very functional
it's very easy to use however it doesn't
have any kind of shortcut commands with
the numbers and that sort of thing now
using a keyboard skin like better
keyboard will allow you to actually get
the keyboard commands much like what the
HTC Sense keyboard offers so for example
if I click here now you've already seen
it in action I can actually now hold
down this top row or any of these
letters here to actually get the symbols
or the number so if I hold down the you
for example it will turn into a 7 now
you're just saw on that screen now
better keyboard will
allow you to customize the keyboard like
I said so if you're looking for a
smaller keyboard or darker keyboard
there's even iPhone replicas of the
keyboard this will give you that option
to fully customize your device as you
see fit as Brandon mentioned in his post
please leave a comment with your
must-have apps let us know what you're
using everyday and what you think please
give this video a thumbs up and stay
tuned for the rest of the editing crew
of pocketnow.com to show you their
must-have top five apps thanks everyone
