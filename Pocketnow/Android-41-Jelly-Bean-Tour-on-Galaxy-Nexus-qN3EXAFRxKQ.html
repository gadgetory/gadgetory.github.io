pocket now calm you know is going to
happen just one day after its
announcement jelly bean has been leaked
it's been leaked on the Galaxy Nexus
whether you're running a CDMA Galaxy
Nexus or a gs-7 Galaxy Nexus you can
actually load it on right now and test
it and we've got it running on this
verizon Galaxy Nexus and we're going to
show you all about jelly bean in this
video so let's get to it okay let's get
started this is a preview but it's
remarkably stable for being a preview
everything works literally everything
works so let's go into the lockscreen
here we're going to unlock the screen
the first thing you're going to notice
is that the lockscreen is a little bit
different we saw this in the emulator
you kind of get these pretty little dots
as you move your finger around and now
there's a third entry at the top here to
go to Google now but we're gonna talk
about that later there's another way to
get to that so we're gonna go to the
right to unlock and here is jelly bean
so there's a lot of cool stuff to show
you the first thing we're gonna show you
is the voice search because I think it's
a lot better than Siri a lot better than
s voice because it's so much faster
watch this how tall is Barack Obama whoa
that was so fast and if it's a piece of
information that it can put into a card
it does so for example what's the
weather going to be tomorrow check it
out pretty cool so let's try something
else how much wood could a woodchuck
chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
now I said that pretty fast let's see if
it got it right got it right if it
doesn't have an answer for you it will
go into just a standard Google web
search so let's do one more when is the
next leap year I'd be impressed if it
got this yeah it's sort of date it
brought up a Google search result so it
technically really didn't get it so the
voice search they're not really calling
this any kind of voice assistant or
they're not calling it G for which or
anything like that it's just the Google
Voice Search and now it works very well
to answer information and and the best
part about it is that it works so fast
Siri has to think s voice gets it wrong
like 90% of the time but this seems to
be the best of all worlds and we're
going to have a follow-up video talking
about this compared to the other voice
search services next thing I want to
show you is Google now and the way you
get to that is you you tap the home
button and you drag up to Google or as
you saw in the lock screen you can
actually access it through that as well
so here we are so these are just some
sample cards I've got my calendar Steven
in noon
the idea behind Google now is that it
will intelligently give you information
based on whatever you're doing and what
your calendar status is and I really
haven't had a chance to play with this
again we're gonna cover this in a future
video because it has a lot of potential
one of the things that the Google guys
were talking about on stage was let's
say you're in a restaurant and you go to
Google now it will know you're in that
restaurant and it will give you entree
recommendations that's just really cool
in my opinion
and up here there's a standard Google
search bar and what you could do down
here it says show more cards let's see
what else we get it didn't really pull
in anything it doesn't have much to work
with because I haven't used it that much
apparently gets smarter as you use it so
let's go back now probably the biggest
feature in my opinion to jelly bean is
butter so Google try to make the
operating system just feel snappier and
there's a lot of technical stuff behind
this that you know I'm not really that
concerned about I want to know if it
just feels faster the first thing I'm
gonna go into here is the multitask UI
now an Ice Cream Sandwich whether you're
on the fastest device or a medium-range
device our low-end device this this
animation always takes way too long in
my opinion let's see how it looks in
jelly bean ok the animation is pretty
much gone and as a basis of comparison
we've got the galaxy s3 here running
CyanogenMod 9 so it's kind of stock Ice
Cream Sandwich potentially a little bit
better so let's do a speed test err try
to do them at the same time as you saw
there is kind of a stuttery animation
further watch what happens when we flip
the items off the screen much faster on
the Galaxy Nexus I mean it's about a
second or half a second faster on the
Galaxy Nexus which really makes a
difference other places that project
butter come into play here is in the app
drawer so if you go into the app drawer
really
to show on camera you kind of just got
to feel it this is insanely fast like it
just snaps into place kind of as if it's
anticipating my next move another place
where you feel butters presence this is
kind of a weird way to talk about it
is in the web browser oh do you feel it
in the web browser so we're loading a
pocket now here I'm gonna zoom out and
scrolling as long as the pages load of
course is just I there I say buttery
smooth I mean it's just it flies and
again this is really hard to explain
it's it's kind of incredible what Google
has done dare I say it feels a lot like
iOS where inputs are prioritized over
sort of background processes and other
things like that just browsing the web
is in another league now on jelly bean
and and and it's very exciting that they
did that another thing we want to show
off is the camera taking a features home
from Windows Phone 7 actually so we take
a picture of my wonderful hand it'll fly
off to the right and you can flick off
to the right and see that picture then
you can do a little film strip type view
here again this is right out of Windows
Phone 7 and you can see the pictures
that you've taken in sort of a zoomed
out view so that's kind of a cool little
feature to have another thing to note
here is the home screen the launcher has
been changed to do some cool things one
of the things you can do is more easily
at widgets so let's go over to widgets
let's drop say mmm let's see what's
Google Play Books sure take it and drop
it here and it will resize and move
things around on the screen so no longer
you have to do this shuffling of icons
around the screen so if I want to move
this over to the left everything gets
out of the way if I want to move it to
the bottom right everything gets out of
the way or at least it should kind of
see there we go
things get out of the way just like
nature intended and another thing that's
new with the homescreen launcher so you
tap and hold on the background get a
slightly different wallpaper UI it's
just a kind of little thing there next
let's talk about notifications because
they've been changed and developers now
can tap into notifications and do really
cool stuff with it so if we bring down
the
vacation tray here's a great example
I've got a missed call from Mason and
what I can do right right from the
notification tray is call them back or
send them a text message which is super
cool another thing you can do is
actually expand notifications so I've
got an email here and to expand it the
gesture is really really weird you gotta
use like a et style two fingers spread
thing it's just really really weird but
apparently go get used to it and it's
especially useful when you've got a
bunch of emails because then you can see
little previews of all the different
emails that you have just giving more
utility to the notification shade
another thing that's a little bit
frustrating actually about the
notification shade is that an Android
Ice Cream Sandwich the notification
shade goes all the way to the bottom
right and so very easily with a flick of
your thumb you could put it back in
jellybean you'll notice that it actually
doesn't go all the way to the bottom it
stops before the on screen buttons so a
lot of the time I'm accidentally you
know flicking on this and hitting a
button which will actually close the
notification shade but I kind of like
just being able to go from the bottom of
the screen and all the way up another
thing we want to talk about here and I
know we're going fast but there's a lot
to cover so we go into settings things
look a little bit different as we talked
about in the emulator video the toggle
switches are a little bit updated if you
want to if you're curious we can go into
the Ice Cream Sandwich UI here things
are just a little bit different they
don't have that little slant who knows
why they why they change that another
thing that's different is that if you go
down to accounts no longer is there sort
of a subsection for accounts and
settings it's just accounts are listed
and sort of broken out right here within
the within the settings screen so for
better or for worse I kind of liked it
the way it was before but it's
definitely something I'll get used to go
to about phone Android 4.1 let's get
that Easter egg hey check that out jelly
bean cute little guy if we tap him will
he dance will he sing will he do
something magical I don't think so
another small change that I've found if
you go in the Google Play Store and you
search for something let's say words
with friends as you start typing if
there's an action
match you can see a little icon that
will bring you directly to the app and
below it you'll have the standard
searches so again if we do say new North
America Netflix right Netflix you'll see
a little icon you'll be taken directly
to the Netflix app page instead of going
to the Netflix search results page and
that just makes a lot of sense and the
Google Play Store and Ice Cream Sandwich
always had this weird stutter this weird
animation problem can I'm happy to
report that in jellybean it's just
rocket fast the animation is smooth it's
fluid
it just looks it just looks awesome so
that was a look at Android jelly bean
again if you've got a Galaxy Nexus you
can install this quite easily we'll put
links up in the description so you can
do it the headline here for me at least
is project butter because Android Ice
Cream Sandwich and really all previous
versions have a lag problem whether
you're running on quad core or single
core and in jelly bean things are
absolutely positively faster and more
snappier and in the web browser it's
just it is day and night it truly is
incredible how fast they've made input
in the web browser which is one of the
most important places so we like what we
see with jelly bean can't wait until
it's available for more devices and if
you liked this video please give us a
thumbs up and as always thank you for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
