Pacquiao calm today we're looking at two
new live wallpapers for Android one of
them is based on a classic first-person
shooter and the other acts as a clock
but with an interesting twist let's
check them out all right hopefully you
guys have played or at least heard of
the game Doom because it's one of the
key games that helped popularize the
first-person shooter genre of gaming
back in the mid-90s as you can see we
have the doom guy wandering around the
home screen and as demons spawn around
him he actually fires his weapon and
they battle it out these monsters are
all characters from the game and they
retain the familiar graphics to give a
retro feeling which I'm sure will stir
up some great memories for some of you
now you can interact with a wallpaper
tapping on the screen will actually drop
power-ups for the doom guy to pick up
and use these include a variety of
weapons and even a med pack to help keep
him alive
as you saw I dropped it a little bit too
late and he died so you get the picture
there are a variety of weapons by the
way which makes things interesting let's
slide over and if we drag and drop an
icon that will spawn new enemies so
that's always fun okay let's go to menu
and we'll actually go to the settings
screen alright here we can change the
size of the characters on the screen so
I'll go to low you can enable god mode
which keeps the doom guy from dying
enable or disable the power-ups and the
spawning of monsters will change the
animation speed to fast select
background we have four backgrounds and
we can cycle through them or we can
select some plain background so I'm
gonna go to black randomize monsters and
then we'll increase the max monsters to
20 as you can see the characters are
much smaller now and the action is much
more fast paced this gives you an idea
of how you can change
the live wallpaper to your liking so
this was the doom live wallpaper let's
check out the other one I was talking
about this is time star live wallpaper
and as you can see it's like a hamster
running in one of those little wheels so
I suppose the idea is that he's actually
powering the clock by getting the gears
or pieces to move very interesting idea
with some nice artwork as well so if we
look closer you can see that there are
hour and minute hands and I like that
they're marked with numbers for easy
reading another thing I like about
having a clock for a wallpaper is that I
can place icons all around it with
traditional clock widgets you usually
lose a portion of valuable screen real
estate but that's not the case if you
have the clock embedded with the
wallpaper also it's nice to have the
clock visible at all times no matter
which screen you switched to of course
sometimes icons may cover up the numbers
but it's still nice nonetheless this
early version doesn't have any
adjustable settings yet but I know the
developer plans to include customizable
backgrounds and additional hamster
animations for example when you turn
your screen back on you'll find that he
stopped running to take a nap or he'll
get lazy and slow down in which case I
believe the plan is to implement a way
to get him motivated and running again
I'm not sure how that's going to work
out but we can look forward to seeing
that
in a future version so this was a look
at the doom and x there live wallpapers
for Android you can get them both for
free in the Android Market please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked it
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
