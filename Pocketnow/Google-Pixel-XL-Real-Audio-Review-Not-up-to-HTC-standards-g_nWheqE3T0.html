on the audio coming from the speakers
and the headphone jack on the Google
pixel XL as we know the pixel is
designed by Google and menya factored by
HTC so a number of us smartphone audio
snobs were really hoping this phone
would be infused with that really
wonderful HTC DNA when it comes to audio
having played around with this phone for
a little over a week now that desire for
high quality audio will be left
unfulfilled a quick run around the
hardware we've got the 3.5 millimeter
jack up top for any headphones you want
to plug into it and on the bottom of the
phone we have a single mono speaker on
the left side of the USB C port and then
a symmetrical vent on the other side
which I guess could be a cutout for the
microphone I've never understood
manufacturers that put dual vents on the
bottom of the phone when it's only a
mono speaker
starting off with that speaker playback
it's actually pretty good for a mono
speakerphone it's up there with phones
like the LGV 20 for clarity for maximum
volume just for a pleasant tone which
doesn't overly distort as you drive it
hard especially with aggressively loud
music tracks on its own it's perfectly
fine for getting you through a couple
little web videos playing some games but
it's super easy to block especially when
gaming if you're bracing the phone
against the pad of your hand though we
should mention that fine for a mono
speaker doesn't mean this thing's
anywhere up there against stereo speaker
phones even against its own stablemate
the HTC 10 which has that weird
experimental tweeter sub woofer design I
feel like we've kind of maxed out what
we can achieve with a bottom firing mono
speaker where the real disappointment
lands is on this headphone jack and this
is yet another phone in the premium
flagship category which is posting good
numbers happily the pixel will play back
32-bit audio files but unfortunately
anything above 16-bit will be truncated
back down to 16-bit playback means the
pixel has a really hard time competing
against our $40.00 USB DAC from Pheo
this is the k1 this is what we use as
our baseline for all of our audio tests
and this thing easily outperforms the
hardware that's built into the pixel
against the premium price pack pixel
lands somewhere near the bottom of the
list pixel outperforms the LG g5 with
the built-in headphone jack but that's a
pretty low bar to overcome and it's a
statistical dead heat against the galaxy
s7 which we were also kind of
disappointed in this year
Google's larger phone is nowhere near
competing against HTC 10 s LG V 20s or
even iPhones for that matter as a quick
aside why we were disappointed in the
iPhone 7 audio playback wasn't
necessarily because it was bad it was
because Apple trumped up all of this
noise all of this hype about digital
audio but what they supplied out of the
box was actually a step back from last
year's iPhone now this is the first
pixel which means this is the first
phone directly from Google with this
consumer focus and the price tag to
match after taxes in California the base
model pixel XL ran me eight hundred and
forty dollars I can't say I'm okay with
adequate audio performance from an eight
hundred and forty dollar investment just
looking manufacturer to manufacturer for
a lot less cash you get much better
audio support in terms of true 24-bit
playback a wider frequency response a
lower noise floor one of the lowest
noise floors we've ever tested less
distortion and an amp which does a
better job of powering nicer headphones
just knowing that the same company put
these two phones together makes it
pretty disappointing that Google didn't
let HTC take the reigns for the audio
situation on the pixel from some of the
teases that I put out on the pocket now
podcast and some of the conversations
I've had on Twitter people are already
asking is there a way to improve the
quality on the pixel exile especially
for headphone playback and the answer is
a resounding I don't know plugging a USB
DAC into the pixel I know that the phone
is powering this Hardware the little
blue light comes on on the k1 but no
audio signal is coming out and there's a
little concern just as knowing that in
the past Nexus devices haven't always
had the best support for USB OTG
solution so as new generations of USB
see audio devices come out USB see Dax
USB C connected headphones we don't know
yet if the pixel will properly support
an open USB audio standard as it
currently doesn't with the hardware we
have to test Google is getting a lot
right with the software on the pixel the
performance of the pixel but if one of
your primary uses for a smartphone is
plugging in some headphones cranking
some tunes listening to your podcasts
this is not going to be the best bang
for buck it's actually likely to be one
of the worst as always folks thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to this channel for our continuing pixel
coverage I'm a green betta is going to
be wrapping up the review on the smaller
pixel I'm almost done reviewing this
larger pixel those videos will be out
shortly in addition to some comparisons
as I'm also on a flight out to UNIX soon
to go catch some cool Huawei news so be
on the lookout for that also for pocket
now I'm Juan Carlos bag now some gadget
guy on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
