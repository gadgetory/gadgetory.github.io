new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it let's take another
look at a device that's taken a backseat
to the new smartphone goliaths I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow this is
the lg optimus G and this is episode 19
of after the buzz in our October review
of the lg optimus G 480 we called the
device an excellent modern Android
smartphone with the proper balance of
aesthetics performance and utility and
then we promptly forgot about it not
because those high points were invalid
but because the flagship smartphone
landscape got much more crowded in the
months that followed the story of the
AT&amp;amp;T Optimus G so far is the story of a
good device stymied by timing and
inconsistent post launch support the
Optimus G is build is beautiful from
some angles unremarkable from others and
it can be downright self-destructive in
terms of long-term use the zero gap IPS
display is just as gorgeous as the day
we unboxed at but even with Gorilla
Glass 2 protecting it from the elements
we fear for its continued intactness
we're not always the biggest advocates
of smartphone cases at PocketNow but
with the device like this carrying it
naked is just asking for trouble
it's the slipperiest phone we've ever
encountered it'll slide off surfaces
that are even remotely angled and it
slides out of pockets so readily it
sometimes seems to defy gravity
in fact we lost an optimist G in the
back of a taxicab once and it's all
glass construction means that in terms
of durability there are more horror
stories than miracle reports out there
the Optimus G isn't the only phone to
suffer these issues but it is a hazard
nonetheless another slight hit the G
takes in the long term is it
low profile design there are nice
touches here but you have to look for
them the LED ring light around the lock
button and the totally flush camera lens
are good examples while it's beautiful
back cover detailing pops under the
right light the device's front side is
so unremarkable that it has a hard time
standing out in the crowd from its
contemporaries not every smartphone
needs to be a standout showboat in terms
of build of course but the Optimus G is
LG's halo flagship device outside the
phablet space as such it's a shame how
quickly its industrial design has been
eclipsed by the competition and that
gradual obsolescence is carrying over to
features as well the 8 megapixel camera
is quite good in normal lighting but
only average in the increasingly buzz
worthy low-light space a problem shared
by some other manufacturers more damning
is the G's tiny tinny speakerphone which
is an embarrassment next to Samsung's
Galaxy s4 or Nokia's Lumia 920 to say
nothing of the HTC One and its Android
skin while aging a bit more gracefully
than Samsung's TouchWiz definitely
doesn't pack the kind of feature set
that gets you addicted to using this
phone and this phone only that takes us
into software a curious tale on our AT&amp;amp;T
version here our initial review
criticized the Optimus G for shipping
with Ice Cream Sandwich instead of the
newer jellybean and cautioned that
updates from LG aren't always guaranteed
in a timely fashion or at all while the
Sprint version of the G received its
jellybean update in March 18 t customers
had to wait until April then even in
that area the rollout hasn't gone
terribly smoothly a long thread on a T's
customer forum details the problems
users have had when trying to update and
indeed our own unit remains stubbornly
stuck on 4.4 informing us that we have
the latest version that means not only
that we're stuck with an older build of
Android but that were stuck with a few
bugs we've grown to hate bugs like
scrolling lag in the browser and total
crashing of the browser when viewing
large pages and text messages arriving
from the wrong contacts in our phone
book waiting forever for a software
update to fix these issues is exactly
what we were worried about in our
initial review and while LG isn't the
own
offender in this regard it's especially
egregious when there's a large Gulf and
features and performance as there is
between Ice Cream Sandwich and jelly
bean we reached out to AT&amp;amp;T for comment
but it wasn't available by press time
we'll update the post at pocketnow.com
4.0.4 the optimus cheese skin is
incredibly responsive and packs some
really compelling visuals many of which
retained their novelty even after
repeated use and even if you get tired
of the unlock animations or home screen
transitions there are many stock options
to choose from and then there are the
really nice touches like the pinch to
zoom in messaging and the video player
along with the less useful but sort of
flashy qslide multitasking in these
regards LG deserves credit the Optimus
UI continues to impress those pluses
mean that if you already own an optimist
G you should still feel pretty good
about your purchase especially if you
snagged the jellybean update even at 4.4
it's still a solid Android smartphone
with some nice special features but if
you haven't bought one yet you'll
probably want to give this one a pass if
you need to buy right now other
manufacturers flagships are just more
compelling with more modern chipsets and
features and if you're willing to wait
LG's rumored Optimus g2 is starting to
look very impressive indeed
if the leaks are to be believed so while
the Optimus G has aged fairly gracefully
overall it's probably not the Android
smartphone to invest in right now rather
it's an encouraging reminder to keep an
eye on LG's next generation which will
hopefully bring enough pizazz to retain
its novelty a little longer than the
previous one if you'd like to read our
