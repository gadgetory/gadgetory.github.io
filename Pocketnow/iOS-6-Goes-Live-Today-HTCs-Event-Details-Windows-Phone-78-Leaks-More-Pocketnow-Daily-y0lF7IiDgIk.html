Windows Phone oven just a couple of
hours away and Windows Phone 7.8 reaches
the HTC hd7 I'm hi meri behna waiting
for my HTC 8x and this is parking out
daily iOS 6 whether loved or hated by
many is scheduled to launch is a with
over 200 new features now we've been
playing with it ever since beta 1 and
the differences between that and the
final product aren't really that big so
make sure you watch our hands on video
the upgrade brings enhancement cessary
passbook it also brings turn-by-turn
navigation another really neat features
though nothing groundbreaking the
upgrade usually reaches devices around
noon so make sure you hit the upgrade
section and settings to see if you get
it now even though windows phone 7.8
won't reach devices for the next couple
of months it's somehow raged on HTC hd7
though obviously not the usual way this
time xda-developers was able to pull it
from a nokia device and port it to the
hd7 though obviously with the difficult
bugs of an unfinished product this
doesn't shed any light us till when will
be getting windows phone 7.8 officially
but hopefully XDA will do a better job
than microsoft and porting it for the
rest of us i've had many ibook call it
whatever you want but the rumored little
tablet from apple is still becoming news
and hopefully it still keeps that
October release date now recent images
show the device fully assembled from the
top and the bottom though it's hard to
tell this is really a dummy unit or the
real thing now since Apple has showed us
just how terrible they've become at
keeping secrets with the iphone 5 i'd
call this thing real and yes i do want
one now one of our biggest surprises
with the launch of the Nokia Lumia 920
is the lack of a cyan model and the
reason why is because well Nokia's blue
everywhere just about everything the
event was blue and everything it's just
blue that's just weird for no kid not to
launch a cyan Lumia 920 but recent leak
them and just have a video of Red Bull
showing the device for a fraction of a
second and it's really hard to tell at
0-0 38 seconds so make sure you hit the
pause button at the
right time but that means that will most
probably get the color some time though
most likely for carrier variant we'll
see and finally for the no I can't wait
news of the day we've got the LG event
happening most likely right now at the
exact time that this video is going live
so stay till in the next couple of hours
for Brandon's hands-on videos of the
Optimus G coming to the United States
aside from that we've also got the HTC
have been happening in the next couple
of hours where we're expecting their 8x8
s NA v windows phone 8 devices being
launched now some of us are even day
dreaming of HTC bringing a Windows 8
tablet but I wouldn't hold my breath for
that one but that leads me to the
question of the day are you waiting for
an HTC windows phone this holiday season
I really want that a text though I still
haven't even seen it so leave us a
comment down below now if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
