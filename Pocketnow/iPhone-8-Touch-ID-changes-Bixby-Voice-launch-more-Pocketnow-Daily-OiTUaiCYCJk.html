ID making a comeback but not on the
front or the back who is enhancing its
Google feed to be able to take advantage
of machine learning and believe it or
not Bixby voice finally rolls out in the
United States I'm honey meadow Rivera
and yes for those of you in the comments
asking about the t-shirts the first
comment down below we'll have the link
erupted apparel along with a 10%
discount
this is pocket out daily the official
news today have to do with deals to a
certain degree I know some of you are
still interested in the Galaxy s7 edge
from last year it's currently for $469
on other carrier variants at Best Buy
but specifically in the case of Verizon
you can get that phone for 312 bucks and
probably that 312 bucks is the only
compelling deal that I would recommend
for a phone this old still a really good
phone regardless
and speaking of samsung finally Bixby
voice is official I mean I think we
played it on the memes for a while just
because how ridiculous it is for this to
take so long still when you watch the
teaser video from Samsung oh my god it
looks really compelling I cannot wait to
get it on my si plus tested I don't tell
you more about it but also in the
comments let us know if you're trying it
out and let us know what you think now
let's talk about competitors for those
of you wanting to know when you can get
the LG G 6 plus well LG hasn't really
shined as to when it's going to be
available in the United States but
there's an Amazon seller that's offering
it right now for 700 bucks now in the
case of the g6 plus where you're getting
is the audio deck you're getting pretty
much other color options the black
bezels at the front and that's pretty
much it there's option for more RAM I
believe and that's all you're really
getting still again the LG G 6 is one of
our favorite phones and the G 6 plus is
obviously just the better variant still
they'll be 30 coming I don't know if
it's a really good deal or not now let's
talk about Google the company continues
to hide the Google feed more and more it
wants to make its Google assistant more
predominant I actually find the Google
feed to be more useful and well the
company is doing something about it as
of now or at least within the next few
weeks there will be some enhancements
and machine learning reaching
smartphones and what this will do is
make card smarter make suggestions
smarter because currently it just asks
you what you want to see but it doesn't
really
know what you want to see unless you
tell it to so yeah this should be
rolling out over time we can't wait to
tell you more about is it worth it or
not obviously coming from Google and
most likely will be and finally the very
interesting rumors today have to do with
the iPhone eight and this time new
publications that are talking about what
to expect I've got a very interesting
prediction coming from Korres we heard
that such ID might not make it that it's
not going to come to the front begin the
displays not ready and there is no hole
at the back for it to be at the back but
some people have noticed that the power
button has gotten longer which makes a
lot of sense given the fact that Lisa
and the iPhone 7 plus it's unreachable
but apparently there's a reason for that
there are rumors that the fingerprint
scanner is coming to the power button
and I mean hey if Apple is able to
figure that one out that'd be great and
it actually leads me to the question of
the day I mean do you think that that's
a smart placement to leave it in the
power button on the side in my case I
wouldn't mind so long as they figure it
out I think the only company that's ever
done it right it's next bit with the
Robin but then in the case of Sony it
was just terrible in the experience
leave us a comment down below we love to
know your opinion ferengi Louie goes if
