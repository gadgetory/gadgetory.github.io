case mold and this time they include the
iPhone 11 our honor is apparently
gearing up for launching up to three
smartphones on its May 21st event and
iOS 12.3 is adding it brings a lot of
reasons why you should definitely
upgrade i'm hematuria vera and well the
weather in new york is less bipolar
today meaning now it's only raining and
it's only cold in May this is parking
out daily the official news today begin
with a reminder tomorrow is the launch
event for the 1 plus 7 Pro we're all
gonna be there at Pier 94 brandon diego
and i so if you guys want to meet please
say hi and if you're not there then
don't forget to follow the livestream
it's actually the first link in the
description it's really gonna be awesome
let's see what the 1 + 7 pro is all
about now let's talk about deals i now
understand why we see so many deals
every single day on amazon for Apple
products I had not noticed it they had
now become an official Apple retailer so
that means that we get deals all the
time now we've got $200 off the 11 inch
and the 12 point 9 inch iPad pros the
new ones that are crazy expensive I love
my iPad pro 11 inch so you can learn
more about that in the description as
well now let's talk about iOS 12.3 since
we're talking about Apple it just
launched and you actually do want to
upgrade your phones the main reason why
is because airplay support now comes to
third-party products that are not
necessarily just the Apple TV so I was
in the market to buy an Apple TV now I'm
not Samsung Smart TVs are now supporting
it obviously there are gonna be more in
the lineup clearly Apple is becoming
more of a services company they're not
worried about their new their old hobby
from like 10 years ago which was the
Apple TV now let's move the spotlight
over to honor we've got it have been
happening in London on May 21st I'm
actually gonna be at the event and well
we hear that we're getting up to three
phones we only expect that the 120 which
is literally the only thing that the
company has ever launched on or 10 on
our 9 etc now it seems to know it's
gonna be the honor 20 apparently there's
gonna be a pro variant according to
rumours and there's also going to be a
library but the interesting part is that
I understand that the lights actually
already in
market depending on the country you're
in so yeah probably that's just gonna be
the official unveiling in Europe
whatever the case may be
stay tuned and finally bub should I call
them hottest news weirdest news are
definitely gonna be about iPhones and
well we've got more case moulds now
coming from mark Berman we've seen the
triple cameras now we've got a case mold
not just the case design through the
iPhone 11 our that also has that
horrible camera hump but only two
cameras I honestly don't understand what
the point is and launching a less
expensive phone or a heart with a car
horrible camera hum that's not really
serving a purpose whatever the case may
be let us know in the comments what do
you think I mean do you think that it's
smarter for Apple to launch one design
across the board or do you think that
this iPhone 11 talk should just have the
same camera design that we currently see
in the iPhones and ask or it's just the
vertical design and that said no need
for the stove whatever the case may be
I like the current iPhone 11s sorry
iPhone 10s design so long as they fix
the camera hum but that's just me leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow us
