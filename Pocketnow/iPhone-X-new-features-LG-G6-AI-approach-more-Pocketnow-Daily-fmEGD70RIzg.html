serious about wireless charging some new
teasers have LG telling us the d6 might
be smarter than we think
and these foldable Samsung Galaxy rumors
continue to get louder and louder I'm
Jaime Matta Ravenna and the Spider Man
and Deadpool would ever do a movie I'm
sure this is most likely what it would
look like this is parking out daily
the official news today do not begin
with deals it seems that companies are
going cheap on Fridays but anyways we've
got some very interesting photographs
that I've emerged by certain users that
claim scrapes on their mat iPhone 7
iPhone 7 plus as well I'll be honest I
have a matte black iPhone 7 plus that
thing fell off directly into concrete I
actually had it replaced but the chip at
the top did reveal metal that than it to
hit a struck a pebble it doesn't show
the same kind of fall as these users
have had where apparently it's just the
simple scrape which is really odd for
anodized aluminum remember the problems
that happen with the space black iPhone
7 no iPhone 5 back in the day so yeah
just buyers beware and for those of you
that don't believe that foldable
smartphones are going to happen and I am
included on that list I have seen
foldable displays but never a foldable
battery chassis or whatever but anyways
there are some sources that are claiming
that Samsung is planning to launch these
foldable smartphones as early as q4 2017
so for those of you that are planning to
buy something weird this year might as
well hold that for Halloween and let's
keep the news with Samsung we've got
this very interesting new trademark that
has just emerged we've heard about
Samsung bixby viv or whatever that
digital assistant is going to be called
the trademark is Samsung hello not just
hello because that would belong to Adele
and that's even not trademark for tech
but anyways he has samsung hello is
going to be apparently the name of the
company's new digital assistant we
wonder exactly how well that will
perform we can not wait to see it
and since we are talking about the
things that have to do with artificial
intelligence LG has just brought this
new teaser of the g6 rather interesting
as we notice that the company is
claiming that this phone is going to be
less artificial more intelligent and you
wonder exactly what that means mainly
because first of all LG is clearly not
making a digital assistant mainly with
its partnership with Google I doubt
that's going to be the case so we wonder
how this company plans to make this
phone less artificial more intelligent
with the same google assistant we'll see
and finally the very hot news today have
to do with the iPhone X iPhone 8
whatever that thing is going to be
called we've got some trusted sources
that have gotten rumors right in the
past that claim a couple of changes that
Apple is investing on apparently the
phone is going to become listen to this
five dollars more expensive and what
you're getting is enhanced 3d touch
modules in addition to a graphite sheet
for it to do better heat dissipation but
the most important one is wireless
charging Apple has brought wireless
charging in its own way to the Apple
watch and we've wondered when we're
getting that on its mobile devices not
that I complain much about that but the
interesting part is those five dollars
compared to the $1000 that we hear is
going to be the new price tag for the
iPhone eggs so it leads me to the
question of the day how much do you care
about things like for example wireless
charging or things like 3d touch for
that matter because in my case I rarely
use 3d touch 1 &amp;amp; 2 I honestly hate
wireless charging for me it's pointless
for you not to be able to use your phone
because it's on a pad and it's just
there and it sits there and it can't
really even charge any faster but
anyways live as a comment down below
