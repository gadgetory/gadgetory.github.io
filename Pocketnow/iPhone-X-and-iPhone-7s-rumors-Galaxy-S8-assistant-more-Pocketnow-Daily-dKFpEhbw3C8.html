design and even a new approach the 7s
Nintendo finally decides to extensive a
Mario run to Android sort of and the
Samsung Galaxy s8 might bring a new
approach to Virtual Assistants after all
I'm hi Natalie then and the biggest
problem was recording videos in rush
hour is that everybody starts honking
the minute I hit record this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
comes from LG as the company has made it
official we can expect its future hot
announcement that have to do with play
as of MWC we have already our
presentations for February 26 and
believe it or not we have a lot of
expectations for this g6 or at least we
hope that's what it's going to be called
now it's all the spotlight over to
Nintendo and Super Mario run definitely
one of the biggest caveats of this game
is that unless you're running iOS you
can't play it right now but Nintendo has
made it official that it will launch
Super Mario run for Android in March you
can actually pre-register as of now prom
is like in the last time we don't really
get a specific date we will keep you
posted as we learn more now let's talk
about Samsung as we've got some trusted
sources claiming that the biz assistance
is coming we hated s voice we're loving
what Google is doing with the assistant
we're wondering why would we need
another virtual assistant but it seems
that Samsung wants to approach this
differently obviously it wants to bring
its own artificial intelligence in
addition to also bringing new features
that are kind of old like the fact that
you can take photos and be able to
translate text on the go with your
camera these things are apparently going
to come to this newest system that
currently can't be done by the existing
ones let's just see how well these are
any better than what's currently out
there I'm supposed to be waiting for the
next generation I've had I know I am one
of those people it seems that Apple
might take a little longer in being able
to launch these products apparently
according to trusted sources we are
going to have to wait until the second
half of 2017 mainly because it seems
that Cupertino still has to work on its
Apple pencil of whatever the case may be
we will keep you posted and finally a
very hot news day
have to do with the iPhone 8 finally
moving away from the Galaxy s8 rumors it
seems that Apple plans to do something
really interesting this year
penny Cupertino is going to bring us the
iPhones but not in the way we thought
seems that there is this ex model that
will be the no holds bar iPhone the new
iPhone that will bring everything and
Alistair even predicting a wrap-around
display and what have you
all new innovations and then apparently
we are getting the 7s and 7s plus as the
incremental variance for those of you
that are out there for the basic regular
iPhone and this approach is interesting
mainly because we assume that this could
mean there could be a new pushin
software that will require the new
hardware because that would mean that
there would be no 7 + 7 + fill in the
market it leads me to the question of
the day do you think that it's a smart
approach for Apple to bring the 7s 7 s
plus in addition to the iPhone X which
could be the iPhone 8 well in my case I
think that the smartest thing would just
be to bring the iPhone X adjust price it
accordingly but hey leave us a comment
down below we looked into your opinion
