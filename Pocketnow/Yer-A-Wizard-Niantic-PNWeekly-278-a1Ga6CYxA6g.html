has your twittering improved now that
you have more characters to tweet apples
face ie defacing more sibling quirks the
Sprint t-mobile mergers off the tail is
off the table
not off the tail a Harry Potter AR game
is coming next year and Apple is back in
the security spotlight as the FBI
struggles to unlock the Texas shooters
iPhone plus we've got a special guest
this week MS Laura Fagan joining the
show to share her thoughts on all the
mobile news that's fit to print we've
got a lot to talk about so make sure
you're charged and ready for episode 2
7/8 of the PocketNow weekly a recorded
November 10th and Pacific this weekly
podcast is where we dis the second
discussed those gadgets that make your
lives mobile smartphones tablets and
wearables it's all the stuff you wished
existed when you were a kid and
twittering was just the thing Disney
characters did when they were smitten
with each other i'm juan carlos back now
senior editor pocketnow.com joined as
always by plucky podcast producer mr.
jules Wong out on the east coast how's
it going buddy boy it's very cold out
here I don't know how fast how why this
has changed so much like it's not it's
not winter nothing I know I know it's
it's it's like 68 degrees in Southern
California right now I I might have to
wear a hoodie today it's absolutely
likes man yeah that's that's really
there long story for you you should I
mean Californians we're not used to this
kind of inclement weather
speaking of inclement weather you know
what you guys missed preshow why we're
putting 5 minutes late this week we had
this massive burnout all three of us had
problems with hangouts that we had to
sort and we had to adjust settings my
microphone wasn't working and as you can
see unfortunately Laura does not have a
lower third because I believe it's
Andrew Wallace's fault
absolutely produce on Twitter I think
has infected her with a virus that
prevents her from having a lower third
on Google Hangouts but for whatever
reason after we were done sorting all
these problems we started talking about
our various collection of pocket knives
and a handy tool kit because that that
is pertinent to our brand
oh yeah absolutely it is very much on
topic I will throw out the the plug for
the Kelvin dot three six which is a a
hammer and it's like a socket set and
it's got a flashlight and it looks like
it came out of the movie gremlins and
when you really want to be in oh and the
tape measure
I always forget the tape measure and
when you really want to be intimidating
it's got like a flip action for your
screwdriver cuz you know pulling it out
like what's why would you put a review
for that like I should actually do a
full a full like the long-term review of
the Kelvin three six
you should also just see what tech you
can disassemble with us and put it on
that scale see I could get pretty far
because it does have an attachment for
like sort of a razor blade on it this
this podcast not sponsored by the Kelvin
dot three six
nobody will properly introduced online
and an author in her own right producing
her own tech commentary on YouTube at ms
Laura Fagan I thank you for joining this
week's episode of pocket net weekly and
thank you very much for having me
greetings from H p.m. Irish time and to
be fair boys it is close to zero degrees
Celsius here so from what I can
understand metric wise it's it's
sounding quite toasty over your side a
warm three degrees oh no I was saying
sixty-eight degrees Celsius in
California no North American of me I do
apologize
well for now from now on I believe that
we should just move on to Kelvin and you
saying absolutely was funnier track
because this podcast will not be if this
is this is a lull and which which makes
it more enjoyable in one sense but it's
also kind of a we're all just burnt out
it's been a really slow
that with us if you want to hate and
love and and just give supportive back
Pat's reach-arounds whatever you can do
that's right going onto Twitter hi we'll
take converting back pots right for
Laura I don't know about you but maybe
just like a professional handshake with
eye contact
I really I really like where this is
headed already and I do weekly so we
already have a couple people tweeting in
hashtag P and weekly one Andrew Wallace
apologizes profusely for infecting you
with the missing lower-third disease
Peter hatin is already jumping on
Andrews case for infecting you with the
missing lower-third disease and Peter
Hayden already has some choice words for
the Twitter story that we're going to be
talking about later so already some
really fun conversation striking up now
for the live broadcast if you're joining
us after the fact um you can still send
us a traditional slower I mean like I
love that we used to call it like snail
mail because now it feels like email is
that kind of slower communique but yeah
yeah takes so long to get through the
pop3 servers like it's true that's true
and and it's podcast at pocketnow.com is
that the you know i think i think i
think it i think it's it's um like go
with what i said and we are gonna be
doing a listener mailbag at the end of
the month so make sure you get those
sent in we're gonna be having some we're
actually we've already got a couple
choice emails pick that already and we
will be covering your questions later
but we do have some stories to jump into
this news from the week jules you want
to
been on this first one oh yeah the fun
poking poking a stick it at the iPhone
10 in the new face ID that we're gonna
talk about in the two segments so let's
just go through what just went on in in
order because we can just lays around
and talk about this so um face ID it's
the new hot thing that you're looking at
if you have an iPhone X iPhone 10 we're
not gonna get used to it
shut up Apple anyways if you're looking
into it and you have a brother or
sibling or somewhat a sister other
person that looks kind of familiar to
you there's some sort of genetic code
base with you it's not even like a evil
twin you don't have to have that it's
you at some point if you use the same
phone for a while then hid will actually
recognize both faces and to some point
now it's it's temporary data apparently
and well I really wish that we had the
video going on here because we have a
couple of videos from the kind of
brothers and also I believe are the some
so on that's why the Ciroc brothers who
have been able to show this off in terms
of you have to have you have to be able
to have like both people have had to
have unlocked usage for a good while
before on faces it's not like it log
faces permanently it's just temporary
this apparently is more of a control so
that if your face gets misaligned in any
way if maybe I mean we've heard of acid
attacks from people who have been I
don't know that that's why the features
designed I don't think I mean yes we
have heard an accident I don't know
that's what Cooper Tino's focus was for
face ID for this system so okay
first of all let's just jump in real
quick I I think we're all tired of the
the face ID twin test videos we've seen
varying outcomes to these tests I think
Mashable was one of the first out of the
gate with their twin test where they
trained they in the video they show
someone training one twin with the phone
then they obnoxiously have the twins
like change seats not just pass the
phone back and forth but like I'm gonna
sit in the chair that you were sitting
in now for no good reason just for the
dramatics of doing this test and then
the other twin is able to unlock the
phone they're able to do it with glasses
on glasses off and this is part of the
comment area that I think Apple made a
point of addressing where if you have
family members that look like you then
it's highly likely that the face ID
isn't going to be as secure as you know
you random stranger picks up your phone
and isn't isn't able to unlock it
because they don't look anything like
you first of all I think we can all say
we're tired of people trying to do this
twin test and seeing different outcomes
and obviously how you conducted the test
is very important but when we're
starting to see some of these other like
what what the what the can of brothers
are doing you know because they're not
twins they're just closely related
that's where you know we do want to
start talking about the system that
Apple uses to learn your face and
hopefully that that's a system that's
being improved over time yeah and I mean
face ID has is still relatively new and
even though that this is arguably the
most advanced implementation of a dot
matrix projection you know that the
Galaxy phones also do that nowadays but
to a lesser extent Lessard complication
Laura I was wondering what sort of
experience you've had in terms of being
able to interact with this kind of thing
and perhaps manipulating its - yes what
phones have you hacked and so you know
so here is my
firing history from 2009 all the
way-ay-ay on the line - and you just
keep keep vamping and i'll get well I
suppose I don't have any direct I'm
currently a proud owner of a notion
myself so when it comes to iris scanning
and all that I have found more hits more
misses than hits in terms of that so I
don't actually use it as my primary
source of unlocking but funnily enough I
do come from a very genetically inclined
family I have three sets of sisters on
who are cousins either side who all look
pretty much identical to each other and
they all use iPhones so there has been
they have actually been kind of
contacting me being like so what about
this whole face ID thing is like is like
blah blah blah I'm gonna manage to get
into my phone and that's actually been a
legit concern because you know they're
the kind of people who swap clothes and
don't kind of tell each other so so
there is a legit concern amongst them
being like you know I don't want you you
know I love you but no I don't want you
dead for all of them I guess no that's
not that's pretty much what I've been
saying I'm like you know wait I know
it's over like touch ID because
supposedly face ID is supposed to be
more secure than touch ID how fun factor
of 200 or 20 or something I don't know
two hundred twenty twenty yeah I mean I
think they said it was well according to
Apple I think touch ID is supposed to be
secured a 1:1 to fifty thousand in the
population and face ID is supposed to be
secure one-to-one million in the
population major disclaimer unless you
have family members that look like you
then that rate drops significantly
apparently but I think that there is
something interesting about biometric
security using fingers as opposed to
using your face where conceivably I mean
in your in your situation there Laura I
mean like you know siblings could try
and get into each other's phones because
you know what face your sibling used to
train the phone you don't necessarily
always know what finger someone used to
train the phone so even I den
twins even assuming identical twins had
identical fingerprints they could be
using different fingers to lock down and
that's actually one added piece of
security that you don't have with your
face which is a very weird thing to say
really if you think about a shoe III you
know Laura if I were to try and like you
know pack your phone with a face on lock
I'm pretty sure I know what face you
used took it's betraying your phone you
know where the dots have a line
basically and speaking of that no day do
you still have the case that will I
share our fun story about going to the
Samsung all the anecdotes we can to fill
out however long this podcast is if we
can be slightly lined up with the
excellent guests we have yeah I I'm not
I'm not filler myself and myself and
Mark who is my husband we went on
honeymoon and obviously because I'm a
bit mental I decided that I was going to
go to New York to see Jill's
for the first like I know that's mental
so we were do I think we were due to
meet Jaime after Samsung store her but
he got a little bit delayed so we
decided to go in ahead and we found that
there was a create your own case booth
and there was no kind of entry point for
any sort of credit card details or
anything like that so we just between
myself mark and Jules we drew the most
random crap on this case thinking that
it would come to nothing that I just get
an email to be like okay here's the cost
of the case and myself congeals went to
sit down and then suddenly there was
just this guy calling my name and like
the three of us were just like should
should we should we even acknowledge
that we're here cause like a couple of
your things broke and we were kinda
certain that we were gonna get kicked
out at this point with the case and
we're like oh if we knew we would have
actually probably doesn't something nice
memory at the moment I saw
oh this is great case okay and one part
of the the signature got clipped by the
camera
port because you know unacceptable you
see and this is this is why you can't
even use Samsung phones anymore nice
grapefruit juice at the cafe
well not that glad to hear that
definitely buy a thousand dollar phone
based off of that four dollar purchases
yeah absolutely
how you base all of your purchasing
decisions from here on there I think
I've exhausted the comedic potential of
face ID I'm just gonna put it out there
in general the general disclaimer from
here on out we're done with face I
detest videos if you're trying to shoot
one now just scrap it and move on to
some other more relevant talking point
and I think the tech community will
appreciate that better um we do actually
want to switch to Samsung for our next
story this one is very exciting for me
because it's my favorite Samsung of the
year and it's funny because I include
these kinds of stories just to appease
Kuan and just yes literally just the me
story and it's because the Galaxy s8
active will no longer be an AT&amp;amp;T
exclusive the only galaxy Verizon no I'm
fine with it would the only galaxy of
the year did not have curved glass on
the front the only galaxy of the year to
not have curved glass on the back or any
glass on the back and the galaxy with
the largest battery of the year is now
officially coming to t-mobile and Sprint
and I think that is a baller move it's
about time the active lineup showed on
other carriers other than 18 t yeah
that's it's a great thing especially
when AT&amp;amp;T has had that exclusive a year
on year on year and every so often we
got a little hint of of a galaxy active
like we got that with the sport yeah the
sub sprint had to get outs or something
like that you know Galaxy s5 active
sports from 2014 and
you know now you can just go full
measure of course it's kind of a shame
that this is the year that had to happen
because of the note eight and how close
those things were together with the
launch at AT&amp;amp;T so now it's whole whole
first half of the year strategy was
pushed back in in an obnoxious way
because like the note feels like it was
still fairly on the timetable I mean
just leading right up to two Aoife but I
wonder if maybe part of the reason 18t
wasn't making as much noise about this
phone is because that they only had a
limited exclusivity on it that's
interesting could be the other way
around I'm not sure could be oh well one
of the things that I think well I know
this doesn't really carry on from the
carrier conversation but it is something
that I've always been curious about and
I'm willing to be start to be to be you
know corrected on this but like the
additive lines for the oh yeah well I'm
sure you will any opportunity to tell
someone they're wrong say my name in
front of a mirror three times the active
line have not made a steady appearance
within Europe and that completely
baffles me like I don't understand that
in like of frickin active durable phones
in Europe hasn't there yeah I mean the
only ones that I kind of see that you
would even get imported are like branded
ones from like from people who make like
construction equipment
oh yeah and so that doesn't make sense
to me I mean a good anecdote and he's
gonna kill me for saying this but my one
of my best friends moved across to
England to do and construction as a
surveyor
and uh and he's really into a stack so I
would be as the good best friend I would
give him like dual SIM phones and stuff
that you can't regularly find here and
he's broken every single one of them
while on the job or out on a run so
something like an active would see
somebody like Cory absolutely down to
the ground for somebody who just
religiously smashes and what been safe
if you did not just mention Corey's name
there and you'd be okay yeah Cory we're
calling you out in your phone breaking
yeah I know I I literally it was his
birthday and I got home M 2016 J -
there's such a horse I'm talking about
Cory
Oh for his right if I went to the
trouble of getting someone like like I
don't know like an honor six and they
smashed it I mean like come on now for
him for his offenders of abetting I was
just continuing the mahkum get a case
dude and a screen protector
no man maybe a deep slick raps or
whatever the game's phone can you
sponsored it's not I mean you know it's
better just make it get it I'm just
thinking there's a market of Cory's
right there when when the because no I
agree when the first when the first
active came out part of this
conversation they still kind of fixate
on like dude bro manly man construction
job site kind of stuff I think it was
with the UH the galaxy s5 active I think
is the one where they switched from the
metal back to the to the poly car back
to the refined band-aid it still had the
just the camo print with the grippy
texture on the back it looked like armor
not not like that I thought it was like
the shiny shiny metal thing and not the
polycarbonate of the
five no no yes four had a medal back yes
five just went to the hard plastic bag
it was still a removable battery that
which that was a mistake I think it was
just the same back that they used for
the for the s6 active - sorry I'm deep
in the weeds you guys don't care about
this um but when the s5 active came out
that was I I would I I sold so many of
those to family and friends for parents
it's like the first time you pick up a
phone it was one of the first times I
think anyone had seen a phone that you
could you know it looked kind of like a
chunky galaxy it looked like the galaxy
in a case the back fit together much
better than the metal back which would
pop open really easily and you know I'm
at an event with family and friends and
a kid like handles my phone and then I
just take it over to a sink and I wash
it and that was like revolutionary like
no-one had ever seen but you know what
the crummy thing is was I remember when
I was sent out to the s7 active briefing
from AT&amp;amp;T and they returned it was it
was one of the promotion they were
starting to promote it as kind of they
didn't have an s6 active which you know
people were kind of bummed so I have yes
all right I don't know six active is the
one that looks the best cuz it came in
the blue camo print I'm a kind of sewer
of galaxy s6 active now you guys talk
I'm gonna go get it to myself okay I
like the s7 active was what they were
promoting the finishes done that and it
wasn't just like there's a camera and
stuff they also had a golden one and
they were starting to you know talk to
you know promote it to moms and yeah in
there you know with their prams and
strollers well I mean it's it on on a
serious note while one goes to you know
collect his camo collection and
yeah yeah well you know I think we just
roll with with the punches of what we
got one yeah but it's all seriousness
kid kid proof Tech is a real is a is a
real thing like and it's a real problem
so yeah you still have one major issue I
mean Galaxy s8 active is my favorite
galaxy of the year still have one major
problem where I would recommend people
throw a screen protector on them and
that's kind of tricky to find because of
the way that they always do the hardware
buttons and the front face and wait no I
don't think the s8 active has the front
buttons no that's all software now but
still because those phones aren't as
common there are fewer options for front
screen protection but you genuinely feel
like you don't need to leave the house
with a case because the whole back of
this is just reinforced and durable
plastic it was one of the things that
came up during I don't know um Laura
have you had a chance to check out a
pixel have they made it to your neck of
the woods yet no so any won't we don't
get any sort of M carriers who generally
can really have it so it is it is an
online thing only so it is a case of
talking amongst people to see it in the
wild I mean you do get the razor phone
so which was no bigger surprise to
anybody except me that it will actually
happened to come to my network as well
so I was very pleased about it yeah
that's that's that that's a pretty good
coup for you guys yeah hopefully gonna
be getting to play with one next week so
I'm looking forward to that but the port
for ringing up the pixel is the pixel I
think does his wonderful job of
demonstrating that a plasticy feeling
phone can still feel like a premium
device but they arrived at that with
this really easy to chip paint kind of
like LG g5 style and at this point like
I keep handling you know you know
durable phones rugged phones are always
made out of this sort of grippy textured
armor-plated plastic I've gone back to
my Lumias my old Nokia devices and all
of these things like I would love to see
a flagship man you
again I come out with something other
than glass on a premium device maybe it
doesn't need to be plastic
I don't know that ceramic really fixes
this problem we're gonna be talking
about a phone that uses Kevlar for the
backplate later in this review there are
so many other opportunities we have to
come up with something that's lifestyle
durable I finally got to handle an
iPhone 10 and I did not like the hand
feel of that gadget on something that
requires hand moving gestures on a
slippery glass backplate at $1,000
didn't feel like a wise investment to me
when I know I'm gonna have to cover that
thing in a case anyway and it was kind
of shameful with the whole oh it's the
most reinforced glass I ever hint people
were still it would like people had to
do a spiteful spiteful dropped us just
to say you know it's the glass it's not
even the glass it's you know we're
making aluminum even aircraft grade
aluminum whatever whatever claims are
trying to make for that well the iPhone
8 plus slid out of my pocket from a
height of less than two feet and landed
softly into mud with concrete underneath
it and it was enough to dent the frame
and cracked the glass on the iPhone so
this wasn't even a drop from waist
height I finally got it replaced we
finally um got the Apple care all taken
care of and got it swapped out that's a
whole other story that maybe I'll just
write an editorial on that doesn't
inspire a lot of confidence on an eight
hundred and fifty dollar phone when a
similar drop with you know one of my
galaxy actives would have been like like
you wouldn't even have a blinked like it
wouldn't it would have been a complete
non-issue and and it's that kind of
stuff like I I love what we're doing in
terms of design I would love to see any
other manufacturer addressing lifestyle
durability seriously and with the
consumer focus in mind indeed and it's
while we're talking about multiple
materials and pixels and what no wait no
that's next story damn it I thought
we've got a segue and said like
something proper but instead breaks I
and this is gonna get segways we can
expect right now actually you know what
well let me throw this one right out to
you while we're sort of explaining this
this this next story Laura you you're
using the note eight
now obviously the microphones are
completely alright like you can't can't
make phone calls or record video with
audio or anything I mean that that's
that much is obviously true no it was a
rescue as much as that was a point out
of what I just did not overtly moving
right along see so lots of people this
issue has been coming along since the
end of September at the earliest which
has been some people have not been able
to make calls some people have not been
able to talk their microphones I'm
picking up people are saying that they
can't hear them and it's because
suddenly unless they're on speakerphone
which uses multiple mics I believe but
you know that main receive and will not
receive it but the microphone that you
use to talk with is not working and took
a little while started to wonder and
then then it actually worked because the
the way that you you fix this problem
for some people is how you can fix it
intend oh yeah I know 64 which I still
have somewhere lying around here those
lovely old game cartridges you blow into
the the gap you blow into the USBC port
microphone part and and suddenly it gets
fixed now I'll joking aside Laurie
you've been using your note a for a
little while I mean have you faced
anything like that
I know date is no longer a daily driver
from touch touch would now I have not
had any issues with phone calls I'd like
so
yeah it's it's interesting people well
only we do have this note so we're
talking about a device that's got an IP
68 water and dust resistance rating
ingress protection but there is still
something to be said like a microphone
works by having some kind of hole in the
device that vibrations of sound can
interact with a membrane designed to
capture those vibrations and so I don't
know that you can create an ingress
protection rating that properly
addresses the fact that you know lint
can get into dust other material can get
into that because oh I'm sorry Jules
good because I was just gonna say you we
wouldn't expect em to take your no date
for a swim pull it out of the water and
instantly be able to use the charging
port or one of the microphones because
we understand water is gonna get that
hole and we need to let that kind of
drain out before you can use something
like a mic well before you go completely
nuts on the hole dust issue because
apparently some people have had some
software triggers - like turning off the
microphone privileges for the google app
so it's not exactly clear what's going
on but to say at the very least that if
on the microphone port is a solution a
bodge to this then because we when we
sent over these stories to you I'm
getting the sense that this is probably
a couple different problems with a
couple different phones I don't know
that I'm seeing anything here that makes
me think that there is one consistent
issue with voice activation software or
with microphone blockage that I think
people need to be overly concerned with
and now an I'd agree I mean there is
just too many reasons why something like
this would happen that you'd need to
kind of have a solid process of
elimination before you could really
identify if there is something else
going on
with this I mean you could just be you
know you could just have a tissue in
your pocket along with your phone and a
little bit of lint get into it and
and you're suddenly wondering oh you
know why this wasn't my mic working
obviously you know and so I mean I think
people do have to be a little bit savvy
now if the solution works the solution
works and that's not to be sort of you
know but I do think that I am as always
good common sense should be applied to
little bit take a look at some of these
issues and make some acknowledgement of
this because the report keep coming in
onto these threads and both Samsung as
community forums and as well as the
usual reddit twitter those sorts of
places so there's a completely in
agreement with you there and now that is
one of the situations that I think a
number of companies have performed
fairly poorly over the last year or two
and that's you have a fan base in your
you have a base in your community I
should say not a fan base you've got a
group of people in your community of
consumers who are voicing concerns over
potential issues and this seems to be
the year of companies staying really
quiet about problems until they are
either echo chambered to extraordinary
levels on the internet or until we see
like a fairly catastrophic disaster rate
of things falling apart in a particular
community
Samsung last year had some major issues
with the note and I feel like any kind
of negative press surrounding that name
of phone for Samsung should be dealt
with with extreme prejudice not left to
people sort of speculating in forums or
in red posts or something like that so I
completely agree with you there giuls
it's just I do this is one of the other
concerns I've got where the people who
are most apt to be discussing their
phones right now seem to be mostly on
the train of I had this problem with my
phone and this is the signal that's
getting amplified above anything else
and it's really hard I think for people
who might also be having a similar
problem or
concerned about issues to weed through
internet echo chambers to get into good
information on what might be going on
but that's exactly why this conversation
needs to happen top-down yeah you you
shouldn't be relying on internet forums
for your first wave of support and it is
kind of disturbing because I think we've
all dealt with this we're in our circle
of family and friends and other people
that are joining conversations were in
online where someone's like oh yeah hey
have you heard about this problem with
my phone my phone has this problem and
then I'll ask them well did you reach
out to the manufacturer and they said no
more common than it'd be in this age and
I think people have just been programmed
to I go to the Internet to complain and
people either mirror or argue with my
complaints and somewhere like step 37 in
my diagnostic process is contact
manufacturer when maybe that should be
more like step 5 or step 6
not like way at the bottom of your list
I think it just goes to show that the
overall communication system is broken
there if you're first because obviously
these people and I'm lumping myself in
and this most of us when we have an
issue with our phones we want it fixed
you know sharpest you want a favor we
want to fix immediately so most of the
time going on googling what might be the
issue is the quickest way of resolving
it rather than trying to find a number
for your local you know manufacturer
customer service waiting in the collar
line then being put on hold and then
having to go through all that when a
five minute Google could do the same
thing and I can also imagine from a
customer perspective it's also quite
frustrating to get finally get to the
end of that chain be talking to somebody
and the person on the other end of the
line is also just googling wash you're
googling as well I know for a fact at
least for here and the process of fixing
a phone here that that is broken even if
it is within your warranty we're not
automatically and allowed a swash it has
to be sent away for testing and that can
take weeks
so equally like they're not making this
process easy enough for people to
actually get the resources out there and
also on the note line that looks
something that I want to touch back on
what you said earlier I mean I think
there is a bit of hesitancy on the
Samson's parish to even utter that there
might be an issue with anything to do
with the notes because it's sold so well
because like even like they had aviation
authorities being like if anything even
looked like I know Devon like you were
you know you and your luggage were
effect on strong-arm about that plane
yes so I mean I mean but that's it
that's another real P or disaster and so
maybe they're trying to fight their
battles on this I'm not defending it
right you know and I agree I I this is
this is where I disagree with Samsung
staying quiet not that I disagree with
you I completely agree with you they are
very likely to be trying to keep any
potential noise under the radar as best
they can but this is also why a simple
statement for them saying hey you know
if you're having problems with
voice-activated bixby or Google
assistant that's one consideration and
if you're having problems with
microphones in phone calls that's a
different symptom of potentially a
different problem and we're here to
address those concerns for everybody in
this community please reach out use this
customer service number or this email
address and we'll try and get it sorted
and then Samsung's made an official
statement they've addressed individual
problems which are all kind of being
lumped into the same conversation and
it's a non-issue people get on with
their lives
I heard the note eight had this thing oh
no no Samsung is dealing with that that
was one person's mic and you get on with
your life I think it actually starts to
add up and look worse than it might
really be if you slow play it or you try
and keep that story under the radar
because then a bunch of people are just
commenting in this thread and that
thread starts to balloon well to be fair
it's either the noh8 line and rather
damning of Samsung in general this issue
actually also affects s eights as well
si so this is like the first I've been
hearing I've got the si plus in the note
but after the initial review burst
they're not phones that I turn to for my
daily driver is often so I'll I should
maybe pull my nope eight back out for a
while and see they're pretty high-end
yeah from this world's top phone
manufacturer like honestly it's kind of
a it's kind of a shame that we have to
be talking about this but your point to
when we're talking about the resources
for customers to get support this is
part of what should be rolled into the
price point on you know the device this
expensive I mean if we can't expect the
company to have avenues for consumer
outreach easily accessible then what's
really the benefit of owning this phone
over it's hilarious that I'm gonna say
premium mid range or mid range err in
the five to six hundred dollar price
free like that's now the middle of the
market five hundred dollars you can buy
a heck of a lot of phone for five
hundred dollars and get pretty much the
same support um speaking of support
issues problems people might be looking
at I want to shift gears into our next
story where again this has been not the
smoothest lunch especially in the way
that geeks like to dissect devices the
pixel to excel not utilizing the full
wattage allowed by the adapter there's a
quick charging technology on the pixel
to excel it doesn't seem like the phone
is really pulling everything that it
could no again no official word from
Google as to what's going on but yeah
III wonder is this maybe a conservative
I can serve your wants to temperatures
or if this is a feature and not a bug
support this is what USB power delivery
which you a dual has been really
advocating as part of adhering to USB C
spec for Android so there's that part of
the story and even with USB power
delivery we're supposed to get anywhere
from five to a hundred watts
just you know from that and in this case
80 watts google says was the most
optimal and that we shouldn't even with
a 27 water whatever higher wattage
charger we would only get at most 18
watts but to not even deliver on that on
the build advertised rate it's kind of a
shame I keep using the word shame in
this guess they don't know why in any
case the the whole like it the person
who was researching this I believe was
Nathan K he doesn't say what his last
name is but he took a really a very
detailed approach into looking at this
and found that there were only two power
stages where one was a constant voltage
when was a constant current and he
compared it to other phones which had
more of those stages excuse me
and it would be more time efficient I
mean when we're talking about 15% to
full this was a two and a half hour
cycle which is not good now there is
that it's terrible but it's not it's not
great there is that temperature factor
to it and you guys talked about this
before but when we're back with the 6p
than with the Snapdragon 810 and Hilda
3.0 I think that was a pretty runaway
kind of a deal and it turns out that
we're looking at pretty healthy
temperatures nothing above 33 degrees
Celsius in any case for the pixel to
excels so there's that wait between like
efficiency in terms of time and power
and power exerted and longevity for the
battery because at some point that start
coming down a bit so well and he kills
electronics it's one of those things
where for a lot of phones that charge
fast I wouldn't mind a slow or trickle
charge setting
by at least when you're doing that you
want to be clear with the consumer that
if we're gonna do this like maybe if
it's set for overnights hey this is a
feature it's gonna charge a little
slowly during the overnight so that it
saves on battery and and that's that's
again I mean it's one of the biggest
problems that I think a lot of
manufacturers face is conveyance and
describing to consumers just WTF is
actually happening inside your super
powerful pocketable computer I I wonder
if part of this isn't the fact that
we're utilizing the actual USB spec and
not qual comes variant of a fast
charging solution I'm not sure if good
because Google has to be you know is
taking authority it's like hey this is
made by Google I would just hope that
they deactivated the quick charge or not
have not included a quick charge why
control it with this story shows is
evidence that we're you know it's using
a Qualcomm chipset but it's not using
Qualcomm's
system for power delivery I don't know
still USB powered I mean it's still like
that the basic spec of things and if
that's not if that has control over
itself then what we're doing here all
that matters is that if it's not putting
out 18 watts this is this is the BS
situation well but that's that's what I
that's that's what I mean is how we're
measuring this and we're saying is if
it's not utilizing the maximum wattage
of this system then what we could be
looking at is USBC power delivery
getting in to say we're measuring the
consistency of the power delivery we're
measuring the the heat of the gadget and
they have likely they have different
thresholds and ratings and qualities for
those metrics than what Qualcomm might
use for their quick charge spec and I
think that might be one of the
differences because I don't know what
other weather I honestly am not aware of
what other phones are currently using PD
over qc3 yeah
yeah that's one thing but at the end of
the day this is a consumer matter where
you know if you're charging for however
long you when you're building you know
half an hour this much power it's make
sense this is I'm still saying I'll
chalk this up to a bummer that this
phone doesn't seem to charge as quickly
as some of the competition might but
again it's if we have reasons we should
be able to discuss what those reasons
aren't especially looking at this data I
mean that the block is off is efficient
it looks it's like power delivery might
be more conservative in what it allows
the the device to actually harness
especially when it's on and you know
elements like radios and CPU or actively
being used to that's I'm saying is it
looks like that could be the reason for
what's even worse if you take it on
four-hour drive if you use it for GPS
purposes and you have to keep the screen
on oh yeah - six watts which is barely
enough to keep it above the zero points
in terms of charging activity true I'm
glad we had this conversation things
like I you know I'm having a hard time
this this is all kind of coming back to
the tone of what we've been talking
about in technology this entire year I'm
having a hard time on this one trying to
gauge like if I should even be upset by
this you know we've gone through screen
burnin burnin issues with the OLED
supplied by LG I'm a little concerned
about the durability of the coding that
Google has selected for the paint there
seems to be in consistencies in how
digital audio is managed through the
headphone adapters that Google's
supplying between the pixel - in the
pixel to Excel and there's a part of me
that almost wants to say like the
battery is not exploding it's still
charging relatively quickly if it's not
the fastest
I'm not too concerned with that the
phone staying cool wallets wallets being
charged you know oh I'll call this one
Mulligan Oh mothers to me is that my
like if I need a quick charge to get me
through the rest of the day from like
6:00 to 2:00 a.m. for some reason just
10 minutes on the charger that better
not run down to zero by the time oh yeah
so I mean and again like it is so funny
I can't remember who I was talking about
this with a couple days ago but we were
just like reminiscing and how scary the
situation was on my blackberry Prive
where while it was charging so you like
Android tries to do that thing you know
you're you're on your home Wi-Fi you're
charging your phone that should be the
safest time to run updates or to update
your apps and anytime the Wi-Fi radio
was engaged on that phone while it was
plugged in it would still drain faster
than the phone could charge while the
phone would get screamingly scary hot to
the touch and like again I'm looking at
this pixel txl going you know what it's
not that bad whether or not it's
charging as fast as it possibly could be
rated to charge when we two years ago we
had phones that would be like scary hot
space heaters in your pocket I'm almost
willing to call this one you know like a
mulligan for 4gu but you know what's
gonna get hot in your pocket starting
next year right are you a fanboy of the
galaxy active series but you're also a
fan of them what well you called this I
like I like a phone of 2017 because it
is objectively the sexiest phone
objectively you're you be wrong to
object that that's a double negative
right there
so long as it gets a positive meaning
yeah III think in terms of pure design
this is the phone that I think has
approached closest for me those
symmetrical design accents that I really
like to see manufacturers pay attention
to the way people pro the hawala we made
10 Pro I'll hold it up again in its
plastic in its bumper case again a glass
back phone but they supply a bumper case
in the packaging because glass is not a
very lifestyle durable material to make
a consumer electronic portable device
out of um no III got a lot of hate on
that I literally called it in the title
and people were fighting me on it and
you're like oh I think you meant iPhone
10 and you're like well the iPhone 10 is
a good-looking phone I hate the camera
placement I hate the vertical stripe on
the camera placement right at the upper
edge of that where it's really easy for
a fingertip to kind of walk in on your
shot and any phone with a unibrow
instantly loses loses the debate on most
attractive gadget of the year I don't
care how into Adventure Time or Batman
you are those little ears on the sides
of the screen
you lose good day sir I said good day so
anyways it's gonna be on a TNC
apparently we have heard from funky
Huawei and ex Dae that talks about this
we're not sure if to make tenants the
the regular may 10 is going to be
brought about to the US but we do have
firmware dumps with services from AT&amp;amp;T
on this and in all likelihood we'll see
it announced at CES 2018 all right now
you talk about the ads because actually
you know Laura I was just gonna ask
first I mean so wow it was a company I
was really happy to see lots of general
consumers using in Germany um when I
went out when I went out for Eva that
the huawei brand like I was in a two or
three cabs where drivers were using them
as their play
just there navigation phones devices is
this a company that's that's made it to
your neck of the woods in any serious
way and it's like it's actually it's
actually really funny that you mention
us because a lot of the startups around
in Dublin most of those kind of in that
scene who always are a big thing because
they're seen as being real kind of bang
for your buck both aesthetically and
internally and it's funny because when a
couple of my tech friends are in the
scene knew that I was coming on today
they were immediately like are you gonna
be talking about the Miche you're gonna
be talking about me so it's really it's
really interesting to see the shift in
dynamic from like the main players to to
this year so it's certainly gaining and
they're just kind of knocking them out
so it's very it's very funny to see like
you know the p-series and also the mate
series and these kind of what we would
have previously referred to as kind of
spurious brands kind of unknown brands
just slowly taking up more and more
shelf space in so it's really
interesting to see and iPhone in black
like I'm glad that there's you know
variety and it's not just kind of CTE
has it had had its chance this year with
AT&amp;amp;T by the way we had we had a couple
of we had a scoop with Andrew Wallace
last week about the axe on em our axe on
eight I was wondering if you wanted to
brag a little bit also about your yeah
Ziqi you won't reply to any of my
messages but apparently they're all into
like talking to you so yeah I mean I'm
obviously I'm obviously just special
obviously you're special it's obviously
like it's it's the fact that oh she's
she's Irish like it's it's up it's
obviously last it's your it's your
accent I think that yeah it is yeah but
yeah and I was talking to them to Trajan
they did confirm gosh
and the axe on em will be coming to
Europe and and over in the next kind of
course the next while which is really
exciting for me
and because I personally kind of fell in
love with us handset when I saw so
that would like like when I the stuff
that I kind of dreamed of when I was
kind of growing up like that was this
that I could do like that I could have
that kind of functionality because it
reminds me partly of my childhood of
like you know the the old kind of
Nintendo DSi s it has that kind of
profile and there's just there's there's
there's little there's nine year old
Laura inside of me who's just very
excited if you're watching like feel
free to just I was wondering if you were
having dreams of the Kyocera echo
because you know did I did fire it up it
does work but nothing really works with
it anymore
but I won't argue with little childhood
Laura in your heart so yeah we'll be
happy that you will eventually get the I
just kind of wrap up Huawei's a story
here right now this is exactly the kind
of move that I think we've been talking
about in certain circles where it still
doesn't mean that I don't hope to see
hallway try and aggressively put more
boots on the ground when we see the
honor brand showing up in targets but
then there's the inconsistency of honor
eight and to honor nine launches where
we had the honor eight in North America
then the honor nine never really made it
here and now there's talk of an 18 t
partnership I still call that progress
but I would like to see them work just a
bit more consistently on how they're
communicating with potential customers
I'd love to see any manufacturer I
really hope any company takes me up on
this just steals this idea from me
because I think it worked really well
for Samsung is to start putting little
like pop-up kiosks in shopping centers
you know like go to a popular mall and
put up a stand and say hey we've got a
really great phone you should check it
out and just any opportunity for
consumers to actually handle these
things it's really difficult putting
this hand this phone into someone's
hands and them not having some kind of
reaction
and you usually very very positive this
that's exactly the kind of I think of
outreach that accompany the third the
world's third largest manufacturer of
smartphones should be trying to look at
if they're really trying to crack open
North America is how I feel about that
yeah I totally agree
I think particularly I mean I am I come
from a slightly more frustrated stance
because we don't I mean we're a very
small island in you know on the edge of
Europe and we don't get very many
opportunities to engage with new tech as
it is outside of our carriers but it's
very difficult to import anything
because we've got this whole thing with
batteries and so I would love to see
more things like that kind of go on the
road you know and for there to be kind
of different use cases and different you
know different ways of exploring dec
that's what I want these conversations
about brands like essential you know
when they put up little pop-up come meet
the essential phones it was like in San
Francisco that's not the people who you
needed to like it's all on this phone I
needed to see one of those in like Des
Moines no I was thinking of Cedar Rapids
I really I was gonna say set it up a
Cedar Point and you know I'll fly out to
Ohio let's do this I am game before we
get to our sponsor plug we do have a
number of tweets coming in just on the
various stories that we've covered in
the first half of our news block here
from Rolla not olap or using the pn
weekly hashtag our phones have pretty
much every single detail of our lives
maybe two-factor authentication for some
app settings and pin plus fingerprint or
password plus face on lock should start
to become the norm I think that's
actually a pretty good idea I think on a
note there could be something really
compelling about like a fingerprint and
an iris scan if you really want to lock
that thing down yeah question from
answering policy who who infected your
computer Laura he's asking you
specifically
is there any kind of strong carrier
influence in Ireland or is the unlocked
market really how more people go about
buying their phones and average
consumers would mainly stick to carriers
and that would be your sort of
day-to-day and if you're in any way sort
of a tech head you have to venture
across the border that is just how it
works and but keep in mind like in terms
of carriers we only have three so you're
quite limited for choice in terms of
your options and three three three and
three carriers total three major kind of
carriers and within that kind of a
context that means you know you're sort
of being a little even a little broader
if someone has something specific that
they want to shop it's much more likely
to be an import situation absolutely I
mean most of the carrier's would stock
the same thing so yeah so so so your
choice is limited your choice is very
limited if you stick to it carriers and
if you're in any way interested at all
you know that it is it is employ or bust
so and let's see from Peter hatin Peter
Hickman actually dropped a bunch of
tweets but one of them talking when we
were talking about the active
positioning positioning of phones like
the active line were always really
interesting here in the UK where the
Sony Xperia Z line was new I remember
kiosks and shopping malls where they
would throw phones into a jug of water
because people just didn't believe it
was waterproof yeah I mean like now
water resistance is sort of an expected
feature on a high-end handset but there
is still something really interesting
about demonstrating that yeah actually
showing people that this stuff works the
way it does Panzer Z doesn't want people
to forget and we were talking about your
thousand-dollar iPhone 10 that the glass
replacement is five hundred dollars if
you crack that thing and you don't have
yourself some Apple care yeah it's like
it's read repairs like - something - in
the height - hundreds and then all of
the repairs are five MD ish
nope no thank you and so we do have a
couple others just to wrap this up uh-oh
where did I lost it
oh and Panzer Z also confirmed the
essential pH one and the iPhone 10 also
use USB powered delivery spec not
Qualcomm quick charging or any other
type of proprietary charging and while
deserve one
Andrew Wallace is asking what do I like
better the glass backed may 10 Pro or
the aluminum backed mate 9 and Andrew
Wallace has the mate 9 so just for the
sake I'm gonna say obviously the mate 9
is way better like you're missing out on
anything at all more puzzle that the
attached to the lower third he
communicates all through hieroglyphics
and gifs now addameer Frank a phenomenal
tech reviewer that you should be
following on YouTube at NIMH bug Damir
Frank one only thinks that mate 10 Pro
is the sexiest because he hasn't touched
the may 10 yet or has he I'm not sure I
only have the may 10 Pro I've not
touched the regular May 10 yet but I
don't know that my opinion would change
too drastically when it comes to design
now if we're talking about feature set
and expandable storage and a built-in
headphone jack
I would definitely feel different about
the features in both phones but when it
comes just to the aesthetics and what we
would like praised a company like
Samsung or LG for I really feel Huawei
has done the best job this year not
these phones are less attractive for the
may 10 existing but I think Huawei
actually has done the best job of
addressing balance and consistency in a
symmetrical design and I'm sure that's
probably been carried through on the
regular May 10 it's just I can't comment
as to that phone as I've not held one
yeah yeah
so with that thought bubble I guess pops
and a stream of new stories await us but
before that happens take a few moments
to talk about our smarts today we
absolutely show
and I'm gonna just kick over to my
script here they actually wrote a great
script for us this week so I'm just
gonna read it how probably best I'm not
gonna try and ad-lib on this because I
feel like a blipping has not been our
strongest test but you know what you
don't have to worry about with a privat

at this opportunity a shout out to MP
our reporter Danielle Kurtz Leoben one
of my favorites
with it reporters out there in
commenting about the
the Twitter the new Twitter character
limits of 280 ad um okay team 5
character Twitter let's do this
starting now and she then correct she
had to correct herself because wait wait
has more than five characters guys I
take it back
she also went through a whole bunch of
other Smash Mouth stuff including of
course the obligatory somebody once told
me
roeme
I had the sharpest ticket but we would
be talking about it's okay we are we are
the backup squad I can always back you
up on some Smash Mouth yeah yeah we're
gonna get a quick summary of these
stories and then choose a couple to
really go and definitely about because
we are Jules
go go go running through so yeah Twitter
is rolling out to everyone and not just
to a select group of people the 280
character limit after a few several
weeks of public testing and found that
only a few like maybe two percents of
tweets ever really go beyond 190
characters so I mean there's some savior
to that there's some there's some
release or relief to that as well
Niantic labs is working on a Harry
Potter game this mean made official by
Warner Brothers an ion took no real
details about Harry Potter Wizards you
Knights have been released just yet but
it'll be on the ilk of Pokemon go
ingress where it's a real world roving
AR game of some sorts we'll look forward
to that in the first quarter or excuse
me sometime in 2018 three years on from
CES 2015
because 2018 has not happened yet and
we're still talking about the saygus v2
aired the phone that apparently the
Snapdragon 800 won't die we got some
documents from the FCC that we looked at
and they were promising
they've been updating the promises every
so often and have been going on Twitter
rants about this and that and what's
been happening and apparently were still
dealing with these last twenty fifteen
or even twenty fourteen specs because
what we saw inside was a snapdragon 800
when the original phone was supposed to
have an eight no one so i mean make of
it what you will but that's always a
little quirk that we like to keep
checking in on every so often um one of
the reasons why I included this story in
here is because um of HTC and that is is
gonna be one of the new colors in Korea
for the Galaxy s8 and si+ it seems that
these colors keep coming around in
trends and will cycles because we're
talking about blue blue blue for all the
Galaxy phones as of recently deep sea
coral whatever the heck you want to put
an adjective to so red being the new big
unique color trend of 2017 is something
that I would get behind and this serious
story here
in which Apple said that they contacted
the FBI right after one of its special
agents held a press conference on their
investigation of Texas masked shooter
who killed 26 people and apparently
they're trying to get into their iPhones
they cannot at this points hoping to
find some motive or some information on
that phone The Washington Post reported
that was an iPhone and Apple coming with
that late response now if it were a
touch ID iPhone we don't know what mano
it is as of right now but if it weren't
uh chori enabled that would be more than
48 hours so they would have to have a
passcode touch ID would be deactivated
they would have to have the passcode and
this sends us back into the position of
having to see what
the government wants to take with an
encryption and they're going to demand a
backdoor that Apple code in a backdoor
for all this just like we did just like
we had to talk about last year with the
San Bernardino shooting dinner shooter
and all that happening so let's let's
save that one because I want to spend a
little time talking about that
immediately I think one of the most
important stories we have to talk about
since we have Laura on the show is how
you probably feel like you missed out on
your Samsung because they didn't get the
pretty red one because that's what girls
care about or like flashy jeweler phones
right Wow Wow that's that's that
stereotyping there it's true right so
you know I don't I don't they they're
they're pretty snazzy they're cheap but
they're snazzy but like I said red is a
universal but on a more serious note I
was quite kill to debate the fact that
and I didn't get my coral blue because
blue is my favorite color
so especially showing them off in public
those are the phones that people react
to the most like with my my honor eight
I got so many questions from people like
and like I be in line at a grocery store
and people would ask like what phone
what case I had on my iPhone but they
were genuinely interested in what this
shiny blue thing was yeah I mean I think
it's just because we've sort of grown
with this trend of just being you know
generic black slobs
so it is it's quite refreshing and it's
quite refreshing that we are getting
more options but I I will admit that I
am one of the kind of the girl ones who
you know because I am from Ireland and
we don't get these nice pretty things or
do we do we get them about a year and a
half too late when you've already bought
your hands and there was no bloody way
of knowing otherwise I do I sound
annoyed
think I sounded annoyed sounds super
bitter but not annoyed actually
supercilious get as they say oh no oh
actually one of the things that I wanted
to ask you guys is is how profoundly
have your lives changed now that twitter
has opened up the character count
because I don't know that I don't know
that like so I think I'm getting the
same number of tweets I'm literally
getting tweets with just a ton more
information in them people are asking
questions and are in conversation yeah I
only had I only have two tweets that
I've personally made one was lamenting
the lack of notification about this
whole thing that you had to find out by
looking at the circle instead of the the
number after hand of character Carol and
also one a reminder that your misery on
Twitter's genis a quoi is irrelevant to
the company's interests and that your
complaints on 280 have no meaning Wow
well very very there you go thank you
but you have just been told I guess
that's the final I'm what do you think
are the funniest things that you've seen
because I've seen some really kind of
hilarious ones like that somebody
somebody somebody retweeted a literal
game of connect of like Connect for that
two people were playing and it was the
most hilarious right I've ever seen
there's always these category categories
that you can use like oh you're
lamenting the actual 280 you're using
this to document something of some
absurd measure or you're just like the
whole you know make character emoji
houses and funny stuff because you have
more canvas I don't know that I've seen
anything so like jaw-dropping or
hilarious but I have seen people getting
a lot more aggressive with their they're
sort of a see symbol art you know like
more elaborate stuff per tweet and so I
mean that kind of stuff I always think
that's kind of cool when someone's
sort of like expanding on the
limitations of a platform
I don't know that 280 characters is
really gonna change my world much except
like it'll make me have to read through
more stuff when someone yeah me online
but I I don't know it's I was kind of
hoping to see like more this kind of
past what it was exclusive it was
something people were talking about like
oh my gosh I got you know 280 characters
and that's really exciting and now that
everyone has it I think aside from the
commentary on people talking about now
that we have it and then shrugging it
really doesn't seem to have changed much
at all in turn what Twitter is used for
how it's being used for people to have
conversations I agree entirely I don't
think the content of my feed has changed
at all other result of it it's just
gotten a bit more lengthy well any was
bad for me because I see lots of just
headlines and everything that's still
under even a hundred characters so oh
yeah there you go
and given that URLs URLs take still 23
characters each you can put in a few
more links if you want to you like
that's pretty much the most useful thing
that you get out of that mm-hmm I agree
so what there's I don't know a this
Niantic story Harry Potter AR game
coming out fine I just wanted a title
like none of these other stories I could
like really yeah and does it feel like
it's kind of a non-story like yeah
they're making noise that they got this
property and then they don't actually
have anything to share mmm it's a shame
so they're working on this with the WB
Studios port port key games which is
their little division now that's set up
with that and I guess lamentation going
on
cuz okay so it's a new game what does
this mean for us pokemons go people
because that was their big appeal that
sent kids flying around roads and
jaywalking in all that and people were
really like up and hip about that and
now some of them are worried well does
this mean that Niantic and going to
abandon us does this mean that several
servers will be more crowded because you
believe a very wide appeal kind of thing
going on too with the Harry Potter
franchise so I'm always continuing to
wonder if they're biting off more than
they could chew yeah yeah I definitely
think I think a number of people are
having concerns there lor were you ever
into the Pokemon go yeah I was I'm one
of those people who are who is a part of
several raid groups in my local area and
in town I'm one of those and so I I mean
this more concerns me than it does
anything else I mean you know kind of we
if anybody doesn't know what happened
with the whole neon tech kind of world
series when they were and releasing
their stronger is like everything
crushed and it was a disaster
and I'm not confident that you want to
be you know making both the Pokemon
people mad and like the like the two
kind of core fandoms of Harry Potter and
Pokemon you don't want to know that's
just that's just a bad time particularly
if they're suddenly going to be
competing for space in the same occasion
yes like then you're not going to really
know and then it's just going to be like
a load of random strangers walking
towards like big groups and it's just
like I wager you Pokemon person or you
re powder one unlike a pleaser does not
know gonna know what to do about that
like community of pokemons go sort of
maintained because I saw obviously like
a steep drop-off in just this sheer
quantity of people who were playing that
game but do you still encounter people
that like that are that are still hiking
out there for for Pokemon go not like
like there were it would be a regular
occurrence for people to just stop kind
of buying in the streets as they were
walking okay oh I've got to get this
yeah yeah I was guilty of it myself um
but there is less of that now but more
like any of the kind of core groups at
least that I've seen I mean the one that
we have in our in our local area is
about 20 strong and I mean the one in
the city it's over like 200 strong nice
for the ones that actually happened in
the city so what you think for the cup
but there's always going to be a core
kind of group of fans and people who
kind of keep something going regardless
right but I'm I'm really worried about
how this is going to be applied both as
a Harry Potter fan and how it's going to
affect me as a Pokemon fan - I
I really kind of unstruck my mad with my
imagination I struggle to see how this
is going to work because it makes sense
in a Pokemon capacity that you go out
and collect you know Pokemon while
you're outside because that's what you
would do if you no actually actually
lived in Kanto and what but in
Vermillion City
yeah but like if but Harry Potter is
based like around the whole mythology of
England and I'm struggling to kinda see
how like there there are certain
landmarks in that I'm struggling and
maybe the crossover is sort of more of
the mythical beasts you know sort of
additional storytelling world possibly
Rowling created - but then we'd have to
get rhettandlink into that - like maybe
maybe we will finally get an actual
augmented reality dueling platform so
instead of it being the real world
hiking exploration which Pokemon I think
encourages that kind of real world I
think there could be something really
compelling if Niantic could create a
real world dueling system yeah that is
built on a real AR platform it's going
to be bolstered by the iPhone 8 well
they I don't know that I
I'm not sure because I'm not a player
pokemons go I don't know if that ever
did make officially I know I've seen
like they're there if there are a lot of
features like there once you see all the
coverage of you know t-mobile and Sprint
offering up charging stations and and
Starbucks also and then you get like
free data mm-hmm for life if you play
pokemon go I once you turn into whole
unlimited data plan kind of thing that
certainly seems kind of silly and then
just like Android wear app engine C is
talking about waiting for his Android
wear Pokemon go app which was promised
right and deal hasn't come and there was
also like a band that I've had that was
supposed to have Pokemon go integration
it's funny to see all that kinda look
started to play did yeah and just
inflated you're kind of also worried now
well that has come to not and maybe like
ingress and I don't think anyone has
anything to worry about what I was
trying to make is we've seen like a
couple little tests I don't think we've
seen it in an actual release yet someone
please correct me if I'm wrong but I
think we've seen some tests of using AR
kit to augment Pokemon go I don't know
that that's actually made it out yet
where your your your characters and your
your captured critters will actually
interact with the world in a meaningful
way and and if it were to I think it
would also show up on Android first on a
Samsung device or on a pixel because
again you would need support for a our
core yeah
that being said shifting over to
something like wizards and duelists and
that kind of thing we could create with
a RK in a arc or a dueling system for
people to combat each other directly in
real world locations in a way that even
lenovo still requires a lot of
additional hardware for their jedi
experience you know putting on the
headset having some sort of
point puck that lights up for the
headset to track the the lightsaber that
has to interact and be paired with the
visor in a very special way if we could
create an experience akin to that
looking through a phone screen and the
only the only purchase someone needs to
make to use that is a piece of software
and the phone that's already in their
pocket then hopefully that wouldn't
overly step on the toes of Pokemon go
like they could continue iterating for
Pokemon go players creating a totally
separate experience for Harry Potter
fans yeah and moving them would be I'm
hoping that that's what they do well my
hope would be that they take the tools
that are being out there that are being
offered out there right now and start
incorporating them into their platform
which is still being used they still
that it's gonna be the same Niantic kind
of thing going on well yeah the whole
map based thing and whatnot and it does
it I'm not sure if that you know in
terms of many interactions you know it
could be the same but but if it is the
magical creature collecting game then
yeah I will be first in line to be upset
that 9sec is is sort of scraping the
bottom of the barrel of their ideas from
every left google they should never left
X I think I think many people would even
just agree that coming you know coming
out of the trees was a bad idea but we
should never have left the oceans last
story obviously the news that we're kind
of getting into those sort of murky
political waters where law enforcement
is needing to access data on a locked
device and it's causing another round of
people to talk about backdoors
for encryption on mobile devices and
giving law enforcement the keys to
access that kind of content and this is
one of those sticky situations because
again the way that the story is being
reported on as the story unfolds I find
it very troubling that a situation
happens like the the shooting in in
Texas and they
pick up information they pick up the
equipment that this person used if that
devices an iPhone that the first thing
the law enforcement didn't try to do was
contact Apple or use you know one of the
fingerprints of the slain assailant to
try and unlock the phone before a period
of time had passed where we are now into
the passcode lock window on on an iPhone
again if you if you regularly unlock
your phone you let the phone sit
overnight you're probably going to have
to put in a passcode you won't be able
to use touch ID to unlock the phone and
this is one of those opportunities where
law enforcement if they really want
information or they really want access
to that information they need to be
doing a better job of contacting
companies to try and support that
situation Apple should be finding out
about it from a press conference two
days after the fact exactly and I mean
this arguably sets them up for another
battle in the courts about this just as
we have with the San Bernardino case
interesting comments from the Department
of Justice's raag Rosenstein is a
inventor I'm running the place deputy
attorney general when you shoot dozens
of innocent American citizens we want
law enforcement to investigate your
communications and store data there are
things that we need to know as a matter
of fact no reasonable person questions
our right to access the phone but the
company that built it claims that it
purposely designed the operating system
so that bring the phone with and with an
order from I don't know if it's my
connection in yours jewels but robots
yeah you did a little bit ok so so I
mean getting getting what we could hear
from from that statement you know again
there's the political posture
/ what right school do consumers have
Laura in your neck of the woods
have there been any similar situations
where there have been appeals to tech
manufacturers or you know calls for
companies to break the locks that they
allow consumers to have on devices and
honestly no and we and or at least I can
only really talk for Ireland but not
even regularly in the news right here of
anything as unfortunate as what wants to
be happening over I mean we like if we
zoom out of the region and talk about
the UK which has been crafting
gregandanna messengers they've been
trying to talk about that in terms of
terrorist communications and how the
like the currents of you know the
fighters trying to recruit people in the
country going to Isis they've been
trying to crack down on telegram on
whatsapp and have also been demanding a
back door to their encryption guides so
it's it's something that I don't think
just because of that kind of reprieve
that we have however HAP's happenstance
it is because we're talking about many
many shootings where many investigations
need a phone yes the case that this is
all just yeah this is all just not fun
and games but I I do think that's good
one I do think that at least from
European perspective it's a bit
different and right now we don't have or
at least we are currently only in the
process of getting and certain we're on
currently dealing with those issues now
about data and things like that and so I
think for me well yeah so so we're only
kind of at the cusp of
kind of really getting into those
details in the first place and I know
that we are really pushing for kind of
at least within tech community in
Ireland we're really beginning to start
to push to you know to have the proper
legislation in place and to get our MPs
and the people who represent us really
in that mind frame because because we
come from a lot of our MPs would be
quite older and wouldn't necessarily see
the value of having this kind of
foresight and into situations like this
so the only kind of controversies that
we would be hearing of would be the ones
kind of overseas where we're hearing of
police departments in Scotland Yard or
wherever looking for looking to talk to
the likes of whatsapp or other groups
like that but we are still in the kind
of the very sort of infancy of even
beginning to work out what that means
for us here so although I mean I'm even
just doing a search for Ireland
encryption debate I'm seeing a number of
people that are actually trying to raise
discussion around this especially as it
pertains to I'm sorry I'm having to I'm
reading this in real time the retention
of data Act of 2011 and that how that is
potentially in breach of current EU law
and it sounds like there are some
rational points being made that this
type of data retention and this type of
accruing of consumer data is
unconstitutional which you know again
that you guys are actually getting to
join this conversation not in the
context of a very hot blooded and recent
tragedy um I think more in just the
relationship and how the EU is sort of
operating throughout Europe right now as
a governing body setting setting a tone
for the conversation at least seems I
don't know it seems to me that your
politicians I think are engaged in a
slightly more rational debate on the
merits of containing consumer
information or citizen information while
there are people on both sides of that
debate yeah it seems to be a bit more
informed as to the actual legal
precedent as opposed to making these
here in the United States I find often
that when someone is in favor of
breaking encryption locks on consumer
devices that it's a very emotional plea
that they're making and sort of ignoring
the context of we're building a backdoor
into your device that law enforcement
can get into and and you know often
that's sort of bridged by the sentiment
of if you have nothing if you're not
doing anything wrong then you shouldn't
have anything to hide it seems like the
conversation happening over there in
Ireland right now is a little bit more
nuanced yeah and and i think that just
purely comes from the fact that it's a
it's just a very slightly different
angle of the conversation that we're
currently talking about so it's
literally it hasn't it hasn't come up
and it probably should because you know
as kind of technology advances these are
unfortunately the realities of the world
that we live in right now so I mean
eventually someone's gonna get noon if
your information has not been
compromised by a data breach of any sort
you're wondering about your personal
privacy what you can do to at least
protect your own files and transmissions
and that was what was making all of us
worry about that crack attacked the
Wi-Fi 20 PA into it about it's a shame
that Android which had the password in
its November 6 level patch it that is
not going out to everyone the pixels and
nexuses are not going out getting that
this month so it's in terms of priority
I think that's all we really like talk
about in terms of you know our own
bubbles right going back to some of the
political part of it because I know we
don't want to truly get into that but
it seems like with our current political
situation with the legislature being
made up mostly if Republicans and even
but well it's like a fifty to forty
eight splits in the Senate and something
you know so it seems like with this
administration trying to push for more
encryption I mean I think more
encryption of backdoors are something
relief exploits there's something shared
between the two administrations and I
think this has more support in general
from both sides which is kind of
concerning this is this is one of those
things where I like I think it's pretty
clear that I IV R on the liberal side of
most political discussions this is one
of those situations where a lack of
technical knowledge is serving to cloud
the conversation on both sides of the
political aisle this is not a situation
where I've been overly impressed with
liberals ability to join the
conversation in any meaningful fashion
even though Republicans are in power
right now I I don't really feel like I
need to blame them when we're also
talking about law enforcement agencies
when we were talking about the FBI the
CIA the NSA and how they are accruing
information on citizens and how they are
trying to find to end roads around
consumer protections of their personal
information not like I want to go and
start throwing on my tinfoil hat but I
feel the biggest problem in this
discussion is usually a lack of
awareness as to what the realities of
building a complex operating system
structure ecosystem of products and then
building in the security that we need to
actually protect that thing there was a
Joe Rogan podcast months and months ago
during during the sort of the heat of
the San Bernardino case where he had a
former CIA operative on on his show to
talk about and it was hilarious because
in the course of one podcast he was
saying well it should be really easy for
Apple to create like a one-off system
image that could defeat the security and
allow people to get into the device and
then in like 20 minutes later into the
conversation he's like oh but like all
manufacturers have issues with security
problems and with data and corporate
espionage and and how people can get
information out of an apple or a lenovo
or a samsung and so you can't really
keep anything safe so if Apple were to
create systems that could defeat their
own security they technically would also
be in breach of the very contracts that
makes the iPhone an acceptable system
for government agencies to use as a
product for interacting with government
government sanctioned information
technology IT departments so not only
from the government perspective or from
the consumer perspective Apple needs to
design locks that are extremely
difficult to break if we're going to
live in a data first and data centric
community and I feel consumers should
have the same access to protecting their
data that a government would also
utilize for protecting sensitive
information on these mobile devices but
which is more important in the moment
right now America first or data first
I think that's Academy I mean that's
that's the economy it's the economy that
they want to you know of the debate that
that's that's exactly the problem is
which you're gonna try and boil it to
boil it down to a thumbs-up thumbs-down
black or white issue and that's that's
not the case because yeah it's not out
to Apple in a timely fashion and and if
this were a touch ID enabled phone for
example if if consumers had that
information or if law enforcement had
given that information to Apple we
probably wouldn't even be having this
conversation because they would have
just tried his finger prints and the
phone would have been unlocked I'm
looking at this as an authoritarian
reach because if I would assume that the
FBI knows what it's doing and that you
know even under the you know if you
associate the Trump administration of
all this then you'll get a part line
vote from GOP members
even the conservative ones that would be
against a reach of authority like this
one which is discont well but this but
this is also why this is a so why i'm
i'm not one to overly place too much too
much too much onus on whether or not
someone has an r by their name or a d'
by their name because this should be a
conversation where both sides could find
some agreement in personal liberties and
freedoms if you want to have the
libertarian conversation versus some
sort of social democrat or socialist
conversation i the big problem is a lot
of heart lawmakers are just wofully
ill-equipped to join a tech-savvy debate
that to me becomes the most egregious
problem with these types of things
because it's always we always sort of
stop the conversation at this sort of
heightened emotional level whether or
not the FBI
quote knows what they're doing when they
wait two days and they don't get to the
pin code I think the FBI is just as much
a bureaucracy as any other function of
government or law enforcement and again
I'm not placing motive necessarily on
that specifically I I don't feel
qualified to comment on that
specifically oh no it was disappointing
aspect of a little bit more tech-savvy
knowledge and information joining the
discussion at the highest levels of
government would do us really well right
now because we should be able to start
having proactive conversations about
consumer technology but instead we
always seem to fall in this trap of
having reactive conversations about law
and technology after something terrible
has happened
when we're sort of least equipped to
join that conversation rationally yeah
and especially given the special concern
stances that were in again Donald Trump
is president and there are unprecedented
dennah moves where that has not been
seen in previous administrations before
which has thrown some wrench into the
whole works of things that's Jane I know
fan of the Trump administration by
when it comes to walk about the library
no but when it comes to law enforcement
we we've seen just as much technological
overreach from law enforcement
regardless of the administration in
power the NSA didn't just start setting
up data collection centers on citizenry
because a Republican was in the White
House that's been going on for a while
and the San Bernardino case didn't
happen under Trump's watch we've been
seeing this for a while and this is a
long-term issue not a conservative or a
Democrat but but the point is here is
that there's been a vacuum of
legislation because if you can't get a
visitor through and if they find a point
where maybe this is something in in the
remote chance that this is something
that they can do something on see a rush
to action on this III agree that that is
that that is a potential threat I I
think the the problem is is just like
anything else that's the hypothetical
that we could discuss the reality but
we're not really good to worry now
yeah again the reality of the situation
as it stands right now is again I think
law enforcement has done a terrible job
of addressing the situation they didn't
act in a timely fashion to get technical
expertise to the table and now they're
reactively saying oh the phone's locked
we need Apple to break it when this
could have been circumvented from the
beginning if again this were a touch ID
enabled phone and we could be talking
about a great working relationship
between Apple and law enforcement which
is what we should have been discussing
from the beginning not oh no now FBI is
reacting to the situation days after the
fact
why doesn't Apple just break this lock
this one time from people who don't
understand how encryption works it I'm
gonna I'm gonna say we should probably
table the rest of this for future
discussion too because we were already
running really long ago the reason why I
wanted to talk about this first because
I want this story to be constrained
doesn't matter the show's over why are
you going back to talk about how they
like we were king of the non sequiturs
in this one I don't think good
one story in front of this would have
changed the overall runtime
unfortunately there were a couple I
wanted to get to I instead I'm just
gonna say thank you everyone who is
throwing in comments and stuff and keep
them coming this is something that
hopefully we can read ress when we get
to the listener mailbag episode at the
end of the month we can expand on this
topic a little bit more because I know
there were a lot of opinions that we
couldn't get to Laura thank you so much
