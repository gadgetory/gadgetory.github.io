and this is the unboxing video for the
palm treo 500 so if we're open the box
the first thing we come to is the
manuals and the CD now in here you have
a quick reference guide which is
actually a complete user guide for how
to use the device and how to use windows
mobile 6 standard there's also a quick
start guide which shows you what you can
expect to find in the box and also have
to charge the phone and use it for the
first time and then the all-important
software CD which contains active sync
which allows you to connect your device
to your PC and synchronize and copy
files across now if I just take out the
battery and the phone I'll put them to
one side for a second I'll comes thurs
in a moment so look what's actually in
the box as far as accessories go now the
first thing we come across is the sync
and charge cable which is this time you
can see they they've opted to use a mini
USB to USB connector rather than a
proprietary connector which they used on
the Centro and that's a much better a
better option because most people have
these lying around from cameras or other
devices around the house so if you lose
the original then it's easy to replace
it and even if you can't have one around
the house then it's easy to pick these
upon on ebay or somewhere so that's
great that's that's your sink in charge
which allows you to connect your phone
to your PC and obviously to to charge it
and copy things across so that's there
the headphone headset this time is a
stereo headset which contains which
comes with a 3.5 millimeter standard
Jack blood connector and has an inline
microphone so you can use that for
listening to your music or your your
movies or you can use it for a headset
for four in your car to hands-free in
your car now again they supplied the
charger just as they did with the palm
centro which is the phone connector
block with a flip-down us a connector
but then it has a three round the world
converters so you can slip these on sir
there and then you can plug it in pretty
much anywhere around the world so
traveling that's a great idea and again
it's the mini USB connector there so you
can you can plug that and charged that
on the go so that's what's in the box as
far as accessories go and in a second
I'll come to the phone itself so moving
on let's have a look at the device
itself on the front of the device you
have a 240 x 320 pixel screen and below
the screen you have a standard
configuration of buttons there you've
got your hang up and answer Corbin's and
then because it's windows mobile
standard and it's not a touchscreen you
have your left and right softkey menu
hardware buttons below those you have a
home button which will take you
immediately back to your home screen
from anywhere in the applications and
then there's a backwards navigation key
which will take you sequentially back
through the steps you've just taken in
the center there's a d-pad a raised
d-pad which makes it nice needed to use
and in the center of that there's a
select button so you can easily navigate
through your programs and applications
below there you have a 34 key qwerty
keyboard which is designed just nicely
for your thumbs to be able to type text
messages and to use in applications such
as word looking at the top of the device
there's an on/off switch which allows
you to power the device on and off put
into standby mode and then moving around
to the left hand side of the screen you
have your volume controls now depending
on where you are in your applications
they do different things they obviously
control the media volume as you
listening to music but obviously if
you're in a call as well then they'll
control the call volume below there we
have a configurable hotkey which allows
you to assign a single application to
that and then your single press and you
can go straight to the application which
is nice if you want to assign something
like media player or camera or something
like that to it on the bottom of the
device there's in the center you have
the microphone for phone calls and then
either side of that you have the sockets
one is your mini USB which is for
syncing and charging the device and then
you have a
pretty connected there which is your
three and a half mil jack socket which
allows you to plug in your headphones
now the nice thing about these through
being separate is that you can obviously
charge the device and listen to your
media at the same time I know in a lot
of phones my HTC Titan two for one of
them you they both share the same socket
they both have a mini USB socket so you
have to do one or the other or buy a
connector with this you can you can do
the same to both at the same time so
that's great on moving on to the back of
the device there is the speaker for
playing multimedia and then there's a 2
megapixel camera for recording video and
obviously for recording still
photographs now if I just pop the back
of the device off here you can have a
look and see what's inside the device so
at the bottom here is where the sim card
goes now if I just take a sim card I can
show you then just pop it in there and
fairly easily slot the SIM card into the
into the socket there so that's your sim
card connected and above there you can
see there's a small connector which
unclips and lifts up now that's for your
micro SD card so you slot your microSD
card into there like that and then you
just clip it down in place and actually
micro SD card now let's that's fine it's
nice and compact but the obvious
drawback there is that if you want to
change your SD cards to put it for music
in for example then you're going to have
to remove your battery which means
resetting the device there is room there
where they could have put a little slot
to allow you to do that but they chose
not to so let's pop the battery onto the
device and pop the back back on and then
what's only back over again okay so if I
now switch the device on you can see the
keyboard lights will spring to life and
the screen will show the palm logo and
that's just starting up now now whilst
it's just starting up I'll just do a
comparison in size to the candy bar
phone which is the palm centro you can
see if I do a comparison from the front
there there's not much difference in in
size height wise this does just a
slightly slight
narrower if you put one on top of the
other you can see that the the center is
just slightly smaller than the trail in
in width thickness is about the same and
we can have a look at the screen so
there you can see the screen is now
started up and you can see the home
screen of the palm treo 500 so that is
the unboxing video for the palm treo 500
and i'm now going to go away and use
this for a week and i'll come back and
give you a full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
