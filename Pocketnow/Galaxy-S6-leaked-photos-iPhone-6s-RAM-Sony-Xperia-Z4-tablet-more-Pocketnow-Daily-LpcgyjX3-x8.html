galaxy s6 in the flesh no more renders
rumors claim that Apple's iOS lineup
will finally get a step forward on the
RAM department this year if I get the
launch details for the LG G flex 2
globally I'm hi Mary vera and the show
will return on March 16 since I will be
in Barcelona as of tomorrow stay tuned
for coverage from WC and yes this is
pocket out daily the official news that
I have to do with LG as the company has
just spilled the beans officially on
when we can expect the G flex 2 in your
current markets there's a link in the
description or full details on different
regions North America Europe Asia as to
when you're getting the G flex 2 but
just to give you an idea and I'm not
show it'll happen a couple of weeks
after mwc finishes which would be a
couple of weeks from now so great news
and the view joined us in our
disappointment with Sony for not
launching anything at MWC 2015 thing
again the company is apparently going to
launch the Xperia z4 tablet yeah before
the z4 smartphone gets announced it
seems to get leaked at the Xperia lounge
application now that doesn't necessarily
mean it will happen at mwc but it makes
all the sense in the world stay tuned
for that now one company that's
shamelessly teasing what Snapdragon
processors are currently running on
smartphones or the coming smartphones is
Qualcomm we saw how the company did it
with the Jeep which to and the company
has just begun to tease that the HTC One
m9 or at least one HTC smartphone
includes the Snapdragon 810 so just
imagine this Snapdragon 810 processor
1080p display which is optimum and
pixels per inch and a battery a great
battery that we are expecting so much
from the HTC One m9 and hopefully it
does deliver because our experiences
with the G flex 2 right now haven't been
extremely positive so far we'll see what
we get now let's move the spotlight over
to Apple Samsung and LG first of all
because as Samsung has just struck a
multibillion-dollar deal with both Apple
and LG for RAM modules and since a
samsung is not really disclosing which
ram modules it is it could be that the
new ddr4 ram modules that the company
had just the lawn
are the ones that are coming in these
smartphones later this year which is
great apparently the g4 will include
them the iphone success hopefully and
yet ddr4 the great deal but even more
interesting is the fact that the rumors
claim that Apple is going to bump the
RAM on its iOS lineup going forward
meaning iphone success or iphone 7 and
the next i pads that are coming so ddr4
and two gigs of ram on the next iPhones
is great news the vice is performed
great with just one gig of ram ddr3 so
let's see what we get and finally for
the hot news of the day if you are tired
of seeing galaxy s6 renders up that's
ending right now we've got the first
leaked photographs of the device in the
flesh no more chassis we're talking
about a fully assembled galaxy s6 in the
lakes of the description got a couple of
photographs of different angles its back
its camera hump and just about
everything else the device looks really
nice and yeah we are looking forward to
seeing it at mwc but it does lead me to
the question of the day what do you
think of this new design of the galaxy
s6 is enticing for you is it something
that you want because in my case yeah
but obviously I'll want to hold it in my
hand first leave us a comment down below
and tell us what you friends you know
the drill if we wanted that was earlier
before this video was filmed make sure
you follow us on packing out comment
subscribe to channel as well you can
follow me on Twitter high maltose

thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
