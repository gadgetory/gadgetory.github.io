iphone 7 plus sellout was a surprise
tear downs of the Apple watch series two
shows sighs improvements in parts and
the galaxy note 7 recall just became a
government thing I'm hi Mary Vanna and I
hope you all enjoy your weekends you
know the way iPhone week is here we're
not going to sleep but this is pocket
out daily brought to you by Autodesk
graphic official news today begin with
deals those of you in the market for a
very good SmartWatch that I highly
recommend the first generation pebble
time is currently available for certain
sellers on ebay for seventy dollars I
know seventy dollars is a crazy price
tag yet you can definitely get it for
other retailers for about a hundred
bucks it's been that way for a while but
still the pebble time continues to be
one of our favorite smartwatches if it
wasn't for that red color that they SAT
me other official news come from Samsung
and the CPSC for those of you wondering
what the status is on the galaxy note 7
it turns out that the CPS he has already
made their recall officials so you know
that that's official but the chance of
that Samsung is pretty much time doubt
that they're expecting galaxy note 7
replacement units on September 21st set
your calendars I will definitely move
one of the people there trying to get my
replacement but apparently there are
already 91 cases that is really bad
let's move the spotlight over to Apple
obviously this is iPhone and Apple watch
series two days so we've got tear downs
the ones expected addition to drop test
from some of our friends out there but
the tear downs are very interesting
particularly in the Apple watch series
to mainly because the battery got thirty
three percent larger that's a major
thing the Apple watch was never really
that bad when it came to battery but
obviously there is a GPS the power now
so I cannot wait to get my unit very
soon tell you more about how that
performs in fitness and speaking of the
average torture test or tear downs there
is obviously the typical torture test of
the iphone 7 already in the market and
you can expect a lot of things from that
particular matte black color first of
all it is extremely resilient it doesn't
Bend which is great the only problem is
it's wretches and that's something
that's expected from aluminum especially
when it's anodized but in the case of
this particular black matte
I phone remember remember the days of
the old iphone 5 and just how scratch
that got in that black color that's
pretty much the same case here so buyers
beware you might want to get a case for
that one as well and finally the very
interesting news that they have to do
again with the iphone this time of the +
usually and historically the case has
always been that the smaller iPhone
sales and more than the plus because not
everybody wants a phablet but this is so
interesting according to data from
pre-orders fifty-five percent of
pre-orders were of the iphone 7 plus
which is the main reason why a lot of
people weren't able to get them on time
you know for launch day on pre-order and
the main reason why it's currently sold
out in pretty much every apple store it
shows that people are obviously
interested in that whole debacle of the
zoom lens and we cannot wait to get our
unit to tell you more but it leads me to
the question of the day are you one of
those customers that is willing to grab
the iphone 7 plus just for that zoom
lens in my case i'm not gonna lie i'm
doing it more for the added battery life
than anything else it's the first time
I'm actually going plus but leave us a
