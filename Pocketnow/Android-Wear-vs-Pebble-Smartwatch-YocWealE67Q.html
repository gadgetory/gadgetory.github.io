second screen for your smartphone on
your wrist but they go about doing it in
completely different ways and with
totally distinct results which one
should you strap on if you're in the
market for a summer wearable let's find
out i'm michael fisher with pocket now
and this is Android wear versus pebble
smartwatch this is more a platformer
comparison than a device to device
face-off so we'll just acknowledge up
front that both pebble and Android wear
offer various Hardware incarnations from
the budget to the high-end with more
coming in the future
the most glaring difference is that
Android wear is a full-color experience
while pebble for now is a simpler
monochrome a sacrifice that gives it a
distinct edge in open sunlight despite
this the principle functionality is the
same across these platforms delivering
notifications from your phone to your
wrist via bluetooth both pebble and
Android wear can handle a wide variety
of notifications from SMS email to
third-party apps and each alerts you to
incoming messages via a vibration on
your wrist both platforms offer devices
with changeable watch bands for
customization and customizable software
as well with support for native and
third-party applications oh and they
each tell the time with many different
watch faces to choose from but for all
their similarity and basic functionality
almost nothing else is the same some of
the differences are the unavoidable kind
the ones that crop up whenever you're
comparing a nearly two-year old platform
to a two-week old one Pebbles
third-party application store accounts
about 3200 apps from over 15,000
developers while Android wear is just
getting its feet under it other
differences are more philosophical
pebble was built with simplicity in mind
as a result the software on its ePaper
display is list driven and
straightforward issuing a touchscreen
for side-mounted navigation buttons the
list options are static they don't
change over time ensuring that your
notifications for example are always in
the same
place Android wear is more complex by
comparison even though it tries not to
be it's not the layout that's the
problem the colorful touch driven
interface is quite beautiful and its
formatting is logical with a vertical
column of cards for the top layer and
more detail available with horizontal
swipes but because the whole thing is
driven by Google now the cards are
constantly changing positions for
example you never know where a hangout
card will be relative to the one that
tells you when the next bus is or what
the weather is going to be like tomorrow
and getting to third-party apps via
touch is an exercise in endless
scrolling fortunately there's a better
way to interact with Android wear that
pebble doesn't offer voice input to
launch an app you can just say its name
and that goes for other actions like
Google searches texting by dictation
asking for a pedometer count and so on
it's by no means perfect which will
expand on in our full review but the
voice interface is probably Android
wears biggest advantage over pebble even
more so than the bigger brighter
displays on its watches when you can use
your wristwatch to literally tell your
smartphone what to do without even
pressing a button it's more than just a
futuristic party trick it brings a whole
new level of possibility to the role of
a SmartWatch almost everywhere else
pebbles greater experience and time in
grade is clear the Android watches are
supposed to be smart enough to
automatically turn the screen on only
when you're looking at them but in
practice they turn on erroneously all
the time with pebble you really have to
shake it vigorously to get its backlight
to turn on but that's preferable to the
annoying fake outz on Android wear this
might have something to do with the fact
that both current Android watches only
last a day or two on a charge while
pebble can go almost a full week between
top-ups in many ways the decision here
is much the same as any choice between
an established product family and a new
one the older pebble has had more time
to get at sea legs while Android wear is
still a cadet on its shakedown cruise
but there's also a big difference in
ambition here
pebble is a notification accessory
that's using third-party apps to expand
while still retaining the simplicity
that made it attractive in the first
place Android wear offers more long-term
potential with its beefier hardware and
it's more complex software allows for
more in-depth tweaking like custom roms
but it'll be a long time before it
attains the consistent simplicity that
pebble has already achieved so if you
want a wearable that doesn't stray far
from the basics a watch that just works
and one that works with your iPhone go
for the pebble if you want something
flash here something more powerful
something you can talk to Android wear
is your wearable of choice and if you
own a Windows Phone well write a letter
to Microsoft because we're getting
impatient - for more on Android wear see
our earlier comparison putting the LGG
watch up against the Samsung gear live

review coming soon until next time this
