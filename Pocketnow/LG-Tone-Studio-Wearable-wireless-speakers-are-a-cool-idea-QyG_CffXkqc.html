coming home from MWC we've been wearing
the LG tone studio almost non-stop its
unique approach to wearable tech and
wireless audio following the design of
previous tone headsets the studio is
built around a neck band which contains
four speakers two up and two down which
simulates surround sound and transfer
some low-frequency audio into a tactile
sensation almost like a subwoofer while
this is a beefier wearable than a tone
active the band ensures none of the
weight is handled by your head keeping
this on the base of the neck works
really well and I quickly acclimated
forgetting I was wearing it most of the
time I've never heard anything quite
like this the studio creates a bubble of
sound which floats around your head the
surround effect is excellent for
watching movies music sounds good but
obviously it's less impressive with
stereo audio files sounding a bit more
like a mid-range Bluetooth speaker the
novelty of course that your ears aren't
completely occupied you can soundtrack
just about any activity and still
handily hear the world around you to
that last point before the sandwich
these overlap a little with bone
conduction solutions like my aftershocks
but with noticeably higher quality
output the audio stays well localized
but it full volume expects people to be
able to eavesdrop by several metres away
that said I found the studio powerful
enough that full volume was somewhat
uncomfortable for those times you're
around other people and you don't want
to be an inconsiderate jerk a pair of
retractable earbuds are at the ready for
those of you who complain about our
editor-in-chief Anton not smiling enough
he would likely be considered the true
audiophile on our team I'll let his
first listen' reaction speak for itself
there's a comprehensive collection of
controls onboard a call answer button
which doubles as a voice assistant
prompt dedicated power rocker toggled to
switch from speakers to earbuds play
pause controls volume dials skip and
repeat rocker and a dedicated 3.5
millimeter input for any devices which
don't use bluetooth LG claims a 32 bit
DAC onboard and while we can't test that
scientifically the studio delivers
excellent audio playback aptX
HD support is included and transitioning
from speakers to earbuds expect a lot of
ear candy very good separation between
channels full playful low frequency
which avoids stomping on the mids
and present highs which I personally
think could use a touch more Sparkle but
never become brittle or unpleasant
overall build quality is refreshingly
rugged my 16 month old daughter used her
full baby strength to try and pull one
of the earbuds out to no avail
toddlers are surprisingly strong but
this audio accessory should be viewed
less as a workout solution and more as a
general entertainment and convenience
piece it did the trick just fine on my
stationary bike but any jogging will
deliver annoying impacts to your
collarbones instead this came in handy
both at home and while driving borrowing
my wife scarves she doesn't have
bluetooth in her - the studio were far
more convenient than any standalone
Bluetooth speaker phone and
significantly safer than wearing
wireless headphones listening to music
and podcast for several hours and taking
a handful of calls every day I never got
the battery below medium when charging
it every night there aren't a lot of
bombers here the symmetrical hardware
layout took me about a day to remember
which button was on which side
accidentally hung up on a couple calls
I wish the studio would automatically
transfer to ear buds when they're pulled
out but that's a minor gripe the main
issue might come with style these are
not the most discreet but they do tuck
under shirts and coats well enough maybe
even pulling off a tech-savvy dress-up
casual you'll probably want to leave
them at home when sporting a proper
button-up and suit jacket for all of our
conversation on wearable technology we
often overlook things like headphones
which you know you wear on your head
LG's delivered something fresh here
which offers a unique take on mobile
audio and it's refreshingly well
featured we're expecting the LG tone
studio to ship for around two hundred
and forty nine dollars in the United
States when released and we'll have more
info on pricing and availability on
pocketnow.com
