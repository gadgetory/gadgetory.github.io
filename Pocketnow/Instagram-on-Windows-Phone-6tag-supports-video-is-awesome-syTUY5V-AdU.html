popped up for Windows Phone 8 and early
indications are that it's pretty awesome
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is your guided tour of six tagged
the new Instagram app for Windows Phone
8 the Facebook owned picture sharing
service Instagram isn't officially
supported on Windows Phone something
Nokia Microsoft and millions of Windows
Phone users would like very much to
change until that happens though users
are forced to rely on third party apps
like instance to post and browse photos
on Instagram and we praised instance as
a wonderful Instagram client just a few
weeks back but the app has some
limitations namely its small selection
of filters and inability to post a video
content plus a recent change in API is
by Instagram rendered instance and all
third party Instagram apps broken for a
short time though quickly fixed that
bump in the road was unsettling for
Windows Phone users who were finally
getting used to the idea of being able
to consistently use Instagram on their
devices enter six tag an app from
developer Rudy Wynn which is according
to Windows Phone central the first
third-party Windows Phone 8 client to
launch with instagrams blessing of sorts
the app launched yesterday and currently
holds a five-star rating in the Windows
Store with over 2000 reviews beating out
even the high scores of wins highly
ranked vine client for Windows Phone
here's how it works when you first log
into 6 tag you know immediately that
this is a different Instagram experience
entirely the welcome screen is backed by
a reel of fun energetic clips that
reminds you of six tags of video posting
functionality once you log in you're
given a quick single-frame tutorial that
tells you everything you need to know to
browse the feed you just swipe left or
right on a card
to display controls for liking sharing
and commenting even downloading photos
to your phone is a one tap process no
video downloading is not currently
supported and while these controls are
handy enough familiar shortcuts are also
still here you can indeed double tap on
a photo to like it the checking activity
on your own account is a simple matter
of tapping the notification bubble in
the upper right and the same goes for
profile viewing
in fact all this is pretty familiar
stuff an instance does most of this
already just differently and instance
also uses a very Windows Phone like you
I complete with sliding panels the
difference with six tag comes when you
want to post something the viewfinder is
familiar enough but after you take the
shot
the newer apps superiority becomes clear
the six tag includes official Instagram
filters in place of the more limited
collection and instance in addition to
tilt shift effects frames and even a
contrast enhancement tool you can also
tag people in the photo if you like and
six tag also supports sharing to a ton
of other social networks a lot of the
stuff hasn't been seen before in a
third-party client at least not to this
degree video recording is similar to
instagrams stock approach with stop and
start capability though you can't upload
already recorded video from the gallery
as you can with the stock app and
there's no filter support either still
it's video uploading with a third-party
app and it definitely works well enough
to satisfy most folks that's our overall
impression of six tag after a day of use
actually it's not perfect there's some
stutter here and there and no
third-party title is ever gonna bring
the full suite of features that an
official app would but six tag gets
absurdly close it beats the current
version of instance pretty handily in
terms of functionality but the two apps
stand together as great examples of what
can happen when developers commit to
filling a demand and doing it well with
a bit of a wink and a nudge from
Instagram itself in six tags case six
tag is free to try in the Windows Store
but a dollar forty nine will remove the
ads and enable video upload
functionality if you're an Instagram
user on Windows Phone well first of all
we recommend you follow pocket now and
instagram.com slash pocket now but
second of all we highly recommend giving
six tag a try
