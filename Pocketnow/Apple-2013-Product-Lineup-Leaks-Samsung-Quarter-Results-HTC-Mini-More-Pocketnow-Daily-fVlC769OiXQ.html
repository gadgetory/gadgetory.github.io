states get leaked Samsung quarter
results are in and some weird details
emerge and HTC launches a weird mini
remote for the butterfly I'm hi meri
behna and the last thing we need is a
phone for our phones this is parking out
daily you know Apple is the most
predictable company in the world when it
comes to launch date end devices is
still we get a ton of rumors all through
the year it was speculated that the ipad
mini to win that the ipad 5 would be
launched in spring but new rumors have
it that it will be launched in the fall
and it makes a lot of sense now
interesting enough the ipad mini 2 will
include a Retina Display duh but
pounding the iPad 5 will look exactly
like the iPad Mini even with the fact
that it doesn't have a bezel on the left
or the right when it comes to the iphone
5s there aren't changes apparently they
won't leave the launch until the fall
and they will be launching at at WWDC
that happens in june though we don't
know what will be getting in this iphone
5s and then when it comes to that iphone
math or iphone plus the people were
talking about what apparently that
device is just a prototype but it won't
see the light of thing Samsung on the
other hand posted their quarter results
to some staggering numbers sixty three
point seven million smartphones were
sold but we know they dilute their
galaxy brand a lot with low-end and
higher in smartphone so it's hard to
tell which of these were the galaxy s3
but we do know that it had a lot to do
with that but the interesting point here
is that their CEO just came on record to
state but apparently sales will decline
in the next coming months and it makes
you wonder why would that happen in our
opinion while the galaxy s4 is just
around the corner so it only makes sense
that their current twenty-nine percent
market share will remain stagnant until
the galaxy s4 regis stores and what
could the nokia laser be new rumors have
the company having a device with that
code name being slated for verizon and
our biggest medicines verizon already
has the nokia lumia 822 and their
low-end smartphone lineup most likely
this is their Lumia 920 variant being
dubbed the Lumia 920 to still no dates
but hopefully that will happen very soon
and if unlocking smartphones is your
thing because it clearly is mine well
the vcm mail the United States as of
tomorrow will not allow this to be legal
so that means that if you want to
rock your phone well a the carrier has
to allow it or we you'll have to buy a
smartphone that's already unlocked and
it's just interesting to see what's
going to happen as of tomorrow in the
past it was really easy to find ways to
unlock your phone anyway so I'm sure
that everybody will figure that out
probably prices will go up but still
it'll most likely continue happening so
just a word of warning for those that
rely on it and finally for the AA deals
of the day HTC has just begun selling
their HTC many as a companion to the HTC
butterfly in China in the front of this
device is that it connects to your
butterfly which is the DNA in the United
States through bluetooth or NFC and it's
pretty much a remote that controls
everything your phone from text messages
to making and receiving phone calls to
actually even serving as a camera
shutter and it makes all the sense of
the world of you think of it in well
emerging countries where theft is
probably an issue and you'd love for
that many to be stolen and not your
butterfly but that leads me to the
question of the day what purpose would
you have for a phone that pretty much
serves as a phone for your phone it's
like a companion it makes all the sense
to me for tablets for example there are
certain tablets that have data
capabilities and could allow you to make
phone calls with those data plans but
still when you need an HTC mini in my
case well in third world countries like
here in Latin America it's complicated
when it comes to theft so it makes sense
but leave us a comment down below and if
you want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow was on
parking now calm please give this video
a thumbs up if you like what you saw I'm
hi Mary later thanks for watching see
