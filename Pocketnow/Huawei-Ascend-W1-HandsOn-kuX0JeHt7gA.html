still here at Las Vegas at CES no
surprise here at the massive huawei
booth this time checking out a Windows
Phone device this is the huawei ascend
w1 which we didn't see at the
announcement yesterday but the press
release came out today announcing it
officially obviously you can tell from
the size will bring this back in a
second but just comparing it to a Nokia
Lumia 920 this is a smaller device and
from the spec sheet it definitely is a
mid-range device let's just take a look
around the around the outside give you a
little bit of a hardware tour here on
the left get a volume slider there this
is obviously the cyan version cyan I'm
much more brilliant blue than we saw in
some of the leaked images this is not a
washed-out color is very visible phone
here's a huawei logo 5 megapixel camera
around the back the front facing camera
incidentally is a 0.3 megapixel vga
resolution so that's not the best we've
ever seen but there's windows phone's
camera key stand by key is up top on
this device and the headphone jack and
down below is the microphone the battery
is a 1950 milliamp hour battery pretty
big for a mid-range device to display a
4.0 inch IPS LCD with something a while
way is calling no air gap technology I'm
really quite sure about that we have to
get into a better lighting situation to
see just how much or how little that is
that holds up under scrutiny but really
brilliant colors here really deep blacks
at least in this lighting situation
something we're used to seeing from
AMOLED but not necessarily from an LCD
so that's quite interesting once again
10-point 15 millimeters thick not going
to win any awards for
but or inside if you don't like carrying
giant bones everywhere might be
something to consider for a windows
phone 8 shopper we want something a
little bit smaller than some of the
black ships obviously you can't check
out and get too in-depth right now is
just a quick hands-on but there is your
first look the huawei ascend w1 running
Windows Phone 8 from my way here in Las
Vegas at CES 2013 pocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
