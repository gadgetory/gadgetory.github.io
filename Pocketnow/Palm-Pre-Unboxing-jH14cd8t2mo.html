calm and we've got a palm pre here that
we're going to unbox so let's start with
this one the box is actually very
similar to the treo pro at the little
angled edge yeah its release so let's
take a look top
here we have to the pre
click
our plastic getting started guide see
how that looks features guide full color
espa√±ol
this fell out headphones 3.5 millimeter
jack we also have a little sleeve see
how that works
nice little pocket and we have the USB
cable with a rubber holder that's cool
so you can keep that on there whoops and
then our USB charger plug the USB in
there looks good but that's not all we
have more boxes over there next that was
a fun
we have a lot of cardboard and this is a
nice car adapter with another USB cable
that's pretty nice what's this
not sure what that does anyway and we
also have the touchstone charging kit
that comes with an extra back with
special electronics in there for
charging and it's a little more soft
touch than the shiny one that comes with
it by default that so we'll replace that
somehow get this out
here's to touch them so that's going to
stick on there when I have a special
back there we go and looks like clapping
must be what this is for plugging in
there nope kind of use the other choir
there we go so that will charge it and
that's a nice of sticky foot okay let's
see if this is kind of battery in it
routine
