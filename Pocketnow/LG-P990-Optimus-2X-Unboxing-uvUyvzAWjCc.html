calm and we just got a package from our
friends at Negri electronics it's going
to be a new smartphone so guess what
we're going to do with it there we go
it is the LG p 9 9 0 also known as the
optimus 2x so we'll check that out this
is one of the first smartphones with a
dual-core processor this little the box
a little bit first there we have we got
a little shiny stuff there 8 megapixel

nice plastic there here's the device
look at that in a minute and we got we
have your normal microUSB cable bill
charger USB in there and headphones with
what do we have
just a little microphone and a button
answer button
here's your headphones and we have a
battery good to have 1500 milliamps and
some do not see any HDMI cables here
just a micro USB cable okay so that's
that let's see the device how does it
compare well let's look at it a little
bit
okay let's compare it to the Galaxy S 4G
screen size pretty much the same
thickness very close LG looks a little
thicker
okay and I guess we'll compare with the
Nokia n8 that we've got here quite a
difference there the screen size pretty
close some thickness and what else we
got I guess it's the blackberry torch
which we see it's quite different and
much thicker not that much but a little
bit thicker okay so there is the
