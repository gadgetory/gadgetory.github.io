pocketnow.com when the palm pre came out
on sprint about a year ago and it wasn't
that long though it seems like a really
long time ago AT&amp;amp;T customers such as
myself or wondering hey when do we get a
webos device well now about a year later
we're finally getting our own web OS
device in the form of the palm pre plus
although it's not really new it's been
on verizon for a couple of months now
and it's pretty much the same device but
in the GSM flavor but that's okay we've
been waiting to try it on a tee tees
network let's take a look here's the
unboxing alright let's do the unboxing
here and apparently the palm pre plus on
ATT come to the touch charge charger
which previously was an added accessory
that you had to pay for which is quite
nice and here it is the touchstone
accessory very small box for this will
take a look at this in a second this
uses inductive charger charging
obviously so you don't actually have to
plug in the palm pre plus so here's the
box very standard box that were used to
with palm devices although it has an
AT&amp;amp;T flavoring to it with the orange
packaging so let's slide this out again
this is the same unit that you get if
you were to go on verizon and get the
palm pre plus let's see if we have
anything around the box very clean box
very minimal pretty nice let's open the
lid here here's the device looks
familiar put that aside for a minute see
well see what else we get in the box
quick start guide and of course ATT
doesn't want you to text and drive
they've got that campaign going now on
all of their devices see what else we
have in here and then the typical palm
layout we have this very tiny little USB
charger very nice looking oh so some
headphones yeah micro USB charger and it
comes with a nice little case which is
made out of sort of a fabric material
orange inside for AT&amp;amp;T so let's take a
look at the palm pre plus and we're
going to compare
this to the verizon palm pre plus in a
second to take off the frontier and of
course the difference between this and
the palm pre is that the button is
capacitive now it no longer sits out
like so the keyboards also been upgraded
so yeah I mean it feels the same as the
verizon palm pre plus in fact now that I
have them side-by-side I can't tell them
apart really I'm they are absolutely
identical but if I did this you want to
know which is which they are completely
the same and i can tell you off the bat
something that they didn't fix with this
this is the verizon palm pre plus and
this battery or this charger port here
can never be closed fully it always
sticks out i'm looking at the AT&amp;amp;T
version and i see the same thing here i
don't know if the camera can focus on
that but it's just this battery or this
this charging port really needs to be
fixed something that i think Tom needs
to work on anyway so let's take a look
at this next to some other devices so
here it is next to the sprint pixie and
of course AT&amp;amp;T is getting the pixi plus
just like Verizon as the pixi plus and
you have the smaller screen lower
resolution slower process or less ram
the the palm pre plus is supposed to be
sort of the premium webos experience
let's see it next to the HTC hd2 which
of course it doesn't have a nice handy
slide out keyboard here and this does
feel a little bit more clicky than the
original palm pre I personally like the
keyboard on the pixi better than the
palm pre just because it's always there
but some people prefer to have it hidden
away like so and you can quickly open it
the sliding mechanism feels solid we'll
see how that lasts over the next few
weeks and next to the google nexus one
kind of a different experience with this
device so it a lot more coming up on the
palm pre plus on AT&amp;amp;T i'm going to use
it as my daily driver for several weeks
and i'm gonna have a lot to say about it
to see how far palm has come and
hopefully they've refined the software a
bit because the palm pre plus on verizon
fun times with lagged for me in daily
use so hopefully there's some
optimizations that have been done to
make it work really really well on the
AT&amp;amp;T network also curious if the mobile
hotspot application works which you can
get on the verizon palm pre plus and
some other palm devices please thumbs up
