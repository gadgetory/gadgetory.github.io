weekly hello and welcome to episode 11
of the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss news and opinion insights
happenings of all kinds from the world
of mobile technology smartphones tablets
phablets you name it I'm your host
Michael Fisher senior editor at pocket
now I'm joined today by our core podcast
team our editor-in-chief Brandon minimun
good morning to you sir good morning and
our managing editor and Tandy Naja good
afternoon to you welcome back thank you
very much as good to be back here
everyone it's good to have you back it's
been way too long it's been like three
weeks and that's an absurd amount of
time not to have you on the on the
podcast well we'll see how many
complaint emails were received it we
will how I but you haven't been your
hands have not been idle you have some
news from from Romania all sorts of news
depending on which one you're referring
yet I mean is it the going back and
forth to Berlin use or is it the the
other news oh right the other news is
more important and makes and doesn't
make me look as as incompetent let that
anybody cares but I am happy to announce
that as of yesterday I am a double
citizen of Romania and Hungary ass this
event this is this is important for me
because since Romanian people are
required a visa to enter the state's
Hungarian people are not so I'm getting
closer and closer to laying foot on US
territory for the first time right for
the first time indeed it's really really
awesome good tony was was an excellent
host in berlin for me for four eva and i
am looking forward to returning the
favor with showing him many American
customs like dousing all sorts of meats
in cheese and being very sedentary and
I'll see you out yes you you are
required to sit on a couch for an
extended period of time while eating the
most fattening variety of chips that you
can find dry wood and and you must also
go to a Starbucks every morning
and spend at least five dollars on your
morning beverage when you could probably
go to you know you probably make it for
a 30 cents right it will be an
interesting experience yes ago
congratulations that's actually really
awesome thank you that's that's great
news will look forward it'll be great it
wouldn't it be cool to do a podcast all
on the same room Alan be awesome I think
we're not even do that in the near
future yeah I hope so let's see Brendan
20 in ski I'm sorry Tony the the other
bit of news is that you are finally
fully equipped in a computer II sense
yes yes indeed and just to keep it very
very short when when Michael Fisher my
dear colleague was coming to the IFA in
Berlin he was supposed to bring me a
computer of from a particular maker a
u.s. computer maker but unfortunately
the computer arrived dead so Michael
came to Europe without any computers we
got a refund and well in Berlin I placed
an order with that certain store which
we don't have here in Romania and they
told me it will be arriving to my hotel
in approximately six or seven days so I
said it's okay for me to extend my stay
in Berlin but after a couple of days
it's got extended to a week or so so I
came back to Romania and upon arriving
in Romania I received an email that it's
gonna be shipping and delivering soon so
I just went back to Berlin again glad
the computer and came back to Romania it
was a hassle but it was worth it well
that'll teach you to order from from
dell in the future point taken good
lesson um well ya know it I'm glad it's
all been solved and I'm glad that Tony
you got to revisit one of our favorite
pizza hut in Berlin yeah indeed the
cheesy crust rules man yeah thanks for
that and there's our commercial exactly
there's our sponsor alright well Before
we jump into the news here there's a lot
to cover Brandon had you have your
customary spot to do with as you will oh
very nice please please wait would what
have you for us today well so so um the
other day I on the iphone five I ran a
speedtest over AT&amp;amp;T LTE network and I
got an absurd
and very unexpected 52 megabits per
second down holy yeah if I could whistle
I would whistle right now okay ship
whistle I can't you go oh you can't I
just get ready yes free get your gs3
send yourself up Dex good call yeah
you're right so so you get this 52 down
Wow and I start thinking for at least
the last the last two or three years
there's been parody between what kind of
speeds you can get on an average
connection here in the US of A and what
you can get on a on a high-end
smartphone so for example 3g came around
and did speeds of like 1.5 megabits per
second to like 3 megabits per second
down and at the around that same time
probably i don't know 2010 i might have
the dates wrong you know most people in
the US were getting like 3 megabits per
second down on their typical Comcast or
Time Warner connection or what have you
and then you know hspa+ came around and
that was boosted to about 6 megabits per
second down maybe 10 if you're on some
of you know t-mobile's faster network
and and then around that time maybe 2011
speeds in the US were bumped to around
there and then you know verizon built
out there fiber-optic network in the US
and for a very reasonable price you can
get 25 down residential here in the US
and around that time verizon launched
their LTE network and most people got
about twenty five megabits per second
down so it all kind of made sense and
then you know LTE on eighteen t is very
unused because it's new and so that 52
that I got was probably because no one
was on very few people were on a
particular network I was connected to
and it's probably going to settle around
where verizon is around 25 or 35 but
what happens in the relative near future
when Verizon probably going to they're
gonna do it first deploy LTE advanced
because for those unfamiliar with LT
lte-advanced it's kind of a piggyback
off of LTE kind of like hspa+ was a
piggyback off of 3g or UMTS and the feet
feel I can't say this word theoretical
Seton who theoretically
Nine's right guys right theoretically
yeah well without the ly the seal oh oh
via reticle that's it okay in theory
lte-advanced last I read can do like a
gigabit down which is a thousand
megabits per second and obviously we're
far off from that but when when when LTE
advanced advanced launches and there's
no news of it yet because LTE is still
in its infancy let's say two years from
now which is actually a very long time
two years from now we get 50 megabits
per second down we get a hundred
megabits per second down what what will
that change on for our mobile
experiences because I'm thinking I kind
of I guess I'm putting a little negative
spin on this kind of questioning you
know why you know faster is always
better but like him are you gonna are
you gonna pull down a web page you know
point two seconds faster or are you
gonna be able to upload a little bit
faster I want to ask you guys what do
you think lte-advanced well will will
enable in terms of what you can do on a
mobile device with 100 megabits per
second down do you guys remember back in
the day I'm not sure I mean I'm sure
some of our readers do when we had those
good old computers with those super big
large and noisy hard drives and the hard
drives were actually slower than some
internet connections at least in this
region so it will download theoretically
at speed X but it would only download at
speed X minor something because the hard
drive wasn't able to write in that speed
so I think that we will have high speeds
and our phones but will the hardware be
able to write or cope with that amounts
of data well I remember that that was
quite a bottleneck back when we were I
was still working on sprint and we were
trying to sell against the the iphone at
AT&amp;amp;T and we were selling the HTC Touch
at the time and the bottleneck wasn't in
the data speed because evdo rev 0 which
had just launched her breve or something
and so the data speed was fine but the
bottleneck was in the processing power
of the hardware and on internet internet
explorer or whatever mobile version it
was running on Windows Mobile five so
yeah I think you're right i think it's
important to keep in mind what the
hardware can do it's not just a matter
of the connection speed but you know
even i think this is a case of we don't
know
you have not yet imagined all of the
possibilities because those speeds are
not available to us yet but you know we
think humankind shows in an amazing
capacity to to come up with with things
to fill space right so if there's empty
space we can come up with awesome media
to fill it and I I don't know i mean the
first thing that comes to mind is just
did these absurd demands for 1080p video
on mobile devices for some reason i
think this is not the first things to
fill that gap yeah I was gonna I was
gonna ask you you know what can you do
differently on your LTE galaxy s3 or
whatever then you could that you
couldn't on your you know your uh
whatever phone and and that's that's a
good answer 1080p video strip you can
even do 1080p because the screen is not
given what 720p 7 from YouTube all day
long no buffering it's great and you
chat and a high fidelity audio as well I
mean if we get spotify as those many
quality settings where it's like if you
want if you're on a 3g connection you
better not put it at highest but if i
had an unlimited pipe like LT does this
pretty well I'll put it on max quality
and that's a totally different listening
experience and I'm not even that big an
audiophile you know well don't forget
that I'm in Romania and I have 3g speeds
and I have no problem with the with the
highest setting also it you know it also
depends on the stability stability of
the speed often the network itself is
very true yeah okay so so I understand
your point Michael that we can kind of
can't imagine right now what will be
possible with 100 megabits per second
down because we haven't gotten there yet
a lot of things have to happen and a lot
of smart people have to rub the brain
cells together but I guess I I'm
suggesting that we come up with one or
two things right now and just spur of
the moment they might not be the most
brilliant things ever but let's let's
imagine let's uh let us um cue the harp
music in the puffy cloud well yeah no I
mean they're they're in hand like look
what look what just happened for example
with the Twitter application okay so
I'll go social media cuz that's my thing
like the Twitter app for of the new
twitter app for iOS 6 dropped and for
the ipad and it's totally different and
it's you know makes use of more
prominent placement of graphics and
things of that sort i think it's that I
think we can't think of the few
your internet as this thing with like
web pages as we know them today I mean
they're going to be it's not they're not
necessarily going to be packed with
media but they're going to make use of a
lot more yeah yeah and maybe not more
imagery which is higher quality imagery
maybe textured you know textured pages
and things that things of that sort so I
just think that the nature of the
internet will change going forward as
our data capacity you know increases so
I think we'll see more dense stuff
that's as close as I can get to a
prediction for more dense is stuff
that's a really good point I mean for
example on pocket now we tend to
compress images and one of the reasons
is to make it faster for mobile users
and and those on a slower connection to
not have to wait and you know not like
the days of 56 k see an image kind of
you know why William line by line yeah
actually you know that's a good point
cuz I was just about to send you Brandon
something a document with it's it's it's
no secret it's it's like an expense
report and I have images of receipts
inside it and I exported it last night
to an HTML file and you forget sometimes
that that applications like Evernote
will compress the images so all these
images that fit within this note in an
HTML file were full size and I look at
these giant like 8 megapixel images I've
taken with the galaxy s3 or something
and I'm like wow there's so much more
data on some parts of the internet or
even some parts of your you know of your
local computer then you think so that's
another example it's like yeah we we
compress images on our pocket now pages
what if what if we didn't post resized
smaller images that are compressed less
what if they were full size all the time
that's yeah that would be one instance
I'm sorry Tony I didn't mean to run over
your answer there no it's not a problem
i just have a closing argument do you
guys think that the priority in the near
and mid future will be mobile I mean
just think of it land lines and and the
internet which you have normally by a
fiber optics on your main computer were
the the number one internet connection
everybody used and mobiles only played
catch up to that we
have 50 100 150 megabytes per second and
speed while mobiles are just right now
trying to bump to 25 50 do you think
that in the near future this this
balance will shift towards Mobile's
being faster than normal internet if
that's not a good question no no I don't
think so because I mean you look at
right now Verizon just wrote out their
quantum which is uh they're bumping
people with 35 down to 75 down and then
they have up to three hundred down and
the thief I'm not gonna use that word
again the ber at the theoretical maximum
of fiber optics to your to your house
not you know through the copper line
like some other providers do i think is
well beyond a gigabit per second because
it requires a lot of power and and
because just just just by virtue of the
the power issues or battery power issues
on mobile devices you know battery
technology evolves a lot slower than
verizon's ability to flip a few switches
and bump the power to the line to your
house in your modem yeah well that's
true and then there's the spectrum
crunch as well where it's like you have
to fit all these users into the same
amount of the same slice of spectrum on
a cellular network and that those
bandwidth considerations are less
critical on the you know on the landline
side but but I think Tony you make a
good point out the focus of almost
everything else is mobile I mean going
forward you know we just saw a report
that like something like twenty five
percent of new tablet purchases maybe in
America are our of new computer
purchases are tablet mm-hmm you know so
yeah I think I think the focus elsewhere
is in mobile I think that it's just
going to take if if we ever are able to
stave off our appetite or fulfill our
appetite for spectrum that's closer Minh
what we can do plus imagine if you're
using the the new iPad to navigate and
we are using your gs3 or your 1x and it
starts burning after 30 minutes imagine
help how phones and tablets would burn
literally when using high-speed internet
right it's a problem now what's up some
advices really won't heat up when you're
on LTE it's very true yeah
bless the battery implications yeah I
think and I think some of the decor of
that is I don't know if it's the LTE
module or if it's the the Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 but I remember using the
the quad core version of the galaxy s3
first and I was like oh this thing
doesn't warm up at all and then I got my
hands on the American the LTE version
and it's like wow this this really cooks
your palm even with moderate load hmm so
it's it's it's interesting but good good
topic corner there let's uh I want to I
want to use that bit about processor
it's a segue a little bit into our iOS
section which we're kind of going to do
first here because we had a story today
I think was today that it was just some
some kind of really brief official
confirmation it was Tony was your piece
right on the about under processor yeah
the processor underclocking and you know
very it's nothing official yet I mean
Apple is still silent about technical
specifications of the apple a6 chip but
the Geekbench application which was
initially used to benchmark and test the
iphone 5 against other android phones
has been updated and the new update
brings hardware support for the iphone 5
in terms of making it capable of reading
the specifications correctly and the new
version of geekbench now shows that the
apple a6 processor is running at 1.29
gigahertz so that's one point three
gigahertz and despite of the fact that
the benchmark maker denied to engadget
that the apple iphone 5 does any sort of
dynamic underclocking and i think it was
9to5 mac who obtained a screenshot of
the same processor clocking below 600
megahertz and this is something which of
course other smartphones do and other
platforms computers also do this but but
for iOS users for the iphone this is
something good because once you need
that load that specific power it will
just run at 1.3 and if you're just
browsing a page which is fully loaded or
listening to send music when your screen
off it would just save power by
underclocking the CPU I didn't know
about that for the longest time like I
think it was only about a year or two
ago that I learned about variable
processor speeds like I didn't know that
they changed dynamically so
I remember using a homebrew application
on my HP vr4 wit web West or something
where you could really dial down the
minimum speed of the of the of the cpu
or blasted up into the stratosphere if
you wanted to you can manually control
it and it was so interesting to watch
the device responsiveness change
depending on you know what you had your
your CPU cycles set at and the same
thing will happen on a the galaxy s3
with samsung's new power saving mode if
you go into power saving mode I think it
puts a like a 300 megahertz ceiling on
the processor speed it's a capias feet
gap yeah so it's like I mean it runs
like it's 2009 hardware trying to run
you know ICS it's amazing what would be
interesting to see and here beside an
official confirmation of this would be
the amount of times the processor and
the system itself is capable of changing
this this frequency because say you are
in a 600 megahertz Mel doing nothing and
then you power up your I don't know game
or or a an application which needs power
just to know exactly how many times per
second can it switch frequencies to high
from high to low because the faster we
can do that the better for for the
application for the experience and for
the battery right that's uh I want to I
want to kind of use that to leap into
the the iphone 5 here because this is
the first time we've this is the first
podcast we've had since we got the
iphone 5 which i think brandon you you
did something like it was close to about
47 videos this weekend wasn't it you if
there are comparisons galore at at
pocketnow.com bridge between the 1x the
gs3 and of course the full review can
you brandon is one of several people on
the team who's got a ten iphone 5 i'm
not one of them and I don't think Tony
you are either so Brendan which I am
preparing to preorder one tonight
because in the 28th yet it will be
available in 22 more countries of course
Romania is not among them but i have a
neighboring country of which citizen i
recently became and i'm preparing to
order one from there cool well it's um
since neither one of us have one of the
in the interim though in Brandon's the
only one on the team with a granted you
i read your review and it was it was is
great to actually get your thoughts on
it but can
can you just kind of tell us tell us in
your own words how your time with the
iPhone 5 has been going yeah so it it's
funny cuz everytime I I get the new
iphone in every year now the sixth year
well this I guess it was different the
first two years or three but I always
think the same thing wishes wow this is
a really awesome device it does
everything everything that it does it
does very well mix cause well as it
takes photos well I browse the web well
and then there's always a but and the
but changes sort of from generation to
generation with the iphone 4s the the
but was i waited a year and I got the
same exact device just a little bit
faster um yeah uh the the but with the I
guess there were sort of dirt there are
two butts with the iphone 5 and i'm i'm
not talking about i cannot wait until
the jolie by live tweet yeah yeah I'll
just leave that to the two butts are
that iOS 5 6 is it's 56 then the new one
yes I wish I sick iOS 6 shouldn't have
been called iOS 6 it should have been
called iOS 5.5 yeah and and you will get
like what what what a the differences
between Windows Phone 7 and 8 you look
at the difference between Android you
know two and three and three and four am
i yeah right three and three and four is
the big via the big leap yeah um and and
you know things look different things
feel different and that's the most
important part is that they feel
different iOS doesn't feel any different
they polished little tiny places and at
the end of the day I kind of feel like
I've been for what I've been tricked so
so that's the first thing I'm truly
tired of iOS and the only thing that
makes me it's still excited about this
device is that it like I said it does
everything very well which is not to say
that the galaxy s3 that I was using you
know two weeks ago doesn't do everything
that it does well the other but is that
the hardware while extremely beautiful
is flawed these metal edges there's
something significantly wrong with them
um yeah they're beveled right there
there's a different is that the part
that chips that you were talking about
here
here that's the part that chips and on
the black model which looks a lot nicer
than the white model I should add it is
far worse yesterday I saw my bro who got
the black one and he was pointing out to
me on his edges there are numerous
scratches from the factory remind mine
has a nick from the factory and then he
went on to use the device for the last
you know since friday which is not that
long and he's very careful with his
phone and he pointed out a variety of
other nicks and scratches there on his
device so while his iphone 5 looks
really badass from afar it's black its
menacing looking um looking up close
you're like wow this almost looks like
junk it scratched all over the place um
and you know I I can't imagine that
Apple's going to recall there are five
million iPhones that they sent out
already it's a design flaw just like the
issue with the iphone 4 with the antenna
issues it's a design flaw and you know
what kind of fly mean are they using
soft metal that's too soft like I mean
is it what's the deal it's too I i think
the aluminum softer then than other
metals right it's lighter but it's
softer trick right right and the end
they they did this you know beautiful
polished edge and i guess when you when
you i guess they're exposing their was
taking off the top layer of the metal
whereas on the back it has a layer on it
a sort of a protective layer but but on
these sides it's just it's kind of like
raw metal uh um and so it's kind of
upsetting right cuz you've got this new
awesome feeling in your hand device it's
expensive it feels expensive and then
you look around the edges up closely and
you're like or could i drop this know
the funny thing is that if you guys
remember back in the iphone 4 days the
problem was with the iphone 4 and white
I mean Apple had problems with the
getting the exact color mm-hmm and in
the white shape now we have problems
with the black one of course aluminum is
not a metal which you can easily paint
so I'm not defending Apple right here
because they did a terrible job with
their quality control but anodizing the
aloo
brings a thin layer of color of another
material on top of the aluminum itself
so when you drop it when you scratch it
when you do something which bothers that
certain layer of color on top of deals
on them yeah it just exposes the
material underneath which is the
aluminum itself so they really should
have thought of this even at the cost of
never having a black iphone just have it
like like the max have its silver have
it aluminum natural color because they
should have known that this is prone to
happen it's according to our friends at
Wikipedia anodizing increases the
thickness of the natural phone call
increases the thickness of the natural
oxide layer on the surface of metal
parts so it's okay so I get that and
it's it's for durability right and it's
for if we're increased resistance to
wear but yes but when it ships all
branches off it's very obvious right I
just one one more thing to get back to
what Brendan said about iOS 6 being iOS
5.5 I ninety percent agree with him but
that ten percent in me says no and let's
take a look at this in the following way
so far we only had one screen resolution
on the iPhone 4 and 4s and two screen
resolutions on the on the iPad and the
new iPad these were all they all had in
common the iphone's resolution i mean
the the retina display is almost a
double up now the iOS 6 brings a
completely new resolution to the table
which means that they probably had to
redesign some core aspects of the
platform to support now one two three
four resolutions in total so probably
not because of the features but because
of redrawing the core elements that they
thought of making it iOS 6 and not 5
point something this is what I think
yeah that that could be it and speaking
of a taller screen resolution I find it
very ironic that Apple's App apples
apple store app has not been updated for
the taller screen oh really
so what there's there's black bars on
the top and bottom they do it like how
could that possibly be I don't know but
but but you know I think I think I'm
being a little little negative on the
iphone right now but I should say that
while iOS 6 does indeed bore me it it's
kind of ok because the iPhone 5 is
dramatically faster in my opinion then
then the iphone 4s like I cannot get it
to slow down and too bogged down in in
the in the review video I did I was
double tapping the home button and
switching between apps and I'm and not
just you know static apps but camera
something that has to open a video that
has to show up on the screen and be
stored in memory and you cannot slow
this thing down it is blazing fast well
that is entirely supported by some story
that pc world round where they said the
iphone 5 is the fastest phone they've
ever benchmarked is that correct yeah to
a certain extent yes but i have to say
this I also think I corrected it in my
post and their headline says the iPhone
5 is the fastest phone in the land and
this is a very important aspect because
the land obviously the u.s.a doesn't
have the quad-core Exynos processor on
the galaxy s3 and doesn't have the
quad-core Tegra 3 on the HTC One X they
will probably have the quad-core exynos
on the note 2 so they have compared the
iphone 5 with the dual core versions of
other android phones and yeah probably
faster but once you compare it with the
GS read the global version or even the
HTC One X the difference is either
smaller or the iPhone 5 is just the
second or the third one yeah that's what
I'm thinking the add the galaxy s 3
quad-core it's gotta be i'm gonna guess
it's gonna be faster and especially the
note 2 with the quad core what time do
you think they perform as well though i
like it do you think they can reproduce
they in your experience in the vert in
the head head to you know ken the galaxy
s3 keep up with the new iphone 5 in that
sense of UI responsiveness you know
that's it that's a good question i I
kind of always look at the galaxy s3 is
as with cyanogenmod 10 living
and i can say that signage in montana
galaxy s3 with screen animations turned
off it absolutely feels faster than the
iphone 5 my purpose and saying that the
iphone 5 fuels ridiculously fast is i'm
just comparing it with the 4s but the
the fastest feeling phone i've ever
experienced is the quad-core galaxy s3
with cyanogenmod 10 that thing just is
just like everything sorcerer taneous
it'll I'll think about a nap and it'll
open it before I even get to it it's
just amazing this is very very true but
we need to keep it stock so when we do
comparisons between phones we always
tend to keep it as stuck as possible so
the out-of-the-box experience because
not every Android user is a super power
user so what I'm saying here is that the
galaxy has free the quad core version is
even out of the box with ice cream
sandwich faster than young iphone 5 I've
geek benched mine and the highest score
i got was closed 1800 which compared to
the 1500 and something on the iphone 5
is faster so so and that's without jelly
bean so keeping it though like in the
from the viewpoint of the of the average
user right who thinks who hears
geekbench and thinks and like visualizes
some nerds desk all right Andrew doesn't
know what the hell a bench a gig benches
or doesn't give it a damn about any of
that I feel like still and maybe this is
you know maybe this is me and I am wrong
because i don't have the iphone 5 yet
but i still feel like from what i've
seen video wise the UI responsiveness
and the the way it feels would it would
be very surprising for me to hear anyone
say that the galaxy s3 is able to keep
up with the iphone 5 from a UI
perspective and i'm not saying the
galaxy s3 is slow I think it's
definitely the fastest android phone
I've ever handled even the dual core
version all I'm saying is the iphone 5 i
think is still faster am I wrong it
depends on how the operating system has
been built and sure and iOS was always
built with the the user experience in
mind I mean they I think it was a report
that iOS always renders the ethics and
whatever you have on your screen with
high
priority than others those two bunked
yeah that was there was a whole big
thing like yeah but but again there's
project butter which which brings that
to android because previous versions of
android didn't prioritize certain
processes but now project butter not
only prioritizes it but it anticipates
it right yeah and and it's you know
interviewing the iphone 4s and below it
was kind of a little bit easier to
recommend an iPhone device if you wanted
a smooth refined experience but jelly
bean I always come here on here and say
this gently being fixed Android and it's
no longer about the smoothness anymore
and and it you know maybe five percent
of devices have android devices of jelly
bean at this moment in time but um you
know think the gap is is definitely
closing at least in that respect which
is a very important component it's how
you interact with it it's how you
experience this is also true yes but the
then then again you have to know that
you are comparing a quad-core experience
with a dual core experience now how
about if you compare jelly bean on a
dual-core one point three gigahertz
processor with the iphone 5 i'll see you
that yeah we'll have to do that and
seeing exactly at the same specs which
is faster iOS 6 or jelly bean because
jelly bean of course brings support for
multiple cores and quad core processors
are almost always faster if applications
are done right then dual-core processors
connect application zar done right can I
use that can I use this as a little
spring board here because I kind of want
to I want to do something I want to want
to move move on a little bit but on
newsroom which is a series you should
watch if you're at all into the news
sometimes if big newsworthy stuff drops
they'll say throw out the rundown and
that's what i want to say because we
were going to talk about Windows Phone
decks but I kind of want to we started
talking about jelly bean i kind of want
to jump into android but before I do I
want to ask Brandon if you've got
anything else or Tony on the iphone 5
because i really want to ask about jelly
bean as it relates to what we're talking
about aside from the fact that i can't
wait to have it and to see firsthand
what that Mapple gate is about which
should i haven't seen it yet except yeah
for on my iPad you have to touch on that
yeah
I really did a lousy job on that now I'm
sure they will fix it in a couple of
months in six months something like that
they will bring it i'm not saying it
will be better than google mac but they
will fix it but at the moment it just
sucks so I mean how bad does it suck
Brandon like is it is it a core
functionality problem like I saw
somebody on my Facebook feed this
morning say that the on their new iphone
the the maps application thinks that
harvard square which is right down the
street from me in cambridge is in like
Kentucky somewhere like I mean is it
that bad like does it was it gonna get
you did you know drive you off a cliff
or what I don't think so I mean it works
and it works fine it's just it's half
baked and to see a half two big product
like you just described a scenario and
I've seen several of those I've seen you
know my local high school I was driving
by an open maps not while driving and it
misspelled the high school name I mean
that the high schools been there for
like 50 years it's just like little
things it's just so unexpected in an
apple product they obviously ship this
thing too early it's not it's not good
enough and this is and this is the US
where all the focus on mapping data is
now imagine my country which is not even
a top European country I have a shopping
mall here in Oradea where I live and
it's called Lotus center and when I look
that up on google maps of course it
finds it but when I look it up on iOS 6
it finds some I don't know what kind of
a lotus fleece market or something like
that in the States I mean come on I
don't have I don't think i have two or
3p oh wise in my in my city on iOS 6 it
it's it's very clear that Google is
gonna release a Maps app for iOS 6 and
uh you know I think they will you don't
think they will I don't think say we're
ambling to do it I think they'll just
let it all burn ass no think because
this isn't this is a huge opportunity
for google google wants everyone in the
world to use their products and services
all is on that stuff yeah and and you
know and it's an apple can't reject that
app because yes the tremendous they can
technically but they're not going to
because everyone's gonna be extremely
upset about that and it's gonna be
really bad press for Apple who will look
like big brother
yeah but if they accept that application
nobody will use iOS maps and then again
well in the purpose of iOS maps is to be
used until they make it better which
they will do like apples like they've
got egg on their face right now I mean
this is a company that is enormously
devoted to its own sense of face and
pride and the fact that they've launched
this app that's that's getting this
amazing level of backlash it's got to be
the one of the most embarrassing things
they've they've done in recent memory so
they're going to fix this by the way
church you go go on Brendan I was just
gonna say real quick what's interesting
is that apparently the maps app in iOS 6
is cloud-based so they can update data
without having to push out another
version of the app this was something I
wanted to dodge it bun yeah it's it's a
cloud-based and it's the how should I
say this is crowd-sourced if I made did
you guys see that statement the tomtom
spokesperson said that there's nothing
wrong with the maps there's nothing
wrong with the mapping data they are
still the leaders in mapping data of
course not yet would disagree and they
just said that Apple that allows the
implementation of that of that mapping
data I just not see that but that as
well I didn't know they were doing that
kind of finger pointing no they didn't
yeah man I mean like I feel like if your
tomtom whatever I don't know that's I
don't really think much about Tom Tom
but there there there there partner
right there their launch partners yeah
but it but the experience is just is
just bad press for tomtom and they won
of course keep their name their high up
on the list right yeah I remember we
talked about often about how it's
increasingly difficult to impress people
with smartphone features and smart phone
hardware and fly over has given me a new
opportunity to impress people and so I I
type an empire state building and then I
click on the thing and then I click on
the thing and I'm like wow look at this
and all the while I'm doing this and i'm
thinking i'll never use this future if
you did not go I mean it that's fun when
you do like I used to do it when
augmented reality was a thing and you
hold up your phone and it's like hey
check it out you can see all the sites
in real time and of course it's it's not
a useful feature in the slightest but it
really impresses the hell out of people
I was showing off iOS
maps to somebody who was recently
visiting me and of course it's it's no
match to google street view but of
course flyover is excellent but I
couldn't find more than two or three
spots on the planet which which have
flyover enabled I mean Empire State
Building yes Big Ben yes but I search
for Eiffel Tower and no I've searched
for the PISA tower and no so we have two
venues or free banquet venues around the
world where you can use this how often
do you guys go to the Empire State
Building or to the Big Ben well it's
ridiculous yeah do you guys do you guys
uh do you street for you a lot are you
upset that there's no street view in
maps and I 06 I haven't used it I mean
maybe occasionally once or twice a year
when I'm at the mwc or Aoife and I need
to know specifically whether that street
is the street I'm looking for but else
no yeah no I mean I use it i use treat
you more I used to feel kind of
sparingly but it would be it certainly
is useful when I do have to use it I
like showing up to a place and being
like not only yes I know I'm on the
right corner but oh yes I have actually
seen these storefronts before yeah yeah
it's very very useful so it's it's it's
annoying that it's not there do you
think do you think they'll do that does
Apple I mean Apple certainly as the
resources to do you think they have the
will to like because they're night they
can't use Google's imaging data right
from from their Street food like they
would have to go and drive everywhere in
tears not a chance and lend ya the truth
it would take years and so much so many
well if they have the resources but
here's here's how I see iOS maps in two
or three years I see them being as
accurate as Google Maps and obviously
Apple will will probably try to strive
towards having flyover enabled across
the globe so fly over being available
everywhere would be a great response to
google street view yeah yeah what no
you're absolutely right that would that
would be helpful I mean because it kind
of does about sort of the same thing
maybe even a little bit better if you
hate is good enough right and it's and
it's on their servers so it will only
come down to your data speeds and your
how much data you are consuming yeah
that's a good thought I like that
thought
on I want to say one more thing about
the iphone before we move on please do
please do so in the review I said I kind
of like the lightning thunder no it's
lightning over the connector yeah I like
it it's it's satisfying the plug-in it's
reversible and I think people discount
how important reversible is but you know
microUSB you gotta get it in right
that's what anyway well that's not good
ok Joe Levi let's see what you can make
out of this so anyway the when I was
preparing the review I took took an HD
video on my phone I had some from the
previous days and I was like right now I
gotta get this this video onto my
computer so I'm like oh plugging the
cable and i'm at my office and i look
around and i have the 30 pin and I'm
like oh no I don't have to go home do I
and so I start thinking about every
possible way I ok I can do itunes Wi-Fi
sync no you have to plug it in and turn
in Wi-Fi sync and then so I contact high
man like Jaime I know there's a way to
get this video off this phone he's like
uploaded to YouTube i Sabbah dog food
yeah right doesn't drive right I
uploaded to yak I you know I was wishing
that Android at that moment I I uploaded
it to youtube it compressed it to 720
well I can't release a video sample
that's 720 and compressed and so high
said I found an application that sets
your phone up as a Wi-Fi server and it
allows you to transfer something or
other so I had to buy this app to enable
it to tap into my photostream but it
would not photos through my camera roll
but it would only work with photo is not
video desaad yes so so then I'm like you
know I I should probably have another I
have another lightning cable I keep at
the office so I go online and I try to
find a lightning cable which Apple isn't
even shipping yet extra lightning cables
and then it just got me a little bit
angry because if only a pod included
that egregiously priced $29 accessory
with every iPhone mmm I wouldn't have to
you know spend you know in 30-40 minutes
on the road driving back home to get the
lightning cable so damn it a couple of
years from now you will have five or six
lightning cables laying around just like
we have 30 pin cables right now from
your iPad
your iPhone from your iPod so you will
have so many it's just the beginnings
i'm not gonna go i hope i wanted i
wanted something which was magnetic like
the max a yes no ok so what I mean
really cool yeah but you know even I
mean just just from a you just throw the
cable the whole cable connector style
out like this is like a five or six year
old complaint but I don't care i'll say
it again i am did the fact that that
apple doesn't give you access to the
file system on iOS devices is just easy
only is the geekiest thing i'll ever say
because usually I'm the champion of the
everyman am I get our native file system
throw it out but me I'm in that
situation all the time with my with my
ipad which i use for some photography ha
LOL i'm an idiot but you know yeah i
look like a moron taking out photo what
do you mean by fly alexis system because
i mean i can't like if i want to
transfer a photo from an ipad to my to
my mac or chewing to a desktop machine I
have to that first of all have to
connect it with the wire if I don't want
to email the photo and deal with the
compression and all that kind of show
and like I have to use iPhoto I have to
use after you have a generation right to
import the images directly all I want
you know if I'm trying to deal with a
raw file that I don't want software to
get its hands on and to fiddle with and
whatever I just I just want to drag and
drop and I can't do that I can't see
what you know what I mean like yeah but
you can always either upload it to your
Dropbox then a photo stream uploaded
right but if you're dealing with video
though like all those applications will
will compress it they'll do their weird
stuff to it they'll you know rather than
just letting me all right let me plug
this in let me drag and drop this over I
see what you mean but Windows Phone is
the exact thing no I'm not saying I'm
will employ yes cuz windows phone has
emulated like the iOS environment you
know at the moment yes yeah I mean it's
whatever it but that's a whole different
thing I'm not gonna I'm just can I just
be honest I'm really just annoyed that
wires are still around and we already
talked about wireless stuff when Jaime
was on and apparently judging by all the
comments everyone still loves wires so
yeah me too all y'all can just eat it
you guys
the magsafe adapter can guess why they
didn't do it well I have a couple of
five years your magnets would that take
up some space that's one cheer that's
one okay that's one and plus the magnets
the magnets and and the antenna with the
antenna which are on top and on the
bottom wouldn't play nicely with each
other and the magnetometer as well the
compass but then again the ipad has
magnets inside it screen because of the
smart cover which snaps into place on
the left and on the right and it doesn't
have anything to do with the with the
compass and stuff like that so probably
they didn't want to have something which
was or plus if you look at the magsafe
adapter it has four or five pins and the
Mac save two is also smaller now the
lightning cable has eight or nine
contacts if I'm right so in order to
have a magnetic something like that it
would have been needed for them to be in
the context to be aligned in one single
line and that would have taken up too
much space on the bottom of the phone
just just rambling here's just yeah a
couple of random thoughts why branded
you have something specific that you're
thinking about also sort I mean a long
odds we've been talking I mean it's the
placement of the magnet it there's a
speaker right near the connector and you
can't really put a magnet your speaker
but speakers are magnet based so they
could have used the magnet inside the
speaker to the heads come actually for
that that would have been some sci-fi
awesome crazy alright I want to I want
to move on if we can to to Android well
because I we were talking about jelly
bean before I'm sorry I apologize for
forgetting about the map will get in the
way to talk about but when we were
talking about jelly bean i was thinking
about the galaxy s3 because Samsung has
officially begun the galaxy s three
jellybean rollout hallelujah yeah I know
rightly same time and that's my initial
response to right it's like oh thank god
finally the the OEM is pushing out this
update but then I think about it I'm
like why do i why do I want it and the
reason I'm asking that question is
because as I said before I find
incredibly I can't believe I'm saying
this I can i find the TouchWiz skin on
the galaxy s3 on all the galaxy s3's
that I have to run so smoothly through
that it is completely that I in my
experience
even as a UI obsessed freak it runs at
the same speed and with the same
fluidity as does the jelly bean on my
Nexus 7 so why am I excited about this
I'm not excited about it for the
marginal improvements to notifications
I'm not excited about it for Google now
which I don't really make use of so why
why why is this a thing what am I
missing guys because it's something one
it's something which you don't already
have and of course you want it because
it's out there this is a psychological
thing and second it's yeah it's the
increase in speed not necessarily in the
TouchWiz but system wise in launching
applications better multitasking better
memory management and those things which
on the quad core processor might not be
that visible but at the system-wide
level they are an increase in
performance I'm I guess I just I just
have so i have 0 complaints about the
way this device and that i'm using right
now operates yeah well there's there's
also as you know there there are when i
when i was testing the leaked version of
of jelly bean on the galaxy s3 with
TouchWiz they were there were probably a
dozen or two dozen little changes in
settings ways widgets look and they just
they used the jelly they're using the
jelly bean update is an opportunity to
fit kind of run some bug fixes and while
you might think that the interface is
super smooth Michael now I'm sure that I
could give you a few things to do to
point out ice cream sandwiches
weaknesses like in the web browser and
um you know for example the web browser
maybe it's not that big of a deal but
when you scroll down the page rapidly
right now you sometimes get some
checkerboards or white space and with
with jelly bean um in whatever the case
in in Chrome or in the stock browser
then either either one yeah okay well I
mean I guess right right all right we
can we can still be excited about this
this isn't a big man I just wanted to
bring it up yeah but but I think this is
more psychological as I touched upon it
it's it's out there it's already three
or four months old and you demand that
you you need it to be not that you need
you want it you expect to have it I
guess it's just kind of interesting that
that and maybe I'm giving too much
credit to touch wiz but I think it's
kind of interesting that there's been a
reverse
so we're skins used to be this lamented
thing where it's like ah they slow
everything down and I think in the case
of HTC Sense they can't they kind of
still do but you know if I still had my
galaxy nexus and I was waiting on jelly
bean i would be waiting with bated
breath but because Samsung has done such
a good job building the the software at
on top of ICS for the galaxy s3 I'm just
almost completely apathetic yeah they
did a good job they really did and it's
it's like it's interesting to hear you
speak to say that isn't weird says it's
loud yeah you feel like you're like
lying or something um anyway so that yet
so that's happening look out for that
one last thing yeah I'll you probably be
the last person on this planet to get
the official update as usual I always
end the last one on the planet to get
official update so I'm gonna let you
guys know whenever Charlie beam hits my
GS free oh it's sad please do and I will
let you know when it hits mine of course
and if I notice can we is speaking of
not that at all LG is building another
Optimus view uh-huh can we stop them
yeah I think it's too late i think it's
been it's it's it's been announced
officially for south korea as of i think
i think today or yesterday said I'll
stop in that manufacturing Preston is
why this is fascinating to me I
mentioned this in a piece recently it's
interesting to me when when companies
make sequels to products that were first
of all that we're just mediocre it's an
even more interesting when they make
sequels to products that are like not
well received and I don't think the view
has been very well received and based on
your time with the intuition Brandon I
think that didn't change when it came to
the US so what so what's the story I
mean why are they doing this do you guys
think well go on no users I don't think
that you're getting it guys the LG is
just pushing out the view too because
there's a samsung galaxy note 2 out
there and they are already one year the
you know yeah whenever Samsung came out
with the galaxy note in 2011
the MVC there was a follow-up it was the
view and the view is still not available
and now there's the note 2 and of course
the head there has to be the video too
and this is just plain stupid or it's me
that I'm playing stupid because I don't
understand a thing the initial view had
a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor with
one gig of ram then this month or i
think it was in August they said that it
will be available with a spec bump they
will replace the 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon processor with a quad-core
tegra 3 and still one gig of ram and now
the view 2 has again a 1.5 years
dual-core processor a step back but it
has two gigs of ram so I think I'm
stupid I don't get it I don't think
you're the one who's stupid know some
someone made a mistake it's in that room
exactly yeah I don't know I am whatever
you know I think I think it's
interesting it's kind of the same
stories like the PadFone getting its own
getting its own sequel which I did and I
I don't mean to put these things in the
same category i think the PadFone is a
more innovative idea i think it's just
as doomed but i think it's it's a more
interesting idea than the view to this
is not the way to do it this is not what
l where l g is going to find success in
kind of releasing an uninspired miss
equal to an uninspired in original
original design well then the same the
same things gonna happen with this it's
going to be not well received I me now
the lg's alternative they have to be in
the phablet space HTC has to be in the
phablet space they will be soon everyone
has to be in the phablet space because
Samsung has proved that it's it's a big
money maker so LG could have done work
two things they could have scratched the
view concept created a new phablet which
would have been admitting defeat and had
would have been admitted that the
original view was a failure or they
could have come up with a view to with
hopefully and some some some significant
changes that that make it noticeably
different than the original view but
they just they just didn't do that it's
it's almost like it like looks very
similar to me it's almost like they
cracked open the case and they had an
engineer solder in another gig of ram
and then
all right we're good right yeah but
imagine a possible view to with with a
super fast netdragon s4 pro processor
which is on the optimus G with a super
high resolution not 1024 x 768 or
whatever the resolution is but a 720p
display and that would have been a
worthy competitor you know it may be on
paper but I think if you put if you've
managed to squeeze in a v8 diesel engine
into the Optimus Vu body I don't think
anybody would still buy it like I think
it is I think it is a dead end product
that is in a form factor that is
unfriendly that nobody likes that nobody
will ever buy I think it's a dead
product I think they should have killed
it that's the key it's a form factor
that no one's going to bite and Tony you
know you said why don't they put a 720p
screen in there that that would be that
would be the smart thing to do nobody
wants a four by three aspect ratio phone
it is terrible for so many reasons eight
yeah and they are so fun of it yeah and
they keep on pushing it and pushing it
right and I get that you want to
differentiate and it's like look we're
doing something different I respect the
hell out of that but it's not it's not
the way that LG is gonna catch up to
Samsung in any respect so all right or
whatever I that makes me to press let's
not talk about the view to anymore um
can we talk about something I haven't
paid any attention to which is these
don't i'm sorry i'm going to i want to
ask first because you just mentioned it
brandon that HTC one x+ that with it got
pictured for tmobile listeners if you
haven't read the story this is just a
like it was a quick leak is the HTC one
x+ distinct from HTC's possible phablet
offering or is it the same thing i'm
confused right now it's different it is
just yeah yeah alright so we do we know
anything more about that HTC phablet
this isn't in the rundown at all it's
just it's just wishful thinking i think
it nobody has actually confirmed this I
heard from someone that there's an HTC
event next week I haven't been informed
of it so it may or may not be true it
would make sense because right around
now if HTC is gonna be releasing a fall
Android product or two this is this is
the time to do it so we might hear about
the HTC di X and the dicks and then
yeah and though and the 1x plus plus
yeah but let's not forget there's also
something else in the rumor mill it's
the flyer tablet refresh we've been
hearing about so it should be I don't
think there will be a phablet and I
think that if HTC wanted to enter the
phablet game they would have done it by
now a 4.7 inch form factor for the 1x in
the one x+ is okay it's a large
smartphone what they want to do maybe is
get a 7-inch tablet out there a flyer
refresh with super good specs a great
build quality great design and and super
cheap price it would be interesting to
see the to see the flyer succeed in its
second incarnation I guess we'll have to
wait and see what they would they
announce may I make a prediction oh yeah
please it's pretty clear by now that
Samsung is not going to be releasing a
premium tablet this year which is really
crazy if you think about it 12 months
and the best tablet we have from Samsung
is the note 10.1 which which has
received very mixed reviews to say the
least here's what I think has happened I
think that they were preparing a high
res quad-core ipad 3 competitor at 9.7
inch 10 10 inch device for 2012 but then
they got owned yeah then they got owned
but then these thinly then they saw then
they said you know why don't we just
release this 10.1 note we'll put a lot
of marketing prowess behind it because
it's truly different than the ipad and
will continue to work on the new Samsung
high-end tablet and make it and try to
preempt what's gonna happen with the eye
with the ipad 4 because the ipad poor
it's kind of funny it's not that far off
from from now it's gonna be announced
what I march in April which is yes'm
yeah mid six it's six months away so i
think that samsung is skipping this
generation of ipad to compete with cuz
they don't have anything that competes
with that if you think about it with a
high res display and you know i just
wish i saw that the that dinosaur that
that super tablet samsung was rumored to
somewhere announced in after NBC or
somewhere around
were your March do you guys remember
that 11.6 inch quad-core ohd yeah yeah
yeah yeah I wanted to see that badly but
maybe yeah maybe brandon you were right
and let's not forget the ipad mini
rumors so if if Apple is to out an ipad
mini then I think Samsung will out a
super competitive 7-inch tablet not a la
Samsung 7-inch which they have right now
the galaxy tab but something better can
be honest I go ahead Brennan alright
well I think that I mean I was some kind
of sitting here being like why am i why
am i what am I having to make an effort
to pay attention and that's because it's
it's it's a boring it's a boring boring
boring the product already in my mind
because of the OS it runs I love android
on a smartphone and I love it in raw
form on the Nexus 7 but i don't i
certainly don't love it in a tablet size
and it's certainly not running TouchWiz
as it's currently implemented on say the
galaxy note n dot one it's weird isn't
it yeah and I'm much more interested in
Samsung's offerings like in the windows
8 space and on a tablet or other OEMs in
the windows 8 space on a tablet so it's
like I think until people are able to
get excited about Android on tablets
outside of the nexus 7 arena and this is
all kind of mood it doesn't matter what
Samsung does hmm true what is the worth
it let's see your egan yes Oh totally
and hopefully Samsung with its kind of
new preferred partner status can get
some you know some some inside
information on the future direction of
Android so they can craft TouchWiz to
complement it and not to usurp its
advantages you know do you think that
despite all the crazy rumors of Samsung
ditching Android which I think are just
dumb will Samsung become to Android with
Nokia is for Microsoft for windows phone
I think that all depends on or is that
Motorola yeah exactly I mean I yeah I
think that's what Google's gonna do with
more even though we're control right in
yeah but outside of the US motorola
doesn't count that I'm sorry more of our
guys but here in Europe
rolla phones are I bet haven't seen one
in the wild so it they just don't sell
and from what I see in the US Motorola
is just another Android Market stand
another enjoy the phone if they want to
I don't know have something better
faster nicer with with Motorola they
should both invest much more time and RD
and resources because motorola
definitely has what it takes and with
google support and money they have
everything they need but instead we just
see the razr HD or the razor i ruin come
on and it but you know I think the razr
m actually even does serve as a positive
you know sign of where Motorola's going
because I really the the evolution in
software and even hardware to an extent
between the atrix HD which was very
clearly started when motorola was still
its own company and the razr m which
probably is kind of a mid you know a
hybrid between the two is is not quite
night and day but it's really amazing
the razr m is a really awesome phone the
atrix HD is really not in my opinion so
you know it's i think they're going the
right direction I think Google's going
to do some really impressive stuff with
with Motorola so we'll have to wait and
see um we did good can we uh there's uh
there's some other android stuff but
actually I would like to jump into
Windows Phone since we talked about it
with you guys be okay with that we're
running a little short on time as usual
sure just looking if we're missing
something I'm looking up your turn I
don't want to talk about the note HD hey
guys barnes noble released some new
tablets go buy them if you want them
yeah i like you know it's i don't know
it is anybody if you guys are excited
about it please stop me because i'm not
i don't care about the note oh well they
just we care about the note it's it's
funny almost that we talk about them
because we take a step back they're
running android but that's not android
and they're intended for different types
of people you could argue that there for
the power user because the kindle fire
HD the nook color tablet they've got so
many names they turned they turned in
they had really good at developer
communities you could relatively easily
strip off the barnes noble or the amaz
on operating system thing and put stock
android on it but besides that out of
the box they are not intended for people
that are listening to this podcast it
for in the for the most part yeah and I
think that's why I wanted to touch on it
briefly when I was thinking about the
podcast because you know I know the
original new color was a big deal for
for Android enthusiasts who wanted to
run you know stock Android or SEM build
on it because it was a cheap tablet but
now in the day of the nexus 7 which I've
talked about anything 14 times in this
podcast already you have a good a tablet
that's good that that runs well and
that's cheap and you know that that's
kind of just stolen all the thunders out
from you know under these guys plus
let's not forget google play books we
now have books oh right the content
story yes exacto right and and even if
you don't like google play books you
know i've i've been on the amazon kindle
ecosystem since the original kindle and
i download the app and it's like boom
I've got it I've got it one of these
things that they're selling but it's on
my Nexus 7 exactly exactly it sounded
the hardware I prefer um alright so
let's let's move on then I I want to
talk windows phone real quick this is
this was the most surprising headline to
me from the past week and I don't think
I am I think I'm alone I think I was the
only one surprised by this rumor has it
correct me if this has been debunked
that HTC is pondering excuse me that
Nokia is pondering suing HTC over its
new windows phone 8 designs I has heard
any follow-ups organ banks neither
confirmations yeah we'll just three it
as a rumor don't think it will ever
happen yet i mean i don't know like it's
it's interesting to hear this because
the of course we talked about this
already this is the first thing that
left to my mind when HTC announced the
new windows phones i was like oh wow
those look a lot like Lumias and of
course I think ninety percent of that is
the fact that they were brightly colored
and you know maybe that's not enough to
to substantiate a lawsuit and maybe
that's what Nokia is sitting there
thinking about right now like could we
actually win if we went through this
with this but I mean yeah that this gets
into a larger discussion of what
constitutes infringement and like you
know it's like all phones to a degree
are rectangles so
you know how how much does making
brightly colored casings infringe on
what the fins are doing you know this
discussion would make sense if Windows
Phone had a sixty percent market share
and Microsoft wouldn't care if if Nokia
is killing HTC or vice versa but with a
still sup to the jig market I don't
think Microsoft will ever allow
something like this I mean you guys play
nice right let's just grow together and
take it from there but but just looking
at the two phones I don't know about the
technologies and the patterns involved
but I it surely doesn't come down to
design because they're different yeah
and I don't know I I think that I i
agree i don't think anything's gonna
come of this but it was interesting that
you know we all SAT there for the first
couple days after the HTC announcement
saying wow man that's a they really took
a page out of Nokia's book yeah but
again and this this is something about
about nokia and HTC as i'm gonna touch
on this and everybody hates me they were
just throwing trucks up spit in my
direction when when I said that
everybody's picking on Apple because of
course you're picking on the big one the
one you're afraid of the galaxy s3 is
picking on the iphone 5 the Lumia 920
even though not officially but it's
picking on the iphone 5 and now nokia
picking on HTC mins something good for
HTC I mean nokia is afraid of HTC it the
way I see it yeah no I think you're
right and I think it's because finally
HTC has kind of awoken from its slumber
and they were like yeah we're not going
to do another kind of dull dull looking
windows finally I'm gonna drop some some
science and you know it it took me a
second to I actually sat in bed one
night after the HTC announcement on my
tablet in between bouts of dropping it
on my face because I was too tired and
I'm like comparing the HTC windows
phones with the Nokia Lumia series and
I'm kind of having this thing inside me
where I'm like what am I gonna what am i
what am I going to do I'm having a
crisis of you know which one am I going
to buy and then I eltham Utley it came
down to something that Nokia was not at
all afraid to point out in an
infographic where they're like good
things come to those who wait as Adam
lean points out in a piece where
they're pointing out their wireless
charging they're pointing out there kind
of superior design their point again
they're comparing it to the iphone 5
well they're comparing to the iphone yet
they are you're right they are but I I
think they've other sites have kind of
done this with and I think we've done
this between the Lumia series and the
HTC windows phones and it's like yeah
they look similar I think I still think
Nokia brings more to the table and I
ultimately ended up settling on the
onion Lumia again personally but it's
just it's just interesting what what
far-reaching effects just launching a
bunch of multicolored phones can do good
for your brand I mean that's you know I
don't know that's not all that the new
HD yes sir but let's not forget the
social life is is probably more active
than our normal day-to-day lives so when
picking between an HTC windows phone 8x
/ 8 X and the Lumia 920 I think most
people will go for the better camera
under Lumia 920 because just HTC I don't
know and again they will hate me the 1x
didn't do good pictures it was the
screen that made the pictures look good
but comparing the Lumia 920 with the HTC
windows phone 8x we don't have official
officially we don't have review units
yet but I have a hunch the Lumia 920
will own camera wise the the HTC phones
right yeah I I think you're I think
you're entirely right and you know
whatever I'm not gonna talk about how I
want the 920 and cyan and so let's just
move on because I'm really really sad
still it's coming it will be here better
be here I hate warm colors and phones
and I know why the Lumia 610 was sort of
the old you know really low end windows
phone with them now it looks like
there's there's a 510 in the works and
we got details on that it's this was for
a story from last week but we didn't
touch on it it this looks to be like
this in an even lower and that looks
like a guava folk to me it does it's got
really rounded corner it's actually not
too bad looking from the back but it's
got a the same 800 megahertz processor
and 256 megs of ram is in the 610 so
it's not going to run apps like skype
well
it's not gonna do I mean I just can't
believe is anybody else surprised that
they're going even lower and here i
thought the 610 was where they would
bottom out I mean what's no kiddin
trying to capture with this that they
couldn't get with the 610 emerging
markets she's right now that's where
their push in the 610 isn't it yeah but
there's it will probably be either one
carrier specific or another carrier
specific or it will be prepaid or it
will be a free phone I mean obviously
they will they will stick to Windows
Phone 7.5 tango or wishful thinking
seven point eight but that's as far as
it gets yeah yeah it's interesting to
think about what that does to the
Windows Phone brand overall you know
with this I don't know how much
penetration these lower end devices are
going to get but I wouldn't want if I'm
Microsoft I don't want I do want to
capture that market don't get me wrong
but I don't want to capture it with
devices that can't run that can't run
all that all the apps that Windows Phone
can run and run them well that's true
but those so we have that in Android I
mean look at the samsung galaxy gio look
at the LG optimus one and look at old
and blow and android phones they are
running or the operating system yeah
they are but they're cheap they are
running applications not all of them but
most of them right so if it's for
teenagers or four for people who don't
have money to invest and a higher and
hardware yeah and you know this come I
always get kind of frustrated when I
hear that Microsoft is releasing a
specific version of Windows Phone just
for the lower end market but you have to
remember that these guys salivate when
they think of you know the the 1 billion
people that live in China who want oh
yeah who want to be like you know the
the rest of the world and have these
high-end smartphones but you know don't
want to pay you know 200 bucks or
whatever it is for it and and you know
they they do a little bit of
multiplication x 1 comma 0 0 0 0 0
whatever billion is true and so you know
this its low-end is huge opportunity for
electronic companies and not necessarily
for hardware but for the ecosystem
itself because those people will buy
applications for this from the store
yeah and and those people will grow up
and get jobs and by the higher end one
and download lots of
yeah but you know and it doesn't always
work there like you have to really
follow through that because that's what
remember what danger tried to do before
Microsoft bottom and danger made the
sidekick and the sidekick was or i guess
the hip-hop is what it was called went
before t-mobile rebranded it and like
they established a real cult following
with these kind of like teenage users in
this kind of alternative lifestyle
skateboarder kind of thing and then once
the sidekick brand became you know old
enough it was like six or seven year
yeah but maybe six or seven years old
and those kids who bought the sidekick
had kind of like grown up so dangerous
land phones but but danger was like
where we're gonna capture that so we're
gonna release like the sidekick HD or
whatever they called it and it was
actually a really cool device as an
android phone right I know was Android
that's right but nobody bought it they
all weighed like you said they all went
to go get android phone so they all want
to go get iphone so you can't always
rely on that and I feel like every I
feel like this is the thing that that um
struggling maybe smartphone
manufacturers or platform makers say
they always they're always like listen
there's still 40 something percent of
the world's users are not on smartphones
and this is what palm said this is what
blackberry is making a big deal about
saying and this is what they're going to
fight with Microsoft who is also saying
this like where we want to go in there
and capture that I completely agree and
I think it's a good tactic but nobody's
done it successfully know and those
people what's going to stop all those
people who are just sitting there saying
well I want to go get an iphone instead
what I want to go get the new galaxy and
it'll be kind of difficult to buy an
iPhone in China if you are living and
working and learning in China but of
course of course once you have a 345 I'm
being optimistic market share you do
everything in your power to boost that
number even if it means that you have to
get twelve fourteen fifteen dollar
hardware out there one user is one user
plus and China has Brandon mentioned is
the number one mobile market so not guys
trying to boost their market share
Microsoft is trying to do that and why
not let the dial phones are great phones
for emerging markets but between the
nokia Asha and the nokia lumia 510
probably people will buy the Lumia
because Microsoft is a brand with
active on the market and symbian is just
symbian hey uh may be spontaneous oh
yeah oh yeah okay oh if you ask
permission first I just did yeah what's
up so uh blackberry jam just happened we
saw blackberry 10 a little bit more
intimately yes well these through video
and blackberry CEO thorsten petroleum
torsten Heinz that's right uh he he said
that blackberry has a fair shot at being
a strong number 3 good you guys agree or
disagree no I know even after seeing ya
there were some cool features of it has
a new interface paradigm where your home
screen is not widgets or icons they're
like live applications yeah actually and
I got excited about that for obvious
reasons yeah i like i like some of the
new interface paradigms that blackberry
that rim is bringing to the new
blackberry but i think they're so
frankly i think they're so far behind
not only do they have to release this
product is this family of products and
this new platform but they have to
maintain developer interest that is just
waning so rapidly and they have no
moment they have reverse momentum you
know they're in a backwards slide right
now i don't think they're stagnant
anymore i think they're actually
actively rolling backwards down the hill
and i don't know i have no hope for them
in regardless of how innovative their
new products are so they don't want to
they go they I I really think that a
company like like even samsung or HTC
needs to buy blackberry and have this
have their blackberry 10 platform which
is actually kind of cool be like their
fall back down to Android and Windows
Phone mmm I feel like if they want to
fall back to the popular one they've got
windows phone already right I mean is it
yeah you know I feel like that's what a
lot of these companies like Samsung and
HTC are doing they're like all right
well Android we'd want to put all our
eggs in one basket so oh but look
h-here's Windows Phone and actually
people might like this at some point
while Samsung has bottle oh yeah but
buzzing yeah I don't apiece anybody off
blackberry was eglee a great
platform and ecosystems a little but I
just don't care about rim anymore and
I'm sorry guys that it just really lost
momentum everybody's talking Android iOS
and Windows Phone and if Microsoft
didn't manage to pull it off almost two
years after launching windows phone with
Windows Phone how could rim do it
exactly and actually I think the most
imposing a question for me regarding rim
is not not any longer who's going to buy
them but why would anybody buy them hmm
um not with those corporations I'm sorry
Michael which I already have it
implemented the system I mean my ex
jumping on switch to BlackBerry's and no
not entire company like why would I
itself I yeah no clue yeah probably
because of this back end may be sure and
and you know I think it's just patents
at this point because I mean nobody
cares about I don't think anybody really
cares about bez the blackberry
enterprise server system and and you
know I mean we're all moving away from
that the whole model is shifted
underneath them so I just don't
understand where who would snap them up
yeah plus BBM already has lots of lots
of lots of alternatives yeah most
notably I message of course but anyway
yeah I also you make a good point Tony
it's not that I don't want to piss
anybody off I'm we're will we all piss
people off daily but it's that I think
blackberry deserves a lot of credit for
coming up with a more innovative
platform than they had it's just it's
just much too late and true that's sad
and let's not forget it's a two-way
street I mean depending on the success
or the lack of success for Microsoft and
its partners this could be either the
winning or the losing card of rim mmhmm
yeah cuz currently their market share is
around the same maybe a little bit
blessed towards microsoft and windows
phone but they're not too far away just
like safe from Microsoft to iOS or to
Android there they're below five percent
both it actually didn't they just
announced that they grew a little bit
the u.s. overtaken by Windows Phone and
2012 blackberry merger I'm sorry I just
I read a headline like two days ago
where that said the writers actually
managed to grow their market share
because of developing markets but the
distance
between them is not that huge I mean
it's nothing rim couldn't pull off or
it's nothing microsoft cannot distance
itself from yeah yeah i don't know
what's that that was a good thank you
for bringing that up Brennan cuz I we
did need to touch on that I would love
to use one of these new devices i hope
that we get the chance to when they're
actually when the review units come out
me too yeah so Before we jump into
reader mail I just want to we posted
Stephen shank posted a story yesterday
entitled would you buy a phone without a
charger HTC and one other manufacturer
think you will 00 2 is the carrier right
yeah 02 and HTC think you will so
apparently HTC is talking about the
possibility of not bundling wall
chargers anymore with their smartphones
got a safe thirty cents I now to be
clear now this I misread this they are
still talking about including USB cable
so there's at least that matter what no
I wouldn't buy a smartphone without a
charger like would you would you buy a
car without what is this like would you
buy a car without her driver's seat no
you know I I mean it is ridiculous and i
can't imagine like you say it's got a
bit like 30 cents their cost savings
can't be that much they make they make
like a hundred thousand of them at a
time their cost per unit is well under a
dollar for that little cube thing right
like no that's a donated can i roleplay
by myself for a minute I've yeah I know
that's your own business I just want to
play devil's advocate and then I want to
contradict myself oh great that sounds
like a fun thing Melissa oh it's about
Michael Fisher how many chargers do you
have in your home uh like wall chargers
like what works like this I probably for
tablets I have probably 12 or 13 brand
the minimum I have an infinite number of
Volturi okay so probably this was their
main idea you already have lots of
chargers why not use one of them and
charge your new phone with one of your
existing chargers which is something
I've learned Brandon does the heat he
mixes up chargers and phones and he
blocks his phones or tablets inside the
nearest the charger and now I'm gonna
contradict myself this is not cool this
is not even
how should I say this every battery
needs to be charged with a certain
amount of current and if you take the
opportunity to read the labels on your
chargers I have four in front of me one
charges with point2 ampars one charges
with point four emperors one charges
with one ampere and one charged with
point A tempers it's not about the speed
of charging it's about the amount of
current which charges that particular
battery yeah and that battery cannot be
charged with any amount of current
because batteries vary from 1300
milliamp hours to 25 50 so I just
contradicted whatever I said before that
and I just played both sides well it's a
good point and you know I think it
doesn't matter for us who changed
devices so frequently because of our
jobs but for somebody who's locked into
a smartphone for two years for somebody
who doesn't want to buy a tablet but
once every three years you know I think
it's very important that they care for
their batteries properly and I don't
think anybody does and if you have
companies being like no you got plenty
of wall chargers at home we're not gonna
give you one special it's like no don't
be jerk please do yeah please give us
and not to mention that the new trend is
to have non removable batteries which is
another factor can't be serviced yeah
but for a several hundred dollar service
fee from the company when you have to
send it back to them ya know it's it's
absurd don't I think we're all in
agreement this is dumb yeah we have
normally at this point was since we're a
little over time I would skip read our
mail but we actually have to really
interesting pieces that bring up some
interesting questions so if you guys
don't mind I would like to read just an
excerpt from yes a piece of mail from
Chris Webber from Gettysburg
Pennsylvania here in the States love
this the whole whole email brings up
some interesting points but his kind of
primary question is he's moving from an
iphone 4 to a Lumia 920 he's kind of
changing his ecosystem is eager to see
how it plays out but he takes issue with
our discussion on I think it was last
podcast where we talked about colors and
we talked about this kind of thing where
it's like yeah you can't if you're a
corporate user if you're like a business
a business man who goes to board
meetings and things and you pull out
your your multicolored smartphone
whether that's a windows phone 8 from
HTC or a nokia lumia it's like banana
yellow
or it's you know bright blue what's the
matter with work phones that are bright
and colorful this jump into color will
quickly become so commonplace he says as
to become unremarkable it so I think
Microsoft is doing all the right things
so it you know that's a question that I
love to to answer and because I don't
know how to answer it because I of
course don't exist in the corporate
world in any of my occupations so I of
course will carry a phone of any sort of
color I want without worrying about how
people perceive me but what is the deal
I mean what is that is this something
uniquely American or is this something
Tony that you see as well well I've been
working in the corporate for about six
or seven years before pocket now so I
can say this the impact in a boardroom
meeting to a red pink yellow whatever
else color phone you can think of is the
same as if imagine this everybody at the
board meeting has black suits and then
somebody comes in with a white or blue
or another colored suit or even a pink
one why not wear this red Ferrari sure
do you care about how he's dressed I
mean not over or under dressing but the
style or do you care about that
information he's transmitting the ideas
is getting forward and if it takes out
he's texas bowl HTC then I just don't
care because I will probably have my
huge humpbacked Lumia or a PureView 808
remain so i think it's it's probably
people care too much about what other
people think about them and it's it's
this is i don't wanna I don't want to
piss anybody off but it's it I think
it's it comes down to your level of
intelligence you cannot judge a book by
it's cover mmm i see i see it a little
bit differently uh i think that as
phones become more colorful it will be
acceptable to have a multicolored phone
in front of you at a board meeting for
example look back to 2007 and yeah board
meeting everyone literally would have a
blackberry and one guy might have gotten
the new I
and did the guy next to him says that
thing looks like a toy how do you get
anything done with it and you know today
taking out an iphone at a board meeting
it's like oh you've got the same phone i
have so i think that as it be as more
phones become available that are
multicolored because right now most
phones are black and white most of them
are just black you know it's a it's not
common to their there are very little
availability of multicolored phones yeah
Chris if you want to buy a yellow phone
and you go to a board meeting buy it
just don't care about whatever people
say it's your style it's your
personality it's you and if you want a
green phone or yellow phone just go for
it so I agree I mean I see it that way
certainly I make those decisions in my
own life but I see it from I can see it
from both sides I think that if I were
going to play devil's advocate i would
say yeah you know in a corporate
environment or in any high-stakes
environment where everyone is kind of
got their serious face on and this is
big news and there are millions of
dollars at stake and whatever you know
people are gonna are going to take any
opportunity they can if they're very
cautious types to say well that that man
doesn't quite fit in or that woman
doesn't quite fit in and it is quite
eccentric and I I don't want to risk my
business relationship with such a person
you know and I that kind of I so I
understand it at the same time I hate it
I hate that kind of ultra-cautious super
super sort of concern i thinking so yeah
I you know whatever I think that Brandon
you're right as we move into the future
as more multi-code phones become
available this kind of stigma will will
pass but Michael do you care if you are
the board meeting or you are at the any
other negotiation let's say one CEO is
coming with his silver jag the other one
is coming with his black rolls-royce or
Bentley and the third one appears in his
yellow Ferrari you care about that yeah
I do however I care because I want to
instantly I instantly identify with the
guy in the yellow Ferrari and want to
learn about how he has the stones to be
different and you know I I like people
who are brave enough to be different so
yeah yeah so I react in the opposite way
of yeah anyway it's it's a fascinating
discussion and Chris thank you for for
writing in
bringing it up we and good luck with
your 920 by the way right and let us
know how the iOS to Windows Phone
transition goes for you and finally I
want to wrap it up with a question from
a gentleman whose name i will
mispronounce I apologize but it is kalid
my sir that's as close as I can get
because I'm inept but kalid also has a
nice at a very long email for us and
love to read the whole thing but we
don't have the time but it's he says in
an interview I'm done by wired.com after
the nexus 7 announced and wired asked
Google when are we going to see the
nexus 10 and they got the reply this is
where we're starting we take it one step
at a time this is where we're starting
and we'll see what partners do in the
10-inch form factor so kalid asks do you
consider that as a confirmation of the
long waited Nexus 10 by the end of the
year no and why Tony so I definitely
agree there will be a diversification
diversification of the Nexus brand we're
hearing rumors of several Nexus devices
even though I'm I don't think they're it
will become true I think there will
still be one preferred Nexus partner but
as far as the tablets are concerned yes
Google wants to move into the 10-inch
form factor too because that's where
that's the main tablet market and do you
think said it before the end of the year
no no I think that they will do it with
the next iteration of Android but I do
think that by the end of the year we
might see the next Nexus phone mmm yeah
I agree yeah I'd i see i think i don't
think i will see the nexus 10 before the
end of the year i do think we will see
this kind of increased watering down of
the nexus brand / different
manufacturers I don't like it but I
think we will see motorola and a sous
and samsung you know make continue to
make their own versions of nexus devices
and i think it's going to get to the
point where it's it's a little bit like
samsung's galaxy brand where it's which
quite quite watered down and that's a
shame but i think you definitely a nexus
10 is in the cards but no i would not
say by the end of the year certainly
I would like to see a Seuss's response
that a nexus 7 I mean asus makes the
Nexus 7 I want to see a self branded
asuste tablet and the same for factor
maybe with the camera at its back maybe
would have better display and see how
well that would play long that's a good
I would like I would be curious to see
it from a professional standpoint i
don't think i would buy it but i agree
it's I don't know it's interesting i
think i'm so in love with the 7-inch
space that the 10 inch android tablet
news doesn't really excite me I want my
ipad mini uh well I think you'll get
your wish pretty soon well if the
league's are to be believed who knows
all right guys all right guys before we
