and it's exploding battery might finally
be coming to a close
Samsung reported that their
investigation into the problems plaguing
the note 7 was concluded several weeks
ago and on January 23rd we should get
the full press release on their findings
over the last week we've gotten a number
of reports where we feel we can put
together a pretty decent hypothesis on
what Samsung is likely to announce on
Monday
first of all this doesn't seem to be a
manufacturing issue insofar as there
weren't problems with specific batches
of phones during the first wave of
recalls there was a lot of
finger-pointing at Samsung SDI that
maybe this was just a bad batch of
batteries but this doesn't seem to be
the issue at play instead what we're
looking at overall is a company trying
to cram too much stuff into two smaller
space pointing to the larger screen and
a smaller overall form factor the
inclusion of the s-pen and a pretty
energy intensive iris scanner all
contributing to reducing the amount of
space inside the device for what would
have been battery flexibility we're also
able to glean that the fault tolerances
for that battery were too low for a
mass-produced consumer facing device
below this video we've linked to an
article from AE and hub they're a
research firm in Singapore who conducted
a test on older phones with removable
batteries against newer phones which had
batteries that were sealed into the
phone body now what they found is that
when phones have removable batteries
that battery is clad in just a little
bit of extra plastic guarding the cells
and all of the energy density material
inside this little mini form factor when
the battery can be removed from the
phone it only makes sense that you'd
want a little extra armor plating around
this battery it might end up in
someone's back pocket and they might
accidentally sit on it but when the
battery is sealed inside the phone
there's usually less of that armor
instead you just get a flimsy pouch
where all of those chemicals are gonna
live and that comes with the benefit of
delivering a higher energy density in
the same form factor but that also means
if that cell gets ruptured you have a
higher energy density for the
corresponding explosion as those
chemicals at the air with space at such
a premium inside the note 7 there just
wasn't enough room for components to
expand when they ran high and the phone
ultimately had a harder time venting or
properly releasing that heat in a safe
fashion edition
we're also reading some reports from
investigators where the software
designed to manage the thermals on the
note 7 wasn't properly identifying or
addressing runaway heat events if that
last point proves to be accurate then we
have a pretty dangerous double whammy
phone hardware which has a difficult
time releasing that heat and phone
software which doesn't properly rain in
the components on the phone responsible
for that heat we are approaching our own
conclusions here with just a little
pinch of salt why I'm trying to use
words like hypothesis as we will be
getting Samsung's full analysis their
full report on the 23rd and will finally
be able to put this whole fiasco behind
us and focus more of our energy and
attention on all of the exciting new
phones due out this year as always
thanks so much for watching be sure to
subscribe to this channel for more
videos like these and help us out with
some sharing on your favorite social
networks for PocketNow i'm juan carlos
back now some gadget guy on Twitter and
Instagram and I will catch you all on
the next video now normally I put some
kind of funny little joke or gag after
the title card on these videos but I
wanted to take a second to personally
reach out to the people in our community
people watching videos like these who
are still trying to hold on to their
note sevens I can completely understand
and appreciate the frustration of folks
dealing with having to part with a phone
which was going to be the best phone of
2016 but in light of the information
that we've been able to dig up on this
issue it really does start to look more
and more like this wasn't a situation of
a bad batch of manufacturing instead a
systemic design flaw compounded by
insufficient software safety to that end
if our analysis is accurate this becomes
less a situation of if a phone will
explode but when a phone will explode if
that turns out to be the case I think
it's time to call it time to pack it in
and start examining what kind of
replacements you would be interested in
using as your daily driver smartphone
it's a terrible frustrating situation
but no piece of consumer electronics no
gadget like this is really worth the
increased risk to your personal health
or safety if you're still rockin a note
7 I hope you can find something you like
almost as much and I wish you all the
best of luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
