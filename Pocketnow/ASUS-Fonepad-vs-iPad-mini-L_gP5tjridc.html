fonepad with the google nexus 7 but the
comparison just won't stop because this
is PocketNow
i'm anton denied and you're watching a
sous film pad vs. apple ipad mini video
comparison let's go check it out these
two tablets couldn't be any more
different apple has brought a brand new
designed to the ipad mini different to
the one on the ipad and more iPhone 5
ish it is a tablet that many have
thought would never come out of Apple's
design labs and factories but it did and
it looks awesome and feels exceptional
in the hand the phone pad is made by a
sous the company had also made the
Google Nexus 7 we've already compared
the two Android power tablets in a
previous video the phone pad is more
conservative on the design and but it
features something that the iPad Mini
doesn't have or the majority of tablets
for that matter an earpiece you can lift
it up to your head and talk like you
would on any regular smartphone then
there's another fundamental difference
platform ecosystem size and app
selection let's compare these two and
take a close look at hardware
performance and user experience let's
start off with hardware the phone pad
packs a 7 inch screen with 800 by 1280
resolution and the PPI rating of 260 it
is powered by an Intel Atom z24 20
processor clocked at 1.2 gigahertz with
only a single core backed up by one gig
of ram there are 8 and 16 gigabyte
storage options and some regions will
also see the tablet ship with a 3.1
megapixel main shooter on the back in
addition to the 1.2 megapixel webcam of
course there are the usual suspects like
Bluetooth Wi-Fi and GPS granted NFC is
not present the battery is rated at 16
watt hour meaning 4270 milliamp hours
platform of choice Android version out
of the box 4.1.2 the iPad Mini is not a
powerhouse either beyond the fact that
iOS devices just like Windows phones
need less power to deliver a solid
performance and user experience the
screen on the iPad Mini is larger at 7.9
inches with a resolution of 768 by 1024
pixels and 162 PPI pixel density which
is not earth-shattering at all the CPU
of choice is dated back in the iPad to
date an Apple a5 chip which is dual-core
and clocked at one gigahertz there are
512 Meg's of RAM but storage options
include 16 32 and 64 gigabyte flavors
the webcam on the front is a 1.2
megapixel unit like on the phone bed but
the back features a 5 megapixel main
shooter without flash the usual suspects
include Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS and no NFC
as well as a 16 point 3 watt hour
battery meaning four thousand three
hundred and eighty-one milliamp hours at
3.72 volts platform of choice iOS
version out of the box always the latest
currently six that 1.1 however the phone
pad has a physical earpiece up top so
that you can make or take calls just
like with a regular smartphone yes a
seven-inch one while the iPad Mini also
has a cellular version even 4G LTE
support it lacks the earpiece build
quality on both devices is solid however
you're instantly shocked by how
lightweight and thin the iPad Mini is at
312 grams and seven point two
millimeters it is 28 grams lighter and
three point two millimeters thinner than
the film pad which means a lot the bezel
on the iPad Mini is also slimmer and iOS
has a neat way of detecting and ignoring
accidental touches the iPad Mini speaks
premium that's not to say the phone pad
feels cheap not at all especially that
the material on the back has been
upgraded we now have the call to the
touch aluminum instead of the sturdy
feeling plastic on the Nexus 7 that and
the earpiece aside we are seeing a nexus
7 twin let's take a look at performance
we're comparing apples to androids here
different ecosystems different platforms
different apps still the easier
experience can only be one good or bad
now first things first it takes the iPad
Mini 21 seconds to boot up compared to
that the phone pad is a tad lazier with
its 37 second boot up time taking 16
seconds longer for everything else keep
this in mind one we are comparing
different platforms and 2 we're talking
dual core versus single core here
despite Intel's Android optimization of
its Atom processor day to day usage
results are rather interesting and
intriguing the film pad puts up a great
fight against the iPad Mini and even
manages to beat it in many cases there's
no clear winner here we have to call it
a tie when it comes to launching
applications like face
Twitter Google+ Foursquare email
calendar Spotify or the browser if you
choose chrome over the alternative
Android browser offered on the phone pad
the iPad Mini Safari performance will
school the assist ablet almost every
time but that's not the tablets fault
it's grown
however running the Android browser
again Safari results once again in a tie
page load times scrolling and even text
rendering is identical to our know
stopwatch eyes if the performance is a
tie if single and separate segments are
being compared the iPad Mini and iOS
offers a more fluid overall system-wide
performance
windows appear more fluidly menus and
animations don't stutter and the entire
tablet's performance is perceived as
never lagging the phone pad does a
decent job but occasionally stutters
when jumping to the home screen or
scrolling lists like the settings where
it occasionally is choppy next up this
place both screens are IPS LCD s but the
iPad Mini is much much brighter than the
display on the phone bed in terms of
pixel density not only the iPad Mini has
a lower resolution but it also has a
larger screen by almost an inch if you
hate seeing pixels regardless of how
long or short your arm is the phone past
216 PPI should be your choice over the
iPad minis 162 PPI resolution and pixel
density aside the winner here is clearly
the Apple tablet brightness contrast
ratio color reproduction color
saturation and even black levels are
much better than on the issues felt bed
still the soos allows you to cheat with
an ace up its leave the bundle the su
splendid app where you can tweak color
temperature hue saturation and turn
vivid mode on or off allowing you to
have the best experience tailored to
your eyes and like it outdoor visibility
to goes to the iPad Mini in terms of
software and user experience we're going
to ask the eternal question iOS or
Android luckily we're not comparing
phones where the answer would have been
much easier iOS is old whether that's
good or a bad thing is completely up to
you however the lack of widgets and the
eternal list of icons becomes quickly
boring Android on the other hand is made
for customization and widgets allow you
to really personalize your device watch
out though all those widgets will
shorten your battery life and sometimes
if your
processor isn't fast enough like on the
phone pad could take up precious
resources
there's nothing aside from specific OS
features you can do on the iPad Mini
that you cannot do on the phone pad and
vice versa
so at the end of the day it all comes
down to the good old cliche Apple's
iTunes App Store simply has a broader
tablet oriented app selection of course
Android is catching up quickly and most
of the apps you already use on a daily
basis probably have a tablet version
already but the iPad apps just look more
refined and fine-tuned if we stop here
in this particular setup iOS is the
clear choice but with Android you can
always route and flash and endlessly
improve your tablet surely you can also
jailbreak your iPad but if customization
and hacking is your playground get the
felt bad at the end of the day if you
need to have an earpiece on your tablet
so that you can leave your phone at home
stop right now and go get the phone bed
it's a no-brainer if that doesn't really
interest you then you should probably
take into consideration that the phone
pad is cheaper our particular 16
gigabyte model set us back 333 dollars
versus the for $59 or euros Apple asks
for the cellular enabled iPad Mini if
you want to go Wi-Fi only then there's
absolutely no reason for you to buy the
phone pad the Nexus 7 is right there and
it's cheap that's gonna do it for today
everybody thank you very much for
watching stay glued to pocket now and to
our YouTube channel our full a soos
phone pad review is coming shortly until

usual social media channels and you can
