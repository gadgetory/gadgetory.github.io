talking gotta calm and if you'd like me
you probably spend quite a bit of money
and if not then you're probably pretty
thrifty but one thing that we all have
in common is receipts and if your seats
look like this it's probably not a good
thing so it's always good to keep a copy
of receipts but it becomes rather
tedious when they're just shoved in your
pocket and you do the laundry and you
realize where is this receipt from when
was it spent although it does say on the
top sometimes it becomes rather tattered
or the numbers fade away with these
heat-activated inks and stuff like that
so I'm going to show you a cool little
program called certified Wally and what
it's going to allow you to do is
actually save your receipts on to the
certified com website so you can treat
them later and actually keep an expense
report of what you're spending over the
time so I'm just going to actually
connect here says I'm working on the
offline mode so what that allows you to
do is actually take pictures of your
seeds and add expenses and then later
you can actually upload them directly to
the certified com website so I'm gonna
connect here oh my device locked ok so
I'm gonna connect ok so I know I
connected and i'm just going to login ok
so as you can see i have one receipt and
one expense that i've already input so
if i want to add another acc i can go
here and click on receipt and it'll
actually load up my camera so i'm going
to take that tattered receipt and i'm
going to just take a picture of it let's
say i'll have the best light in here
focus and then take a picture of the
receipt wait for it to close and when
it's closed the application as you can
see here it will ask you for the amount
and if i can barely read this let's see
this is twenty nine dollars and three
cents so click on here i can also change
the date i'm gonna do that in just one
second twenty nine dollars and three
cents change the day let's see that was
from october twenty third wow that was
awhile ago oh ok anyways and then i can
select a category and which I'm out I
want as you can see it says US dollars
right here but I can also select the
category so that was meals Oh
meals and the reason hungry okay food
then and I can also select a check mark
for reimbursable or billable and I'm
just going to click Save and I have
another receipt here let's see here I'll
add this oh add receipt launch the
camera again can barely read this one
also so I'm not too good at keeping
receipts as you can tell okay so i can
add the amount on that one and that one
is sixteen dollars and fifty six cents
1656 away so that was also a meal and
i'm just going to keep on today's date
and reason i'm just gonna leave them
unchecked but i'm actually going to
check reimbursable for this one and
click Save and once I have all my items
saved i can actually sync up with the
certified calm website and it will send
my receipts so we'll just give it a
second for this up to upload okay so i
can also add expenses and I can go
through the tutorial if I want so if I
wanted to add an expense let's say I had
something that lets say i had gas that i
just bought and it was fifty dollars and
thirty four cents or something like that
ok so just put gas and under here we've
got a mileage and that is going to be
let's say that's billable was cliff save
and we can think that if we want or if
we're let's say on an airplane and when
you buy something on the airplane we
can't really upload because we will have
any network right there so we can always
upload it later so this is certified
wallet and this program is free and you
can find this on windows mobile
marketplace and this is another
marketplace pick where we pick some
useful and interesting applications on
windows mobile marketplace thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
