december twenty second google CEO Larry
Page tark's Motorola Nexus and Samsung
see as event apparently doesn't have to
do with smartphones I'm hi Mary better
wondering who still jailbreaks their
iPhones anymore and this is parking out
daily
that's right an anonymous hacker the
claims to have worked at one of the
depth teams that we knew and loved in
the past will apparently release an
untethered jailbreak for iOS 6 that
works on all the new chip sets including
the ones that power the iphone 5 the
ipad mini you name it it's kind of
interesting to see that jailbreaking has
dropped in popularity in the past couple
of months for no reasons apparent and we
could just wonder who this guy would be
the jailbreak would be launched on
december twenty seconds and we're
putting our money down on this guy being
comex after being fired by Apple though
it could also be Scott Forstall now even
though we know about Samsung's January
eighth event at CES Las Vegas scenic
just came on record to state that Sammy
will not be releasing a phone on this
event and the problem is when you have a
company like Sammy that manufactures
everything but the kitchen sink at your
home so the question is what could we
get this is perfect timing for samsung
galaxy note 7 and we know this would be
the perfect form factor for a note to
buy so we could be surprised now even
after some rough Financial Times HTC has
just launched another smartphone to the
world this time it's being called the
one sv and even though it doesn't have
the best bells and whistles when it
comes to spec it does support 4G LTE it
does have a very simplistic and actually
cool design no word on when it'll reach
the United States shorts but most likely
CES will be the date now today has been
full of some great coverage starting off
with Joe Levi's recent video of how to
run cm 10.1 on your Nexus 10 so make
sure you follow the links in the
description and make sure you also watch
Brandon minimums full treatment of after
the bus for apples fourth-generation
iPad which brings compelling reasons and
why you really shouldn't upgrade to this
iPad and probably wait for the next
generation iPad to come next year aside
from that last week we did a lot of
coverage when it came to after the bus
for the samsung galaxy note 2 and also
for the iphone 5 when it comes to my
case so make sure you watch the links in
the description and that's what you
think about the videos in the comments
down below and finally for the
interesting news of the day google CEO
Larry Page just sat down with fortune to
talk about nobility a lot of the talk
had to do with Motorola their recent
acquisition and why we don't have a
nexus device being built by motorola
according to Larry Page the only reason
why we don't have this device yet is
because they haven't owned the company
enough time to actually reach
oh so that leads me to the question of
the day after the nexus for being the
not so hot phone that we expected what
would you think about a motorola Nexus
device in my particular case I would
love the Kevlar backing on the razor
design on a Nexus device but the problem
is the racer lineup hasn't really been
that hot so probably my impressions
wouldn't be the best so leave us a
comment down below what would you like
and if you wanted earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com please
give this video a thumbs up if you like
what you saw I'm Hina Rivera thanks for
watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
