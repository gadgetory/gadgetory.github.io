now calm and today we're going to be
taking a quick look at the blackberry
bold 9650 the blackberry bold 9650 for
sprint essentially replaces the carriers
on blackberry tour 9630 and is seen as
an upgrade from the 9630 before we take
a look at the hardware in the device
let's go ahead and take a look at what's
inside the retail packaging box so here
is the retail box for the blackberry
bold 9650 inside the box users will find
a getting started guide as well as some
nice packaging of manuals inside the box
to get you going with your blackberry
smartphone on top of this carton would
be worthy smartphone rests you also have
a belt clip pouch on that's faux leather
the pouch has a magnet inside to
automatically turn off the screen when
you slide in the phone which is a nice
touch there is also a micro USB to USB
charge and sync cable along with a
complete wall charger that charges the
phone via your wall outlet and stereo
headphones that connect to the
blackberry bold 9650 via the
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack the phone itself is a standard
QWERTY keyboard phone that's in candy
bar form form factor it has a 2.4 inch
half VGA display with a speaker grill on
the top on the upper right hand side is
an LED indicator light that shows that
flashes whenever your device shows any
notifications or alerts the keyboard is
a contiguous keyboard on the bottom of
the device the keyboard is slightly more
straight than the comparable blackberry
tour 9630 keyboard which has more of an
art to it on the bottom rows whereas on
the
650 the bottom rows are more straight
however the contiguous keyboard offers a
good tactile typing experience where
there are ridges on the keys to guide
you and help your fingers stay on the
keys when you're typing at the top bro
are for navigation buttons a call sign
button a blackberry button that allows
you to access more menu options along
with a back button and a call n button
which doubles as a power button when you
press and hold the button there's also
an optical trackpad which replaces the
black trackball on the older device the
trackpad allows you to navigate up and
down left and right as well as push in
to select at the top of the device in
the middle is an air vent for this
speaker there's also a keyboard lock
button that allows you to lock the keys
in case your phone is in a pocket or
purse and you don't want the keys
accidentally being pressed there's also
a mute button for muting on the phone
when you're in the middle of a call the
speakers on the left hand side of the
device along with a voice dial button
which is powered by nuance technology
and allows you to call a contact or
navigate your phone via voice there is a
micro USB charging port and syncing port
on the right hand side of the device
along with a camera button volumes up
and down and the three nap millimeter
headphone jack on the size of the device
is a plastic chrome stripping that
allows the device to have a nicer look
to it the back of the device has a 3.2
megapixel camera along with an LED flash
and the bold moniker the camera is of
same resolution as the older blackberry
tour the back battery cover on the side
has a nice soft touch rubberized finish
and a ridged
plastic backing in the center portion
rather than the leather or fake leather
backing on the blackberry tour 9700
which is used on gsm networks such as
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile the back battery cover
is also compatible with the tours back
battery cover so if you prefer the tours
look you can switch it out with a older
looking battery cover from the tour if
you have one available there is a 1400
milliamp hour battery which is the same
as it is on the tour so if you have an
older tour you can use the old battery
as spare for your new blackberry bold
9650 also under the back battery cover
the device comes pre-loaded with a 2
gigabyte micro sdhc our card as well as
the card slot which you can insert a
finger and just pull out with your
fingernails right there there's also a
sim card the device is a world phone and
works on sprint cdma evo rev a network
in the US as well as quad-band gsm edge
as well as a single band HSPA 3g
frequency for international travelers
users who are familiar with the
blackberry OS should be comfortable on
the device which sports blackberry 5 on
operating system the mail application is
pretty standard once you go in to a male
the notification turns off and there is
no longer a blinking light male that's
been read shows and opened envelope and
if you send an email it shows up with a
check mark to access additional menu
items the phone has quick shortcuts to
some of your most frequently used
programs on the bottom bar right here
but you access additional programs all
you have to do is hit the blackberry
button and it will take you to the full
programs list sprint pre-loaded the
device with some very usable
applications such as sprint navigation
which comes
preloaded with the blackberry plan that
you have sprint navigation is powered by
TeleNav and provides turn-by-turn voice
guided GPS instructions where you can
select a point of interest or enter an
address and it will guide you via voice
to your destination other entertainment
applications pre-loaded by Sprint
include the NASCAR Sprint Cup mobile
application as well as a football app
and some sprint musics or as well as
sprint TV which provides streaming music
and TV stations for you to stream to
your device the TV application looks
like it is a rebadge of mobile mobitv
and provides for more of on-demand
content rather than actual live TV and
depending on the show and the networker
station that you select it may take a
few menu clicks to get to watching your
show
within the TV sprint TV app there's also
a radio feature for you to have
streaming radio as well also as an
upgrade for the blackberry tour 9630 the
bold 9650 has Wi-Fi built in and another
feature that users may not notice but
will definitely appreciate would be the
built-in additional memory the device
now has 512 megabytes of ram instead of
the 256 on the blackberry bold 9700
which is on the GSM network the device
looks identical to the blackberry tour
9630 and now joins the GSM 9700 bold and
the same family this is a quick look of
the sprint blackberry bold 9650 I'm
Chegwin for pacquiao calm and thank you
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
