the samsung galaxy note 2 specs get
leaked and sadly the HTC Desire X's
anything but desirable I'm hi Mary vera
and this is out daily one of the
things we love the most about getting
close to events is all the leaks were
able to one veal in this case we've got
the sony vaio duo of 11 that we just
linked where we have a new tablet that
has a hybrid design it looks a little
like the microsoft surface with the back
but this device is different in the case
that the keyboard is non-detachable
apparently but this device is mostly
slated at the windows 8 pro market
because of everything that's included in
the device you can see the backlit
keyboard and just about everything we
saw in the images now it's just
interesting to see Sony have Xbox Live
icons on their devices but hey that's
just the case what are the most
anticipated devices for IFA 2012 is the
Galaxy Note 2 from Samsung apparently
according to lease we will be getting a
1.4 gigahertz quad-core Exynos processor
along with 4G LTE connectivity we will
be getting Android 4.1 jelly bean the
sad disappointment though is that
apparently you won't be getting the 12
megapixel camera only 8 megapixels is
everything pretty much is these days and
the typical 16 to 32 gigabytes of
storage on the device we don't know
anything about microsd support or
probably if that LT is going to be mixed
with a quad-core processor in the united
states but you know what i really hope
the engine is figure it out because this
is a really big device there's no excuse
for everything not to fit in there now
try to do this with me inhale motorola
razr m 4g LTE exhale talk about stupid
names but this is the new razor coming
to verizon according to leaks but the
interesting part about this device is
there are good things and bad things on
the good part i mean look at the bezel
on this device there's pretty much just
screen there at the front it looks
beautiful but that comes with a catch
sadly it stuck the qHD resolution along
with a stupid name and the usual specs
you're not going to get a quad-core
processor just the typical stuff that
you'll get on verizon
one interesting thing though is this
device does have support for both 4G LTE
and also world phone gsm and HSPA+ so it
will be a good device it just won't be
great I think the only news today that
wasn't a league with Samson's invitation
for their IFA event where they plan to
unveil the new windows 8 hybrid tablet
well the RT or Windows 8 pro is only yet
to be seen but hopefully the smartphone
department from Samsung has met up with
their tablet department because sadly
their tablets haven't been as great as
the smartphones now we're not sure if
this will be again a pro device
hopefully we will be getting two devices
and not just one to compete with the
surface but anything can happen at IFA
and finally for the sad news of the day
if any of you were waiting for that HTC
proto code name that we found well sadly
it's now being dubbed the desire x but
it has nothing to do with a desire
lineup of the past and it has nothing to
do with the HTC One X this is a very
lame 1v device that is not really that
great single core processor very low
specs and it's not really something we'd
recommend hopefully that's not the only
thing that HTC is going to be launching
at IFA because if they are they are
going to be the laughingstock now if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
