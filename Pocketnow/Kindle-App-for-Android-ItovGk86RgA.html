now calm Amazon just released the Kindle
app for Android devices I'm a big user
of the Kindle because you buy a Kindle
book and then it's accessible on the
Kindle on Android on iPhone on iPad on
your Mac and your PC so you buy it once
and it's available on many different
platforms and they synchronize the last
page you read they synchronize
highlights and bookmarks so it's a very
very cross-platform product let's take a
look at the latest Android application
that runs Kindle already now the iPhone
application for Kindle has been out for
a very long time and it works very very
well it's developed quite nicely you can
search within a book you can go back to
your home screen you can right there
it's a sync tear for this reading
location very well done application and
of course here's the home screen you can
access your archived books if you click
get books it's not integrated as well as
iBooks that's where you can buy the book
right within the application you have to
go to the web but it's well done so
let's see how it's done on Android so
I'm going to turn on the device here and
unlock and we're already in the
application let me start from the
beginning here so here's the home screen
right and these are your books that
you've downloaded and you tap the menu
item and you go to archived items that
has a little picture of a cloud this
shows you all the books that you've ever
purchased on Amazon so let's say I want
to get Lord of the Flies downloaded to
my home screen so it's downloading right
now very very fast and here I am on the
page that I last read now there are a
few things you can do here you can
obviously go to side to side you can go
into landscape very nice reading
experience not sure why it's up there
goes landscape and back to portrait and
we have a few options so we can go into
menu we can what's that doing is syncing
to the recent location I'm going to go
to view options and just like the iPhone
app the iPad app and the PC and Mac app
you can change the size of the text we
keep it on the small so you can also
change the color of the background and
right within the application you can
adjust
the the home screen brightness now what
I'm going to do now is compare both
applications directly and by the way the
only limitation of the Android app and
they're actually pretty significant is
number one you cannot highlight which is
quite annoying so typically in the
Android application you can tap and hold
and a little highlighting thing comes up
can't do that number two if you press
the Search button you cannot search
within a book so this is the first
version of the Android application so
here we are on the same page and we're
going to pull this up and see what it
looks like
let me synchronize the page here on both
devices and we will should be able to
get there we are we're on the same page
now and you can see the difference
between these applications they're very
very similar similar reading experience
because the higher resolution screen on
the iPhone 4 I am set iPhone 3GS you get
to see an additional couple lines of
text so over here this ends with
Leonardo or an author of the book and
over here you get a couple probably two
or three extra lines of text these are
both set to the smallest text size but
overall the Kindle app on Android is
well done if you are a Kindle user
you'll be happy to know that you can get
your Kindle books on yet another
platform really awesome something that
the other reading platforms like Barnes
&amp;amp; Noble cannot offer please subscribe to
our channel if you like our video and
give this video a thumbs up that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
