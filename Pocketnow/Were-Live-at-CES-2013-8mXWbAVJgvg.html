pocketnow.com I'm here with Michael
Fisher and Jaime Rivera is behind the
camera we are at the Venetian at CES
2013 and in this video we're going to
tell you what we think is going to
happen in the next few days at CES so
this year's going to be all about sony
sony has yet to make a big end road in
the Android space they're going to have
their Xperia Z 1080p smart phone which
is going to compete with the droid DNA
and preempt with Samsung has later this
year with the galaxy s4 it's all about
Sony this year they use the event here
at CES to really announced their their
big Congress pretty experienced needs to
be awesome and it's not the 1080p is not
going to be confined to Sony I think
this is going to be the year of 1080p
it's any big secret and I think we're
going to see a big push from several
manufacturers to do that now there are
some fringe players around who are have
been consistently trying to make a
bigger footprint for themselves like
Huawei and we're going to see what is it
the ascend d1 permit it's still donating
to me and right yeah maybe this year
that will change and we'll think of them
as like a hassle you know that's right
depending on what they do in the US
market that's going to affect how we
report on it but from a worldwide sample
we're going to see Android devices from
them as well as new windows phone 8
devices that are doing the what became
very popular in 2012 which is the
colored casings including cyan and a
form of magenta and it's no doubt going
to be very musical it's really
fascinating to see how tablets have
evolved over the years at CES just a
couple years ago we were seeing really
crappy android tablets how the Nexus 7
is out which is blown everything away
you might see some new tablets from a
sous maybe something to compete with the
nexus 7 that's not necessarily called a
Nexus device we're going to see a ton of
Windows 8 tablets Windows RT hopefully
some windows 8 pro as manufacturers try
to claw on to an operating system that
isn't being very well received but they
need a strategy to have tablets and
they're going to use Windows 8 because
Android tablets are still fledgling
great fletchling yeah and I feel like
those manufacturers we're going to build
these windows from excuse me these
windows tablets you can do so with a
little bit of confidence because
regardless of the fact that it hasn't
been terribly well received so far we
know Microsoft isn't gonna let it go
yeah Microsoft is going to push this as
hard as they possibly can to matter of
survival for Microsoft exactly put all
the research behind it like they're
doing the Windows Phone EV but so we're
gonna see a lot of them than someone
we're going to be poor and somewhere
we're going to be great but we won't
find out until tomorrow in the next
thing yes that's right so one of our
biggest concerns is with HTC and with
Nokia HTC doesn't have any press events
at CES they don't have a really big
stand and they're really kind of playing
it download you're going to probably be
promoting the butterfly the DNA and
really that's it they've got the m7
coming out later this year with the
church they're going to wait to do a
full press event for because that's
going to be a really big deal for the
company last year it was all about what
was last year where's the 1x the one
extend they do the one x+ before that
was the sensation and then the desire HD
HTC always has a phone they rebrand over
and over again and the offer on all
kinds of carriers across the world this
year it's going to be about the m7 which
is basically a DNA souped up a lot maybe
yeah we will see right i mean i don't
know exactly i have this issue with HTC
where i want to have so much faith in
them that i want them to learn from
their past mistakes i don't want them to
do a 2011 again right they may keep
yelling will say keep making them safe
you're right we will see and we're going
to talk about this a little bit more on
Wednesday after we know a little bit
more I think we have on the podcast as
well but but also nokia isn't basically
the same boat they're not doing much of
anything here at CES and i think this
speaks to kind of the diminishing role
of CES overall going forward and it's
kind of very very odd when this
manufacturers want to do their own event
so they can frame it properly they can
tell their own story without
you know opera and of course he is just
the starting point of the year in mobile
tech we've got Mobile World Congress
coming up CTIA a lot of really good
stuff a lot of press events or really
