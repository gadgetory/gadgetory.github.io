for Johnny Aires iOS 7 no kiss
considering we're focusing their camera
strategy dramatically and blackberry CEO
clearly doesn't understand tablets yet
I'm hi Mary Mehta and there's a reason
why nobody bought that blackberry
playbook this is out daily let's
start today off talking about some deals
AT&amp;amp;T has decided to make your 2013
purchase a lot more compelling as
they're now implementing a new trade-in
program where you can bring your old
phone into AT&amp;amp;T and they'll give you one
hundred dollar discount on your next
purchase now obviously there are some
cases where you can sell your phone at a
much better price on ebay but if you
think about it there are some phones you
can't resell that easily so take the
training now let's talk about some tech
irony's thorsten heins from blackberry
was in an interview recently and said
that it's not a compelling business to
sell tablets at least for the next five
years apparently he believes that
tablets will not exist in the next five
years and I'm just wondering what is the
guy thinking I mean the ipad is
currently soaring in sales and the pc
market is currently stagnated so it begs
to wonder if this guy really understands
why the BlackBerry PlayBook did not sell
now there is a blackberry tablet in
their league rome at but i don't know if
it's going to happen or not so stay
tuned nobody's actually waiting for it
anyways now let's talk about nokia if
you remember there's a company called
whiterow that built a camera last year
that allowed you to take a photograph
and then refocus wherever you want with
software or within the camera after you
took the photograph not necessarily
within the moment that you're taking it
which is kind of really interesting
technology but obviously it's not ported
to mobile devices just yet yet because
apparently toshiba and milky have just
figured out how to bring this into a
mobile sighs camera so it makes to
wonder if we will be getting something
like this on their next device to be
launched in May with their event being
detailed so we'll keep you posted with
the news now let's move over to
Microsoft the UI previously known as
Metro has proven to be quite polarizing
and not as useful for certain
applications like Facebook not
everywhere should be metro and
apparently Microsoft is just admitted
defeat they've just released a new beta
for their facebook application which is
actually separate from the real
application that's already there both
applications made by microsoft by the
way where they're stripping away the
metro you winder bring the typical
Facebook you why that Android and iOS
users know so far it looks kind of good
it looks like the way Facebook should
have always been but anyways this is
just a beta make sure you hit the links
in the description for you to download
this application and give it a try and
finally for the interesting news of the
day three separate and reliable sources
say they've already seen iOS 7 and
apparently jony ive's new baby is now
focused on being much more flat and less
Q morphic you know all that stitched
leather that you currently see on iOS
but apparently what's even more
interesting is that well that's the only
thing that's really going to change it
apparently will only change in
aesthetics because the UI is going to be
pretty much the same meaning that
they're not going to add any learning
curve to current users they'll just move
to iOS 7 and be used the same iconic you
I that you pretty much already know
which leads me to the question of the
day what would you like to see an iOS 7
if you currently are on iOS or you want
to switch to iOS what would you like to
see happen in the UI that would make you
want to switch or either stay with iOS
for your next purchase in our particular
case most of us want which is there
something that won't make us have to
jump from application to application
it's kind of boring to have to be moving
around all the time but leave us a
comment down below what's on your wish
list and of course for an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening and the
smartphone it's out the world but you
follow us on pocketnow.com subscribe to
our YouTube channel you can also follow
me on Twitter and I'm underscore to be
better please give this video thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am hina
better thank you very much for watching
I'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
