lumia 920 and HTC Windows Phone 8x are
the only things worth getting excited
about this week what recently arrived at
my doorstep was the exclusive t-mobile
USA variant of the Nokia Lumia 820
called the Lumia 810 we're gonna give it
a full review treatment in the days
ahead
but for now let's see what's inside the
box and let's see what the device feels
like let me get our hands on it I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow comm
let's check out the Nokia Lumia 810 the
first thing I noticed about the Lumia
810 is packaging is that it is larger
and more substantial than other high-end
Nokia Lumia phones like the 920 I very
recently unboxed as well as you can see
it's got the the device here in a very
glossy relief on the front of the box
there's the t-mobile branding on the
side there kind of blurry it's so fast
it's blurry and features on the back
here just a few of them eight megapixel
cameras called out front-facing camera
is called out 1080p video recording
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor that
is the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 plus up to
32 gigs of expandable memory through
micro sd as well so this box opens in a
very interesting manner this was an
important notice and it has been the
seal has been broken so Windows Phone
branding on the bottom we just pull that
slides out right on the bottom and
that's pretty cool I think I haven't
seen that kind of packaging all that
often here is the device itself which we
will come back to in just a second this
offer here interesting packaging this is
manuals have been included in a little
envelope that comes in with this module
here user guide is in there as well as
initial set up probably some warranty
information as well that's all held
together very nicely alas no more
accessories than we had on the Lumia 920
over at 80 MT just a wall charger and
USB cable no headphones no fun stuff
not even an NFC tag it looks like
no-nothing sad face but let's get back
to the device continuing this trend here
of a really helpful labeling of features
on the screen protector here the back
home and quick search buttons are all
called out as is the charger on the
bottom camera key on the side standard
for Windows Phone interesting
responsiveness there you can hear it
it's very sharp click on the half press
to focus a very dull click on the fold
push and a lot of travel on that key
there as well
volume down volume up power these
definitely don't feel as premium as on
the 920 very very obviously plastic or
if they're metal they feel plastic
headset port volume it looks like a
noise cancelling microphone up top their
headphone jack on top as well here's
your speaker view on the bottom and on
the other side of the phone not much
going on but we have some call-outs here
we have a cover releases down here they
tell us that's very nice we'll get into
that in the full review and the
protector on the carl zeiss lens for the
camera there which is an 8 megapixel
shooter let's come back around in the
front see if we can take off the screen
protector here great great sound that
right there is the sound of progress i'm
gonna go ahead and press the power
button here one two three add a little
vibration buzz there there's our
t-mobile branding theoretically this
should be final software we'll get into
details on the review well the phone
boots we just take a little tour around
slowly
there's our Nokia brand buttons are that
off-white color that we see that we've
discussed on the same as on the Lumia
920 just a little off-white a little on
the green side whether you like or
dislike that is going to depend on your
own taste
there's our Windows Phone 8 splash
screen and the Start screen
as I mention at the top of the video
we're gonna have a full review on this
device in the next few days stay tuned
for that in the meantime if you want to
leave us a comment let us know about
something you want specifically covered
