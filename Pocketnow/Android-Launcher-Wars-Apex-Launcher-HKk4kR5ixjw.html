pocketnow.com if you like the look of
stock ice-cream sandwich but you want to
have some control over it there are a
lot of third-party launchers out there
that are based off of Ice Cream Sandwich
that do an awesome job at giving you a
ton of customized ability in this video
this episode of launcher wars we're
going to talk about Apex Launcher which
might be my new favorite launcher let's
get to it so you might remember in a
previous video we talked about how the
HTC One X has a new version of sense
since 4.0 which is lighter than before
but still a little bit too heavy
especially on the home screen for
example folders sputter when you open
them they don't open a smoothly a stock
Ice Cream Sandwich so one of the first
things that I did is I routed the HTC
One X and I put a third party ROM on it
which came with Apex Launcher and we're
going to talk about it now now Apex
Launcher looks like Ice Cream Sandwich
because it's based off of Ice Cream
Sandwich but it gives you a lot more
control over your experience than what
you get with stuck now of course this is
the HTC One X and the one X has folders
through sense but these are Ice Cream
Sandwich style folders so folders open
very very quickly not only that but you
can customize the look and the feel let
me show you how so I'm gonna go into
Apex Settings here which is just the
sayings for the launcher I'm gonna go
into folder settings this is super cool
so you can go to grid preview and
specify how the little icons should
appear within each folder so you can
have sort of the iOS book you can have a
grid book you can have it look like
stock Ice Cream Sandwich where you can
go with a fan let's see how it looks
with the iOS look and we're gonna go
back to the home screen has to refresh
and as you can see even smaller previews
of the icons that are within the folder
let's go back to the apex settings and
we're gonna change some more folder
settings before we jump into the other
features you can change the folder
background which is super cool so we can
have the ring which is right out of Ice
Cream Sandwich you can have it be a
square or have no folder background so
we're gonna actually go to the ring and
kind of give it the Ice Cream Sandwich
look and feel but what you'll notice is
that you still get the little tiny iOS
style icons that looks a little weird
my favorite is just keep
on the folder background of iOS because
it kind of looks cool and folder preview
of the grid and then boom you get a nice
preview of what's inside the folder
without seeing icons that are
microscopic another great thing about
Apex Launcher is that it lets you resize
every widget so when you tap and hold on
any widget you get a resize menu and
this is cool because this is the default
stock Ice Cream Sandwich Google search
bar but now you can resize it so if you
don't need it to take up such a large
space you can move it around and of
course ice cream sandwich stock it
doesn't let you move the Google search
bar but now you can have it wherever you
want and of course you can resize it now
lets happen hold function does some cool
stuff on other apps so for example if we
go into let's go over here and go to ROM
manager if we tap and hold we can edit
it so let's do that and we can change
the name of the item we can even change
the icon which is really cool we can
also look at app info we can share the
app or we can remove it completely so a
lot of extra functionality added there
now let's talk about the app launcher in
cents 4.0 it's this side-scrolling
passionated clunky thing here in Apex
Launcher I get back the Ice Cream
Sandwich look and feel I can scroll to
the right to these different columns and
now I have a vertically scrolling list
super fast super fluid look how quickly
it opens boom and opens instantly and
now I've got a much better way to add
widgets to my home screen in Sense 4.0
there's this clunky thing that just has
so many visual effects it's overwhelming
but now I get back a little preview of
all my widgets and I can tap and hold
anything I want and bring it to the
homescreen and drop it there and
customize it to my heart's content also
in Apex Launcher you can customize the
number of screens you have you get the
leaf-like feature so let's go back into
apex settings and really quick talk
about the drawer now since we just show
the drawer look at the settings you get
here that's so you can choose which apps
are hidden which is terrific if there
are some apps that you just don't want
to see all the time in the widget trick
you can sort the change the apps sorting
there we can
change the style of the drawer I've got
it vertical and continuous so you get
that nice smooth scrolling list you have
a drawer animation I don't like
animations ever so of course I turned it
off there so it's as fast as possible
and there's just so many options that
you can choose from for your app drawer
let's go back and look at the other
things you can do
dock settings so you can change the
number of dock icons in Ice Cream
Sandwich you get five in Apex Launcher
you can go up to seven which is cool if
you like to have a lot of icons on the
bottom of course they'll get smooshed
together which is fine because if you
want to add more icons they need to get
a little bit closer together in order to
achieve that effect and the list goes on
and on what you can do with Apex
Launcher you can backup your settings so
that if you install to a new device you
can have it look just like it did
previously and there are some options
here in behavior settings talking about
what certain swipes do you can have a
swipe up show your notifications that's
super cool so now for on the home screen
we do a swipe up boom there's the
notification tray instead of having to
sort of reach your thumb all the way to
the top here you can just boom swipe up
and there's your notification tray so
Apex Launcher the best part about it is
that it is free
and it's available in the Play Store so
just go to search for Apex now there are
other launchers that give the look and
feel of Ice Cream Sandwich such as Nova
Launcher we're gonna talk about those in
future launcher wars but we want to talk
about Apex Launcher because it's just a
great option for people that want that
look and feel of Ice Cream Sandwich
though the way the folders open up
instantly with the beautiful animation
that doesn't take up too much time it's
a really great idea to have if you liked
this video please give us a thumbs up
and if you want to suggest the a
launcher for a future episode of
launcher wars please leave us a comment
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
