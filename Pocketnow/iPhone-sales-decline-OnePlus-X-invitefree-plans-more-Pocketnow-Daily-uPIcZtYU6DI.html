its first drop in iphone sales next year
the oneplus X gets off its invite system
sort of and it seems that schools are
getting smarter about smartwatches I'm
hi America vetta and uh no don't worry i
am not an imposter yesterday's lack of a
monday joke was not intentional this is
sparking out daily the official news
today begin with temple and the pebble
time around for some people a very
beautiful watch for others like me not
so much but the company is kind of
catching up on that up to the point
where the company is dropping the price
tag from two hundred fifty dollars to
two hundred dollars and there is no
definite time as to how long that's
going to last now the good thing about
pebble smartwatches is they last for
days and what they do they do really
well i just don't like the bezel on this
one but that doesn't mean it's a bad
watch and speaking of deals the company
that's not so famous for deals but for
selling smartwatches at very affordable
price tags is one plus and even though
their invite system is not the best in
the world the one plus two is out of the
invite system as of a few weeks ago and
in the case of the oneplus x starting
tuesday and every tuesday their forward
if you want to x 1 plus x you can do so
invite free makes all the sense in the
world they'll most likely start selling
phones like crazy on tuesdays but hey
glad we know and probably one of the
most underestimated tablets of the year
is now offering a deal we're talking
about the Samsung Galaxy Tab s2 we
really liked it at ctia I really wanted
to get me that tablet for some reason i
didn't but then again hey if your will
in the market for one the company is now
offering a full year of netflix for free
but there's a catch number one you have
to be in the united states number two
you have until december 26 to purchase
the tablet for to be able to claim this
deal really good one looks of this
crucial for full details on what you're
getting and if any of you have been
using your SmartWatch to cheat at school
shame on you it seems that the kyoto
university has just figure that one out
you can actually pull out a calculator
and so many other things with your
SmartWatch up to the point where it's
now being banned from the university
students going to no longer arrived with
a SmartWatch and most likely once the
first educational area figures
that one out everyone else is going to
start doing that so buyers beware you'll
most likely not be able to carry your
SmartWatch going forward you should at
least give you lockers just set it in
there and then when you leave the test
just get it back and finally the very
hot news did they have to do with Morgan
Stanley and its predictions for iphone
sales in 2016 for those of you that
don't know ever since Apple launched the
first generation iphone in 2007 I
believe it's the only product that Apple
hasn't seen any decline when it comes to
sales up so that when we're currently
makes sixty percent of apples and come
every year and well it seems that Morgan
Stanley predicts that it will finally
see a drop in sales from two point nine
to five point seven percent because
apparently it's not hot enough and the
apple sort of saw a minor stagnation
with the iphone 5s and it seems that
this story is repeating itself right now
with the iphone success but hey it leads
me to the question of the day why do you
think atlas was selling less iphones now
or would be selling less iphones in 2016
what do you think would have a lot to do
with that in my case I feel that if
competitors were able to launch the
phones they launched this year next year
it's gonna be even better and that's a
good thing for competition leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the drill
if you want to get the nose earlier
