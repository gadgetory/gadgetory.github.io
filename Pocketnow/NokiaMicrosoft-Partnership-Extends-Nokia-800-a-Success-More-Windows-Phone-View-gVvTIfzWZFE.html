soon offer free nokia maps to everyone
so far the Nokia Lumia sales are a hit
and our tmobile HTC Radar 4d review is
now live all this and more coming up
right now hello everyone I'm high memory
that are with parking out common welcome
to Windows Phone view the show we wrap
up all this week's good and bad inside
the world of Microsoft's with no slowing
platform let's talk this week off with
what's good okay let's talk about nokia
and the windows phone since according to
nokia well this is the true windows
phone so far the Lumia 800 begins
selling in Europe in sales and France do
prove it to be a hit and well let's not
kid ourselves I mean the device was
bound to catch an eye because it's
gorgeous now out of the cool things with
this partnership is that it seems that
Nokia will be offering their no get maps
for free in the marketplace to everyone
that owns a Windows Phone so this
partnership really seems to be good
let's hope to see some really more
things in the future Microsoft has just
launched marketplace extra which is a
Windows Phone website with the idea of
helping you discover applications now
it's not really as intuitive as our
current weekly show Windows Phone app
roundup but it does a really good job in
bringing you information on what apps
you might have missed and which ones are
really good so make sure you hit the
link of the description for details and
also make sure you catch our Windows
Phone app roundup out of our weeks
coverage make sure you catch Adam lanes
full review of the HTC radar 4g from
t-mobile which Adam at the beginning
didn't really expect it to be much but
it ended up being a really good phone I
mean it's court 4.5 stars out of 5 and
that's for a really compelling reason so
make sure you catch the link in the
description and also read about it
because it seems to be a really good
phone it's already on sale online in
certain places so make sure you catch it
and while the era of weird Microsoft ads
just end it because well I'll be honest
with you I really love their really
campaign because it was really funny and
Microsoft was trying to prove something
but sadly I think the point was really
flawed because Microsoft was trying to
prove that Windows Phone 7 was the anti
smartphone
forum where you could actually come in
and dig out and be wherever you want it
to be worried was actually the opposite
I mean people are not really looking for
an anti smartphone they're looking for
an immersive experience and to be honest
with you oh when those phone 7 is what
it is it is really immersive and it does
a really good job and just compiling
everything in one place so I think it's
actually more immersive than anything
else and so far Microsoft is just aired
a new ad campaign where they're showing
everybody what OneNote can do between a
Windows 7 computer and Windows Phone 7
really smart I mean this really what ads
Microsoft had to bring a long time ago
they have to prove to everybody that
Windows Phone 7 was actually smarter
than they think and it really is so
let's hope does that can paint bring
some really more things because it's
really cool and while speaking of
marketing Microsoft is just planned new
events that are starting on november six
and november seventh where you get to
spend the night with Windows Phone and
these that's what it's called though
we're not really sure if you're going to
be able to take a windows phone home and
it's definitely not going to have a
skirt but you're going to have
performances for met and Kim in New York
City so all you have to do is register
and Facebook for the event and be able
to attend so we're sure everybody's
going to be there and for those of you
interested in some Windows Phone freedom
Chevron wv7 Labs is now live and
starting to unlock your phones now this
is very different to how you jailbreak a
device in iOS or rooted device in
android you don't really need any sort
of weird software to work on your device
that's been hacked all you have to do is
pay Chevron wp7 nine bucks and they'll
send you a token where you can unlock
your phone along with some other
software for your pc now the really cool
thing about this is again it's your
windows phone only it's unlocked the
only paid for it once don't have to do
it again you can actually side load
applications after that so really cool
if you're interested
that does it for what's good let's
continue on with what's bad and man I'm
really tired of internet sharing
fragmentation because you know what the
Nokia Lumia devices are not going to
bring internet sharing out of the box it
seems that Microsoft is excusing
everything with the fact they're dealing
with this with the FCC and I don't think
Microsoft is notice that everybody else
iOS and Android are already using
internet sharing with their devices now
it's kind of ironic because internet
sharing was actually invented with
Windows Mobile so it's kind of an irony
to see that it's not making it to the
new windows phone 7 hand since I mean
Microsoft really needs to get their act
together and see how competitions
working because they're really pulling
themselves behind with this feature in
it may not be important to you but I've
spent the last three shows talking about
it because it's important to all of us
power users anyways that's it for today
show thank you very much for watching
I'm high memory better remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
