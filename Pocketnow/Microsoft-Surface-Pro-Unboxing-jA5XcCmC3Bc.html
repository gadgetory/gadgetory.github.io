where I've got myself a nice new surface
pro from Microsoft and let me tell you
Saturday morning would have been a great
day to do a launch one of these devices
but it turns out there was a giant
wizard so about 20 of us that made it to
the mall and lined up I had to wait a
little while longer because the mall was
closed anyway this is Adam Lane and I'm
going to unbox the surface pro all right
I bought a limited edition surface touch
cover to go with the surface pro so
let's just try to open that first get
this and tape in there that's out nice
feet here it is does it come out
something like that so they touch cover
as you can see it's very very thin feels
pretty nice all right so I'll leave that
over there and next we'll look at the
surface there's the packaging very plain
nice to the side you can see some specs
on the back 128 gig Windows 8 Pro
one-month trial of office 365
Bluetooth you know all the works alright
so let's see how this opens there's a
little tab here
and we gotta slide it very nice another
box inside lamb nut a little tab over
here to Brad let's see how this works
there you go
Wow look at this blue alright and here
we have our charger Pro Windows 8
sticker thing and it has a USB port so
if I had let's see I have a phone
charger we can plug that in and I can
charge my phone pretty nice
there's our wire magnetic area cool cool
ok hence the AC power and let's skip the
surface pro app very nice looking
doesn't click as loudly as the Artie
it's very muffled looking good all right
let's see what else we have in here
here's our stylist or your plasticky
that's all right and we have
documentation see what this is about
not much
let's take a little look around around
the device focus there's our spine and
there's a couple extra ports down there
so extra connection so you could
possibly have an external battery we
hear about that but that's where your
keyboard will normally connect very nice
there's your kickstand and underneath
you can read you can see it 128 gig
that's what it tells you down there
there's your camera a little microphone
date format casing very nice a little
bit of fingerprints already there's that
thickness
over here we have a headphone jack
volume USB 3.0 on the other side you
have your charging port micro SD card
slot and a mini display fork that can
stick the pan in the charging port like
so it's pretty sturdy doesn't just that
hey if you fluff it too much it will
flop up but seems pretty sturdy
that's how straight it is no I think it
might be able to stay in there and
there's your front facing camera and the
a Windows button capacitive buttons so
that's a look at the surface pro on box
sure here this video a thumbs up and
stay tuned for more coverage on this
awesome surface pro that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
