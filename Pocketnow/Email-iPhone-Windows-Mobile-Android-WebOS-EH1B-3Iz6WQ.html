pocket now calm and this is a comparison
of the email experience across these
four mobile operating systems so we have
the iphone 3gs running on the iphone
operating system the HTC hd2 running on
Windows Mobile the google nexus one
running on android and of course the
verizon palm pre plus running on webos
we recently did a video comparing these
four devices in terms of their home
screen experiences and now we're going
to take a look at email because i know a
lot of people especially myself really
rely on a mobile device to bring a very
good email experience so that when
you're on the go you feel connected
you're productive and everything like
that so let's go device by device and
try to talk about the philosophies
behind the various email programs and
we're going to start with the iphone ok
so here we are with the iphone i'm going
to unlock the screen and right off the
bat we have no information about any new
emails and this is important thing to
note because some of the other devices
you're going to see do give you
information if you have any new email so
you don't actually have to unlock the
device to start so here we are we're
taken to the icon screen as i like to
call it and right off the bat we can
take a look down at the mail icon and
say okay it says three right now in the
upper right corner last hour i checked
there were two that must mean i have a
new email so i think that's really the
the best way to be able to check so i'm
going to open up the email client the
email on the iphone 3gs is very slick
and very smooth and very fast i think
that's one of the best parts about it so
here i've sent myself a test message and
within it is a picture pictures show up
perfectly i don't have to download them
i can pinch to zoom with the very very
smooth multi-touch i can move around on
the screen does a really good job at
supporting HTML emails and really let
you see emails as you would on the
desktop from here i can mark as unread
which is very important i use this
function a lot so within the email i can
do that although i can't mark as unread
from outside in the inbox view to delete
i can swipe to the right and I get a
little Delete icon which makes it pretty
fast too to delete messages but I think
you're going to see webos has the best
way to delete messages it's super fast
so let's say I want to make a new email
I press down here one of the greatest
things about the email client in the
iphone
is that when you start typing somebody's
name it not only pulls up the names from
your address book but also recently
entered email addresses so even if
there's somebody that isn't in my dress
book but I've correspond with them
recently it will come up but anyway it's
a very very fast way to to to type in
the name of someone that you want
subject hello and very quick and easy
press end and you're done so a very
satisfying email client on the iphone
3gs i think thanks a lot because i think
thanks hugely in part because it's just
very fast and we can go backwards to
take a look at our sub folders or if you
have multiple accounts they'll show up
here that fun does a great job at
managing multiple email addresses so
that is the iphone 3gs email experience
let's take a look at the HTC hd2 now
something unique about the hd2 or this
is for Windows Mobile in general is that
I don't need to unlock the device to see
if I've new email I can tap here and see
that i have three new emails already and
i can slide to the right to go right
into my email application but before I
do that I want to show you something
else unique about the the hd2 I can
preview my email right within touchflo
3d and of course this is an HTC
enhancement but it's really helpful
because I don't have to open my email
client I can just dig through my emails
through this screen and if I like what I
see I can tap on an email I can reply to
it or I go straight to my inbox so let's
take a look at that test email I sent
with the picture and see what it's like
to look at the image okay so I need to
tap over here to download it I'm over
edge so it'll take a second okay and
here's the image I can tap on it and
there it is and of course I get the nice
multi-touch very smooth to here except
in this email client there's the extra
step of having to actually download the
message from the the header of the
message there so I can go back to delete
a message there are a few ways to do it
they make it very easy in Windows Mobile
I can tap on a message and hold and
press the delete button up there or i
can press the delete button down here
you can't swipe to delete also another
thing i like about the the email client
on
Mobile is that from the the inbox screen
I can mark something as unread which is
very handy I don't have to go into the
email to mark it as unread and now let's
make a new email so quite simply go to
menu and new and i'm going to type
Brandon and again it pulls from my
address book but in this case it won't
pull from things that aren't in my dress
book and I can type hello again and
press the send button and it's off so
another thing that I really like about
the email client on the HTC hd2 or in
Windows Mobile in general is that it has
very good integration with microsoft
exchange so I can search my company's
address book I can search the server for
emails that i wrote a year ago it's it's
quite remarkable Microsoft devices will
always have the best exchange
integrations so hd2 is really fantastic
email client it's fast probably not as
fast as the iphone 3gs just because it's
not as refined there are some extra
steps to do certain things so let's take
a look at the google nexus one and from
the unlock screen you don't get any sort
of indications of whether you have new
emails you can look up here to sort of
get an indication but you still need to
unlock to see anything else now from
here some of the some of the android
devices that are made by HTC will
actually allow you to have a widget that
ties into email kind of give you that
touchflo 3d like view of peeking into
your email with action without actually
having to open the application but on
the nexus one we can go right into the
email application and here we are and
you can see the emails are piling up
because I keep sending myself test
messages and from here let's open up
that test email with the image and over
here we have to get it to fetch and it's
going to come through pretty fast and
just like the last two devices this has
multitouch so we can pinch to zoom we
can see it in its full glory and it
works quite well and so we can press the
back button to go to the previous screen
to see our message list if we want to
delete a message in in the android
operating system it's very similar doubt
you would do in Windows Mobile you tap
on hold then you get the pop up and you
can delete so I'm going to press the
back button swiping will not do anything
in android
mark is on red you can also do a tap and
hold and go to Marcus on red there so
again you don't have to actually go into
the message to do mark is on red as you
have to do in the iphone so let's make a
new message I'm going to press the menu
button here and then I'm going to click
on compose and let's do what we've been
doing all along i'm going to type my
name and here we are and i'm going to
type you know hello I've been typing
lots of hello messages send and there it
is a very nice email experience to on
the google nexus one there's there's a
lot of taps and holds there they don't
have menu buttons along the bottom to
make it easy to quickly delete a message
like you can do on the hd2 or or quickly
send a message you always have to dial
into this menu system which is okay
helps to maximize screen space and
finally let's take a look at web OS and
here in webos we can see right off the
bat that we have an email notification
which is great web bless is a really
interesting way of showing notifications
you can see how many emails you have you
can also see the the recent most email
that you have so I'm going to drag that
up and I'm actually going to go back to
the the home screen to kind of show you
how webos portrays email so you don't
get any sort of notification next to the
email icon like you would get on the
iphone so you can't glance down and say
okay I have three new messages but again
web bless is a very interesting way of
showing you new email while you're
working as to not disrupt you so we're
gonna tap right into the email
application it will open up a new card
which by the way is very convenient
because you can keep your email open
while listening to pandora radio or
while you're on the web or doing
anything else and still have the same
view stay intact of where you left it
when you were doing email last so that's
a really good feature of webos and how
it relates to email so looking down
let's go to that email that I sent
myself with the attachment where is it
here it is there it is and let's see how
webos brings up that image so here it is
right here it downloaded the image i can
bring it up it doesn't it doesn't it's
not included within the email but again
we can do pinch to zoom just like we can
do with all these other devices they're
almost itouch and it's been
a smooth very easy to use we can rotate
into landscape or at least we should be
able to it doesn't look like it's
working for me there and then we can
copy it into the photo application we
can swipe backwards to go backwards
that's how webos goes to the previous
screen and we've buttons along the
bottom that we can use to delete things
now I mentioned that webos has the best
way to delete emails and this is how you
do it you swipe it off the screen the
quickest and easiest way that I found
yet to delete an email on the iphone
operating system you can swipe to the
right but then you get a delete button
so that's really two steps here in webos
it is just one step which is really
really quite fantastic now from here you
cannot mark items as unread you can't do
a tap and hold like you can in windows
mobile and in android so you have to go
into the into the email to do that sort
of thing and I haven't even found a way
to to mark an item as unread within an
email so here we have reply forward
reply all and that's really it i'm sure
there's got to be a way to mark as
unread but I just haven't found it yet
they don't make it very easy to find now
to make a new email tweet app the new
message button here it opens up a new
card and we can start entering
information with the slide down keyboard
here and so I'm going to do another
email to myself and it's searching the
global address book it's not as fast as
the other devices that we've tested but
it's quite good so I'm going to type you
know hello got to get used to this
keyboard and then I'm going to send it
off there and it is gone it says sending
email down there on the screen so I'd
say that the implementation of email on
webos is the least sophisticated of the
other operating systems and it's also
not as fast even though this is the palm
pre plus with an upgraded processor and
more ram I still find it to be kind of
slow and especially when your multi
tasking obviously that's going to use a
lot of ram but some of the time i go
into my email I've got two or three
applications open and it gets really
slow so if I were to rate these in terms
of best email experience to worst email
experience and this is very subjective
this really has to do with what I prefer
in an email client I'd give the iphone
number one because I find it to be the
fastest email client that really lets me
stay productive I've given
22 the HTC hd2 because it's got perfect
exchange integration it's got a really
fast email client it lets me preview
email and it's also pretty snappy like
the iphone 3gs third i will give to
android it has a lot of the
functionality that Windows Mobile has in
the tap and hold to bring up menus you
can do a lot from your email inbox
without having to dig into the message
and I'd give fourth place to webos I
just don't think its robust enough it's
not nearly as fast as the other cell
phone platforms but it generally works
especially if you're doing light email
so I'm curious to hear what you think
about these different email platforms so
put a comment in the post on pocket now
calm or within the YouTube video and let
us know which email client you prefer
the best and of course we didn't cover
blackberry most people would agree that
blackberry is the best email experience
but of these four devices and of these
four platforms which do you prefer the
most that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
