same old question and we are trying to
answer that in our full review of the
Samsung Galaxy K zoom coming to you
right now not before telling you that
this intro footage has been shot with
the Galaxy K zoom let's go check it out
maybe this year Samsung realized that it
makes absolutely no sense to abuse the
name of the galaxy s5 flagship and
despite everyone was expecting a galaxy
s5 zoom we've got the galaxy k zoom
despite being larger than its
predecessor in all measurements it
definitely feels smaller in the hand you
may lead to the omission of a camera
grip present on last year's model also
gone is the tripod mount and the battery
is no longer a slide it in from the side
one but a situated below a plastic
battery cover which utilizes the same
texture found on the s5 oh and the ring
around the lens is gone as well at 200
grams this is not a light device couple
that put its bulky form factor and
you've got yourself a pretty
uncomfortable device to carry around in
your pocket but it's not all that bad at
least it feels good in the hand well as
good as any other Samsung phone you'll
find on the market and the back texture
is miles better than last year's hyper
glaze in terms of specs samsung has made
improvements over the s4 zoom in almost
every aspect we've got a 4.8 inch Super
AMOLED screen which is now 720p and
looks as good as any other recent
Samsung panel with vibrant colors and
deep blacks of course the physical home
button is found underneath it flanked by
a multitasking and back button to its
sides sadly just like last year a
notification LED is still missing and
Samsung doesn't really allow you to use
neither the flash nor the focus assist
light for that purpose the rest of the
front is business as usual with the
earpiece sensors and a 2 megapixel front
facing each Samsung lens
we'll talk more about that in our
dedicated camera section later in our
review for now we'll just mention that
the megapixel count has been up to 20
point 7 while the optical image
stabilization and
and times optical zoom have been kept at
least in terms of numbers on paper you
still have a xenon flash to have
brighten up things and it focuses this
light for darker scenes an exodus 50 to
60 SOC is powering the device which is a
hexa core chip meaning it has six cores
there's a quad-core 1.3 gigahertz cortex
a7 structure and a dual-core 1.7
gigahertz cortex a15 system the 2
gigabytes of memory ensure that
everything runs smoothly and the bare
minimum of eight gigabytes internal
storage out of which very little is
available to the user around five gigs
ensure that you have to go out and buy a
microSD card to expand it you will need
it the usual suspects include the
sensors accelerometer gyro sensor
geomagnetic sensor light sensor
proximity sensor as well as the NFC
Bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi GPS and radio
supporting 4G LTE depending on your
market and frequencies a 2430 milliamp
power battery and Android 4.4.2 powers
everything but you won't find galaxy s5
specific features like waterproof
construction heartbreak monitor or a
fingerprint scanner multi window air
gestures and s health are also missing
from the software side on top of Android
4.4.2 the K zoom is running the same
version of TouchWiz that you'll find on
2014 Samsung phones including the galaxy
s5 hence the entire experience is
comparable - the software and hardware
emissions we mentioned earlier and if
you want to know more about that we
invite you to check out our in-depth
galaxy s5 review software section long
story short the UI is somewhat cleaner
with samsung's new rounded shortcut
icons in the notification tray as well
as the settings menu which is now
organized under vertical categories and
is searchable small bits like displaying
the last time you've talked to the
person you're currently dialing and 2
bucks for a facebook chat head like
always visible floating shortcut menu
are all useful additions to the user
experience if you're buying this phone
you're most likely doing so because of
the camera which is after all its main
selling point we snapped a lot of
pictures during our time with the K zoom
under different circumstances with
results varying from very good to
satisfying one of our main complaints of
last year's s4 zoom was the inability to
wake the device with the dedicated
camera button and launch it into the
camera application sadly that's not been
fixed by Samsung you can wake the phone
as usual and launch the camera from the
single shortcut on the screen however
you can launch the camera with the
shutter button only if your device is
active and awake being a camera centric
phone with some people still arguing
that this is really a point-and-shoot we
expected a different camera software
instead we just got the same camera UI
found on the s5 with a ton of shooting
modes you can choose from we applauded
the ability to separately set focus and
exposure points which comes in and the
many times there's also a special mode
on the K zoom called Pro suggests which
automatically suggests effects depending
on the scene you're currently capturing
needless to say you can download dozens
of effects from Samsung to complement
the Cornucopia already found in the
device but aside from the usual modes
there's also a program mode and the
manual mode which is pretty
self-explanatory
27 modes are available to choose from
out of the box out of which you can
display 12 of your choice at any time
while having multiple choices is a good
thing clutter and the fact that you will
probably never use half of them or not
but it's really up to you they're there
if you want to only show creativity how
about the results
the 20 point seven megapixel shooter on
the K zoom delivers very nice results
images are well balanced realistic sharp
and under good conditions noise free
most of the times we have a major
complaint though on our particular unit
the far-right quarter of the stills
snapped lacks sharpness almost like a
special faded out blurred effect was
applied we're guessing it's a lens issue
because it tends to go away once you
start using the optical zoom but then
also some of the light goes away as well
thanks to the variable aperture range of
3.1 to 6.3 meaning zoomed in pictures
will probably be darker exposure and
white balance are handled well and with
20.7 megapixels there's a lot of
information you can crop into since
there's no ring around the lenses
anymore you can either pinch the screen
or use the volume rockers on the sides
debate the ten times optical zoom you no
longer need to move in close to your
subjects and the results are pretty
impressive both in terms of shooting
faraway subjects or in creating nice
bouquet effects low-light sensitivity is
also good though pictures tend to be
warmer than those shut under regular
circumstances we have no major
complaints about the xenon flash which
is really strong enough to brighten up
the scene easily
our biggest concern though is the
aforementioned blur on the right side of
the frames while it's not something you
can't live with if you care about your
stills it will bother you that blur is
also present on the same right edge of
the frame while shooting video zoomed
out otherwise the camera is capable of
recording good looking videos both
outdoors and indoors and the ability to
zoom in on the fly optically while you
have to learn to live with the sound of
the lens zoom motors in your videos is
great after more than a week using the
kasem we can tell you that our battery
concerns from the initial unboxing and
first impressions video were spot on
the 24 30 milliamp hour battery is
simply too small for this device
prepared to run out of juice by the end
of the day even if you use it as a
regular smartphone open up the camera
app and shoot your way through today
like Samsung wants you to do and you'll
have to recharge halfway through or
replace the battery with a fully charged
one we have no complaints on the
performance side of things though we
have experienced no lag or hiccups while
performing day-to-day activities
whatsoever
these include phone calls texts emails
chats social media music and video
streaming navigation and document
editing you can also play graphic
intensive games without a problem Need
for Speed Most Wanted ran without
problems though the battery was the
bleeding fast coal quality and signal
strength are not stellar but they're not
on our complaints list either the phone
delivers average results in line with
most of the smart phones you find in the
market we're a bit disappointed by
speakerphone performance though
regardless if we talk about phone calls
or multimedia with such a bulky form
factor Samsung could have equipped the K
zoom with a more capable speaker the
fact that it's backfiring doesn't help
either but luckily the speaker is
positioned on the top so you won't cover
it up with your hand in portrait mode
and when it comes to the battery
we'll just have to reiterate our
thoughts it's too small for such a
device but that's the price you have to
pay for trying to keep the form-factor a
decent size while packing capable
hardware and the powerful camera inside
we had a lot of complaints last year
with the galaxy s4 zoom
needless to say most of these are on our
2014 kazoom lists as well while Samsung
has definitely improved the
specifications on paper it has still not
addressed some important aspects like
the LED notification or the simplest
no-brainer capability of waking the
phone into the camera app with the
camera button that being said we're
still not sure we're able to answer our
fundamental questions about this device
but we'll try our best is it a phone yes
it definitely is a smartphone and they'd
rather capable one at that being able to
handle most of today's tasks without a
problem is it a camera it surely is and
a good one who would buy it the person
who doesn't care about edit bulk is not
a speck head but rather a casual
smartphone user is relatively light on
using the phone and cares a lot about
his or her on-the-go photography why
well you tell us why you buy or skip the
Samsung Galaxy K zoom in the comments
