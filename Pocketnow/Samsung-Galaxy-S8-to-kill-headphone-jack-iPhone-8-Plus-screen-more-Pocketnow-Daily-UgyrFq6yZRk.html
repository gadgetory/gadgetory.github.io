eight takes a plunge into killing the
headphone jack new details emerge on
spring specifications for the iphone 8
plus and we look into what HTC might
bring after CES 2017 I'm hi Mary that I
am fine i will leave 2016 alone no more
comments even though there are some
reality show artists that might be of
use for it this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with more
statistics again we are at the end of
the year and one of the companies this
really surprised us with its performance
in sales is huawei after the nexus 6p
Huawei has really shown us the quality
of its products and we've totally seen
that and how much the company is sold
this year 140 million units and for
those of you wondering how popular
devices like the p9 are 10 million units
sold in the year that is a big deal for
a company like Huawei and that's the
reason why the company is at its level
of market share right now and we just
hope to see better products coming in
the years to come now one of the biggest
questions that we've received on social
media is what to expect for HTC su event
that's happening on January 12 now we
are wondering exactly what the company
means with you and we've got some
sources that claim that this could be
the HTC codename ocean where it brings a
lot of the HTC design language but some
innovations in the way you navigate
through the phone and some improvements
over HTC software so if that's the case
why not we will keep you posted as we
learn more for those of you that are
worried about when we will be getting
the next generation iPads me included
that's probably one of my favorite
products well apparently TSMC has just
confirmed that it is not having any
yield issues with its 10 nanometer chip
so it is possible that we should be
expecting the next generation iPads as
of March the problem is that if the
yield issues are true than expected to
sell out as it usually does and speaking
of apple one of the major rumors is that
we are getting three different iphones
and well even though some have fumbled
with the spigen iphone 7s or iphone 8
we've got another source is claiming two
things one that we
we'll have a combo of two devices with
LCD displays and then the only device
that's actually bringing an oled display
is the larger iphone 8 plus according to
this it's a five point eight inch
display and it makes all the sense in
the world that we are losing bezel real
estate but again these are all just
rumors we'll see and finally the very
interesting news that they have to do
with Samsung and possibly the galaxy SI
now bear in mind we're not expecting the
galaxy s 8 to be announced at CES but
the company is announcing that it will
bring us audio innovation the future of
audio it's teasing that for CES so it
could just be that will be seeing audio
accessories being announced but one of
the other rumors that's really
constraining us is the fact that
apparently samsung is going to ditch the
headphone jack and it's going to bring
its own pair of wireless earbuds even
though we already have the I on exes so
listen it leads me to the question of
the day do you think that Samsung should
make the move and kill the headphone
jack or do you think that the company
should keep it in my case hey we're
already having a slimming issue with the
galaxy note 7 why not keep a thick
galaxy s 8 keep the headphone jack bring
a better battery and let's just call it
a day leave us a comment down below we
