many like to call it
iPhone day and I am actually really
excited but it's funny even though I'm
actually set up for the iPhone 10s right
here I'm actually more inclined to be
excited about the new Apple watch series
for I'm gonna be better with pocket now
when let's go through our unboxing
brought to you by the geniuses over a
Twix definitely by now I know that there
are a ton of people making lines at
different Apple stores across the
country I did that last year to a
certain degree i pre-ordered and then I
scheduled for a pickup and that was all
great but I tried the delivery service
this year and it was actually seamless
UPS was here at 10 a.m. which was great
it pretty much took me more time to put
this video together than anything but
now that we've got everything let's get
to work
I have to admit unboxing experiences are
important to me like removing the
plastic off your new car seats you
deserve a good experience as you
unpackage such an expensive pair of
devices the two brown boxes are standard
with the iPhone being probably the most
sale of both just the standard tape
around and then plastic holding down the
phone the Apple watch was actually the
most fancy of the two with a pull tab to
reveal the product box underneath let's
start with the iPhone 10's I like how
Apple wraps the box around plastic so
there's some peeling noise here
underneath we have the standard
literature packet that most of us don't
really care about but it does include a
user manual the typical Apple stickers
and a SIM tray since in my case I
ordered the unlock variant underneath
there is the new iPhone 10 s and below
it well this is where we get the
unpleasantries I mean it's 2018 and we
still have the same old 5 watt charger
that won't give you fast charging we
still have the old USB a to lightning
cable and ear pods without the 3.5
millimeter headphone dongle
like seriously Apple for $1000 we should
at least get the fast charger in here I
mean I'm not saying that we should get
air pods but I'd be willing to pay a
little extra money to not be bothered by
these ear pods that don't work with
other Apple devices like the Mac for
example but complaints aside be unboxing
experience that I did enjoy was for the
Apple watch series for there is a box
within a box within another box it took
me a bit to figure out that the designs
at the bottom were actually pull tabs
and that these served to unwrap the
other boxes inside and the wrapping
actually shows different designs of the
Apple watch I found that to be really
cool below that we have the watch band
casing and then there's the Apple watch
box now I found it really interesting
that the series 4 is served alone
without its own band so you can't really
reuse this box to store it or you can't
even take off the band's and then you
have your typical USB 2 wireless
charging puck and the 5 watt charger
included the Apple watch is tucked in
the very interesting protective sleeve
this is actually new and I also chose
the sport loop watch band which comes in
a separate case now let's get to the
real goods let's start removing some
plastics off this iPhone 10's
and yes let's also remove the protective
film around the Apple watch series 4 so
I chose the iPhone 10 s instead of the
Macs because I'm quite comfortable with
the size of the iPhone 10 but seriously
it looks like an iPhone 10 in every way
up to the point where the cases of the
iPhone 10 fitted just fine I actually
chose the gold variant just for you guys
to believe me that I'm reviewing the 10
s but this finish and gold actually
looks really slick and then I've always
chose silver and Apple watches mainly
because they aged better when it comes
to the watch bands and I also prefer the
larger size so this is the 44 millimeter
one and I'm honestly not regretting this
the larger size of the display makes it
look really nice even turned off like
seriously I believe that this would be
the first Apple watch that I've actually
really liked we're gonna set this up and
come back tomorrow with more details on
a separate video on our first
impressions but so far I have to say the
unboxing experience has been good for
the Apple watch not so good for the
iPhone 10s let us know in the comments
what you think and while you're at it we
would also love to ask you to stay up
until the end of this video for a
message from our sponsor and yes you
know the source for everything we do on
the pocket our YouTube channel comes
from pocketnow.com but boy do I wish
that we had wicks back when we created
it if you're interested in creating a
professional website blog or online
store without coding knowledge which
offers an insane portfolio of tools for
you to design something that's right for
you and it's all drag-and-drop which is
so practical or you can choose from any
of the hundreds of templates that they
offer learn more about wix.com in the
link in the description below friends
