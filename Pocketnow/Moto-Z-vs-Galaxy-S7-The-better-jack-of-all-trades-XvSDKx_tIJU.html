days right looking for that fashion form
which can also satisfy all of the
function you need throughout your day
Samsung and Motorola are both making
compelling arguments for your cash
moving beyond the build materials it's
interesting to see these two differ on
thickness modo eliminated the headphone
jack and shaved millimeters off of the
Moto Z while Samsung actually added a
bit of girth moving from the Essex to
include a larger battery the Z is a
shockingly thin phone but after that
first moment holding it that thin this
isn't a feature unto itself both of
these will likely be used with some kind
of case or mod backplate adding to that
hand filled discussion the button action
on the s7 is a bit more familiar volume
keys and power button flanked different
sides so there's a little less initial
tactile confusion over the very small
and evenly spaced keys on the Motorola
ditto the fingerprint sensor which is a
home button on most phones as it is on
the Galaxy but acts as a power button
replacement on the Z and moving over to
the screens these displays battle well
both are quad HD and AMOLED so using the
auto brightness modes to our eye
Samsung's contrast and color shifting
eke out a very small win for outdoor
viewing and sunlight but we think you'll
be well served by the Moto 2 we're not
surprised that these two also differ a
lot on software Motorola perfected the
NIR stock user interface and the Moto Z
reinforces that aesthetic this is clean
maybe even a bit start only the basic
options for customization are available
but there are some nice simple mods to
tailor the experience like sensors on
the front face to wake the screen there
twisting the phone to launch the camera
and the moto assistant to augment ok
Google of course with these being
Verizon branded phones there's a bunch
of stuff pre-installed but nothing which
impacts the look and feel of the
interface moving over to the Galaxy this
might be the leanest build of TouchWiz
we've ever seen but it still influences
nearly every aspect of the Android UI
from notification shade to home screen
options to settings menus this is still
very much a Samsung joint of course
while we wait for Google to catch up on
features like split screening apps in
Android n we can already play with that
on an s7
and running that software these are both
powerhouse phones at this point it's
overkill to talk about the basics these
phones will crush messaging social media
video streaming and most daily
multitasking situations no worries there
we really need to climb into graphics
intensive applications before we can
demonstrate any differences our current
can√≠t play crisis benchmark seems to be
Marvel future fight which is
consistently underperformed on welcome
chipsets at the highest quality we don't
know what magic moto conjured but the
Moto Z visibly outperforms the s7 in
this game it's not completely free from
lag or stutter but it rarely becomes the
slideshow which the galaxy is more apt
to produce stepping down from this game
these too often battle for ties and
games like implosion in asphalt 7 but we
do seem to see a slight efficiency
advantage for the Motorola there's no
contest for camera performance though
moto has significantly improved the Z
cameras but sticking with the 13
megapixel rear camera on the Moto Z
Samsung's track record with camera
innovation overpowers what moto is
capable of here first the Samsung
delivers pure speed for launching the
app and locking focus when shooting full
auto the two are close enough in terms
of exposure and output but the Samsung
pulls ahead with a far more feature-rich
camera app delivering nearly every
control we would want for photos and
videos and a pretty complete collection
of tools to alter photo post-processing
do you want more saturation and less
sharpening in your pics it's easy to do
we have no such options for the Moto Z
we have to acknowledge that these are
early days for this phone and we expect
that these issues will be sorted but we
are encountering a fair number of
gremlins in this camera app especially
in low-light situations this should be
easily fixed by a software update but
it's a bit less likely that this app
will continue to evolve to include some
of the options or controls we mentioned
before even the ability to capture a raw
image would be a welcome addition the
Moto Z isn't as compromised as moto
cameras of the past but it does fall
behind some of our favorite top-tier
content creation phones comparing audio
playback flips the script though the
Moto Z speaker is higher quality and
benefits from being pointed in the right
direction it's more difficult to block
the speaker when playing games and
propping the phone up for video
a more direct audio path to your ears
headphone audio is also a win for the
Moto ok so using an adapter is kind of a
bummer but the amp output is higher and
we get better output numbers with a
lower noise floor disappointingly
however the Moto Z seems to truncate
high res audio where the Samsung seems
to include the full frequency range of
24-bit audio the Moto Down samples us to
16-bit playback still if you're
listening to mp3s the Moto delivers a
higher-quality headphone experience
moving to battery life Samsung chalks up
another win
mostly for including a larger battery
but it's not the runaway victory we
thought it might be on our media tests
streaming 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 50 percent brightness the
Samsung drained 5% of its battery while
the Moto drained 6 these numbers are
pretty close and in daily use we
routinely ended each day with more
battery on the Samsung then on the Moto
but usually by a narrower margin than
the difference in capacity between these
two phones for recharge speeds our early
testing isn't great for the Moto Z and
we'll be detailing this in our full
review but 30 minutes on the included
charger only delivered a 38 percent jump
and that's with us flipping the phone
into airplane mode there could be
something up with our Moto Z review unit
as our Moto Z force was capable of a 43%
recharge over 30 minutes and that has a
significantly larger battery we've
tested and retested our galaxy s7 and
the best we've ever managed on the
Samsung included charger is a 33% charge
so we guess the Moto Z wins this battle
but not by much lastly we've got to talk
about the gimmicks Samsung built their
reputation on throwing everything in the
kitchen sink into their phones water
resistance built-in heart rate monitor
TouchWiz software tweaks there's a lot
going on inside a Samsung the Moto on
the other hand delivers one of the most
exciting accessory options for any phone
we've ever played with snap-on back
plates to customize moto mods to add
functionality it increases the overall
price of the phone but it's a handy way
to tailor fit each phone to your
specific needs
depending on how creative Lenovo moto
gets with future mods they might help
extend the life of a moto Z offering
future technologies or options which
aren't built-in to current devices at
least we can dream that a manufacturer
might be so magnanimous
so let's wrap this up where does that
leave us between a moto Z and a Galaxy
s7
competition is good we like close fight
and moto has something really
interesting here we're still inclined
aside with the galaxy is the better
all-rounder but the Moto Z looks like
it's more capable of satisfying specific
needs for consumers these two trade
blows really well a good camera versus a
great camera good audio versus great
audio better gameplay or better battery
life but in a number of areas these two
battled to a tie and that's what we want
from premier top-tier phones when
spending over $600 on a gadget we want
two companies bringing their best as
