for in the samsung galaxy book 2 that
I'm currently playing with reviews
coming soon we were wondering what was
next for the company and we're now at
CES 2019 we had to step outside because
the lighting in there is terrible
Samsung decided to take over with
laptops some very interesting laptops
I'm Jaime to be that over the pocket now
with Jools one on camera let's dive in
let's start with the Samsung notebook 9
series the company claims it to elevate
Portability and power you need great
design and that's what this lineup
stands for previously we had seen the
notebook 9 pin which was more of a
consumer product and which now follows a
lot of the design of the Galaxy Note 9
and its color approach blue chassis if
only the lighting would help us portray
that and the nest pen and yellow
specifics remain the same with a gigs of
ram 256 gigs of expandable storage and
an eighth generation Intel processor now
the new kid on the block is the Samsung
notebook 9 throw it is a true looker a
very beautiful computer it's got
diamond-cut edges a full metallic finish
that's sharp all around we have a 13.3
inch full HD display that goes as bright
as 315 it's it's got a spacious and
backlit keyboard and USB sea ports that
support Thunderbolt 3 it also includes
an eighth generation Core i7 8 gigs of
ram 256 gigs of storage expandable and
yes there is a fingerprint scanner here
samsung also includes an active pen for
stylus support with Windows 10 home and
there are some Samsung added
applications and services to take
advantage of it
then there's the Samsung notebook flash
which is more their entry-level product
it includes either an Intel Celeron or
an Intel Pentium processor depending on
what you pick four gigs of ram 64 gigs
of storage expandable through microsd
we've got USB seeing us v8 connectors
and also a fingerprint scanner for its
price probably the coolest part is this
keyboard which reminds us of the old
typewriter design which is sort of this
pleather texture best of all the price
tag 349 dollars
and finally there is the notebook
Odyssey which wasn't announced at this
event it was actually separate in the
Nvidia event because it sports a new
r-tx 20 series GPU she has a core i7 up
to one terabyte of hard drive in
addition to a 256 gig solid state drive
we're talking about an Intel Core i7 16
gigs of ram in addition to us VC and
USBA ports this is more the gaming
computer in that company even claims up
to five heat pipes to keep everything
cool it is definitely also a looker
though not the lightest computer ever
but yeah that was it for Samsung at CES
2019 definitely really good laptops here
