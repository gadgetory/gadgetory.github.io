got to be a new s-pen and you're willing
to forget all about the note 7 that
burned out of our memories last year
then we can safely say the note eights S
Pen has some pretty neat
never-before-seen features
I'm Jules Wong with pocket now and this
s-pen lowdown is brought to you by D
Brown
if we had water to throw around we could
properly show off the ip68 rating of not
just the phone itself but of the s-pen
too it's only very recently that
elements resistance has come into vogue
even with our audience so additionally
tops our list here the stylus itself has
a soft touch
rubber feel and a tactile function
button that does the job just fine a
finer tip and more drag on the screen
gives the s-pen a bit more resistance to
your strokes not really a ballpen feel
you press the spring-loaded top to punch
it out of the silo and push it back in
till it clicks the shape of the spring a
bit also prevents the S Pen from gumming
it backwards so if you're still
traumatized by that note 5 get the note
8 if you take the S Pen out while the
phone is sleeping you activate screen
off memos for absolutely quick
scratchings when you really need them
you can write up to 100 pages at a time
and they get saved automatically going
to the hub of features action jiff
making takes a step up with live
messages take a picture start drawing
and watch those lines get animated with
sparkly sparkles into gifs that you can
share everywhere a new translate feature
is now also available you can parse
words or sentences between any two of 71
languages this applies to online text
and to currencies that are not dollars
if you're doing this in the US or
Singapore or wherever you have dollars
Samsung tells us they're making sure
that multinational currencies like
dollars can be converted if they're not
native of course it's always a work in
progress with software but we expect it
pre-orders for the Galaxy Note 8 are on
from tomorrow
and speaking of pre-orders you can still
preorder some skins for your know date
from D brand they'll give that glass
some grip and take your finger prints
out of the picture and it's not just for
the note 8 they'll cover up your other
Galaxy phones to learn more and get your
reservation in by heading to Bieber and
calm slash galaxy or by hitting the link
