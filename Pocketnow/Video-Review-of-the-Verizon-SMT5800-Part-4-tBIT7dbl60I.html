pocketnow.com and here is part 4 of my
video review of the verizon smt 5800
windows mobile 6 standard smartphone
today we're going to take a look at the
keyboard and the accessories that came
with the phone so we've got the numeric
keypad on the front of the phone and the
slide-out keyboard which is a qwerty
keyboard it has a function keys like we
can actually bring up mail by the touch
of this button and the function keys
identified by the red characters so you
can actually press function key twice
very similar to any other HTC phone or
shift twice for it to stick most of the
symbols that you'll need if i can get
this any closer here are on the function
key you can also use the number pad here
in the d-pad is available as well during
the creation of an email so if we go and
create an email you have the ability to
either use the t9 input so if i type
something this you see the t9 bar at the
bottom shows up until you hit space and
pick a word you can also turn this
feature off by hitting the star key on
the top of the phone and you can see
there's a little status here that says
xt9 and that status will change just to
ABC and then we can type test and you'll
see that the t9 bar doesn't show up so
this is very handy for those people who
really don't like t9 i found it to be
actually very useful in liked very much
when i was using this phone one nice
feature of
this phone is that the backlight
actually turns on based on the amount of
ambient light that's around and that's
just to save the battery so if I go back
to the mode and we'll just turn the
light off for a minute and you can see
the backlight on the front of the phone
is on and now the backlight is actually
on on the keyboard and that's quite
helpful although the keys look close to
each other I was able with my fat
fingers I was able to type but fairly
comfortably with my thumbs so from a
size standpoint it didn't bother me at
all now let's take a look at the
accessories and it came with this little
pouch which is nice to protect the phone
but great to put in a briefcase but not
that handy for really ever everyday use
I feel I need something with a clip for
my belt that seems to be the best use of
a case for for my everyday carrying
around of the phone and protecting it
otherwise it just ends up in my pocket
the other important accessory which I
was glad to see although upon closer
inspection I was a little dismayed is
the splitter for the HTC USB connector
as you can see it has a you another USB
connector so that you can charge the
phone and it has a headphone headset
jack which is a two and a half
millimeter jack versus the standard
three and a half that's used on
headphones and this is really too bad
they should have provided a another
adapter because this is really the
standard for headsets and not headphones
as you can see my etymotic cr6 is just
won't fit because there are three and a
half mmm
Jack what I have is from bucket PC text
is an additional splitter so you've got
one splitter that came with the phone
and then I actually have another
splitter that splits the headset and the
headphone and this has a
three-and-a-half millimeter jack so that
ends up being the way I have to use
headphones with this but obviously with
its Bluetooth capability the phone
doesn't really need wired headsets so
this is a nice thought but they didn't
think it all the way through and then
you have the AC adapter which is a
worldwide AC adapter 100 to 240 volts
it's your standard USB and you have the
USB data cable that came with the phone
that allows you to connect to any USB
port on a PC or for that matter a power
adapter so this about does it for my
video review of the verizon smt 5800 a
very well built and solid smartphone
with windows mobile 6 standard i'll be
back with my ratings later on this week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
