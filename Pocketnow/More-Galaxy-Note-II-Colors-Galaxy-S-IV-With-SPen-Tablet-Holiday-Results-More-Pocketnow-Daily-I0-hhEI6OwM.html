colors soon rumors of a galaxy s4 with
an S Pen half begun and tablets seem to
be eating smart phones when it comes to
sales I'm high metal Ravana here to end
2012 off right with this year's last
episode of poking out daily now let's
start today off by calling the samsung
day because well most of everything will
talk about how to do with samsung first
of all the Galaxy Note tool apparently
bring more colors to the table just like
the galaxy s3 brought more colors just a
couple of weeks after release apparently
the first device to be launched will be
a blackberry ins and even though it's
not my favorite it's good to have
options now speaking of the galaxy note
2 can you imagine a galaxy s4 with the S
Pen functionality I mean we do know that
the galaxy s3 had the sea pen but we all
know that's a poor excuse for stylus it
was really terrible nothing really out
of the ordinary there are a lot of
really great things with the S Pen on
the galaxy note in galaxy note 2 and
apparently Sampson is already gearing
down to bringing that functionality to
their next-generation galaxy s4
obviously we will have to wait until may
2013 probably we're still not sure about
that but I am sold I definitely would
love an S Pen on the galaxy s4 and yeah
for more samsung news they have a new
deal on facebook where you register your
samsung galaxy note 2 or your Galaxy s3
they'll be giving you a free flip cover
along with six NFC tags which is a
really cool deal if you think about it
only those flip covers have really ugly
colors still they're free they're also
giving you 50 percent discounts on
almost every accessory in their online
store which is another really good deal
the only problem is that you have to
wait like six to eight weeks to get your
gadgets but you could bet tonight's
beers that I already registered for mine
so make sure you follow links and
register your device now even though the
motorola droid razr and then really
surprised anybody in the market even
though it had some great praise from
michael fisher in his review motorola
apparently is already working on a new
variant of this droid razr m with an HD
display along with a better battery and
we don't have any day test to win this
device will be launched there's always a
market for smaller devices this droid
razr m fits right there I just wish they
thought of an
new shorter name imagine motorola droid
razr mhd what a mouthful and finally for
the interesting news of the day we all
know that the tablet category has
existed for more than a decade even
though it was really the iPad that made
it at a mainstream three years ago and
if we consider these new generation of
tablets apparently this year is the
first year the tablet surpassed
smartphones when it comes to sales and
just think about it I mean you don't
really need a tablet but you do need a
smartphone in most cases so that leaves
you to the question of the day what did
you purchase this holiday season you get
a tablet a smartphone or both in my case
I got both but can you blame me leave us

earlier scoop of everything that's
