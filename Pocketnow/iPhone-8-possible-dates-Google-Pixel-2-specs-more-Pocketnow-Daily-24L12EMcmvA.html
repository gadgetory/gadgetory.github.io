to a probable date of announcement and
launch Samsung is pretty much let us
know when we should expect its next gear
SmartWatch
and we also get a possible date for the
next Google pixel smartphones I'm Jaime
Rivera and yes these awesome t-shirts
come from ripped apparel you can follow
my Twitter and you will find the link
and also 10% off this is PocketNow daily
the official news today begin with deals
you've probably seen the ads of Virgin
Mobile where they're offering that if
you buy a smartphone on their carrier
you pretty much only pay a dollar for
service unlimited during a full year
well now you don't need to buy the
smartphone follow a link in the
description you can pretty much buy any
iPhone or bring your current iPhone port
your number-two Virgin Mobile and you
will only pay a dollar for your services
then afterwards and think it's about $50
a month I know it's too crazy there's
probably a catch learn more in the
description and if you were left
drooling over that space black
blackberry key one that was only
available in India and I think other
markets it's currently now being
announced as an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive you can
learn more about how to get it in the
description we're not exactly sure if
you're getting the extra gigabyte of RAM
as that variant from India is but yeah
this is another way to get the phone the
spotlight over to Samsung as the company
CEO of mobile DJ Co pretty much just
spilled the beans over when we can
expect the next gear SmartWatch he
pretty much teased that there is an
ephah event and afterwards we actually
got the official invitation for the
press event to happen at Aoife I am
really excited over what the SmartWatch
could be the gira story continues to be
one of my favorite smartwatches let's
just see if this one is actually better
at notifications and third-party apps
and speaking of possible announcements
if you're wondering exactly when we're
getting the next generation Google
pixels Evan blast is pretty much just
spill the beans on when October 5th is a
possible date and probably one of the
coolest parts of this rumor is the fact
that this device might bring the new
qualcomm snapdragon 836 processor so
this is a big deal for the pixel let's
see how that improves performance and
finally the very hot rumors today have
to do with the iPhone 8 we've got
European carriers already predicting
when exactly we should expect this smart
phone to be announced
apparently pre-orders are going to
happen on September 12th and then 10
days later
as in usual Apple fashion you will be
able to claim your phone September 22nd
and this is rather interesting if you do
the math that's just seven days after
the Galaxy Note 8 reaches consumers so
yeah iPhone 8 Galaxy Note 8 it leads me
to the question of the day I mean with
just 7 days of a difference between one
phone and the other obviously we don't
know exactly what we're getting with the
iPhone 8 but are are you more inclined
to an iPhone with the rumors or to the
no date given the recent announcement in
my case I would like to have both a sort
of large small smart phone and then a
sort of large small yeah that's not a
small phablet but anyways leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion renji - the way it goes if
you want to get the news earlier before

fired out comment subscribe to our
