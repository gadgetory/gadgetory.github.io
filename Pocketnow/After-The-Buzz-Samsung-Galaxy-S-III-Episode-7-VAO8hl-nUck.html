when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappears
ensure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say about the devices
they wear a man over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of review to see how they
feel after a couple weeks so let's do
something about it let's take a look at
a smartphone that while it's still
setting the market on fire it still
isn't exactly a newborn anymore I'm
Michael Fisher with pocketnow.com
this is the Samsung Galaxy s3 and this
is episode 7 of after the buzz
the next big thing is here Samsung's
marketing tagline kicking off the launch
of the Galaxy s3 was bombastic but quite
accurate you can still see the banners
and commercials everywhere you look so
it's tempting to say that the Galaxy s3
isn't yet ready for and after the buzz
segment but it launched longer ago than
you think 29 May 2012 which means it'll
soon be creeping up on middle age for a
flagship Android smartphone the galaxy
s3 sold more than 20 million units in
its first 100 days of availability
smashing records and flooding the globe
with the biggest non phablet smartphone
ever so how's it holding up so far well
let's check the hardware of my Verizon
branded Samsung Galaxy s3 to see how its
held up under a few months worth of
daily use in short pretty well honestly
better than I anticipated
you'll recall I've never been a huge fan
of samsung's design direction with the
galaxy s3 and at emphasis on lightweight
and glossy flimsy material if you're
like me and you don't like protective
cases the Galaxy s3 is build quality
might have given you pause when you
first took the device out of the box no
matter how strong the Gorilla Glass up
front or the polycarbonate around back
fortunately the device has held up much
better than I expected
the plastic you feel is annoying on
humid days and the hyper glaze coating
on the battery door shows more than its
fair share of scratches even despite
careful handling but the white coloring
on my unit covers up those pretty well
from a distance also that same glossy
coat has prevented the white
polycarbonate from staining or color
transfer from jeans or other sources
from far enough away the unit looks a
lot like it did when it first came out
of the box I still don't like the
physical home button which forces me to
interrupt my tap swipe and flick
interaction so I can mash a big key with
my thumb it's clumsy and stupid a
departure from the new UX principles
that ICS tried to introduce also the
capacitive keys flanking it are
invisible when not illuminated and their
position close to the edge of the device
makes them very easy to activate
accidentally especially when you're
passing the phone to someone to take a
picture it's annoying
touching on one last positive bit of the
hardware experience though the device
spends most of its out-of-pocket time
resting on the protruding camera module
the lens isn't scratched in the
slightest which was a welcome surprise I
still wouldn't trust the galaxy s3s
build enough to put it through any
significant physical stress but for
daily use in its caseless naked state
the galaxy s3 holds up well oh and PS
we've never fallen out of love with its
big bright notification LED either but
as we know hardware isn't the only thing
that degrades over time in the world of
smartphones like many galaxy s3 users
I'm still stuck running Android 4.0.4
Ice Cream Sandwich how does that hold up
in a world increasingly dominated by
jelly beans not as bad as you might
think
sure a few days with the Galaxy Note 2
got me used to the enhanced
notifications and Google now support
baked into androids latest but as I
mentioned in that review I didn't really
feel the performance enhancements of
project butter because the UI is already
so smooth on the galaxy s3 running
Android 4.4 Samsung worked some real
magic with the nature UX iteration of
TouchWiz transforming the much-maligned
Android skin from a laggy mess to a real
value add useful elements like the
toggle bar in the notification shade the
information dense widgets and extensive
customization options have all served to
make the Android experience more
convenient my devices app launcher shows
that I've downloaded 49 apps that camera
tells me I've got close to 700 pictures
onboard and there's over 2,000 songs
loaded into memory that's on a removable
32 gigabyte card and even taking
read/write times into account the device
is still snappy as anything sure it bogs
down at times no device is perfect
Chrome in particular seems to strain the
s GS threes resources at times and it's
possible to get some UI lag going if you
have a busy widget menu also a lot of
the fancy Samsung software
customizations don't serve much use
once you get past the novelty stage
particularly s-voice which is still just
awful but other features like smart stay
continued to prove their worth and the
phone's core features continue to shine
even under the fine layer of dust that's
gathered since launch the camera is
still one of the best smartphone
shooters out there battery life is still
better than many similarly spec devices
on the market and it even makes phone
calls pretty well if you're into that
kind of thing part of the reason we
started the after the buzz series is
because over time smartphone devices
tend to bog down their real errors don't
float to the surface until after weeks
or months of use on Android that
sometimes tends to mean a lag year
experience with jittery UI performance
and general grumpiness until it's no
longer the Droid you're looking for that
hasn't happened on the galaxy s3 but
granted this is the US version with
different processor and RAM loadout than
the global variants and other models and
we have no idea what's going to happen
when the next few iterations of Android
make their way to this device but
considering the Polish Samsung's brought
with this model the massive ad blitz
surrounding it and it's impressive sales
numbers thus far sgs3 owners now
constitute a hugely important sector of
Samsung's customer base and the company
is probably going to do all it can to
support this halo device for quite a
while maybe more so than other flagship
devices from other companies which
haven't enjoyed the same media exposure
more than four months post-launch if we
were a financial firm we'd still give
the Samsung Galaxy s3 a strong buy
