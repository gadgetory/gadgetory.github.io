interaction with the user interface
motor whirs of the ipad proclaim a
launch date and order details the pebble
time steel is just a few weeks away I'm
hi I'm Adam iveta officially claiming
that if it were up to me you would all
have today off including me obviously
this is walking out daily official news
today start with Microsoft the company
that's not everyone's cup of tea lately
the company obviously is under fire with
the future of the Lumia lineup and the
company's Terry Myerson just came on
record to confirm that we can expect
high-end lumias coming soon and the
speculation claims that it could happen
at Aoife and that we could probably see
a launch happening on September 24 so
set your clocks let's see if that's true
and for those of you that are still on
the ropes about the pebble time well the
pebble time steel is apparently just a
couple of weeks away the company has
just confirmed that it will try to give
up backers of the pebble time steal
their unit as soon as the the last week
of july or early august and they want to
finish with backers that early for them
to be able to sell the rest of the units
to everybody else so tell us what you
think we consider a pebble time seal or
how about an apple time in my case I'd
go for the regular pebble steel now if
you remember a couple of weeks ago we
covered that with the launch of iOS 9 we
saw that there were new colors of iPods
in the works and we thought that the
news ended there but some sources that
we are still trying to confirm claim
that the new ipods are not just about
new colors it seems that the new ipod
touches bringing a 64-bit processor as
it seems that apple is not even ready to
make these products die even cooler is
that apparently these products will be
silently launched tomorrow so we'll
report back tomorrow and see what
happens and even though the iPad lineup
is on decline in addition to the rest of
the world of tablets lately it seems
that the Apple is still trying to give
us their larger 12.9 inch iPad pro or
iPad plus and if you're wondering when
this is going to happen it seems that it
will start selling in November so the
scepticism right now is if it will be
announced in November or announce in
October as it usually is and for us to
get the product sold in November
and it seems that apple will be cautious
with the amount of orders as Apple
usually does with new products let's see
if it sells in the end or if it revamps
the iPad lineup as Apple wants it to and
finally for the very interesting rumors
of the day it seems that google is
already working on a new version of
Android wear and we have leaked
screenshots finally a couple of changes
are coming first of all the way you
interact with your friends you have the
current the way you could tap a friend
on the Apple watch and send your
heartbeat seems that google is working
on something similar but better and in
addition to that it seems that it's also
working on more interactive watch faces
there's currently a walk around to do
this but Ghul wants to make this
something from the operating system so
now instead of going to look for cards
for weather information or your steps
this will now be part of the watch phase
which is really cool but it does lead me
to the question that they given the fact
that Android wear hasn't really sold
well what would you want android wear to
do for you like it in my case honestly I
would like to be able to make phone
calls with the watch or at least have
the watch respond to me via voice
because the current one way interaction
is sadly I don't know it feels our cake
but leave us a comment down below what
is your case and friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video was
filmed make sure you follow us on pine
out comment subscribe trach tube channel
