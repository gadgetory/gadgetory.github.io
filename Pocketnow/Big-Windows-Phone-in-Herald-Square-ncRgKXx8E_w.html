Oh
hello people of New York welcome to the
new windows phone let's start with
answering what would be our first
question why are we here we're here
because most smartphones somehow lost
their way the focus moved away from
connecting people by conversations we're
in a world where the devices people use
to communicate our position to hold more
importance than the people they actually
connect whether it's phones bragging
about being unhuman or simply living out
the dream of being an application
launcher these products are more about
themselves than their users is it
possible for phones to be narcissistic
those are as we launch this newest
version of Windows Phone we present to
the world something different windows
phone connects people not devices it's
living breathing design means your
relationships take priority over apps
and icons
our first again of course our thumbs are
loaded with the most popular apps
blazing browser speed and some of the
most advanced search and find technology
on the planet they let us get facebook
or twitter updates on friends post on
their wall check-in post and see photos
or even start a chat all with no app
required all those features are built in
to keep us closer to the people we care
about today we are here to announce the
availability of the samsung focus s and
samsung focus / at AT&amp;amp;T along with the
HTC radar 4g at t-mobile well simply
windows phone puts people back at the
center of the smartphone experience let
us show you what we need
you're comfy jungle where dreams are
made of there's nothing you can't do

now I'm down to heaven square right next
to the macy's but I'm little forever I'm
got a new windows phone is it sound made
in here I can make it anywhere yeah
there's nothing everywhere I just took
all in harlem on the mother minute
cuddle right the rubber broadway riding
back your mommy darla to get to the hot
spot by this great tree that's me in the
kitchen like a river in the pastry Oh
and it gives like a giddy about my city
I could use a real taste of New York
who's up for a slice of pizza oh wait
wait wait let me try there one more time
who's up to us like a pizza
famous ray's original eater
let's get some eats out here
man
and the stars
used to like us

just license away

here Wednesday please please go

with a little music what do you say with
a built-in zune music experience and

Phone music and video hub ensures your
favorite tunes are never more than exit
