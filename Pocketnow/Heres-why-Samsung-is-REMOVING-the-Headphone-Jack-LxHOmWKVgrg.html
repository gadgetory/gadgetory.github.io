1000 us why the company is removing the
headphone jack the Zeus ROG phone 2 was
just released and let's just say even
flagships to set it up and let's talk
about that Google pixel 4 and pixel for
Excel is some leaks of a possible design
make it not look that ugly I'm Jaime
Ravenna and well there was a heat wave
here in New York I'm back here and now
we have flash floods warnings and it's
raining this is pocket a daily the
official news today begin with deals
starting with the MacBook Air last
generation but I mean the new design
only last year's model currently on
Amazon it's for 950 bucks the
entry-level model I highly recommend you
consider the higher tier which is also
available on Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H with some
tax benefits think about it is for 1099
you're getting 256 gigs of storage and
sure I know the butter fried keyboard is
not the best one of the enhancements
with the new one is the better keyboard
mechanism so it's a good deal but you
might want to think I don't know you can
learn more in the description if you
think about it now let's talk about
Huawei and the company releasing new
phones particularly we're expecting to
make thirty in May 30 Pro later this
year but now we get to see them 830
lightly usually that make 30 variants
always launches before the rest it will
apparently launch first in China as the
Nova 5i Pro it has a twenty five
megapixel punch hole selfie camera and
four cameras squared at the back six
point two six inch display a forty eight
megapixel primary camera that's
complemented by an eight megapixel and
also a two megapixel sensor we also get
the Karen 810 mid-range processor in
addition to a 3900 milliamp hour battery
and it's rather interesting the company
is sticking to the design of the mate
20 pro for this we'll see why now let's
talk about Apple and what it will do
with future generation iPhones obviously
we're already talking about this year's
but IC universe has got some interesting
leaks that the company is already
talking with LG and Samsung for them to
provide ohlet's that are capable of
going between 60 and 120 Hertz in a
variable way
and this is rather interesting as
apparently this is going to be one of
the key features for the most expensive
iPhone and not for the rest of them so
it seems that Apple is playing around
with other benefits we'll keep you
posted now let's move the spotlight over
to the Google pixel for in pixel for
excel for some of the ugliest phones but
for certain leaks not necessarily that
much let's start with specs apparently
both devices will finally bring six six
of RAM in addition to 128 gigs of
storage or at least on one of the
variants the pixel forest resolution on
the display will be of 2280 by 1080 then
the four XL will have a 30 40 by 1440
display which is a step up from the
three of the three excel we expect them
both to be powered by the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 855 plus and we also finally
see renders provided by on leaks that
don't make this phone look ugly at all
I'm wondering if this is probably just
one of three companies it's providing
designs but we see the designs of the
cameras at the back of the
time-of-flight sensor and then notice
the chassis I mean if it's gonna be that
curvy all around the phone actually does
not look bad at all I'm hoping that they
launched that color option as well
though we're not exactly sure again if
this is gonna be the final design or not
we will also provide you more
information as soon as we learn now
today we have two sets of hot news and
I'm actually going to leave the best
first instead of the best last I know
that a lot of people are not necessarily
fans of a soos and there are og phones
but my god the company has just
announced their newest variant today
they are the ROG phone - and my god
those specifications will give any
flagship a run for its money first of
all it packs the new Qualcomm Snapdragon
855 plus 12 gigs of ram a whopping
listen to this six thousand milliamp
hour battery 512 gigs of storage a 3d
vapor chamber cooling system and in a
hundred and twenty Hertz OLED display it
has a bunch of accessories like a fan
for cooling a narrow case and a gamepad
to make it look like a Nintendo switch
or you know the black shark phone and we
still don't have a price point we don't
have a launch date but my god those
specification
the company is aggressive about the
price I'm actually starting liking this
a soos ROG I'm hopefully gonna get one
soon the soos yes thank you you need my
shipping address and finally the other
hot news that I have to do with Samsung
and it's Galaxy Note 10 and note 10 plus
or pro where ever it's gonna be called
obviously one of the biggest complaints
is the fact that apparently the phone's
gonna lose the headphone jack but as we
get more information on specs we seem to
have a reason why they're ditching it
apparently the smaller Full HD plus
variant has a 6.3 inch display and the
three 500 milliamp hour battery which if
you look at the footprint of the phone
yeah you kind of need space for the
s-pen and so therefore that's where the
headphone jack is going the quad HD plus
variant has a six point seven five inch
display that'll bring a forty three
hundred million power battery twelve
gigs of ram and 256 gigs of storage we
also hear that the s-pen will bring
enhancements like a new air feature that
bring scrolling through images without
touching the display as well as a marker
sound when taking notes to get a sense
of realism so that kind of was a feature
I think for the Galaxy Note 5 not
exactly sure there there was an option
which was terrible definitely a gimmick
but anyways in today's question actually
two one opinions on the isuzu ROG phone
and two what do you think do you think
that a slightly larger battery is a good
reason to the headphone jack because in
my case I mean if we're getting a more
efficient snapdragon 855 I think that we
should still get the headphone jack and
but that's just me leave us a comment
down below we love to know your opinion
