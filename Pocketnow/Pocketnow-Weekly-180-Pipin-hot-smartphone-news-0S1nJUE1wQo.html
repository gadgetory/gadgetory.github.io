for you watchers do help join in we're
going to need your help to get this
through without having our own voices
you know drown everything out this
monotony of will be entertaining Who am
I kidding there's a couple ways we want
you to contribute to the bakken that
would be podcast and you can do either
of them if you're watching us live in
Google Hangouts we'd love you to hop on
over to the Q&amp;amp;A panel which I'm going to
try to figure out how to use you know
Michael is usually the one handling this
and it yet something we're talking about
on the air that you would like to hear
more about enter your question in there
or comment or you know whatever you say
hi other reviewers will vote up their
favorites we'll do our best to answer
some of the most popular ones on the air
or just the ones most germane to the
conversation we're having if you're
listening to this later or if you just
have something sort of more long-form
but you spit on point you can shoot us
an email podcast at pocketnow.com we're
going to be answering a couple of those
listener marrows later on in the program
that if you send this one will do our
best to get to it on a future episode of
the show how do we get into the
interface jules that's a good question
here the Hangout QA for me it's a
convenient little thing over on the side
here i move my mouse over to the left
there's a little messaging style window
that says Q&amp;amp;A that's the letters with an
ampersand between them I said it's
similar in your stream viewers if it's
not I would I would love to hear so I
know exactly what to tell y'all to look
for other YouTube browsers a pop up
Jules hell does a pop up to look for in
youtube if you're watching us there
but hopefully we will hear from you guys
I'm going to pop over now to see if
anyone's there already mmm yes yes merry
Christmas from the Netherlands oh thank
you she got to jolly I'm already
murdering name this is going to be a
good i'm gonna go to ja ja ja okay a
nice long episode with ya when i
butchered names throughout yes uh for
it's only been what three business days
since we last brought you the pocket now
weekly uh so going into this I was
worried you would not have enough to
tell you about but I am surprised
there's a lot going on here some
mentioned in the intro let's dive right
into it we don't have a ton of time so
and there's a lot to talk about we've
got oodles noodles of news yes let's
start this weekly news trainer rollin
with Android here and no speaking of
Chicago and Adam here uh Motorola has
some new weeks out they don't have them
out but they got out anyway well we're
taking a look at what we've heard is the
next-gen moto x ah it we're tempted to
call the Moto X I don't know if it'll be
play pure edition special sport whatever
it's going to be but the next go to X we
hardly saw a leak of it like a week or
so back I thought that was kind of
weird-looking we talked about this in
the previous podcast Adam you see this
leak when it first came out and see the
link when it first came out and clicking
to it frantically as we speak it was a
weird-looking guy uh it had a big old
circle on the back i I thought it was
hacked together you know maybe it's a
composite of shots of it's a frankan
phone and had these weird really
prominent a little speaker grills
presumably speaker grill holes but
little holes on the back of it just
didn't look right had this like Lumia 8
30ish Oreo thing on there hey it seemed
wrong it seemed weird it seemed fake and
now we're kind of thinking maybe not cuz
this new leak out this time it's an
internal shot it shows us some of the
the spacers on the back of the phone
where come on as well go there's no
circuit board just yet but there's this
big ol heat pipe in there yeah it's got
plumbing yeah not liquid
cooling even though it's a pipe i guess
it is their liquid in this some sort of
thermal compound designed to channel
heat away from the super hot parts the
soc and move them to areas of the phone
work and dissipate safely grant it still
into your hand you can't get the phone
the heat away from the phone still in
there somewhere but you know spread
things out there's not like one super
hot spot that really gets annoying there
man i just found that we can get oh wow
alright um good luck with that moto
alright and i would have thought that
this isn't a real but now look closely
at this newly care for the heat pipe and
you see over on the right we still have
this grid of was it 16 little holes
there and crisis i look closely they
don't even seem like they're spaced
evenly it's weird-looking there's no
obvious speaker there yet I can sort of
see where one might fit but and the
commenters had a field day with us
talking about it might be like
ventilation holes for the the heat pipe
system I I don't see exactly how that
would work but it's an idea there get
something it's so nothing an idea yes
just gonna get stuck in there right yeah
yeah yeah and you know what else I'm
learning is that continuum is not going
to make a very good podcast companion so
we're going to abandon that particular
ship and move on subtitle of this
podcast should have been like failures
of Windows 10 it's when the song
specifically we're gonna get to that a
little bit later but continuum gia
playing nicely for you know got to it
and I'm 50 or the XL or the 950 uncle so
and I'm trying to go from like you're
like oh but looking at this other page
with the with the pipe I'm like clicking
the back button no no clicking the back
button nothing's happening why would it
be responsive we don't need that in
computer well i actually i'll talk about
that in editorial today alert but anyway
before we move too far away from that
we've heard the new Moto X could have a
Snapdragon 820 in there certainly the
highest end of the 2016 Snapdragon
lineup but hopefully we've heard it
shouldn't be nearly as thermally
problematic as the 810 was so it seems a
little weird and why are we getting a
heat pipe on this but I think that like
I said
a little earlier I think there's a good
reason for this even if it's not running
super hot like the phone wouldn't
function without it it still can make it
a little bit more comfortable to hold
you're doing a high intensity gaming or
what not really pushing it to its limits
this just it keeps it from getting that
one little hot point that's burning your
fingers oh and also one commenter
pointed out I didn't notice this when
initially posting this but there's these
little seals it looks like around a lot
of the student where components will go
maybe looking at some nice waterproofing
on this guy yeah that would be awesome
Shay a lot to look forward to continuing
on an Android here Adam what if you tell
us about this have you seen this google
next-gen messaging thing um I have I'm
still trying to figure out what it's for
but definite damn good question so a
wall street journal published this I
think yesterday and I read this the
story you know once or twice through and
it seemed like I don't know a joke a
goof I double check to make sure it
wasn't backdated to April first but it's
weird sounding that's what we're talking
about here is a google hangout
supposedly remain even hang out but
Google could be working on a next gen
messaging app and the big hook to this
thing is supposed to be artificial
intelligence powered chat BOTS like
robots you talk to you know I'm not
granite other messaging systems have had
their own interactive botsa various
forms here and we've been heard about
facebook prepping something like this
for messenger where you could like ask
it questions and we didn't know you
would try to answer them itself didn't
know it pass it off to a live human
operator who give you your answers but
supposedly Google's looking to have some
sort it sounds like taking google search
like the voice powered google now stuff
wrapping this up into it's going to be
all text based or maybe voice but
putting this into a messaging system so
you like text it hey find me a nice
place to eat around here and you'll get
a message back saying okay here are some
restaurants in your area but isn't what
Google's for I mean look I don't get it
does that I mean don't get me wrong
messenger apps SMS apps on Android or
kind of like Twitter apps on webos
there's a crapload of them and they all
have their
and minuses so I mean I can kind of see
that this is a this is a an area that
Google has left largely on the dress but
I don't think chat bots are really going
to be the answer unless of course it's
there for lonely people oh you know what
I get from them I mean it's not supposed
to be like you know supposed to a
touring testing we're it's trying to
prove it's a real person it's like it
reminds me of men I don't see the point
yeah so is it's a good question what is
the point of this it's being presented
as a way to draw users into this
messaging system because right now even
though hangouts is baked into Android it
has a lot of competition from
third-party things especially facebook
Messenger and whatsapp stuff like that
and Google needs some you know big draw
to get people to use its service because
unless your friends are on there you're
not going to use it unless there's some
really well feature in there you're not
going to use it so it's I guess it's
supposed to be if you go there for your
searches maybe you'll stay there and
talk to your friends yeah or maybe if
you're always on there chatting with
your friends you just want a quick way
to bang off a quick search I don't know
I I don't see it but I guess maybe if
they made like a core feature of android
wear this is messaging was built in so
instead of having you know your google
search bar something it was persistent
like chat thing ah but it reminds me of
remember old look at the name of the
service used to be something where you
would send a text message to it with any
question and they would fire back with
an answer I mean it's usually what we do
now with a couple of those too yeah
sounds like sort of the next-gen version
of that only a I driven there's talk
about Google may be opening us up to
third-party developers and having them
make their own chat bots which would be
I guess specific to certain tasik maybe
a video game developer could have
something where you have a you're trying
to get through a level instead of
calling the nintendo pro tips line flash
back to you 90s they're running up your
1 900 numbers you'll just like text
nintendo chat bot it would tell you how
to kill all your friends and super smash
brothers Oh in super smash brothers ok I
hope you were going to finish that
sentence so no don't don't kill your
friends just over
a video game that's got you in trouble
there so I think we can wrap this one up
as a we don't get it yeah there's no
word of a timeline here when Google
might be hoping to do this I i would
really curious to see where this is
coming from yeah I have a feeling the
reporter like might have heard some real
tidbit of information that Google is
actually working on something here and
we just don't have the full picture
because clearly Adam and I seem to be
agreement here this just sounds weird
don't eat it peaking of things Google's
up do this one seems a lot more
plausible sort of a next-gen two-factor
authentication appears to be in testing
now there's been reports from users on
reddit who have got invited to try this
out a system that uses your smartphone
to authenticate you for Google logins
across the ecosystem across phones
tablets your PC the weights appears to
work is you get it set up on your phone
has to be presumably only works with
certain phone just mention of compatible
models we don't have a complete list but
presumably a recent model you know
lollipop or marshmallow needs to have as
the secure lock screen in place so just
like android pay in that regard but once
you're authenticated on your phone this
sort of works as the length of the hub
of which you authenticate and other
devices so you go to a computer go on
your laptop or something even a friend's
laptop but liking for the first time
type in your email there it wouldn't
even ask you for a password on the
device instead it will just give you a
notification on your phone hey someone's
trying to log into your account on so
and so do you want to authenticate this
and you did yes you know and go from
there up do you think it sounds good
idea Adam I might be off here but I
think Microsoft actually has a very
similar system place but Microsoft uses
it as a risk factor and to God as a
two-factor authentication where instead
of sending a text message it'll send you
you know and that you know to a
notification into an appt saying you
know is this legit so I guess my google
is just trying to remove the password
from it which seems less secure to me I
don't know I kind of think more secure
like I'm thinking what if you're like a
public computer maybe you don't know if
there's like a keylogger and the
keyboard or something you know yeah
across the machine you want to be using
it temporarily this allows you to
authenticate without giving any
of that secure information to the
possibly untrusted machine I suppose but
the point of two factor authentication
is to stop that in to begin with if they
have their username and password who
cares they still don't get the code so
oh yeah but I'm also wondering what
happens if I'm you know at work and I
leave my phone on my coat pocket and I
try to login and I don't have my phone
with me so well has thought of this in
the system currently and testing it
advises users that you can always enter
your password in it's a backup if say
you know exactly you don't have your
phone there's maybe no reception your
battery died have other options to kind
of like a fail-safe but then again I'm
wondering does this make this less
secure you always hear about people
getting hacked not by someone figuring
out their password but by figuring out
their security questions you know it's
easy that what about clone phones to my
wonder saving him it anymore I don't
know well they do in the movies back in
it Oh or something yeah it's in testing
now I'll hopefully we'll hear more about
this as Google rolls it out to more and
more users uh I think it's a neat idea I
question exactly when people would use
it but especially if you're if you need
your on-the-go a lot you know
necessarily have access your own
computer all the time but you do have
your phone on you this might be
something worth checking out it's the
type of thing where it needs to be
bulletproof but if it is then aid
nothing wrong with it and this is
exactly why I Google's requiring up
Bowman secure lock screen there I kind
of like the idea especially if you have
up on the fingerprint scanner this sort
of ties your google login to your
fingerprint rather than a password at
all sure one hundred percent agree on so
biometrics are fun fun fun they are do
you have anything with biometrics on it
yet ah fingerprint scan or anything like
that no no okay I get no no my laptop my
laptop does and I do use that for login
on that really so you're the one okay
yeah it's really not graceful but right
especially because of windows boots up
and those does like five second lag
before the the fingerprint software
loads and I'm swipe swipe swipe swipe
now it's not good yeah so let's keep
this google trainer role in here uh
we've been talking so much about sales
over
past few weeks Black Friday Cyber Monday
and then just week after week of getting
your last minute holiday shopping done a
lot of hardware deals there we talked
about a bunch of them last week in the
podcast this week we're not talking so
much about hardware deals as software
stuff and Google's year-end holiday sale
has come to the Play Store there's a lot
of stuff going on there some of it not
great deal some of them better have you
looked at any of these Adam I need to
browse through that's actually probably
on my list for tomorrow there's a lot I
think we've got a half off albums on
google play music that uh seventy-five
percent off video rentals a bunch of
apps on sale and some good stuff I
probably would pick up if I didn't have
already Monument Valley is stupid cheap
a lot of them are like ten cents or just
a dollar minecraft story mode you're
looking into get into that action that
the sales on news newsstand
subscriptions some books on say a lot of
stuff check it out loud go to google
play on your pc phone tablet whatever
and check some of those out will not
last long you probably have least at the
end of the year to take advantage of
those um let's talk a little bit about
hardware what is not an android spectrum
here for some reason phablets are big
all of a sudden and no pun intended
there we got a couple new ones that just
launched ZTE with its axon max 6 inch
full HD big old battery 4140 milliamp
hours solid mid-ranger qualcomm
snapdragon 617 processor some big 16 and
13 megapixel cameras at a price that's
not the cheapest thing around but pretty
good for what it looks like you get the
equivalent of around 4 30 for the
chinese market here we haven't heard
anything about this guy come into the
west yet though but CES is just around
the corner nzd you could certainly bring
the sky around show it off a little more
get some buzz going yeah so hopefully
we'll be hearing more about this guy I
think maybe the more interesting of the
fabula is we just saw literally just
happened samsung and the galaxy a 9 yes
rumors have been
this guy coming up for a while now and I
had to double-check this because Samsung
just released a bunch of new galaxy a
series phones a new a three a five a
seven confusingly the 2016 and that 2015
on already got those the beginning of
the year we did not have a first gen a
nine I think is the first one first time
this phone has ever come out with this
name and it's a pretty solid looking
piece of kit again it's a lot like this
ZTE it's got the six inch full HD
display this one's an OLED processors of
the beefier there it's got that new
Snapdragon 650 to previously the 620
which is pretty solid octa-core 64-bit
new Adreno a GPU on there we don't know
a lot about where Samson tending to send
this guy yet presumably like the other
galaxies A's it's focused not so much on
the US market as it is markets in the
east but we know because introduced it
in China and hopefully what we hearing
more about this guy in the weeks to come
you know it's interesting because you
know both of these phones have the you
know the 6-inch 1080p panel and the the
Snapdragon 6xx yeah processor and you
know 13 ish megapixel camera I think on
both oh it's just none of these are
really screaming mid-range specs to me
except for the processor I'm just kind
of wondering where our criteria is when
ATP isn't mid-range these days well I
mean maybe it is but then you get in
back into that question of you know how
much screen resolution do we really need
I'm just ya know I'm just wondering
these you don't look so bad for with
Rangers actually no absolutely not and I
think a lot of users have been now
moving away from the flagship phones and
to the mid Rangers sure you can spend a
couple hundred dollars more and get this
really premium polished model but if you
can save that much money and the phone
you get it's no longer about making
compromises it's you're getting hardware
that's maybe I even last year's but like
six months old is now considered the
mid-range I only wish for your mind I
only wish I'd seen this story come out a
little bit sooner because then I could
have trolled cliff Thomas by telling him
he'd get a galaxy a 9 before he get his
HTC One 89 Jules mentions a blue one x
2016 1080p 150 bucks that's friggin nuts
cheese and a lot of these guys at CES
I'm sure the flagships might hold off
for a little later in the year I'm
expecting a ton of of super high-end
action but me rings galore yeah but
neither of them have a 5000 milliamp
hour battery so it's still pretty good
uh yeah the a mines got 4,000 which is
nothing to shake a stick at I mean even
with a big screen I'll get you through a
day no problemo I'm hoping I'm gonna be
carrying the the blue energy to add at
CES just because of the 5000 milliamp
hour battery oh I'm just gonna carry a
car battery strapped on my back with the
younger it has nothing to go from there
there you go the lines get too big I'm
just at a cattle prod and shock my way
to the front it'll be a little
spectacular I like it I'll ask for a new
strategy before we wrap up android here
once it touch in with ooh one of my
favorite developments in smartphones
modular technology it sucks that you
can't fix your smartphone without having
you know tiny tiny hands and a giant
magnifying glass and where you're going
to be destroying the thing even worse in
the process here most of us we take our
phones well actually most of us probably
didn't get them thick we break our phone
we get rid of it we move on to the next
newer model but fairphone thinks that's
not the best way to be doing things it
launched its fairphone 2 earlier this
year with the idea that it can help
reduce electronic waste by making the
phone built out of modular components it
isn't so much like project ara we're
supposed to customize things but instead
it allows you to replace bits as they go
bad so then we always like seeing a
phone with the external or removable
battery because not only does allow you
to swap out the battery without waiting
for the phone to fully charge just pop a
new fresh one in there but over time
batteries their chemical things they
lose their capacity so it's very nice to
be able to you know a year down the line
switch it out for a brand new running at
the top of its game component or even a
bigger battery in some cases or yeah
even a bigger but I love those
ridiculous ones that make the phone
three times as thick and a 15,000
milliamp hours why not yeah oh it's just
preaching to the choir yeah fairphone 2
it's now shipping to its initial backers
it's a bit expensive for what you get
I'm just talking about what makes a
phone
the sky is looking at 1080p display two
gigs of ram snapdragon 801 just like the
the oneplus X which is it is an older
processor it's still pumping along and
you probably unless you're using your
very again we could pushing talking
about gaming like in the pipe on the
Moto X unless you're really running high
on stuff like that and 801 will probably
get you by just fine but it's a lot for
what other asking a lot for what you're
getting there this guy's going for or 0
5 530 euros please its flagship level
pricing there but again this is a phone
you're sort of paying for the warm fuzzy
feeling it gives you not only is it are
these components replaceable so that
you're not making electronic waste but
the components themselves or ethically
sourced all the capacitors these guys
are going all out down to Africa getting
their 10th album from of Mines that
don't exploit labor or they don't you
know Percy environment so you pay a
little more but you can sleep at night
so that's very close to six hundred
dollars ussg I don't know but I think we
move on to other platforms here I'm
gonna take a look in here QA see
anything a nice going on here Oh see
Windows 10 fan do you plan the upgrade
the pocket net web site you a more
modern 2016 look um I'm not sure exactly
what I'm supposed to be talking about
here but i will say stay tuned is all
i'm willing to offer there I think
wheels are in motion you will be
pleasantly surprised and what you're
talking about its modern looking I know
I really like the bucket now layout but
i think i just hate change hmm uh that a
dumb windows 10th it also was no Buller
will we be making a pocket now mobile
app um I'd like the first point out our
pocket now mobile web site is optimized
for smartphone viewing ah i prefer the
desktop you want smartphones though i
may be in the outside there but no i did
not believe we have a standalone mobile
app and the works right now but again i
don't want to say too much about any
redesign plans but i would I don't think
you'd be wrong if presuming that would
extend to the mobile side as well so
again stay tuned well you know we were
thinking about it but then we'd have to
make a blackberry one
so we just decided I car out to be
discriminating because I want to make a
blackberry yeah we are an equal
opportunity website so you know we have
to make simply in webos and yeah just
did rabbit hole you know anyway sorry go
ahead jobs see Jamal ask where's Mikey
Mike I know he's doing is holiday thing
like everybody else in the world here
and adam and i will be doing shortly
jewels as well but we're doing things a
little early trying to put aside the end
of the week for our our special time
with our loved ones let's be honest he's
just gotten lazy ever since you found
out but Stephen and I can do this he's
just need a serious mean why bother when
were you know hitting every point like
we are an ounce I know uh alvin tsui
asks do you think we'll see 256
gigabytes of internal storage in devices
in the future god I wish we would uh I
am probably the biggest proponent of
Clifton is asking a question oh sorry
Jules you're distracting me yes we will
get to that uh we haven't seen as many
high storage devices out now as I would
like to considering all the other places
that components have been pushing limits
screen resolution is probably the best
there we've been sort of hanging behind
an internal storage I think it's a
disservice certainly I am I love having
all the me I want on my phone straight
away not having to rely on you know this
the cloud or streaming services I just
popped a 64 gigabyte microSD card and my
brands new 1 plus X I can't wait till I
get a hundred twenty eight gigabyte one
because 64 gigs it's not enough storage
for a boy like me 256 awesome but I
actually I agree with that and then
actually kinda makes me jot down an
editorial idea for Tony what is up with
that I mean everything else is getting
better and better and better you don't
got more RAM we've got more power we got
more battery we've got it what what is a
internal storage the sad thing is I deal
with internal sorry sir the sad thing is
I get it because most users do not have
this need they certainly don't want a
phone that's like eight gigabytes with
only two gigabytes free when you get it
but
the 16 especially the 32 gig space
that's more than enough for installing
your basic apps maybe even a big one or
two maybe even having some media on
there a couple albums and for most users
I'm i feel like this satisfies their
needs that their direction need 64 or
128 are the exceptions not the rules uh
I'm gonna say I'm gonna say Windows
Phone brings 256 gigabytes first that's
not a bad idea especially people using
continuing um that's right that's tough
placement there that's the money right
there that's going to be that's going to
happen you can write it down december
twenty third i said that yeah but
certainly the flash chip components are
out there they're not physically that
much bigger than the 1628 gigabyte ones
it's just a matter of demand I don't
think it's there just yet and
manufactures I've gotten used to be able
to charging a premium for these
certainly it costs a lot more to move
from a 64 128 gigabyte phone as it does
compared to like going from a 64
gigabyte hundred twenty gigabyte microSD
card right though they kind of realized
if we had these big ass storage on
phones we would have to or we would be
able to charge a lot more consumers
would expect it and maybe that's not
very tenable so let's pick one more
Clifton have a question here you'll once
out uh what are we asking Santa for
Christmas Adam why don't you start here
um this year I am asking specifically
for amazon gift cards because the only
thing i want is here i know but the only
thing i want for christmas is like a
seven hundred dollar camera so i don't
see any of my family getting that for me
so that's for not what I'm asking for
but if you're asking like of what
devices are out there right now that I
would want it that I would want to ask
for I would go and this is probably in
the same realm of realistic expectations
of the camera but I would probably go
with uh with a pixel tablet this just
because the Nexus 9 man so with with
with marshmallow is no Gouda you don't
like no it's awful the marshmallow
killed my
nexus 9 songs with it waking it up to 60
then again you never use a lock screen
so maybe that's like a condiment but I
mean it's like I will wake up my tablet
I will draw my pattern for to wake up
the tablet and it will sit there for a
minute until it times out again and
turns off again and I'll turn it back on
and says oh you need to put in your
pattern it's just nerve so no I
definitely i used to have problems with
the the double tap to wake i think i had
them more with lollipop marshmallow
seems to be pretty good with not dying
on me now that beside i did get an
update recently which helped clear up
some stuff but anyway pixel is really
nice Oh although hmm alright so think on
that a little um you got ya not geez I
don't really want anything for Christmas
and that hardware wise i'm pretty set
now but i can't say amazon gift cards
but you can say i don't want anything
dad don't I want to I want to get
through CES with my sanity intact their
health uh everyone tells me I'm gonna
get super sick I think I have a very
strong constitution I'm always like low
level 60 stops you from getting super
sick but I'm very interesting what
wonderful bugs i pick up so yeah happy
and healthy new years what I want that's
a lame i know that's not we have been
doing these q and A's for a while now we
are running short on time have to hop
back into news here yeah there's not
that uh because we have a lot more to
discuss uh let's head the shift gears
over to microsoft land here and talk
windows 10 mobile which man has think is
taking a beating lately and my
commenters have been pointing out they
seem to think that we're really hating
on windows 10 mobile here we don't hate
it we're just kind of disappointed we're
not hating it we're just we just took
off the rose-colored glasses I mean it's
Windows 10 windows 10 mobile
specifically is a beta test I mean it
really is i mean there's it's so buggy
and there's just so much that's just man
um you just I ran over Adam lanes review
and we collaborated on a very little bit
over the weekend and he and I were on
the same page with every single point
it's just it's buggy it's it doesn't it
doesn't behave in a way that you would
expect some of the settings are still a
mess I mean I still don't know where NFC
is or not turn on I always search for it
and it always says well here's NFC and
so then I say okay great but where is it
so i don't have to search for it the
next time it never tells me it doesn't
do little things that other yeah it's
frustrating because it is hard all the
big announcements back in the early part
of the year it seemed to have so much
promise Microsoft if I be seemeth
company got what it needed to do not
just on desktop and mobile individually
but as this cohesive vision for how
products would work across device form
factors sounded really great and
certainly we saw the company testing
things as early as it did it
unprecedented level to which it's
bringing users on to try things out
early not just on the desktop but also
on mobile we've had the insider program
for windows immobile going since like
februari I think all this time you think
would be enough to work out these little
issues but no there's just this glitch
is throughout and very frustrating I
mean to be fair they're doing a lot new
here this is kind of a big undertaking
but Microsoft it's still a giant in the
industry yeah but it's it's hard to see
it stumble like this but one of the big
st. big things that has going and going
for it is you know the community of fans
that are around it yes this is our which
is and you know Michael had a wonderful
piece that he wrote about about this you
know talking about the fan base of
Windows and how sometimes they can be
local to vocal to their detriment but in
general the windows community is
actually really fantastic it's it's it's
almost up to a level of webos that's the
high bar that's that's by high bar so um
but yeah windows the windows community
is really super helpful with trying to
you know get things figured out like I
was you know I've been tweeting about
the Lumia 950 for you know
few weeks now and every time I run into
you know a roadblock I'll get you know
five or six people yeah Chinese nice
even though there are all these problems
out there there are users who have been
running into this as well they can offer
you some advice on maybe how they found
workarounds until microsoft works all
the kinks itself right which is great
and so is it is one of the one of the
shining beacons of of being a windows 10
mobile fan yes having that much support
for for as much hate there is between
platforms as many fanboys as their art
their smartphones in general its work
phone users they're good people they're
willing to help you out when you want to
do a jam no indeed unless of course you
miss identify something in an article in
which case they will tear your face of
god no you don't do it desk i'll give up
all hope ye who enter here yeah anyway
um yeah so things are struggling over on
windows 10 mobile Jules tells me there's
an update wait there's nothing headed
out now that they were done with those
for the year well updates coming one way
or another sooner and or later
especially for the existing windows
phone models animagus one dark on us
there there we go oh yeah really uh yeah
windows 10 mobile updates for existing
Lumias pushed back till next year
hopefully by then I don't blame
microsoft word holding things back until
things are working as smooth as they
need to so keep the faith and keep
watching for what happens there over on
Android Microsoft is having its own
problems could start bringing Cortana
cross-platform earlier this year first
testing and Android than an iOS and a
few weeks back we had the you know the
full launches of Cortana for both
platforms and everyone loves hot word
support you can get start talking your
phone and it listens does what you want
it to when it works it's lovely but
Cortana it's not working so well and its
back it's working so unwell Microsoft
had just turned it off entirely used to
be able to say hey Cortana to your phone
we've you're on the home screen or thin
the app itself the only platform wide
stuff was with the other promised
cyanogen OS intergration which I'm not
sure we ever saw come out hadn't been
following that but Microsoft it was
causing problems with the microphone on
the phone in general like
users wouldn't be able to make phone
calls because Cortana had like locked
itself onto the microphone there so
until they can get that worked out
that's no longer functioning and Android
which is a big detriment I wonder how
many Android users were actually using
Cortana to begin with i'm downloading as
we speak yeah okay without Howard
support but still yeah yeah you can't
get everything and before we move away
from windows 10 so far we've only had
three windows 10 mobile models from
Microsoft launching the Lumia 950 950 XL
and the ones at 550 yeah but there's
supposedly been some more on the horizon
some of them we heard were getting
canceled some have been uncannily we've
been talking about looking forward to
the Lumia 650 for a while now now we
haven't seen much in the way of real
weeks of the hardware here but the guys
over a window central have got their
hands on especially some internal slides
showing off the phone for one reason or
another they weren't able to share the
original pics but they commissioned
these Oh lovely and I mean capital L
lovely renders of what this hardware is
supposed to look like man if it looks
half as good as these I think a lot of
Lumia 950 owners will be hitting
themselves in the foot I don't know how
idioms work but they'll be very upset
because this 650 it's a classy looking
phone nonsense we're gonna be happy for
the platform yeah and yeah that's that's
what's gonna happen nice metal trim on
this guy supposed to be positioned as a
fordable phone for business users and of
course we continuum and microsoft school
because an enterprise business will
continue to be a big focus of the
platform going forward I am really
excited for this guy we've been heard
you've heard that this phone may be
coming out in the next month or two
Microsoft may be looking to introduce it
sometime around mwc which isn't late
februari this year and like i said if
this looks half as good as these renders
make it out to be microsoft could have
something really special on its hands
here ok one more platform to talk about
we could talk about webos briefly did
you see this atom that webos is moving
to the three-point oh no what what no
be any good it's just for LG Smart TVs
but oh okay it's so it's nice to hear
that it's still living on in one form or
the other I don't know I guess cockles
of my heart yeah it's okay I mean it's
one of those things where you know maybe
the guts of it or webos but it's not
it's not the soul you know well the less
old man you used to be cool used to be
mobile what happened to you know then
they got all stuck up in those TVs
change is happening all across platforms
and one change becoming too well just
started coming to smartphones is
pressure sensitivity Apple had it forced
touch first started on the Apple watch
now 3d touch on the iPhones and we've
been seeing it who is the other guy who
did this it's a ZTE or Huawei sure Jules
will shout it out but word is that we're
about to see the sort of pressure
sensitivity start coming to every
smartphone normal everyone but a
substantial majority of smartphones
starting next year s companies you know
call them copycats or what you will but
integrating their own systems for
pressure-sensitive screens and if
presumably will start seeing more and
more apps taking advantage of these the
report we looked at said well one in for
smartphones launch next year may have
some degree of this functionality I've
yet to actually try this for myself I'm
not an iphone gummy in the phatom now I
have not so no success for me and it's
difficult for me to appreciate the
usefulness of it not having done this
myself but already I touch me
interactions a bit tricky how you have
this you know position and input are
tied into one you can't you point to
something on stream without also saying
I'm tapping on this so we've had like
long presses double taps all these
different ways to try to signal how
we're trying to interact with the phone
will this pressure sensitivity getting
us one more really improve things I
don't know I'm really curious to see how
they implement this yeah I mean it's one
of those things where it is forced touch
to me sounds a lot like long tapping but
at the same time it seems like it's a
little bit more useful than what you
typically typically get out of a long
so I definitely want to try it out so
maybe we can visibly yet Michael to
bring a success to CES so we can play
with it for understand how it's easier
to explain to new users I mixes all the
time on the podcast but I got my mom her
first smartphone a month a few months
back by now and it was very difficult
she never interacted with a touchscreen
device before it was very difficult to
explain to her how she should be
pressing on things and invariably she
would press to shortly press too long
and the phone the timing is very
sensitive for the app has to respond to
short taps long taps differently I can
imagine it being much easier to explain
to someone just touch the slightly
versus you know smusher finger on there
it's maybe a more natural way to I think
that's even more subjective but I'm
currently fighting with this dual touch
thing and I got a new macbook and that
has that that multiple layer of touch
thing and I'm familiar with this well I
don't know if it's the same thing um but
I'm I don't like it no sir I don't like
it nope that will not do but again it's
new and maybe it's not as fully fleshed
out as it could be so as platforms start
to learn to take better advantage of it
and i really think that as app
developers start building apps that
don't just have this as a gimmick but if
they've had time to work with it they
understand how users naturally will want
to use this maybe six months from now
we're going to start seeing a
renaissance of force touch and it's its
variants becoming a lot more useful so i
think the idea of more hardware getting
this can only be a good thing so
hopefully that will pop up in some of
next year's most popular phones speaking
next year's most popular phones of
course the iphone is going to be stupid
stupid super popular iPhone 7 we've
heard rumors here and there what to
expect and there's this really to my
mind kind of scary one that popped up a
while back suggesting the phone could
drop its lightning connector and now
there's a couple stories that came out
this week that seemed to add a bit of
credence to that well one that in
credence to it one just sort of
expanding an idea a little more first we
heard that Apple is looking to possibly
add new high-quality recordings to its
streaming option
and Apple music so not necessarily
higher bandwidth what does it have to be
but higher bitrate and higher sampling
rate so we're talking 96 kilohertz
24-bit audio CD quality probably sounds
super good to most of you but there are
those audio files out there who can
appreciate a maybe higher sampled
recording problem is the the DAC and the
iphone there isn't really equipped to
output the sort of thing but if you plug
in a pair of super fancy digital
headphones through the phone's lightning
port well sure they could have their own
DAC and be capable of delivering the
sort of audio in the full quality that
Apple's streaming it in and so this
rumor is one thing and then that sort of
adds on to the theory that well if we
went if Apple were to go Lightning only
this would certainly be a new draw for
manufacturers who wanted to start
producing lightning equipped digital
headphones we already saw one it was
ridiculously expensive but are out there
next year could bring us a lot more you
know I give the feeling if Apple does go
this route had those headphones will
probably start getting a lot cheaper
really quick oh sure and I'm variably
companies would release adapters that
would give you a little dongle to plug
in your existing analog headphone too
wouldn't that be great speaking I was it
was it the palm what's the home you need
an entire just to use the headphones the
view as an economic one yep and what how
well that ended up oh yeah it was great
um yeah someone a designer whipped up
some renders of what the iphone 7 might
look like if Apple indeed what in this
direction of dropping the headphone jack
us right now it's one of the thicker
components on there remember that
ridiculous rumor we heard that they
would like slice the top and bottom off
the round connector yeah yeah yeah
gladly not going there but which by the
way here's a veer party look what you
got yeah that's our connector yeah Weiss
have five pins I don't know oh it was
data and power in stuff that is the data
port as well that was everything but we
saw these renders someone whipped up
some pictures of what an iphone 7 that
dropped headphone jack could look like
and it is preposterous lieth in these
are iming a speculation based on the
size of devices but if we got a new 4.7
inch iphone 7 it could be as thin as was
your five point two millimeters which is
nearly two millimeters thinner than the
current gen I believe it has got a
little thicker this year and again apple
and it's still living down the shame of
Bend gate so you have to wonder if
making the phone this then would really
be a great idea and of course we have
commenters chiming in well okay make the
phone or you know save space by getting
rid of the headphone jack sure but what
if we you know just put in a bigger
battery to make up for it wouldn't that
be really nice to nobody does that now
he's interested oh my o.o but yeah okay
take a look at these renders they are
some beautiful looking things whether
Apple goes this way or not I don't know
certainly when the company dropped the
30-pin connector and went full lightning
that was controversial in and of itself
I don't know that this move will
necessarily be any more controversial
and Apple has the clout to get away with
a sort of thing if it wants to do it
it's gonna do it we're gonna have to
live with it oh absolutely but once
again as I've said many times over the
years if there is one company that can
do that and get away with it it's apple
boy how d all right that is it for the
news here Jules we have a sound effect
going into listener mail you know I'm on
this vodka sticker because I really have
that much awareness of oh it's a big
bong as a de ba sayo x uh Adam why don't
you pull up that first listener mail
there and okay alright so this email
comes to us from Robert De Rose now and
says so many new pay services here on
here or on the way like Walmart Samsung
Apple and love and which they'll target
yeah yeah yeah I'm someone who loved the
wallet / android pay and was
disappointed with the lack of support by
retailers sure then came Samsung pay I
use it everywhere do you think that
Samsung has the right idea and
everything else is a waste or is a grass
peed in age technology and I should
support NFC in
the future always a pleasure listening
to the podcast hmm thank you um I
actually have a lot of thoughts on this
do tell well I'm a purveyor of mobile
payments I mean I've used every mobile
payment that has or i should say i've
used the big ones you know the the
samsung pay and Apple pay and Android
pay and all those and I love them I love
them to death um as a matter of fact
there's a spoiler alert editorial coming
out about mobile payments very soon um I
am in favor of any new mobile payment
system that comes out I used to think
that you know it'd be better if we just
had the one standard you know the one
samsung pay or yeah whatever but the
more I thought about it the more I
thought the more that we can get users
used to the idea of paying stuff for
their phones the better off we're going
to be because we'll work out the
standards later let's just get people
using it right now and if if target and
say and walmart can do that by
integrating it within their apps hmm so
much the better because I mean you're
going to be there you're going to be
using the app if you're a cartwheel
you're going to be using their stupid
cartwheel app that's cool it's a target
thing it's really stupid don't ever use
it okay um it's a bad experience but I
mean if you're already in there and
you're already using it and you could
just wave your phone or point your phone
at something and pay that's gonna be
better because that's gonna get the idea
in people's heads I can buy stuff with
my phone and it's super easy together
more directly to to the question here I
think that Samsung had the right idea
with this magnetic stripe emulation
especially with the NFC seems that is
great it's available before let's talk
about not being able to pay with these
things I found it's available more often
than not at least in retailers in my
area I'm going to say about thirty
percent that's it ok but this fall back
to have an eidetic stripe support I
think a huge boon for samsung
unfortunately it kind of got here too
late I can't deny that especially with
the hardware in the galaxy s6 and
Samsung not enabling Samsung pay until
months after its release now the u.s. is
in the middle of this move to
a chip and not pain but signature and
it's not inconceivable that we're going
to see magnetic stripes in general start
going the way of the dodo pretty soon
right you're a year or two ago that
would have been fantastic yep of the
options available now that Samsung lets
you do this and it has NFC support it's
the best of both worlds yes absolutely
you have a choice between something a
samsung phone that does this and another
manufacturers everything else being
equal and you like mobile payments by
all means go with something that
supports Samsung pay yeah yeah you took
the words right out of my mouth so
Samsung is got a good head start in this
particular arena with that MST but it is
a little bit too late and it's going to
start not working in more often than
knowing why you can fellas exactly
speaking of great things and maybe don't
always work or not always available we
like them to our next listener mail here
comes from Lucas who writes hi PocketNow
team longtime listener have a question
for the podcast it's really bugging me
what's going on with wireless charging
Qi charging in particular is it dead but
for two years ago I got my Nexus 5 i'm
started using wireless charging but now
i have but by now i have a che Qi
charger in my car 01 on my desk and one
besides my bed and due to this I don't
have to touch a micro USB charging cable
for a long time now that's amazing but
now in 2015 only seems like only a few
Lumia devices the galaxy s6 end up
getting wireless charging it's
disappointing the new Nexus phones
haven't had this what do you think's
going on is because of quick charging or
the COS not that people are using it in
general you know I think this is sad I
really loved wireless charging i used it
occasionally on my Nexus 5 but I didn't
leave it plugged in all the time because
I worry about it being a jewel thief and
i'm wasting a little bit of power when
not in use always sending out that
signal that's there um I don't know if
that's what people don't use it and
certainly who've seen manufacture some
of the bigger phones this year didn't
have it other ones did um I think
technology though it's continuing to
evolve and made some big progress this
year as the companies behind these
platforms started joining forces not Chi
but the PMA and who are the other guys
there was a third one and we now
is wrapped up with PA yeah they're part
of PMA now so yeah and and now that a
lot of phones are having have chipsets
for wireless charging that support both
of these standards likely galaxy s6
compatibility issues are becoming less
of an issue and yeah you make a good
point fast charging is a big draw on a
lot of phones at least people seem
really upset when a new model doesn't
support it or doesn't have the standard
they want that said we do have fast
wireless charging in the galaxy s6 does
this but again you're going to have to
have the right this is introduced a
whole new standard problem as 6 plus by
the way that s6 s6 plus as that yeah the
note 5 and the sx plus have it the s6
and the s6 edge do not think this is a
problem not everything is working on the
same page here I don't know if next year
is going to improve the situation any I
thinking that the options are there if
manufacturers want to take advantage of
them the question is the weird part is
that it seems like PMA and Qi both took
really divergent routes in in in getting
their product out there PMA went after
the providers starbucks and the car
searched and the different places they
they wanted to get wireless chargers in
their stores whether or not anybody was
actually using them in their phones
whereas chi went the other route and
they were trying to push their product
into phones but then nobody had the
support for so he's kind of never the
twain shall meet it was kind of like the
chicken and the egg thing now that the
technology is there for both i think
there's a much better possibility that
chitra or that i should say wireless
charging and now that we have fast
wireless charging as well I think
there's it's poised to me to come back
just like webos so no it's I think it
could potentially make a comeback this
year it's not dead um but it's just it's
a VHS versus beta thing so we just got
to figure out which one's gonna win and
then 11 wins then we'll be we'll all
have it and everybody will like it damn
it may I stuff I'm a HD DVD player I
miss those things you would that formats
man debt technology technology alright
you got one more listener mail here a
lot of you think its own Adam oh sure
hi pocket now from unicorn workhorse
that's a great name it is a cracker I
want to know your thoughts about the
idea of Google enforcing minimum
hardware standards for android phones
for example some standards could include
1.5 gigs of ram 8 gigabytes of available
storage 250 I PPI screen resolution 1.2
gigahertz processor eighteen hundred
million of our batteries yada yada yada
what do you think what's such a change
produce phones like the lowes Android
one models boring similar devices would
it make them too pricey and too
expensive I see this as a way to help
eliminate fragmentation but then again
please speak your mind so because we
don't always have to agree with each
other I added that last part but um
personally I think that would probably
go against what Android and Google is
about I think Google is trying to push
out the idea that this can be installed
on just about anything um and I also
think that pretty soon we're going to
reach a technological point where even
the crappy stuff ain't all that bad yeah
so I mean you know where I think we're
already at a point where just about
every phone has 1.5 gigabytes of ram and
a little rebellious to it with every
phone worth buying so I mean III don't
think that it would necessarily that
Google will necessarily have to enforce
this I think the industry is going to
enforce it for us because there's not
going to be anything less than that
available no largely I'm with you there
I think as I guess answer the question
straight up no I don't think this is a
good idea I think Google should do that
and my first didn't think was well this
is sort of a market solved problem here
that a lot of the phones were seeing are
already well above these standards but
these are just the phones that we're
talking about we don't talk about the
crappiest phones out there the phones
that you're going to get for you know
thirty dollars with a prepaid provider
and some of those can really you know
fail to hit some key specs series we're
still getting devices with like FWVGA
resolution name is that good enough for
user needs that's the thing i think yes
that a lot
of the times you can get by with really
really bottom of the bucket here
hardware and the fact that Android can
still run on these even if it's an older
version even if it doesn't support all
the bells and whistles of modern
hardware does that's still good it gets
users online especially how this is a so
much more affordable way for people to
access the internet and having you home
broadband connection and a computer just
getting people engaged getting them
connected is valuable enough that I
don't think setting a minimum bar here
for hardware that would unfortunately as
a result probably make things a bit more
expensive especially on the bottom and
here I don't think that would benefit
the the community as a whole it's
frustrating when you when your device
doesn't support the latest app so if you
can't you know guarantee hardware update
our software updates or when you know I
got 8 gigabytes of free storage that is
a pipe dream there so I think we'll
still be seeing phones with no 8
gigabytes total and you just get like I
don't know to I've when it shifts yeah
um but we always have better options out
there and certainly as users get more
educated about what they're looking for
they'll be able to you choose the phone
that best suits then and again even if
you're not getting really high-end
hardware at this thirty fifty dollar
price point a hundred hundred and twenty
dollars you can get a very solid phone
that can run the latest software with
not too many difficulties so I would not
like to see Google do this okay so we
agree but for different reasons yeah
it's not like it meeting of the minds
here before we head out let's pop back
in a Q&amp;amp;A here for a brief moment here
see if any other goodies comments going
on here da da da uh ok I got it you
asked me talk to me directly and nearly
gonna have to respond to you windows 10
fan is back with another comment here
name the specs of a shank phone ooh I'm
kind of liking this Snapdragon 650 shoe
here I think I go with that 4.7 25 inch
1080p screen a 32 gig storage minimum if
you have that animal microsd expansion
so much the better here no I could go
with a fingerprint scanner I've been on
the fence before but I would like to
have one I think an XC again I
much juice for it right now but why not
I'd like to have all the harbor options
out there USB on-the-go compatibility is
a must i loves as close to stock Android
as you can get battery I guess 25 milli
twenty-five hundred milliamps wouldn't
do me and have a doubt phone would that
have a doubt phone um around the same
screen says I'm gonna go a little bit
bigger 55 25.2 somewhere in that
neighborhood um probably 1080p at 1080p
minimum you want to go higher than that
okay whatever the camera is gonna be the
most important thing for me something I
don't care about the camera yeah see i
wanna i want to galaxy s6 camera module
whatever that I think it's so me I don't
know any whatever that whatever's in
there I wanted my phone batteries got to
be at least 350 at three thirty five
hundred milliamp hours because I want a
horse um what am I missing Ram three to
four gigs of storage space 32 no 256
there we go right we're making this
dream oh yeah yeah and you know android
would be fine um iOS would be fine not
sell this phone aki sailfish yeah sorry
guys um but uh yeah I think I hadn't we
can have as manufacturers you heard what
we want here duh the John Matthews
talking about the new Moto X leak on the
inside do we see a place where a
fingerprint scanner could be uh yeah we
heard a rumor the microsoft motorola
could be getting back into the
fingerprint scanning game it was one of
the early players the had a phone the
support of this back door was baked into
the platform with that little that's
tops trip on the atrix 4g uh from the
leak I didn't see anything like that but
then again there's a lot of places you
can put a fingerprint scanner I love
what Sony did with the side mounted
power button scanner even if it doesn't
work as great as it could mmm an option
I think probably a front of him over the
home button because it's not going to
have one being motorola but like
integrate it into maybe the screen or
just the bottom there yeah that could
happen
but no nothing on the back that we've
seen but it's weird-looking hardware I
don't know man couple of OEM zar working
on screen based fingerprint sensors this
is all capacitive if you already ate
some capacitive sensors in the screen
why not yeah he put it right there baby
let's get one more here Sebastian Chavez
shabas do you think HTC will make a
comeback next year what were they need
you to make this come back don't call it
a comeback yeah because it's probably
not gonna happen have been for the last
I don't know was it three years now
there's been this downward spiral we
really want them to do well and you know
this yes flagship one phone it sounds
really great it looks sort of premium
and then it lets people down in one way
or another sales never seem to be where
they are the company has months works
doing better months where it's not but
there's this general decline in sales I
don't know if it has what it takes to
pull things around I would love to I
guess one job hardware and you know
maybe we can down I mean that's all it
has to do everything else is there it's
it's got every all the other good stuff
it just it just keeps screwing up that
one major thing which is the camera and
you know I I don't think it's been doing
its promotion job as well as it could
it's made some big miss steps and at
Robert Downey it's getting celebrities
that aren't really clicking with its
message there it's not engaging users
nearly the way you know what I'm selling
much less an element one other thing
that HTC needs to clean up from tells
its customer service I have never had
them personally but my two on my on my
other showtek beard calm my other
podcast both ryan and cliff have had
atrocious experiences with customer
service I've only had good things uh HTC
makes the Nexus 9 shortly after I got
this thing last year I noticed not dead
pixel but they're a couple like super
hard to see barely there dark spots in
the backlight you had to look at it
under a magnifying glass to take a
picture of this thing okay once i saw it
i couldn't unsee it pissed me off I got
an RMA he sent the
back new one and like a week or so no
problem easy really lemon squeezy well
