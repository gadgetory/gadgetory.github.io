flight travel rooted galaxy s 2 s get
multi window support an HTC announces
the butterfly internationally though not
really I'm high memory data waiting for
the FAA to hurry up with this tablet
thing and this is parking out daily if
you do some minor or lots of traveling
like we do you know how annoying it is
to have to turn off your portable
electronic devices every time the
aircraft takes off or lands the FCC
Chairman has just sent a letter to the
FAA asking them to remove that
restriction for tablets because
apparently there is not much of a threat
when it comes to tablets now that said I
worked for airlines for 15 years before
i came to pocket now and i know this is
going to take a long time to get
approved but at least it started if you
know and love the galaxy note 2 you know
that one of the features that everybody
loves is its multi window support as of
android 4.1 point to the galaxy s3
customers are getting it as well but
what happens if you have a galaxy s2
well if your device is rooted there is a
full tutorial on how to get this feature
running on your galaxy s2 so follow the
links in the description and enjoy now
I've been meaning to ask you guys do any
of you care about the galaxy camera
anyone well it seems that Sammy has now
shown the world that apparently there is
a verizon LTE variant to come to the
market soon even though we have no dates
for it just yet now i just find it
extremely funny that anybody would care
about having a camera that you have to
pay a full data plan for but the market
is the market we go hands-on the Nokia
Lumia 820 for AT&amp;amp;T which is a mid-tier
variant windows phone 8 device it was
recently released and even though we
have reviewed the Nokia Lumia 810 for
t-mobile and the 822 for verizon
recently we are going to give this 820
the full treatment on AT&amp;amp;T and tell me
if it's worth the money or not so make
sure you watch Michaels video and tell
us what you think of the comments down
below and finally for the oh no you
can't be serious news of the day HTC has
just officially shown the butterfly on
their international website which is
code for yes you can buy this
international variant carrier unlocked
and it even has a microSD expansion slot
anything is cool so far right well hold
it right there this device has dual band
3g and for anybody that knows dual band
3g is not really an international phone
it can't work everywhere I mean the
Galaxy Nexus that was released last
year's Penta ban 3g so it does seem that
apparently this is not the International
Varian that ended up by mistake on this
website and apparently this is the
Chinese variant that people can buy
unlocked and it's not really a global
phone so that leads me to the question
of the day even with this disappointment
do you want an HTC butterfly device
probably with a different name to be
launched on wherever you are to get it
soon in my case I'm desperately waiting
for this device so make your voice be
heard leave us a comment down below now
if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi mera better thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
