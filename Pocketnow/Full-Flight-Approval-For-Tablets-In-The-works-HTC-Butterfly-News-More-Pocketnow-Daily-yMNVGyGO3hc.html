full flight travel routed Galaxy S 2's
get multi window support and HTC
announces the butterfly internationally
though not really I'm Jaime Rivera
waiting for the FAA to hurry up with
this tablet thing and this is parking
out daily if you do some minor or lots
of traveling like we do you know how
annoying it is to have to turn off your
portable electronic devices every time
the aircraft takes off or lands the FCC
Chairman has just sent a letter to the
FAA asking them to remove that
restriction for tablets because
apparently there is not much of a threat
when it comes to tablets now that said I
worked for Airlines for 15 years before
I came to pocket now and I know this is
gonna take a long time to get approved
but at least it started if you know and
love the Galaxy Note 2 you know that one
of the features that everybody loves is
its multi window support as of Android
4.1.2 the galaxy s3 customers are
getting it as well but what happens if
you have a galaxy s2 well if your device
is rooted there is a full tutorial on
how to get the speech or running on your
Galaxy S 2 so follow the links in the
description and enjoy now I've been
meaning to ask you guys do any of you
care about the Galaxy camera anyone well
it seems that sammy has now shown the
world that apparently there is a Verizon
LTE variant to come to the market soon
even though we have no date spread just
yet now I just find it extremely funny
that anybody would care about having a
camera that you have to pay a full day
to plan for but the market is the market
we go hands-on the Nokia Lumia 820 480
which is a mid tiered variant Windows
Phone 8 device it was recently released
and even though we have reviewed the
Nokia Lumia 810 for t-mobile and the 822
for Verizon recently we are gonna give
this 820 the full treatment on AT&amp;amp;T and
tell you if it's worth the money or not
so make sure you watch Michaels video
and tell us what you think of the
comments down below and finally for the
oh no you can't be serious news of the
day HTC has just officially shown the
butterfly on their international website
which is code for yes you can buy this
international variant carrier unlocked
and it even has a
crow as the expansion slot everything is
cool so far right well hold it right
there
this device has dual band 3G and for
anybody that knows dual band 3G is not
really an international phone it can't
work everywhere I mean the Galaxy Nexus
that was released last year's Penta band
3G so it does seem that apparently this
is not the international variant that
ended up by mistake on this website and
apparently this is the Chinese variant
that people can buy unlocked and it's
not really a global phone so that leads
me to the question of the day
even with this disappointment do you
want an HTC butterfly device probably
was a different name to be launched on
wherever you are to get it soon in my
case I'm desperately waiting for this
device so make your voice be heard leave
us a comment down below now if you won
an earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone or tablet
world make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw I'm
Jaime Rivera thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
