pocketnow.com the Android 2.3
Gingerbread SDK has just been released
and with it we get the new emulator so
that we can track Gingerbread on a
computer so in this video we're gonna
walk through Gingerbread tell you about
all the new stuff that has come along
let's get to it
so gingerbread is a lot about gaming
increases in gaming performance
gyroscope support a lot of other things
that will help developers make better
games for Android there's also a lot of
stuff for communications like Internet
calling built right into the operating
system so you can actually go into the
phone dialer and use a over IP service
to make a call instead of doing it over
the cellular provider there's also new
support for camera so that developers
can better take advantage of the
front-facing camera for video chat and
then there's a lot of minor user
interface changes as we're going to see
mostly through this video the top bar is
now black the icons have more detail to
them some of them are colorized with a
little bit more green overall not that
big of a jump from Android 2.2 to 2.3
which is why they didn't go with the
title Android 3.0 they're saving that
for a big leap so let's talk about
Android 2.3 here so the notification bar
on the top is now black stock Android
2.2 was white if we pull down the
notification shade it's also a little
bit different it looks the same but it
uses black and gray instead of white and
gray as we found in Android 2.2 so we
can roll that back up you know things
like the phone icon are different as you
can see here in the center down here
these three buttons along the bottom are
colorized green are especially the phone
and the web icon let's jump into the web
real quick and not much has changed
there except there's a better way to
copy things now of course we're running
this as an emulator so it's not going to
be as fast as you'll see on say you know
the Google Nexus S that's coming out in
December so so bear with us as the
screens load and things are a little bit
choppy let's say we want to copy some
text okay so we can tap and hold I mean
this isn't new we get now larger
selection handles here we can
click and drag and if the cursor will
follow me we can select some text now if
we tap on the selected text watch what
happens boom it's copied in one step so
it's a it's a little bit easier now to
copy text in Android 2.3 there's also a
new on-screen keyboard so if we tap up
here in the address bar we should get
the new on-screen keyboard pop up and
there it is the new on-screen keyboard
the keys are sprite spaced out more and
that has multi-touch capability so you
can be a little bit faster when you're
typing also new is that the character
buttons or some of the character buttons
now have three dots on them and when you
see those three dots you know that there
are other letters that are associated
with them so down here the slash if we
tap and hold we will get additional
options so we can go into settings from
here the same with the period if we tap
and hold on the period we'll get
additional punctuation pretty much all
of them question mark exclamation point
and so on and so forth so an improved
keyboard which is great because a lot of
devices now for Android don't have
slide-out keyboards let's jump into the
settings and take a look at some other
minor user interface changes so here in
settings again we get a lot of the black
theme and setup the whitish theme that
we saw on Android 2.2 and below so let's
jump into some of these things like
language and keyboard and you're going
to see a new sort of checkbox so now as
you can see the checkboxes are more
clean they have a green check in the
middle a nice white border and a gray
background so a nice little subtle touch
there let's jump into some of these
menus real quick to see if there's
anything that's different wireless and
networks pretty much the same jump out
of here let's go into display see if any
things have been changed
we've auto rotate screen we've seen that
we can turn down animations maybe make
the device a little bit faster
brightness although this is an emulator
of course let's go back jump into
application see if there's anything new
there install applications from unknown
sources quick launch set keyboard
shortcuts to launch applications which
is pretty cool so we can actually assign
various letters to launch different
applications which is quite nice
especially if there's a hardware
keyboard
not sure if this is going to be
something that they roll out for devices
that have the on-screen keyboard but if
so it's a very cool feature let's jump
back into there go to battery use and
certainly we're not going to see any
information about the battery because
there is no battery installed this is an
emulator after all now there's a new
menu that is the of course multitask
menu let's go back to the home screen
there's a new menu from the home screen
so we tap menu we have a new option
which is manage apps so previously you
had to go into settings and then
applications and then manage apps but
from here from the home screen you can
jump immediately into manage apps and it
will bring you into a little task
manager that shows you sort of what is
running at the what's what is running at
the moment the contact screen is a
little bit different when you go to add
a new contact the interface has been
spruced up a little bit and bear with us
as it loads here so we're gonna go to
menu and new contact and you're gonna
see how things have been spruced up a
little bit so things are bigger more
finger friendly nicer icons to do
certain things here in Android 2.3 and
the application drawer has been slightly
updated if you remember in Android 2.2
there was a 3d carousel and that seems
to have been changed a little bit
although it's tough to tell because
we've only got a small grid of icons
here but it looks like the icons sort of
fade away from you instead of sort of
cascade away from you and here are the
programs that are built in to Android
2.3 in lis and at least the emulator
there's not much to work with here we
don't even get the Android Market let's
go into the gallery and see if we can
see any changes there seems to be
bouncing back out ok no media found fair
enough let's jump back out and go to
music see if we can see any changes
there similar kind of interface that we
found in Android 2.2 and below and one
more thing we want to go into messaging
and just see what
looks like so of course this is for text
messaging and I've already sent a
message looks identical to the way it
was in Android 2.2 so not many changes
there well though we get these three
dots appear again which will allow you
to manipulate or do additional things
with a contact so presumably if I had
this person stored in my address book
tapping on those three dots would allow
you to call the person message them or
do an Internet call just a better visual
representation that there are additional
options available should you want to
action on this person so that was a
quick walk through of Android 2.3 when
we get it on a device we're going to do
a more comprehensive walk through it's
really hard to get a full representation
of what the new version of Android is
going to be like through an emulator
we're also going to put instructions on
pocketnow.com if you want to try out
Android 2.3 on your own with this
emulator if you like this video please
