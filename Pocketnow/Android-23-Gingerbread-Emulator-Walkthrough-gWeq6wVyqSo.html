pocket now calm the android 2.3
Gingerbread sdk has just been released
and with it we get the new emulator so
that we can track gingerbread on a
computer so in this video we're going to
walk through gingerbread tell you about
all the new stuff that has come along
let's get to it so gingerbread is a lot
about gaming increases in gaming
performance gyroscopes support a lot of
other things that will help developers
make better games for android there's
also a lot of stuff for communications
like Internet calling built right into
the operating system so you can actually
go into the phone dialer and use a voice
over IP service to make a call instead
of doing it over the cellular provider
there's also new support for camera so
that developers can better take
advantage of the front facing camera for
video chat and then there's a lot of
minor user interface changes as we're
going to see mostly through this video
the top bar is now black the icons have
more detail to them some of them are
colorized with a little bit more green
overall not that big of a jump from
android 2.2 to 2.3 which is why they
didn't go with the title android 3.0
they're saving that for a big leap so
let's talk about android 2.3 here so the
notification bar on the top is now black
stock android 2.2 was white if we pull
down the notification shade it's also a
little bit different it looks the same
but it uses black and gray instead of
white and grey as we found in android
2.2 so we can roll that back up you know
things like the phone icon are different
as you can see here in the center down
here these three buttons along the
bottom are colorized green are
especially the phone and the web icon
let's jump into the web real quick and
not much has changed there except
there's a better way to copy things now
of course we're running this as an
emulator so it's not going to be as fast
as you'll see on say you know the google
nexus s that's coming out in december so
so bear with us as the screens load and
things are a little bit choppy let's say
we want to copy some text okay so we can
tap and hold i mean this isn't new we
get now larger selection handles here we
can
click and drag and if the cursor will
follow me we can select some text now if
we tap on the selected text watch what
happens boom it's copied in one step so
it's a it's a little bit easier now to
copy text in android 2.3 there's also a
new on-screen keyboard so if we tap up
here and the address bar we should get
the new on-screen keyboard pop up and
there it is the new on-screen keyboard
the keys are sprayed spaced out more and
that has multitouch capability so you
can be a little bit faster when you're
typing also new is that the character
buttons or some of the character buttons
now have three dots on them and when you
see those three dots you know that there
are other letters that are associated
with them so down here the slash if we
tap and hold we will get additional
options so we can go into settings from
here the same with the period if we tap
and hold on the period will get
additional punctuation pretty much all
of them ? ! and so on and so forth so an
improved keyboard which is great because
a lot of devices now for Android don't
have slide out keyboards let's jump into
the settings and take a look at some
other minor user interface changes so
here in settings again we get a lot of
the black theme instead of the whitish
theme that we saw on android 2.2 and
below so let's jump into some of these
things like language and keyboard and
you're going to see a new sort of check
box so now as you can see the checkboxes
are more clean they have a green check
in the middle a nice white border and a
grey background so a nice little subtle
touch there let's jump into some of
these menus real quick to see if there's
anything that's different wireless and
networks pretty much the same jump out
of here let's go into display see if any
things have been changed we've auto
rotate screen we've seen that we can
turn down animations maybe make the
device a little bit faster brightness
although this is an emulator of course
let's go back jump in the application
see if there's anything new there
install applications from unknown
sources quick launch set keyboard
shortcuts to launch applications which
is pretty cool so we can actually assign
various letters to launch different
applications which is quite nice
especially if there's a hardware
keyboard
not sure if this is going to be
something that they roll out for devices
that have the on-screen keyboard but if
so it's a very cool feature let's jump
back into there and go to battery use
and certainly we're not going to see any
information about the battery because
there is no battery installed this is an
emulator after all now there's a new
menu that is the of course multitask
menu let's go back to the home screen
there's a new menu from the home screen
so we tap menu we have a new option
which is manage apps so previously you
had to go into settings and then
applications and then manage apps but
from here from the home screen you can
jump immediately into manage apps and it
will bring you into a little task
manager that showed you sort of what is
running at the what's what is running at
the moment the contacts screen is a
little bit different when you go to add
a new contact the interface has been
spruced up a little bit and bear with us
as it loads here so we're going to go to
menu and new contact and you're going to
see how things have been spruced up a
little bit so things are bigger more
finger friendly nicer icons to do
certain things here in android 2.3 the
application drawer has been slightly
updated if you remember in android 2.2
there was a 3d carousel and that seems
to have been changed a little bit
although it's tough to tell because
we've only got a small grid of icons
here but it looks like the icons sort of
fade away from you instead of sort of
cascade away from you and here are the
programs that are built in to android
2.3 in leet and at least the emulator
there's not much to work with here we
don't even get the android market let's
go into the gallery and see if we can
see any changes there seems to be
bouncing back out okay no media found
fair enough let's jump back out and go
to music so you can see any changes
there similar kind of interface that we
found in android 2.2 and below and one
more thing we want to go into messaging
and just see what
looks like so of course this is for text
messaging and I've already sent a
message looks identical to the way it
was in android 2.2 so not many changes
there although we get these three dots
appear again which will allow you to
manipulate or do additional things with
a contact so presumably if I had this
person stored in my address book tapping
on those three dots would allow you to
call the person message them or do an
internet call just a better visual
representation that there are additional
options available should you want to
action on this person so that was a
quick walk through of android 2.3 when
we get it on a device we're going to do
a more comprehensive walkthrough it's
really hard to get a full representation
of what the new version of android is
going to be like through an emulator
we're also going to put instructions on
pocket now calm if you want to try out
android 2.3 on your own with this
emulator if you like this video please
