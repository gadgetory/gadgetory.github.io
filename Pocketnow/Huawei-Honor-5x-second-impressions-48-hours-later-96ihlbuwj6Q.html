honor 5x is this is the first
kwame phone I've spent any significant
time with but I felt it was important to
check in with some early impressions I'm
Juan Carlos bag now for pocket now and
here's my first 48 hours with the honor
5x we recently published a first
impressions video and after two days
most of that video has been confirmed or
reinforced this is an attractive build
for its $199 unlock price I can't unsee
some of the little blemishes where seams
don't quite line up and it's always been
a pet peeve when the headphone jack
isn't centered on the phone body but in
daily operation these issues won't
overly distract instead pulling the
phone out in public I think most people
would be hard pressed telling it apart
from a far more expensive flagship I
absolutely wouldn't blame anyone for
confusing this with an HTC from behind
or a note 5 from the front
I spent Valentine's Day weekend using
the honor as my main driver and it was a
whiplash inducing collection of highs
and lows it's still a bit early to get a
handle on battery performance but the
phone handled casual usage well a full
day off the charger when you ended a
very light day with about 70 percent
battery left we'll see how that holds up
to an actual workday though and standby
times have been pretty good sipping
about 2% of the battery overnight on
Wi-Fi also too early to call is camera
performance this price tear has been
getting increasingly competitive with
ASUS of Lumias and all kettles offering
up some solid rear shooters I'm not
particularly enamored with the camera
app but performance has been snappy with
quick load times directly from a
DoubleTap on the volume rocker and
reasonably quick recycle times compared
to competing phones the optics seem
solid but we'll still need to look at
image processing and low-light
performance
now what isn't too early to call is this
fingerprint scanner it was a shining
moment during the initial setup and it
continued to impress over the weekend it
was consistently faster in operation
than the button press plus scan action
the v10 requires and the placement is
near-perfect for folks of all hand sizes
to easily unlock the device without
moving it around in your hand I also
enabled one of the gestures to pull down
the notification shade and happily that
replicates one of my favorite
customizations on lg devices I might be
at the end of my rope with this UI
though I don't like it at all
manual organization like this is terror
you install a new app and it just gets
plopped onto the next available open
spot on one of your home screens if you
want that app anywhere else you have to
move torque cuts around or organize
folders adding widgets to this interface
just looks a mess everything is
cluttered and there are precious few
apps that will deliver badged updates
when information is sent to your various
accounts frustratingly difficult to get
an at-a-glance look at what's happening
in your digital life without a lot of
swiping and organizing now I know it's
often included as an accessibility
feature or for older consumers who might
not be as tech savvy but I'm liking the
simple mode better easy to use shortcuts
for the basics a layout which resembles
a file Explorer or finder and we're back
to having something closer to an app
drawer plus the flat color style and
rounded corners reminds me a little of a
Star Trek style L cars UI even though I
can't really stand Huawei software at
least the actual phone performance kept
me well powered through most of the apps
I use flipping back and forth between
system tools social networking and a
little light gaming the honor 5x kept up
very well
only struggling occasionally with
combinations of services like
turn-by-turn navigation while tracking
my vehicle and engine info and streaming
some podcasts gaming also kept up well
playing older titles like Riptide gp2
and Sky Force but it shouldn't come as a
surprise that will often see framerate
drops or the occasional lag and yet
considering the issues I might have with
the honor 5x I just can't get overly
frustrated with it considering the price
every time I pick it up I can't help but
give it a bit of a grin the bang for
buck here feels pretty good and it's
another handset reinforcing how well
Android can compete at the $200
threshold we still have a ways to go
wrapping up the full review here so make
sure you subscribe to this channel to
catch the full scoop on the Huawei honor
5x as always thanks so much for watching
for PocketNow i'm juan carlos back now
you can chat me up on twitter and
instagram as some gadget guy and i will
catch you all on the next video
