the announcement of yet another sprint
4G milestone as you know spread became
the first national carrier to launch 4G
in this country we finish 2009 with 27
markets covered 30 million people
covered me hope to quadruple that
coverage this year in 2010 we started
with a dual-mode 3G 4G air card and then
in January of this year we announced a
new category product the overdrive
mobile hotspot a great thing about the
overdrive is it allows you to share a 4g
speed with up to 5 additional devices
the device that i'm going to show you
here will let you do that with up to
eight additional devices but what the
world has been missing is a great 4g
smartphone so today we're announcing the
world's first android 4g smartphone and
yeah
we have some plans out there good job
guys but also you know this country's
first the 3g 4g smartphone as well the
HTC evo 4g so i think I I will take what
Jay has here on the table so I'll do my
best Carol Merrill this is a terrific to
a whole new level it has camcorder like
video capture and playback equal to HD
quality so you can dis your camcorder it
has an 8-megapixel camera so you can
ditch your camera as well and because
it's written 4g speed and value make it
so practical with download high quality
pictures and videos it has a really a
beautiful 4g or sorry 4.3 inch very high
resolution screen we've even added a
text and so that you can watch videos
and screen it's not just for cheap that
makes this so fast the evo itself is a
very fast device with a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor so websites
including flash applications appear
really hit a snap an Android to duck one
apps like speech to text or texting or
email and goggle visual search just have
to be experienced i love the goggle
surgery is
snap a picture of a wine bottle
everything about it very quickly had a
chance to use that this weekend it's a
it's a terrific smartphone even in 3d
models so even if you only have 3g
coverage this is about as good as it
gets so of the devices that are
available this summer the HTC evo 4g we
believe will be in a class by itself I
could go on about the evo forever but
I've been elected to experts Kevin
pakenham and 3d from Sprint come up and
talk about this a little later but first
it's my great pleasure to introduce the
CEO of a very innovative terrific
partner mr. it has HTC so peter chao is
the visionary behind this great device a
terrific partner and i'm going to bring
him up now
provision for such an important a minute
later spread poggi is a misstep follicle
I'm actually very excited honor to here

work site as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
