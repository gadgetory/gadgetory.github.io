pocketnow.com and this is a look at
windows mobile 6.5 they'll 23 502 last
time we showed you about 23 0 8 1 which
brought a lot of small changes for
example the checkboxes have new visual
styling the scroll bars look a little
bit different things like that this
newer version of windows mobile 6.5
really is all about speed there's not
that many visual changes the only thing
that's sort of relating to design is is
the scrolling the kinetic scrolling no
longer do we have iphone like bounce
back in the scrolling this may be
something temporary but if we go into
file explorer for example and we scroll
up nothing happens we don't get that
bounce back like you get in on the
iPhone or even on windows mobile 6.5 the
version that is out there now and really
this version is just quite fast
especially compared to the other
releases of windows mobile 6.5 point one
I can bounce around from screen to
screen with virtually no lag we get to
see that the scroll bars have yet again
been changed I'm no longer do you have
the up down and the up arrow in the down
arrow now it's just sort of a a white
spot hopefully that will be stylized
soon hopefully all of this will be
stylized and we can finally see where
Microsoft is going with this version of
the operating system so if we jump into
task manager real quick we can see that
our there are a few programs open and
it's still going quite fast and if we
end all tasks you can get a look at that
the new buttons that we have then are
very windows esque they're no longer the
square buttons that have no dimension
and this was present in build 2308 one
so again this is bill 23 502 not many
changes except for speed things are just
a lot faster and that's good news for
those of you that like to run this
version of windows mobile 6.5 that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
