missing on a google nexus 6 feature
reports claim that sony xperia z4 might
be missing MWC 2015 and microsoft is
already considering names for its
project Spartan a minor iveta and yeah
there's the green screen and but I'm
back at the old studio actually this is
parking out daily let's begin today with
the official news facebook has just
launched a new application and this time
it has to do with facebook the company
has launched Facebook Lite for Android
and the whole purpose is that if you're
rocking an android phone that's not
really as powerful as some of them are
then you can download facebook like get
the same notifications and you will have
a much crop down experience even though
yeah you're pretty much getting Facebook
the way it is intended on the website
it's pretty much that concept indeed so
like the description to get the app
download if you're interested now let's
talk about Microsoft we thought that the
whole Spartan browser thing was going to
be part of it and explore and it turns
out to be a separate browser but
Microsoft was apparently wanting to name
it the same way anyways the company is
looking for different names in a survey
for what its Spartan browser should be
called and every single name has to do
with E or the letter e should I say so
we have entourage we have edge in
addition to other names but apparently
Microsoft wants to include either
Microsoft as a name or internet explorer
or ie as a name so Internet Explorer
edge is apparently going to be the next
name as edge was the name of the whole
rendering engine for sparty now one of
the most anticipated products for mwc
2015 is the Sony Xperia z4 and I'm about
to tell you that you should stop
anticipating it as it seems that we have
some credible sources claiming that it
will not be ready for mwc and actually
not in spring either apparently it's
going to launch until late spring early
summer and it could be end of May or
sometime within the next Ainge Bond
movie after the renders and leaks and
everything that happened in November not
sure exactly when that will be but if it
does miss and there you see it's both
were leaving in bed that from WC but
we're leaving because that means your
Xperia z3 is not obsolete even though
some leaks of the HTC One
I nor the HTC hema have been shameless
and telling us that the one of nine
looks exactly like the one I made it
seems that this is actually just a decoy
recording some trusted sources
apparently HTC is using that decoy with
internals and everything with the
purpose not necessarily to have the
press go crazy over something that's not
but obviously to avoid leaks so we
remember Apple did this with the iphone
4 and wrapping it around iphone 3gs
cases in a long time ago after the whole
gizmodo leaks and fortunately that
apparently that is the same thing with
the HTC hema apparently the design is
drastically different not what we've
seen in leaks but we will learn more
than WC trust me and finally for the
very interesting news of the day
Motorola's ex-ceo dennis woodside was
recently on record talking about the
Nexus 6 and apparently according to him
the Nexus 6 did not land one of its best
features which was going to be a
fingerprint scanner on the motorola
dimple giving it a purpose because apple
bought the company that it was the best
supplier for the fingerprint scanners
and hence the reason why touch ID is so
cool on the iphone and ipad lineups and
yeah it seems that the Nexus 6 was going
to bring this feature in the end but it
leads me to the question of the day do
you think that that fingerprint scanner
would have made a difference with the
Nexus 6 because in my case yeah I mean
it would have given the purpose to the
dimple but then again the dimple would
have been so far up because of how big
that Nexus 6 is that the i'm not sure if
it would have been useful leave us a
comment down below what do you think
friends yes you know the drill if you
wonder if it was earlier before this
video is so mushy follow us on
target.com is a scrap change of channel
as well you can also follow me on
twitter Jaime underscore d better please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am hema better thank you
very much for watching we'll see it's
