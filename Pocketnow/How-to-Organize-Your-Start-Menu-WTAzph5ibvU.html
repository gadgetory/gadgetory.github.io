pocket now calm and this is a tutorial
on how to clean up your start menu and
this applies to windows mobile 6.5 and
6.1 and 6.2 up screen or non-touchscreen
all work the same now in 6.5 in
particular we have the ability to move
icons around although we can only move
them to the top so if we have something
on the bottom here say we want opera
browser at the top we tap and hold and
go to move to top but let's say we want
to delete an icon there's some AT&amp;amp;T
stuff on here that I don't necessarily
want to use such as AT&amp;amp;T music this is
how you remove it you want to go into
file explorer and what depending on the
device that you use it may be here in
the main directory or it may be under
tools like it is on this device and go
into file explorer and now you want to
navigate to the windows directory so the
way that you can get to there is by
going to the main directory my device
and drilling into windows and after that
loads you want to scroll down a little
bit and go to start menu and then go to
programs and this is going to show you
all of the things that are listed in
your Start menu there's the one I want
to delete AT&amp;amp;T music to delete it simply
tap and hold and press delete and it
says it's a system file so be sure you
don't want to ever use this again I'm
pretty sure I'm not going to and so if
we go back into the start menu AT&amp;amp;T
music is gone it's cleaned up a little
bit more you can also make subfolders
let's say for multimedia so that you
don't have all these applications all
over your Start menu you can try to make
it as short as possible so you don't
have to scroll as much if you're trying
to find something so let's make a new
folder you can already see there are
some folders made like apps and
productivity let's do multimedia so I'm
back in that programs directory and I'm
going to do menu new folder I'm just
going to call it multimedia ok I'm going
to deselect it and let's find some
things that I want to put in there for
example album so I'm going to take this
and tap and hold and I'm going to do cut
and I'm going to scroll down to
multimedia go inside of it and and do a
paste tap and hold and paste
okay good and let's confirm that we did
exactly what we thought we were going to
so we're in the start menu and scroll
down there's multimedia and there's
album just like we want of course we can
go right into that okay and let's move
another program into multimedia here we
are let's take let's take camera and put
it into multimedia so tap and hold once
again do cut and go down to where'd it
go so now up here and do a tap and hold
and do paste of course if you're
connected the activesync you can also do
this from your computer if you go to my
computer you can drill into the folder
structure of your device just like we're
doing here although it may be easier to
organize lots of things on a desktop or
a laptop whatever you're using to
connect your device tube so that was a
quick tutorial on how to customize the
Start menu of your windows mobile device
it's quite helpful to be able to kind of
consolidate some of these icons so that
you don't have a massively long list by
default when you download a new program
it's added to this main directory and it
can fill up pretty quickly for more
