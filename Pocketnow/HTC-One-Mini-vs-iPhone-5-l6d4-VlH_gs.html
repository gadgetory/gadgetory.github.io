least that's what HTC wants you to
believe but it's a matter of perspective
the HTC One mini is still larger than
the Apple iPhone five Apple's flagship
for this year so in this video we're
going to compare the two and see how
they stack up let's go take a look you
don't have to be a rocket scientist and
you don't have to analyze and compare
these two phones too much to realize
that a mini phone the HTC One mini is
larger than Apple's flagship the iPhone
5 if we want to be fair and honest we'd
say that the iPhone 5 is the real mini
phone among the two the difference
between the iPhone 5 and the HTC One
mini is bigger than the difference
between the One mini and the one yes we
have compared the two ones we reviewed
the iPhone 5 we even had an after the
bus and a durability report so head over
to pocket now for all the details while
you're at it follow us on social media
to be among the first to see when our
videos and posts are up aside from a
fundamental difference that comes down
to Android versus iOS these two phones
couldn't be more different will tell you
exactly what we're referring to in this
comparison where we are looking at
hardware software and user experience as
well as the camera believe it or not
there are also similarities when it
comes to the HTC One mini and the iPhone
5 it's not all about the differences as
strange as it may sound aluminium is the
main material used in the construction
of these phones paired with glass on the
front the one mini also adds plastic
along the edges which embraces the
aluminum on the back and glass on the
front as well as two inserts on the back
that aside everything else is different
the iPhone 5 is more square toward the
edges and round towards the corners
while the HTC One mini is tapered along
the edges which makes it feel really
good in hand
precision drilled holes are present on
both devices along the bottom edge on
the iPhone 5 front firing top and bottom
on the HTC One mini and there's a
physical home button on the Apple
flagship while the HTC One mini has two
capacitive buttons for back and helm the
differences are even more prana
when we look under the hood generated by
the totally different ways Android and
iOS operate four inch IPS LCD screen
with 640 by 11:36 resolution on the
iPhone 5 for 326 PPI versus 4.3 inch
720p super LCD to display on the HTC One
mini for 342 PPI dual-core Apple a6 chip
clocked at 1.3 gigahertz versus a
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 cpu
running at 1.4 gigahertz 1 gig of ram on
both 16 32 64 gigabytes of storage on
the iPhone vs 16 gigabytes of storage on
the HTC One mini both non expandable 8
megapixel camera versus 4 megapixel
camera 1.2 megapixel front facing us is
1.6 megapixel
1440 milliamp hour battery versus 18
hundred million power pack and most
importantly ios 6.1.2 nioh s7 vs.
android 4.2.2 jelly bean with HTC Sense
on top of it long before iOS started to
become boring and before Android jelly
bean made the user experience very fluid
for Android users Apple's operating
system was considered by many the
benchmark for speed and fluidity
now since jelly bean Android is as fluid
as it can get and luckily HTC Sense on
the 1 mini doesn't bug it down will
refer to iOS 6.1.3 this video but you
should know that iOS 7 will soon be
available for the iPhone 5 we've already
published a demo of the upcoming OS on
the current Apple flagship so head over
to pocket now to see that whether iOS 6
is boring or just conservative and
consistent is up to you it also depends
on which side you are on Apple users
don't mind it Android users call it out
so we'll leave that up to you
however we'll tell you this much the
entire OS and user experience on iOS
looks like the app drawer on the HTC One
mini you've got a grid of 20 icons with
four persistent on the bottom and in a
world of widgets and live tiles it's
safe to say that iOS became the most
static OS on the market a drop-down
notification shade is there just like an
Android which you can customize this
contents can be tweaked to see
your needs and folders can be easily
created to organize your apps and weird
on the other hand has its widgets on the
HTC One mini since five is nicely
complementing the OS without being too
intrusive blinkfeed collects all the
information that is important to you
across several social media sources and
other content providers while the rest
of the home screens can be tweaked to
your liking with either stock widgets
and icons or free as well as commercial
solutions from the Play Store and since
we're talking about the stores iTunes
and Google Play Store are the two
leading content markets today there's
absolutely no use mentioning which is
the one containing more applications
once you pass a certain threshold it
doesn't really matter you can find
anything on both online markets we'll
have to give it to the HTC One mini when
it comes to the user experience and the
sheer pleasure of using the phone
whether it's bling feed the gallery or
the camera interface the one mini looks
more refined iOS on the iPhone 5 on the
other hand is more simplistic and
believe it or not the speaker puts up a
decent fight with boom sound on the
one-minute but how do these two compare
when it comes to performance let's learn
some applications and while we launch
them in the background will tell you
that it's a tie with some applications
launching fast around the iPhone others
under one minute we're comparing
day-to-day tasks like social media
Facebook Twitter Google+ email calendar
camera YouTube Spotify Maps and the like
we'll leave you with the comparisons
running in the background
there we go
now as far as the camera is concerned
the ultrapixel camera still does not
deliver and the iPhone 5 is clearly the
best shooter among the two and not
because it has doubled the megapixel
rating but because the shots are sharper
color reproduction is closer to reality
and stills are missing noise which
appears to be present on almost all
picture snap with the one mini we're not
saying the one mini is a bad camera
we're saying that it's worse than the
iPhone 5 we're letting the sample images
do the talking and you'll be the judge
of the camera quality surely they both
excel in optimal conditions bright sunny
outdoors but is the tricky lighting
shadows and difficult circumstances that
give a fair representation of details
and overall camera quality to draw a
conclusion is more difficult than one
would think aside from the eternal iOS
vs. Android debate these two phones are
different and behave differently there
is no word on carrier pricing for the
HTC One mini yet if we compare unlock
prices the iPhone 5 is more expensive
even if its price will drop once the new
iPhone lands in q3 if budget is your
only concern or limitation then the one
mini is for you however if you prefer to
look at the overall package and services
you'll have to do some research and see
the ecosystem offerings too
after all we're comparing a flagship
even if almost one year old with a
mid-range err bottom line you can't go
wrong with either phone just make sure
you can live with mediocre shots if you
opt for the HTC One mini everyone that's
gonna do it for today for the HTC One
mini versus Apple iPhone 5 comparison a
bonanza denied you can follow me on
Facebook as well as on Twitter and if
you like this video please give us the
usual thumbs up thank you very much for
watching until next time
