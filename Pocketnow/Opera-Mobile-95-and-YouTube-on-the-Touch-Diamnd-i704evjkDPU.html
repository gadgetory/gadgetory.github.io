calm or take a look at some of the
internet capabilities on the touch
diamond from HTC so the diamond includes
opera about as the default browser and
on the internet page you see bookmarks
up here here so you can jump quickly to
bookmark and you also have a YouTube
application so let's not as ur notice
how long this takes and we have a home
screen with a search bar and the HTC
logo and a bunch of icons at the bottom
they were there and these are ambiguous
not written in English so your mom's not
going to know what their I wouldn't
recommend this to beginners so that has
a auto hide buttons feature
automatically goes into full screen
often at you know opportune times so you
have to keep bringing back now that's
the back this is the star the middle one
is the tabs you can have three tabs the
house with the box behind it is the home
page and this is the menu
when you give settings downloads page
info history data lilla so let's load a
page
bookmark screen is nicely finger
friendly large buttons
this is a stop button this is your URL
this would be active if you had more
than one tab you can close the tab this
is the progress bar you can see we're
loading still to finish
ok
now you don't know what to do here this
is rendered zoomed out so I know it's a
vga screen and you might be able to
reach some of this if you put it really
close to your nose but you have to
figure out how to zoom in it turns out
that doesn't work so you have to double
tap and when you double tap it rear apps
text to fit that screen area and this is
better to read you can scroll by
flicking over here when you push them up
when you push and drag you see a little
black those your scroll bars see them
that shows you how far you have to go on
the other sides so that shows me there's
more over there and over here
oops sometimes it snaps to columns but
so we can scroll like this and it's
rendering more you can tap and hold and
get menu save image as send it if you
tap and hold in here you got a different
menu context-sensitive do slip text
selection and we tap an old again you
can copy it send it through SMS select
everything that's good but uh how do i
scroll I'm going to get out of text
selection mode all right
now let's I like to use hello
mobile sites a lot
so that is render zoomed out and i don't
know like that so it's like another step
to go through here and then sometimes
it's hard to click these things
and it's a little bit slow to type it's
not typing for a while
whatever how do I get out of here
also note on the favorites we have these
weird icons here too that is an ex
usually means delete this looks like a
tool so that must be settings plus I
guess isn't add a bookmark turns out
settings is actually modifying the
bookmark
so it's not really intuitive ambiguous
icons hard to understand people should
know that now the most annoying part is
getting out of the program exit do you
want to exert opera if I didn't want
eggs and opera I wouldn't have chosen
exit if I wanted to minimize it I would
have used the minimize button up here
I would kind of like a way to switch
this to Internet Explorer as the default
but whatever YouTube is another
application and its apps to load
now I've lost my start menu I've lost my
status icons I still don't have soft
keys at the bottom nothing is labeled I
have no idea what these things mean the
only thing I do understand is all videos
and we have videos here and I can't
scroll them I can select one can i
scroll them yes I can it just didn't
work before it's no scroll bar so I know
how long this list is program guide
I have pocket now I already saved as a
separate program guide
TV I guess means these are the videos
box with a flag in it means bookmarks
box with a clock on it means history
magnifying glass means zoom ir a-- no it
does museum mean search so here's
another problem
see how my text is predicting here if i
tap that my it goes away I don't have a
keyboard anymore so if I have to go up
here and my text is gone now I have to
retype that whole thing in search again
not very impressed with youtube
claim it is opens a player
you know play buttons
pause stop full screen and back
there's another icon there that's
settings
pressing YouTube to do anything and X
will get us out of here
alright that's enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
