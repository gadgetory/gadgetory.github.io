here at Aoife in Berlin at the LG booth
this time taking a look at the LG
optimus l9 latest in the L Series this
is a deceptive device because while it
actually feels quite small in the hand
quite like a midsize device this is
actually a 4.6 inch display which I
couldn't quite believe as you can see
take a look around the back which is
kind of textured back here Matt bezel
kind of non distinct side buttons here
the LG the newest iteration of the LG UI
is kind of interesting we've got the the
shortcuts up there in the app launch
drawer and all that kind of standard
stuff but we can also we have a couple
nice touches here if you tap on an icon
you can actually select from a bevy of
icons for for every particular icon
including from the gallery if you want
to create a photo icon you just select
from the gallery where you can take a
new shot we'll just select one of these
here and you will crop it into place and
if for some reason you wanted this lady
to be your internet icon you can make
that happen pretty cool in this example
not very useful obviously but there's
that there's also you can change things
like transition effects in the home
screen settings right now we're on
carousel we can do acordeon and it will
give you a preview and when we hop back
out here we've moved to the accordion
transition style some nice stuff from LG
and made all the more nice by the fact
that when you hop into the app launcher
everything is very very responsive in
spite of the skin it's something that we
also saw on the optimist view as far as
specs go we're looking at we're powered
by a 1 gigahertz dual-core omap 4430
processor is a quad-band device the
display is sorry it's 4.7 inches not 4.6
and it is an IPS qhd display camera on
the back is 8 megapixels the front
camera 1.3 megapixels and the usual
array of Wi-Fi direct bluetooth NFC and
up to four gigs of onboard storage and
expandable once again this is Michael
with pocketnow.com this the LG optimus
l9 here at Aoife in Berlin we have a lot
more coming to you as to stay tuned
meantime thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
