seven and its two variants will arrive
in May we have a confirmed model numbers
for two rumored Galaxy Note tens and
there 5g variants and alleged code names
for the Google pixel for in pixel Forum
Excel have emerged along with some
benchmarks I'm hanging out a bit out
it's Friday finally I actually really
needed some time off this is parking out
daily sponsored by the honor of u-20 the
official news today begin with deals as
a well not for everybody as Best Buy is
offering 48 hours of deals for their
members we're depending on what you're
looking for for example MacBooks you can
get up to 300 dollars off in addition to
Google products etc I'm not gonna bore
you with details you can follow the link
in the description to learn more now
let's talk about Disney as the company
just showed us something that I don't
really want but that I actually do so
think about it is we've heard about
their streaming service for the longest
time to compete with Netflix now we see
Disney Plus and so obviously it's Disney
products and it's pretty much the same
model that we see on Netflix the
interesting part is when you're
currently playing eleven dollars for
Netflix and you're just gonna pay $6.99
for Disney so that's what it gets really
cool we'll see how it goes
now let's talk about the Google pixel
for pixel for excel codenamed coral and
flame according to benchmarks and
information it seems that we should be
expecting these products very soon
obviously we're still speculating over
what details we're getting what we do
here is a qualcomm snapdragon 855 along
with six gigabytes of ram google finally
welcome to 2019 and 2018 and 2017 and
depending on what phone probably even
2016 so yeah that's also coming we just
need to know what and now let's talk
about the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 5d 2
without 5g obviously these will launch a
different periods or probably different
markets what's most important is that
even though we do hear that there are
two different sizes for the display
apparently they're not going to be much
different six point seven inches or
above on one of them 6.2 something
inches on the other
it's not like if we're really getting a
really small phone it's pretty much like
the Galaxy S 10 the mid-sized variant
which in my opinion is really cool we
also hear rubrics that we might even get
different sizes in the battery which is
even better I'll see about that
and finally the hottest nish that I have
to do with the oneplus 7 we've been
covering the possibilities of three
devices now we've got a trusted source
claiming that yes that at least two
devices will be launched in May that the
slogan for the event will be go beyond
speed which ok awesome and that there is
a third variant but we're not exactly
sure when we're getting that one and at
least my personal speculation is that we
probably getting two right now and then
the other one will be the T variant that
might be even that 5g phone that's just
me I don't have any solid information
for that that's my opinion but in the
comments down below let us know what you
think what do you think that oneplus is
planning on doing with these three
phones what do you think the launch is
going to be and what do you think they
mean by go beyond speed because what is
it speed of light or what let us know in
the comments down below I think we're
onto something cool and the rumors are
that we're getting this in May and folks
this episode of the pocket out daily is
sponsored by the honor of u-20 this has
proven to be one of our favorite phones
of the year thanks to its gorgeous and
unique back design a whopping 48
megapixel camera that brings an awesome
night mode along with an ultra clarity
mode for better photos in all scenarios
it's one of the first with a time of
flight sensor for state of the art 3d
sensing and better portraits it's also
one of the first with a hole-punch
design for the selfie camera and one of
the smallest we've seen in the market
price this plus it's powerful carry 980
processor just $600 and this is why this
phone is just hard to beat follow the
link in the description below to learn
more about what makes the honor of u-20
