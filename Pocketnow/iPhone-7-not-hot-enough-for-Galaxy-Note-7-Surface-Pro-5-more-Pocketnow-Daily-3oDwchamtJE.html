wasn't enough to pull note 7 switchers
away microsoft surface pro 5 is rumored
to reach a launch date very soon and it
seems to the Moto X is coming back but
with a different approach I'm hanging
netting that and no this is not the last
video of the year expect a recap for the
best news coming very soon this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with deals if you have not noticed
that one of our favorite phones and the
only most recommend this year is the lgb
20 well it is and right now it's fifty
percent often sprint and in addition to
that you also get an expandable storage
card I wouldn't even think about it
twice and then as we move on to rumors
those of us that have been asking
ourselves when the surface pro 5 is
coming yeah it is coming apparently but
we're gonna have to wait for it it seems
that q1 2017 is what's going to happen
it was actually do for the fall this
year but for some reason it seems the
Microsoft is perfecting something or
whatever we only got a performance space
for the surface book yes the surface pro
4 is currently one of my favorite
computers so you can only imagine how
much i want that surface profile we'll
see as well the spotlight over to the
Moto X those of you that thought that
the phone was dead it kind of currently
is but apparently it's not as we've got
some leaks in renders and video cat
images that show is that the Moto X is
coming back but apparently this is just
the thick moto Z kind of like the Moto Z
play we'll see what we get and have you
been waiting to get that official
samsung galaxy s7 nougat update the rest
of the world this Samsung is just
terrible about software updates news are
that well the beta is done today we
should be expecting the official update
in early january and i just wish that
samson could do something about this
like seriously and finally the very hot
news that they actually have to do with
samson but mainly because it turns out
that note 7 switchers didn't go for the
iphone they ended up getting other
galaxy phones at least in the majority
and according to analyst in the Wall
Street Journal the reason for this is
because the iphone is boring and proof
of that is actually the fact that supply
chain sources claim that Apple is
actually scaling down its production of
the iphone 7 for early next year because
there is
enough demand so listen it leads me to
the question of the day do you really
think that the current iphones are too
boring to replace the galaxy no 70 in my
case I I agree I agree they're good
phones but the note 7 was the note 7
