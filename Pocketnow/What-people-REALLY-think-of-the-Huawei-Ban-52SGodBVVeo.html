what are your thoughts on Google banning
Huawei devices what happened to our way
no news on Huawei so you wanted a good
discussion on Huawei let's do it I'm
home it'll be better with pocket now and
this is the market our daily recap your
best comments for this week and we had a
hard time picking them all they were
fantastic so on Monday the topic was the
initial suspension when will notified
everybody that they were no longer gonna
make business with Huawei
I asked you what do you think about this
resolution we had 600 comments US
government if you can't beat them banham
dude 103 likes and i am so with you warm
way has been pulling so many punches
when it comes to innovation lately that
yeah I do understand that probably other
companies are a little worried I mean
their growth has been significant of
love your comment no Huawei equals no
competition no competition equals no
innovation that's not good for consumers
exactly that's one of my biggest
problems I mean you know it's funny it's
not that I'm trying to defend Huawei
it's just there is still no evidence and
it's not the first time that the United
States does that and what so we're just
gonna ban a company out of the blue over
suspicions up dude I've got this Amazon
that go back there that knows exactly
what I want to buy and what we're not
gonna we're gonna call that correct
still waiting for evidence on Huawei
while plenty of evidence on US
government spying on the rest of the
world double standard like no other back
to work on shopping citizens of
capitalism all right that's gonna get a
little political we're not gonna go
there but dude you deserve your 133
likes and again that's exactly what I
mean
my biggest problem is leaving here and
saying yeah I want to buy some travel
pants as I was doing the other day and I
discussed on the recap sorry I'm like
weekly and just out of the blue boom all
the ads that are showing up on my phone
are now about travel pants what do you
know
Apple why would need to stop innovating
so they can sell high priced products
Trump hold my beer yeah sadly then on
Tuesday the topic was software you know
that always been given 90 days where
your phones or existing phones are gonna
be
working just fine and obviously there's
the biggest concern over what happens
after that I asked you do you think that
always should move to another operating
system for future devices or what we had
690 comments I want one way to make an
OS I'm bored of iOS and Android I'm
ready for a third OS and I bet I'm not
the only one I'm not gonna say that
Android or iOS are not good but I'll
tell you this much it's not that they're
getting boring but we already notice all
the limitations in Android for example
social media if I want to use Android
for any sort of video on Instagram it's
terrible I would rather use an iPhone
it's the main reason why I carry an
iPhone with me why does that have to
happen why isn't that at an OS level
things can be better so yeah if Huawei
makes its own OS incant perfected like
apple has man oh man you got the package
you know I guess my biggest question is
what would happen if Huawei makes a
really good OS and then they open-source
it and everybody in China moves away
from Android have you ever thought about
that
vanning Huawei should trigger nor long
to other companies like Samsung the
centralization Google has over Android
is too big I guess industry is going to
think away from Google that is my
biggest concern definitely not
necessarily because of Samsung because
you know Korean companies in the United
States they get along really well I
don't think that's gonna be a problem
it's just I thought that you know with
the whole United States perspective of
this is free Commerce and a free
everything and why is it that once a
company gets bad because things are not
going their way you know yes I think
that companies are gonna start
questioning why should they trust
Android and I think that's a big problem
a new OS might be a good thing for
consumers but believe me it's a
nightmare for developers you do nail a
great point I mean we had windows phone
and nobody adopted it we've seen Tizen
nobody adopted it so there is no
guarantee that it's gonna work unless
companies have motive but I believe that
now the motive has been shown if
companies are now going to be concerned
about the possibility of being banned
and not being able to access Android and
pretty much leaving all their eggs in
one basket I do see that there will be a
necessity for something else and then on
Wednesday the topic was the Karen
processors you know that now arm also
decided they weren't gonna make business
with Huawei even if they're in the UK
but it's us technology I asked you what
do you think I mean if the Karen dies
and Huawei is not gonna be able to use
processors by other companies what's
your perspective we had 1030 comments
thanks so much guys Trump an apple a day
keeps the doctor Huawei all right 300
legs that's all I'm gonna say
Huawei is in the endgame now it is a
difficult situation I mean if they can't
access technology what exactly is it
that they're supposed to do they're just
gonna kill their business out of the
blue this is just pushing Huawei to
become more self-sufficient yes and you
know the problem is that they have the
technology they currently have the cash
not exactly sure how long that's gonna
last but I mean they've done it in the
past the whole argument was that Huawei
was copying but now they hold so many 5g
patents I'm not exactly sure if that's
true anymore Facebook stores and sell
static Google tracks and stores and
sells data Huawei no evidence who can
you trust nowadays anyways yes I'm not
saying that any of this neither Huawei
or Facebook or Google is correct I'm not
saying that any of them is right I'm
just saying that all right if there is
evidence then sure just show the
evidence just prove and let's stop
hindering innovation again I'm not
trying to defend any company here I'm
just saying if we have the evidence then
consumers can be like yet no definitely
and that's not by Huawei phones I think
that that would be all of our reactions
if we could see that it's true and then
on Thursday the comments got the most
heated because we've been hearing that
the Chinese government has already
provided a formal claim there are
speculations by many analysts that are
already believing that Apple could be
banned from China as repercussion for
everything that's been happening and so
think about this no iPhones being
manufactured in China no iPhones being
sold there was a
dramatic hit I asked you what you
thought about this we have thirteen
hundred and seventy-three comments
thanks so much meanwhile somewhere in
South Korea Samson let them fight I I
see this is an absolute win Samson right
now is at the top of the food chain when
it comes to smart phones they're not
involved or not affected think about
that like for me it's like yeah it's
like if somebody like we've had no news
about this for many other companies oh
yeah I can imagine how that's going it
is fair of course don't throw rocks of
your houses made over-leveraged glass so
here's a thing and that's one of the
points that I made in that video China
has been blocking the access of Google
services Facebook and other apps to work
and China forever so why is it that
China now gets upset over the United
States doing the same thing
that's the thing and that's the reason
why I'm like neither thing is a good
thing everything here is a lose-lose if
China bans US companies from doing
business in China there's this whole
market that US companies can't access to
and so the United States is applying
that pretty much same principle and so
now we have a problem
I feel that China needs to change their
policy as well that's the thing that's
the reason why I'm telling you I can't
go in favor of one or in favor of the
other both are a problem if China could
shut down Twitter Trump would
immediately end the trade war but I
don't think he cares enough about Apple
SiC burned an eye-for-an-eye I guess and
it's funny because that is actually the
way the law in China works but think
about this I've been talking about all
the negative repercussions and how this
affects huawei for the past you know
five six minutes of this video now think
about the opposite is it fair for China
to block you as companies from doing
business in China it should be fair and
I feel that regardless of my thoughts
over the situation and if I think that
it's right or wrong I also feel that
there is a point it should be fair
across the board US companies should be
able to make business in every country
and every country should be able to do
the same in the United States period and
then finally I decided on Friday
you know what let's stop talking about
Huawei so much for the end of week we
were discussing about the Samsung Galaxy
fold since everybody's like what's going
on with Sam saying you know what guys
Best Buy has just decided to cancel
pre-orders and I'm like wait a second we
see pens for the full two where is the
fold one I asked you what you thought if
it's still in your top of mind we had
443 comments fold cool gadget but I
don't have a problem that this gadget
fixes
I hope they succeed in getting it back
because it's important to keep the
innovation wheel going true that I you
know I it's a beautiful product I found
it really cool to use it doesn't solve
anything for me but I love that train of
innovation I just I'm sad because I
really like the made X let's be patient
let them work out the kinks and release
it when they're ready no rush
true that you know fixing good products
you're doing good products it takes time
obviously there's testing and this
testing involves carriers every carrier
needs to check this product again that's
gonna take some time the fold isn't
going anywhere it's going to get
released and probably soon either June
or early July could be a possibility
promised we don't have any dates
I wasn't likely to buy a galaxy fold but
I still really want to see it I still
prefer its design over the main X you
know it's funny everybody that hasn't
touched them made access this and I'm
not saying that having an outer display
is a good idea oh man the moment that
outer display falls it's destroyed
instead I'm not saying that that's the
best solution I'm just saying that that
phone is so thin that it feels really
cool it feels like a regular phone and I
find that to be the smarter solution but
I totally get your points Samsung does
provide a smarter solution but then
again now their patent for the full two
is an outer folding display so who knows
where that's gonna go that's it for the
parkin out daily recap thank you so much
