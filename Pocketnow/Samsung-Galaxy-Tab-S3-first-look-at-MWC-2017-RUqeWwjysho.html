big way this year at MWC refreshing the
Galaxy Tab s 3 with improved fan
favorite features and a new design sleek
and slim the Tab follows the galaxy
phone build now with a glass back it's
sexy to look at though you'll likely
want to keep it in a flipped case or the
keyboard cover you know slippery and
fingerprints and all that but it is an
attractive look we haven't seen on
another slate for some time now is a
well traveled form factor the nine point
seven inch display at a resolution of
2048 by 1536 plus the juicy colors and
insane contrast ratio of Samsung's
AMOLED technology we know this we like
this but now we're also getting proper
support for HDR video and the slate will
be white listed by Amazon for their HDR
streaming titles new for the s3 Samsung
is sprucing up their audio game tapping
AKG as the experts to tune the new quad
speaker system orientation aware the s3
will shift playback for different
situations portrait video calls versus
landscape movie watching we can't play
this track without earning a copyright
strike but we were very happy to hear
what this thing could do and Samsung
continues to flesh out this ecosystem
now tablets also gain game centre
function gameplay recording and live
streaming additionally there will be LTE
enabled options available to the tablet
line from a Productivity standpoint
though the major improvement here might
be ad spent the same hardware for both
the s3 in the new Samsung book the six
features 4000 levels of pressure
sensitivity its tilt aware and never
needs to be charged I'm not the best
artist but even I could pull off a quick
comic doodle pretty easily more capable
hands will definitely appreciate these
improvements the new keyboard cover also
deserves the mention was improved he
traveled it had a very nice feel under
my fingers it just greased better than
most Liu - keyboards I've used and
connects quickly via pogo pins with some
stabilizer nubs these magnets are also
pretty sync and strong easily supporting
the weight of the s3 while holding still
USBC connector on board with a
respectable battery capacity and fast
charging to boot the tab at 3 looks to
be a formidable option for folks
interested in the tablet with solid
entertainment
but also looking for better productivity
features in their mobile kit expect
pricing and availability info to follow
