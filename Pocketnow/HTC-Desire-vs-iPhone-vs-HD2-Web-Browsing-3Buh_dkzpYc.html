pocketnow.com
and this is a three way web browser test
for the iPhone 3GS the HTC Desire and
the HTC hd2 all three of these devices
are best-in-class for their operating
system so of course we have Windows
Mobile Android and of course the iPhone
operating system so be very interesting
to see how these very powerful very
capable devices compete against one
another I should also mention that I
have set all of them to maximum screen
brightness so that if you're shopping
for any of these devices you can get a
sense for how they compare in terms of
color clarity and contrast and that kind
of thing so I'm going to turn on the
iPhone here and then here we go okay all
right and we've quit clinks ready to go
so let me see Mike and get these at the
same time okay and obviously the HTC is
going to struggle a little bit because
looks like we have an advertisement here
okay and it looks like the iPhone won in
that round let's zoom in a little bit to
this headline and pan around let's zoom
in looks like it's still loading but
there goes and over here we can't do a
multi-touch because Opera Mobile 10
doesn't support it so we can tap once
and it'll zoom in quickly
so let's tap on this headline see if I
can do it at the same time when we get a
little bit closer okay let's try it
there they go they're off
that's like the hd2 is iPhone finished
desire finished and the hd2 finished at
the last second okay let's let's go in
closer to another area and let's go on
to the hd2 review that's a very big page
and you can see that the multi-touch on
the HTC Desire is very good but not as
smooth as the iPhone so let's see if we
can click on this HD to review at the
exact same time okay try it good see
which one gets it first lots of images
on this page Wow desire finish first
followed by the 3GS followed by the HD -
very closely behind okay let's let's do
one more test on pocket now then we'll
load another page let's go to page 2
which has even more images in this HD to
review so get it positioned here all
right let's do it and they're off
desire finished first again beat the 3GS
up something up yet bit finished okay so
it looked like the desire finish first
followed by both of these devices at the
same time they're all very very good web
browsers let's flip down the page and
see how they look they all have very
smooth scrolling the desires a little
bit faster than the iPhone let me zoom
back out and the hd2 is about the same
speed of the iPhone a little bit slower
let's test screen rotation so we're
gonna zoom out a little bit
let's first test the desire with the
iPhone 3GS okay at a desire one there
let's do the other way the desire one
again let's test the desire with the HD
to see which one rotates faster okay go
zyre one let's try it this way
so it looks like the desire is the
winner in terms of screen rotation speed
test and it also beat the iphone two
times two out of three times in page
rendering I find that overall the the
web performance of the HTC Desire for
the most part Beach it beats the iPhone
3GS and the HD 2 on a regular basis
let's go to another website let's go to
Engadget here
very fast really fantastic fidelity here
get to see all the images just like they
were intended it supports Flash most of
the time a lot of advertisements come
through just fine you get this nice
full-screen view which you don't get on
the iPhone because you have the top and
bottom bar always present but on the HTC
Desire the browser works fantastically
well you don't get any checkerboard when
you scroll down quickly it's very
precise it's easy to zoom in the
browsing on the desire is one of the
best experiences that I've ever had on a
mobile device and and that's saying
something
so that's it for the look at the web
browsing experience on the HTC Desire
I'd say that undoubtedly the HTC Desire
is a fantastic internet browsing machine
coming up in the full review on
pocketnow.com we're going to talk about
battery life more about performance and
talk more about the overall experience
in using this device compared to other
devices to know exactly when the review
