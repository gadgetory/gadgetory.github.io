geun-hye are calm and this is another
episode the windows phone 7 app roundup
in which review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get to it marathon
is a pay for application that cost 99
cents on the windows marketplace what
this app allows you to do is to track
your progress based upon your exercise
skill so let's go here and we'll go to
play and now I can just set up one of
these recordings if I liked it so now I
will just set it for walk and the
training mode normal so we'll just start
that with play this and we can just
record over this previous recording that
I had and when you start to move it'll
record you're inclined your speed your
distance and all the other great stuff
stars 3d is a paid for application that
cost 99 cents on the windows marketplace
this app is great for anyone that likes
to look at astronomy or any other object
in the sky so here we have our entire
solar system and our galaxy right here
so I can change it to either be the
center as the Sun so now I can view the
Sun right here and it will show me the
Sun I can get a little bit of
information here so it shows me the
apparent magnitude and how far it is
away from us and we can also go back and
view other constellations of tones is a
free application veil on the windows
marketplace little I should create
simple rhythm tracks based upon where
you put these points on this grid so
here you if you can see it the
highlighted grid down below is the drum
track and above is the instrument track
so here I can begin typing some of these
here and hopefully and each
corresponding square equals a different
note so I can also go here it can change
the beats per minute and let's say that
I want to add a drum I can go down here
and add some from tumblers a free game a
bill in the windows marketplace the
object of games to move our little guy
over here into this little checkerboard
circle type object so what we want to do
is to scroll around and get our little
guy into this
area and if we do it within the time
limit without using up all 45 seconds
times three we get these three stars now
we can move on to the next level so we
can just scroll over here hope we don't
move too fast and if were able to get
our little guy into that area we beat
this level and we can move on to the
next as one of the most famous mobile
games of all time for any platform is
now available on Windows Phone 7 and
cost two dollars and ninety-nine cents
on the windows marketplace so the arms
of the games of course is to move our
little angry birds over here and to
knock down these pigs so let's see if we
can do this I'm going to overshoot and
hopefully we can bounce back and get all
three pigs to fall over and do the more
you're able to achieve and the least
amount of birds used you get more points
so let's see if they're able to do that
and my tops go over 60,000 so this has
