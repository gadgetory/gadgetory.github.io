pocket now calm and this is a further
look at software on the HTC HD Mini in
this video we're going to compare the HD
Mini with its big brother the hd2 we're
going to talk about web browsing and
we're also going to talk about
third-party applications and see how
they look on this h vga resolution
display coming up in the full review on
pocketnow.com we're going to talk about
battery life performance call quality
all those sorts of things but right now
let's get a little bit more into the
software aspect of the HD Mini so I'm
going to unlock the screen and let's
bring over the hd2 here both of these
are running windows mobile 6.5 point 3
that was a custom lock screen that you
just saw here so let's start off on the
home screen on the home screen between
the two devices you get more information
here on the hd2 you can access to your
Quick Links whereas on the HD Mini
because of the lower resolution screen
you have to flick upwards to see any
quick links at all let's go over to the
people tab which looks pretty much the
same you get to see two and a half rows
of pictures over here it's kind of two
and a quarter so not as much information
of course you can expect that with a
screen that is much much higher
resolution over here on the hd2 if we go
into email we get to see the same email
screen although on the hd2 you get to
see more screen information from here of
course on both devices we can delete the
messages or reply right from the screen
without actually having to drill into
the email application over here on the
internet tab the same exact screen we
can set quick tiles to quickly go to a
certain website or we can search Google
right from the top let's go over to the
calendar view and here we are on the
same day I'm going to go out to month
you calendars look very much similar
between the hd2 and the HD menu which is
nice the HTC calendar is really
brilliantly put together and it keeps
you from going into the ugly windows
mobile calendar which I don't even think
you can get to anymore because HTC is
covered up with this beautiful sense
interface let's go to the stocks tab
very similar stock stab a slightly newer
version here on the hd2 we can
tap on one of these in particular and
you get a lot more on the screen we can
tap to update data and there it goes and
on the hd2 we should be able to go into
doesn't look like we can go into
landscape actually on on either device
we can go into landscape so let's go
back but here in photos we can flick our
pictures upward very smooth animation on
both devices but where things get a
little bit different is that on hd2 you
can rotate and get this beautiful
animation but on the HD Mini it it
doesn't do that so you have to stay in
this portrait view and you can't get
into this really nice-looking landscape
view speaking of pictures let's go to a
picture and do some pinch to zoom
because both of these devices have
multitouch maybe that's not the best
picture it doesn't look to be high
resolution enough let's go over to the
scene ok great so pinch to zoom works
very well on the hd2 very precise on the
HD Mini for some reason it's very slow
and you can probably see what I mean let
me do that again on the hd2 nice and
precise and on the HD Mini it's a little
bit slower it's not as sensitive and I
think they do that because the screen is
smaller but it takes more finger
movement to get the pictures to move it
almost feels kind of numb so let's go
back and that will flip over and press
the back button there ok let's go into
weather and so I'm gonna go to weather
here and weather here and it is not
picking up my location so I'm going to
real quick add a location let's go to
Philadelphia ok there we go and flick
upwards ok so here's Philadelphia on
both devices looks pretty much the same
things are smaller on the hd2 you have
to squint a little bit to see the high
and low temperatures but basically the
animations are the same it actually
looks like the graphics have been
updated just a little bit here on the HD
Mini so let's go over to the music tab
and take a look at what we have there
and says no music found will go into
library and see how they differ in terms
of this library again they've updated
sense a little bit so now these are
colored really
nice looking icons over here on this
older version of windows mobile 6.5
point 3 you really don't get those
colorful icons let's go back ok let's
continue down let's go to footprints
something that I really don't think many
people use and just to get an idea of
how they compare in terms of graphical
power on the hd2 very smooth animation
and on the HD Mini you just saw it right
there kind of choppy I'm actually
surprised it was that shop it usually
it's a little bit smoother than that so
let me go back here and and it looks
like it's actually unresponsive this
happens actually more than you would
then you would hope on the HD Mini it
freezes up ok there it goes it's just
responded probably didn't help that I
was tapping the screen a million times
but so here it comes so I'm going to go
back over to footprints something is is
slowing down this device so I'm going to
tap and hold up here really quickly go
to the task manager so overall compared
to the hd2 it's easy to see how the HD
Mini is sort of a lite version of the
hd2 it's lacking in sort of the power
the screen resolution isn't even close
to what you get on the hd2 it is a
similar experience at the end of the day
if somebody wants to have a lower priced
device like the hd2 that is smaller and
and perhaps not as as flashy so let's go
on to the next thing let's talk about
web browsing on the HD Mini I'm going to
zoom in on the screen a little bit and
let's slide over to the the internet tab
and I'm going to tap on pocket now and
it's going to load up pocket now calm
right in the browser and we're going to
see how it performs
okay so it's still going while it's
loading it looks like it just sort of oh
it finished right there I'm going to
rotate to landscape and takes a little
bit of time not very fast here and we
can pan around very smooth we can do the
capacitive pinch to zoom but again it
feels kind of numb as if they got the
algorithm wrong that determines how much
to zoom in depending on how much how
wide your fingers are so here it is
here's pocketnow.com let me load it up
on another device and we can do a speed
comparison once we click on one of these
permalinks so here we are on the iphone
this is actually beta software this is
iphone four point oh so it's very likely
that it may not be as fast as it
normally is which would be beneficial to
to the HD Mini here so here it comes and
again we can pinch to zoom we can pinch
to zoom smoother on the iPhone but it's
happening SAT the exact same time after
this is done loading reaction I'm going
to force it to stop and see which one
wins they're both on the same Wi-Fi
network right now so you can tell that
the screen on the HD Mini is actually
crisper and clearer I've always found
the screen on the iPhone any kind of
grain though and here they go
and the iphone has finished it looks
like looks like the the HD Mini has over
all loaded the page but it's still
trying to get something there and we can
pinch and move around on the screen like
so let's go to another website on the HD
Mini let's go to engadget.com and by the
way in a second we're going to talk
about the keyboard usage okay here it
comes this is an older version of opera
mobile this is properly version 9 or so
and if you get the newest version of
opera mobile 10 it as opera turbo on it
which increase increases or decreases
page load times so if you have an HD
Mini and you want to get some better
performance definitely check that out so
here we are on engadget still loading
but it's loaded for the most part we can
go into landscape that goes and
scrolling is pretty smooth we can you
know double tap to zoom in it reflows
the column the text looks good and we
can zoom out so overall a pleasant
browsing experience on the HD mini the
small screen makes it difficult to
really have precise navigation and
against that pinch to zoom algorithm
doesn't seem to be quite perfected yet
so I'm going to get out of this okay so
let's talk about keyboard the text entry
on the HD mini so we're going to go into
we're going to go into Microsoft Office
and click on word mobile
okay so here we are we've the standard
HTC keyboard but the story here is that
the screen is a lot smaller so it's not
as easy to use so I'm going to try to
type the quick brown fox okay so pretty
accurate the quick brown fix I didn't
quite get everything there you can
actually change the language on the fly
which is sort of new for the HTC
keyboards between French Dutch and some
other ones like Italian hear something
else that is new for this keyboard is
that the d-pad arrows are gone you have
to tap and hold this to get the d-pad up
and it kind of appears above the
keyboard now we do have a landscape
keyboard which is a little bit better
okay so if i go into landscape okay here
it is here we get the landscape keyboard
but you really have no room to see what
you're typing it's so small because the
screen is such low resolution let me do
a test here the quick brown fox so again
relatively precise but it's not the best
keyboard in the world because of the
small screen and the low resolution on
the display so now let's talk about
third-party applications now that you've
seen the comparisons with the hd2 and
some web browsing beautiful weather
animation there by the way so I'm going
into the start menu now and you can see
sort of the included programs on here
very standard stuff I'll talk about the
YouTube application in a minute I've
installed some apps on here such as
pocket informant which is one of the
best ways to to experience a different
kind of calendar on your device i
installed the trial and i'm just click
no and the point of me showing you this
is that for some reason even though
pocket informant was not made for the
screen resolution it works we can go to
the different views and I've been in
this program for a while and everything
seems to work on the screen so let's get
out of here i'm going to show you in a
situation where it doesn't work so i
loaded on here skyfire which in our test
is the fastest mobile browser for
windows phone and watch what happens you
can see off the bat that it's not
formatted for this kind of screen and
then i'm going to wait a second and
you're going to see an error message pop
up
out of memory I'm not sure if this is
because it's confused with the screen
resolution or because the HD Mini just
can't handle it doesn't make much sense
because sky fireworks on really any
devices but it's a shame that you can't
use skyfire on the HD Mini and speaking
of third party applications i loaded on
spb mobile shell which is the
award-winning interface replacement for
windows mobile watch what happens when I
go back to the home screen this is
mobile shell it just doesn't work on the
screen in fact it is completely broken
so you can't use mobile shell on this
resolution screen unfortunately the
third party application story on the HD
Mini is not good there are several
applications that I've tried that just
don't work because of this weird 480 x
320 display so that was another look at
the HTC HD Mini we've got a lot more
coming up in the full review on
pocketnow.com if you want an HD many of
your own you can get one right now at
clove co uk they ship worldwide and they
have a stock that they just received
this week actually that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
