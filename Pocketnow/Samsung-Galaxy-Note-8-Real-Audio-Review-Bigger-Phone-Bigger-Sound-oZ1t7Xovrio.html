Carlos bag now here for pocket now and
it's time we take a listen to the Galaxy
Note 8 brought to you by D brand got a
throw a quick shout-out to AT&amp;amp;T for
helping us out with an additional review
unit just so Jaime isn't the one having
all the know date fun Samsung hasn't
always had the best relationship with
sound but this year thanks to
improvements in Qualcomm chip set
numerous phones have been able to
produce much higher quality audio output
galaxy s7 - Galaxy S a samsung went from
being a fairly mediocre performer to
being significantly more competitive
we're expecting similar improvements for
the note 8 so let's start this off with
some speaker chat Samsung might have
moved over to dual cameras but we're
still dealing with a mono bottom firing
speaker this is going to sound about as
good as we can expect a single speaker
solution to sound and it's going to
sound exceedingly similar to the Galaxy
s8 let's take a listen
really wanted to mess with you guys and
maybe flip the audio samples or just use
one audio track for both phones but that
would have been a really jerky thing to
do the note 8 represents another data
point that mono audio is probably as
good as it's going to get but shifting
gears we've got a big phone big price
tag should we expect big headphone audio
and again the node 8 performs almost
identically to the galaxy s 8 it's not
necessarily a bad thing we've got true
blue 32-bit audio reproduction means
this phone can generate frequencies of
sound that dogs cannot hear compared to
the galaxies that came last year and
before we've got much better signal
reproduction a lower noise floor a
better signal-to-noise ratio and a much
higher dynamic range those quality
numbers are looking pretty good but they
do fall shy of a phone like the LGV 20
and that's another area we were hoping
to see some improvement on the note 8
and that's in the amp output like the s8
before it represents a nice little bump
over the phones from last year but it's
still outpaced by a phone like the 1
plus 5 and it's absolutely rocked by
phones like the axon 7 and the V 20 if
you're listening on consumer-grade
headphones low impedance earbuds and
headsets this isn't really gonna be much
of an issue this is still plenty capable
of driving that tier of audio solution
it's more the idea or the philosophy
that someone's spending this much on a
phone might also be the type of consumer
who would be looking to invest more in a
pair of headphones happily Samsung does
include a really nice pair of Samsung
earbuds tuned by AKG at the time this
video was shot these are probably the
best earbuds you can find included in
the purchase price of a phone and I'm
also happy to see the return of this
adapt sound preset manager built into
the sound settings on the phone it's not
as techy cool as HTC's ear scanning
solution but I would highly recommend if
you're picking up a Galaxy s8 or a note
8 take the time to go through this
listening profile it takes a couple
minutes as the phone sends a bunch of
signals through your ears and then what
you get out of that is a personalized
tailor-fit sound profile for your ears
and the headphones you're listening on
it's a nice little consideration for an
activity that a lot of people take for
granted on their phones make your audio
fit for you but I rambled on enough
let's wrap this up where does that leave
us with the audio on the Galaxy Note 8
Samsung continues to earn our
improved of the Year award from where we
were last year to this year this is
excellent evolution so when we're
talking about a note in that Vanguard
feeling that Vanguard experience we were
hoping to see just some tweaks to things
like amp output on the headphone jack
and with the phone this large it would
be nice to have some sort of split
speaker solution a la HTC
maybe a high frequency sound coming out
of the earpiece and low frequency sound
coming out of the bottom ultimately
though we are happy to see Samsung
delivering more capable hardware it's a
really nice feeling holding a premium
product an expensive product which is no
longer shamed by the headphone dongle on
an iPhone a built-in headphone jack on
an expensive phone should be able to
outperform a dongle man that glass back
does a great job reflecting my studio
lights showing off all my fresh finger
prints from every time I touched the
phone if only we had some D brand skins
to help protect that rear glass and add
a bit more grip when I go out to use
those dual cameras a check out D
