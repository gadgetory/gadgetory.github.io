superphones some ladies feel their calls
on phablets but it takes some real gall
a real desire to challenge society's
conventions to make your phone calls on
a tablet a tablet you hold up to your
head among other topics that's what
we're talking today on episode 04 3 of
the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocket now calm where we
discuss smartphones tablets in the state
of mobile technology in the year 2013
I'm your host Michael Fisher editorial
director at pocket now and today I'm
joined all the way from aradia by
managing editor Anton d naudia good
morning to you sir good morning good
afternoon good evening everybody and
we're also joined by senior editor and
chief Carolinian Taylor Martin hello to
you had a and welcome aboard gents we
have a lot to discuss in terms of weird
off the wall stuff and not a lot of
headline news which is kind of an
interesting inversion from the past few
weeks wouldn't you say I'm personally
I'm looking forward to it yeah i'm
looking forward to a podcast that it's
only maybe ten percent or less dedicated
to talking about the galaxy s cool we
want to kick it off with a thought
thread courtesy of managing editor anton
and that is relating to the teaser that
i postulated a second ago talking on a
tablet Tony your phone pad review is up
and we all want to hear your thoughts
well it's been an interesting experience
I can tell you that much i've been i've
been using it as my daily driver from i
think it was two fridays back up until
the moment i published my review and
since i've been using it since friday
i've used it also as my daily driver for
clubbing activities for for hiking
activities and for everything else oh
well everybody was pulling out their
iphones and their HD season samsung's I
just slapped the slab on the on the
table I almost bumped over a bottle of
I'm not gonna make any announcements of
what it was so thing is thing is I would
still be using this
film pet as a daily driver if my
particular unit had a back facing camera
and and this is a small rent of mine the
entire point behind the assist foam pad
is that you leave your phone at home so
that you can take your phone calls on a
device which is both a tablet and the
phone I can agree to that but now since
you don't have a back camera you leave
your phone at home you take the phone
pad but you still have to bring your
phone or a camera with you because you
cannot take any pictures so that's just
kind of dumped from from from masseuse
yeah i agree i mean if it's if it's
positioning itself to be a smart phone
replacement it should definitely have a
primary camera built-in and i have
thought of this people not only laugh at
you they the laughter goes away after
your first phone call people people
heavily frown upon the phone bed and
nothing surely the phone pad as the
asuste product the the entire concept of
talking on something so outrageous that
they don't know what it is so i think
that the problem with the phone bed is
and then the products like is society
itself and i want to ask you this guys
we know that there is no limitation to
including phone and earpiece
functionality on a tablet still only a
couple of OEM s do it do you think it's
is the social factor Taylor I'm gonna
let you go yeah sort of but it's also
kind of a an efficiency thing sure if
you can carry and s 7 inch or 8 inch
tablet and feel comfortable with that by
all means I think it's a valid option
but it still it looks strange and that's
the whole social part that that we're
trained to think that holding any other
device up to our head looks normal but
if you stand back and think about it if
someone from 50 years ago 60 years ago
saw us and holding something up to their
head all the time like this or staring
at something that we carry in our
pockets and internet tell people look at
me when I will hold up not my tablet to
my ear but my brand new Galaxy s4 zoom
camera to my ear I mean come on
oh yes last year he was talking on his
tablet now he's talking on his camera
what the hell is wrong with him I felt
ridiculous enough just for the 10
seconds it took to take that picture
with the galaxy camera up against my
head for the galaxy camera as a daily
driver peas I kind of imagined doing
that on a consistent basis go ahead
Taylor sorry you're not done but but no
i mean if if someone from 30 or 40 50 60
it doesn't matter anybody from the past
beyond the the birth of the cell phone
that i'm sure they said the same things
when the first cell phone came about you
know the bag phone why would someone
carry a bag and hold this thing up to
their to talk to someone i've got a
phone at home you know so i don't know
maybe it's a little different but i
personally would never carry a tablet as
a smartphone replacement to hold up to
my head to answer calls i wrote an
editorial about it and i'm fine i take
calls on my ipad all the time I'm okay
with with plugging in a headset or
bluetooth headset or something that
doesn't have me holding a huge device up
to my face so but that that's an option
I mean the HTC One and the s4 have an
infrared blaster you don't have to use
it just slap on your piece there don't
you don't have to use it but those three
people me the biggest fan probably the
sous guy who came up with the idea of
the phone pad and that one single guy
from Samsung who against all naysayers
slept an earpiece on the note 8.0 us
free can enjoy it that's a good point i
think though that like you have to
factor in cost cutting like four
different models like I don't think the
nexus 7 would have been as cheap as it
is if they had built in some of these
extras that some people wanted like a
primary camera or like an earpiece you
know I mean I feel like at some point
you have to say well are we making a
complete product or are we making a
product that's going to sell for much
less money and that's going to be its
differentiating factor you know and I
but I think they've managed to keep the
price cost excuse me the cost down on
the phone pad right that's absolutely G
I paid for it 333 dollars but the it's
an expensive country so you might be
able to get it for 249 I wonder what it
would be without the earpiece you think
it'd be like the 22 239 to time without
the earpiece but maybe with a stronger
faster processor right all right
and there's a lag they won't see here's
the thing with here's the thing i get i
get Tony why you why you would want to
do that I think it's like a
simplification factors like okay I'm
gonna carry this one device I've got my
nexus 7 actually read here on the table
so I can so I can sort of get a feel for
for what you're talking about Erik wins
yeah exactly and and by the way a sous
is not an idiot so I want to make clear
that you know they may not be
positioning the phone pet as a total
replacement if they haven't built in a
primary camera but if you're going to
use it that way like my problem would be
primarily in pocket ability but that
social factor would definitely creep in
and to answer your question Tony yeah I
think I think it's definitely a side
effect of the way we are we are
conditioned to think of what as normal
as Taylor was saying but also as a
result of that I think we've all been
we've all grown used to people trying to
make a splash yeah people trying to show
about and any time back in the day when
people would have their super clear
cases on their phones with the flashing
LEDs or some kind of really ostentatious
like bejeweled casing I'd roll up and be
like oh you are trying to impress me
okay I feel like I would feel the same
way about someone who rolled up to like
my dinner table at at the club or
something like I wasn't talking on a
phone and you were in this situation you
were telling us about people calling you
out on the streets when when you use the
note 2 for the first time mm-hmm oh all
the time and actually that still happens
consistently with the note 2 whenever I
take it out people are like what is that
man yeah I had someone asked me if my
note 2 was an iphone what yeah really
yeah yeah i just i reached over the
table and smacked them with wit with
your samsung iphone yeah yeah so no uh
what right now good okay cuz we agree um
no I I totally agree with Michael um but
i'm not against using like i said i'm
not against it i just the whole holding
it up to my head thing I just yeah and
it's just I don't know it doesn't seem
efficient for taking calls I mean would
you do the same thing with the 10-inch
I would know nikken net hope I mean I
could hold that with one hand but but
you cannot yeah ninety-nine percent of
the people and kenna Tony what's the
story on like hand fatigue when you're
doing that like you're holding nothing
up to your head and I mean sure for two
minutes is fine but what if you're
having like a 45 minute phone call now
if I extend my bone completely and I
laid the phone bed vertically i'm having
like more than one inch on the left and
work more than one inch on the right so
i can easily grasp it without any
problems but then again i have big hands
yeah and it's not a heavy device not at
all right did I forgotten is it lighter
than the nexus 7 or yeah I from the top
of my head I cannot tell you but it's
let's see it's it's about that wait okay
well yeah it's it's an interesting
experiment it's definitely it I think
it's instructive in that it's showing us
the threshold of the boundaries of kind
of what we will tolerate both as users
and as society in general like I don't
see the 7-inch phone catching on but it
that gives us an interesting delineation
point where it's like okay so eventually
these phablet makers will reach this
this this cutoff point and how big can
screens really get is I think a question
that's been asked for for over a year
now and in the in the landscape and it's
like well I don't know you can you can
make bezels slimmer you can get you get
the device to almost an all screen you
know configuration with fancy software
tricks to prevent false touches from
grabbing the unit and stuff but like how
big can it actually get I don't think
you can get as big as seven inches I
think the cutoff is somewhere south of
six inches myself yeah well let's see
mega you know well we also said the same
thing about the original Galaxy Note
everybody said why would anybody ever
want a 5.3 inch phone why nobody's ever
going to when you use that it's way too
big nobody's gonna want it and look at
it and look at the galaxy note 2 right
that's mean is I'm sorry go on then no I
was done the truth is that that the note
2 while being an excellent product is is
not tablet enough it is still a big
phone and what makes it so popular I
think it's not its actual physical size
but the s-pen function
so even though we are going beyond five
inches it is not tablet enough I don't
know III think that it's I think at its
size more than the S Pen at least here
like in America I was sitting next to a
guy at a at a theater function recently
who's a acquaintance of mine and he
pulled out his note to oh my god he just
got that didn't you he's like yeah I'm
like so I just kind of interview him for
a little bit i'm like so what was the
driving force there you know and he's
like well you know it's so big and then
I I told him I was like I wrote a piece
once called what was it called jumbo
phones no well yeah I've written about
40 pieces of that word in the title know
it was like oh yeah but with phones this
big who needs a tablet is what it was
and you know he was like that's exactly
right because I was thinking about
buying a tablet but then I figured you
know why why invest in a tablet and the
smartphone I'll just get this and this
will serve both those needs and I get
that man you know I'm looking at the
note 2 right now as well and and
definitely if I if I was on a real
budget but I still wanted a smartphone
and a tablet i would consider the galaxy
note 2 to serve both those needs because
it's it's it's almost the best of both
so I know it's not one I just add
Michael what yeah I was about to say I
know it's not my job to wrap the topic
up but I'd like to wrap it up with a
question to you guys it is your job to
rep is your topic what's the biggest
size device you will put up to your ears
in screen size are in screen size if
they were to get the bezel down I would
still put up a I would go as high as six
inches if it had an almost invisible
bezel so the mega 5.8 yes then i got 6.3
no yeah ya round there you're right yeah
that that's that's where else it right
now yeah so I'll try anything um i would
try taking call with a tablet 8 inch
tablet up to my head but uh chances
aren't probably not going to like
anything much larger than the note 2
just for reasons of carrying it so right
i don't have a belt clip or anything
that's going to hold a tablet and I
don't carry a bag everywhere so yeah
yeah gentlemen thank you ya know Tony
thank you for your phone pad thoughts of
them I think your review came out on a
show where you were not on the air and I
was
like I want to hear more of your
thoughts and then I didn't oh yeah cuz I
kept interrupting you right yeah well
interrupting Taylor that should be a
joke serious shouldn't interrupting
Taylor Martin man you have no idea there
was a long like ongoing joke with all my
friends all through high school my
family everything every time I open my
mouth it just so happened and this still
goes on today every time I open my mouth
something would just happen somebody
would cut me off or some loud car or
truck would drive by as soon as I'm
talking and what I've done the noise is
gone are you seeing it happens perfectly
every time I was sitting at the coffee
shop yesterday talking to a friend and I
was like hey man you know what and he's
like what and i go to talk and the
coffee grinder goes off for like I'm
gonna have I'm like how in the world ah
so if we made a show or a joke like that
it's not my first time there wasn't it
yeah gonna say tell you could probably
have your own like you know reality show
probably good so just follow you around
women over over the shoulder cam all day
like being frustrated with Taylor Martin
yeah like I go to talk and just yeah
whatever it is I'm done facts guy
capable yeah so I take that out on the
podcast and just cut you off remind me
next time we were on the year review or
something like that I'll just break out
the centerboard and make sure overwrite
all your stuff I want to change up the
run down a little bit Wes we cheap as we
jump into the Android section our first
section of the podcast because we
finished up talking about the fonepad
and big smartphones and phablets and so
I want to just briefly touch on what
Taylor Martin thinks the galaxy note 3
needs to be to avoid being a
disappointment and we know what the
commenters think oh yeah yeah I got
ripped another one in the comments oh my
god yeah yeah yeah I'm like I could
comment like hey guys in that comment
thread and they just be like all thumbs
down yeah how are you guys that's the
most confusing thing about about our
Disqus environment is that like somebody
will post the most helpful comment ever
I know I've said this before but like
it'll be a piece that asks a question
it's like here's this problem that many
people have been having with their
whatever their nexus 4 and
somebody who replies with exactly the
way to fix it and like a smiley face and
also compliments for everyone will get
like 18 down votes meanwhile like
meanwhile somebody who comes along and
says like at least it's better than
iphone and the other thing else will get
like 26 upvotes it's like what what
people using BOTS is there something I
don't understand about gaming discuss I
don't know I have no idea but um in
regards to the question or gedit Oriole
um out of all the things that I could
think of obviously it needs to be
upgraded to 2013 specs this is the
notoriously poor time that note 3 note 3
so it needs to be upgraded to 2013 specs
that's a that's a given because any
upgrades going to be upgraded to new
specs mm-hmm but there were rumors
saying that Samsung is quote unquote
worried about their build quality and
the materials they use I don't know how
much I agree with that or believe the
rumor but um that's something that I
hope and would wish that Samsung would
do is reevaluate the materials they use
and I made it clear in the article that
plastic is not bad there are great
plastics out there to use it's the
plastics that Samsung uses and the
coating they put on their plastics they
make them feel yeah yeah I was gonna say
feel so cheap most definitely that hyper
glazes is to blame for most of it and
not the material itself yeah yeah and in
the comments were oh my god who cares
about the build quality who cares about
what it's made of it's all about the
other parts of the phone right yeah and
maybe you know I see and I just replied
right before we came on the air i just
replied to one of those comments where
it's like know you guys weren't saying
the galaxy s3 was badly built until the
one came along and i was like actually
no that's not true here's a link to my
review where I complained that it feels
cheap in the hand if one came along
before the s3 right yeah right and to
know I hated the galaxy s3 oh all the
galaxies oh yeah well you said us three
edges no but I meant the three yeah
we're now in a confusing spaghetti bird
flu stuff not the one x ro not the one x
21 in first yeah sorry yes yes yes ooh
no I hated the one no I hated the build
of the galaxy s3 from day one touched it
and I'm like you
yeah and I not to note no spoilers and I
promised my review I've done my research
my review but we will be subjective this
is the regatta buddy AT&amp;amp;T branded galaxy
s4 correct yes yes it's very subjective
I've taken you know a very broader view
of the device and objective what
objective yeah I don't know I'm so gonna
do this on every show now less objective
yeah but I picked up the phone and I
told I think toni ann michael this um I
picked up the phone when it came in on
Friday and I might man this is literally
just like a galaxy s3 just more square
and put it back in the box I just
dropped it back in the box finished what
I was doing and I'm like I just I can't
but you don't get that impression from a
phone that's built really well it's that
first impression that really just kind
of seals the deal for at least for me
yeah right absolutely I'm I had a friend
who was looking at getting the s4 she's
been like I won't ts4 Ont s4 can't wait
when is coming out when is it coming out
well i sat down at the coffee shop
yesterday she came in and I had the s4
and the one and I've been telling her um
you know there are other phones out
there too but you know don't don't make
your decision before you even use the
phone just you know wait and I hand it
the two phones to her and I said which
one feels more expensive and she's like
the one it's like exactly like the
galaxy s4 is the more expensive device
it's more premium in regards to
specifications and its utility and the
features but it feels like a mid-range
device it really does they were would
you have had the same opinion about the
s4 if the s4 would have been the S free
now this is a dumb question let me
rephrase did you get it no okay so are
you having this impression of the s4
because you know the S free is the same
and you hate the materials on it so
let's say that the s4 is the first
samsung s device to use this coding this
design this everything
and totally phrases even further have
you had this opinion of the S free last
year yes I said you could probably look
it up on Twitter I said as soon as it
was announced I said the galaxy s3 looks
like a feature phone mmm yeah and in it
and it kind of does and the s4 is less
so or less looks less like a feature
phone but yes to answer your question
yes I didn't like the build or design of
the galaxy s2 or the original Galaxy S
series I didn't like the s3 and I don't
like the s4 as far as building quality
go yeah so we're talking about I was
looking up my review of the galaxy s3
for sprint last year and I think Taylor
you and I are making the same point is
what I said last year was here's what
we're saying this isn't a mid-range
gingerbread device for high schoolers
this is a six-hundred-dollar flagship
class super phone and in the hand it
doesn't feel like it yeah that's a shame
you know yes exactly it yeah it's like
getting a sports car and the interior of
the sports car not being leather but
being like a vinyl pleather right and
and all the dashboard is just a cheap
like matt flimsy plastic yeah the
outside of the car is like a cheap
plastic you know knock on me inside of
the door and it's hollow like that yeah
it feels cheap yeah Billy if you pick up
the phone like the s4 and you kind of
like slap it in your palm the whole
thing just kind of vibrates and you can
actually hear it vibrate yeah well
there's like this time I can imagine at
this exact point the comments on YouTube
right exactly gonna kill us and also but
also and yeah we have to make the point
that they got good Samsung is not the
prime event is not the single offender
here you can do that with the Lumia 920
which feels like a tank but of course it
had that problem with the the battery
wasn't taped down well enough for some
toys rattle around like other
manufacturers do this but two points one
you can't say that aesthetics are not
important to a smartphone if you want to
be you find we're all geeks here that's
great we're all different flavors of
geek and that's cool but aesthetics are
important for something you carry around
with you all day for two years whether
it's how it feels in the pocket how it
feels in the hand there's a lot of
people care how it looks so you know eat
it or second point is this um how
eat it how does this apply to the city
to the note note 3 Taylor because you
were making a good point that you feel
like the note 3 should be the pioneering
force that takes samsung to the next
level of aesthetic design or hardware
design but you also i think don't think
that that's likely right I don't think
it's likely and I think actually the s4
should have been that I yeah yeah it
would good what right then it is here
the thing is I was having this
conversation last night at bar trivia
with a friend of mine where it's like
we're talking about iphone vs galaxy the
galaxy family and we're like yeah well
this is what Apple and Samsung have
fallen into this pattern of doing right
they do break through one year
incremental improvement the next year
break through the year after that and
then an iterative upgrade so and I
understand that actually because of
contracts and and the rate at which
people normal people buy phones sure but
how does the note 3 fit into that though
cuz what and what has the note been so
far note 1 was just like oh my god what
is this thing and now and then note 2
was like oh this is way different
because guys it was slimmer right it was
it was easier to hold it was much more
smartphone than weird kind of shot in
the dark wyd phablet right yeah the to
put it guess in a better perspective the
original note was like the ipad mini
it's really wide but yeah you know you
go to like the Nexus 7 and that's that's
what the note 2 feels more like if you
compare it with like a tablet because
it's you're not losing a lot of display
but you're you're actually getting more
display but the actual physical size is
bigger you know I'm can I can I just get
throw this out there real quick and I'm
sorry I know I asked you a question I
Tony you have one too Taylor's got when
we all three of you have used note 2
rather extensively do you guys feel like
this is going to be the next the next
like vaunted superfone that people are
already getting nostalgic about losing
because I feel like there's a huge fan
boy class for this phone that is just
above and beyond its almost equal to the
fanboy level surrounding the hd2 you did
oh yeah I definitely I definitely I
don't want to like my friend was asking
me the other day
there was a guy posting an HTC one on
craigslist for like five hundred dollars
I think and I I was like man I could
just trade my note 2 and some cash for
that my thing I really don't want to get
rid of my note 2 I don't use it I don't
use the outside of videos but you don't
want to get rid of it I do not want to
get rid what about you Tony I'm sorry I
was muted on that speaking and then
realized I was muted and then I caught
oh there we go uh I like the note too
but I'm not a huge fan of the note 2 and
i believe the note 2 is not by by far
it's not at all more special than the s3
just like the note 3 it will not be more
special than the s4 about the only thing
which ties me to the note 2 is its
exceptional battery life as you and I
Michael have experienced in Barcelona
and as I have recently expanded it to a
sixty four hundred million power battery
that's the only reason bonita yeah
that's the only reason keeping me tied
to the note 2 or the no.3 if it comes
out in august-september if it will
deliver the same battery life I need I
was saying so are you good are you gonna
upgrade to the the nine thousand million
power battery Tony as soon as soon as I
get it yeah see I think is a monster I
was talking about missing the note 2 I
think maybe on last week's weekly or on
the you review or something like that
and I still a continue to miss it and
this note 3 has me has me excited I
think we're all pretty convinced that
we're gonna see it in Berlin right in
August that yes still yeah there's no
indication to the contrary I also Taylor
I join you in hoping that Samsung
strikes out on a different direction as
I've said before though I think that the
Galaxy S line is where is where the
pioneering innovation happens I don't
think it really excuse me in terms of in
terms of aesthetic design in terms of
hardware yeah but there are so many
things that they could do without
drastically changing much of anything
yeah the note 2 for instance feels a lot
better in the hand then the s3 or the s4
by a long shot absolutely yeah it in its
the weight so Samsung focuses so much on
making their flagship phone as you said
in your review extra portable and
by doing that they made it extremely
extremely lightweight but a hundred and
thirty grams over something that's 180
grams isn't really that significant I
mean there's a big difference in that
weight you can feel it when you're
holding them but it's not like 180 grams
is going to pull your pants down when
you put your phone in the pocket so
let's just say it mean yeah so the the
worst thing I've had to do with the s4
was take the battery out um have you
have you done that Michael taking the
battery out and race held the phone and
the phone in the battery door without
the battery in it no I sure wouldn't
want to do that now it feels like ninety
percent of the weight is the battery oh
yeah hold the phone itself it feels like
it would just kind of blow out of your
hand if a strong gust of wind is also
valid for the no 22 well it's heavier
it's it's not they didn't really cut
weight on the note 2 they just slapped
it all the offspring yeah yeah I mean
it's heavy even without the battery in
it it's it's heavier right but um to
that point I'm saying that just use a
better material a thicker plastic like
you have your nexus 7 right yeah right
here and you have the phone pad the back
of that feels amazing yet it's cheap
plastic it's this soft touch fruit
plastic and not only is it is it like
cheap plastic but and it but it's
stippled it feels nice because it offers
a little bit of friction and you know
okay next to the I'm putting the nexus 7
right next to the galaxy note 2 and yeah
next to the note 2 made you know the
nexus 7 looks I will say this less
premium if you just flip them over and
put them on their faces because Samsung
is really has a the market cornered on
this awesome kind of faux faux metallic
hairline aluminium brushed metal finish
that's not that's not real no it is
that's like a smooth chrome no it's not
it's not smooth this brushed its brush
horizontally across the back I mean I
have the gray one you're just just
scratched no well actually and none of
them look anywhere near as good as the
back on the achieve S which I also have
here and who's after the buzz episode
should air today assuming it yet it will
it'll get published later today and the
ax t VES looks just gorgeous and it's a
real shame that it
make it to any kind of relevance but i
don't know i think that there's a really
really good case to be made for using
cheaper plastic that feels good in the
hand but that you can apply a pattern to
the nexus evans very good example of
that I don't think you'll agree though I
the Galaxy Nexus is another great
example it's cheap plastic very thin but
that phone felt so much better so much
sturdier I loved that galaxy nexus in
the hand Tony bring one of those the
what the Galaxy Nexus and no i only
played with yours nexus uh-huh no that's
what she said here huh and with high res
Nexus okay and now there are the same
yes just bring that back bring it back
agreed I don't you really don't have to
go metal three yeah they don't have to
movable metal at all know you can do
different fun stuff with plastic yeah
well alright we have we have to move on
from the note 3 but let me let me tell
you my prediction cuz I didn't have an
input on what I expect from the note 3
or what I think it will be just it will
be a one-sentence feedback Nora please
go I think and I'm gonna I'm gonna
phrase like those stupid logical IQ
questions the the note 3 will be for the
s4 exactly what the note 2 was for the S
free meaning they will look most
probably the same the note 2 is not the
device it's not the launch where samsung
introduces new things so I'm expecting
same looks same build quality maybe a
faster Exynos octa processor with LTE
support and proper 4g bands for all the
world 1080p Super AMOLED screen a little
bit smaller bezel larger screen and boom
there's another three and did you
mention the camera ready 13 the same
cameras on the s4 yeah yeah just one
counterpoint and we can move on yeah the
whole note itself that the note line is
a new venture so if you look at it like
that new at you have an S Pen you have
things that no other Galaxy devices have
so it it was when it was first
introduced but now at its second the
third iteration is just just as far as
maturing yeah yeah I mean it I don't
know I I don't believe that anything
will happen but I'd love for two so just
stop killing my dreams
I think next year now next year will be
the year for a huge s5 and note for
redesign and that's that's going to be
probably the phone to get and I wonder
if the roots of that redesign will start
with a with a cellular phone ization of
the galaxy player 5.8 like we I think I
wrote a piece about that a while ago
read like that that galaxy player with
the front facing speakers the five point
eight inch screen right I would like to
say that you said that like I would have
like four years ago from mice and
spiders yeah y'all ever seen in front
facing speakers let's talk about dragon
hey y'all see a Snapdragon Snapdragon I
am dragon sorry sorry now just lost
everything uh can you tell me why I need
to be excited about the Snapdragon 800
because Stephen shank phrases it
beautifully in the first store opening
line of this LG LS 980 Android creates a
Snapdragon 800 mystery he says qualcomm
snapdragon 800 if mention of that chip
doesn't send a little shiver down your
spine you haven't been paying close
enough attention to this year's hot new
SOC launches correct true enough Steven
hi I was there at CES but i got i I just
it takes a lot to get me excited about
you I'll give you two things to be
excited about first one so the 600 is
already a super fast processor right as
you know 600 in the HTC One and the guy
says dear that is correct 800 is even
faster but what the 800 will have and
the 600 doesn't have is the super fast
charging what wait no the Snapdragon 600
does have that it does not have that
wait a minute i read the white paper on
it but knowing i have not which is that
guys I wasn't aware and maybe I'm
exposing a bit of ignorance on my part
but I wasn't aware that CPUs had
system-on-chips had anything to do with
fast charging of the battery
yeah well it's it's your project I know
yeah you're your CPU is it controls a
lot of things wireless technology for
instance if you don't have support you
can't have LTE and you have things like
that yeah that's that's clear but I I
didn't know that i thought the battery
stuff was completely isolated I thought
it had its own dedicated kind of sub
bands as for something and who knew
there was a Snapdragon 200 oh yeah well
yeah we knew this didn't we oh no I
don't ya didn't I'm gonna pretend like I
knew it I totally knew that and I mean
I'm do it go back and learn something so
there is a dispute as to whether this
800 supports or the 600 supports fast
there's there's no dispute no I know
Qualcomm quick charge 1.0 is integrated
for inside the Snapdragon 600 and
Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 is integrated
in the Snapdragon 800 the one window is
basically the standard which it takes
four hours for me to chart the one but
the 800 have to point o which will
probably charge in under one hour Wow
well yes ok interest I knew I'd read
quick charge come on now you can't
expect me to memorize numbers come on Oh
what what difference a virgin just say
yes yes I do galaxy s5 what yeah I
skimmed I get some credit ok so we have
we have a big version leap in quick
charging there that is cool that's
probably a whole different conversation
in itself but also one of the things
that I think that I was expecting in
this leap from 600 to 800 was that maybe
you know I think if you don't pay a lot
of attention to chips you could very
easily associate 800 with octa-core and
that is not the case at all these
Snapdragon 800 is still a quad-core chip
set and but it can run at a max of what
two point three gigahertz is that right
that's not necessarily the the key point
and takeaway here while while we cannot
dismiss that definitely yes youjizz or
size processor at 22 points something to
point you okay well it has check with it
has also an updated GPU it will have the
Adreno 330 GPU versus the Adreno 320 to
occur yeah so that our camp
the performance as well I see i sigh if
i recall well from the top of my head up
to 51 megapixels did it 5-4 55 I still
correct so not yet i got i have the
white paper up now where's the eos yeah
exactly Wow and then so this is this
particular rumors associated with a
device that sprint servers describe it
it's an LG made device called the ls 980
which i think a lot of people have been
speculating to be the follow-up to the
Optimus G the Optimus G sequel but LG
has already started as Steven points out
using 980 in reference to the optimus g
pro because the AT&amp;amp;T version is the e
980 so this device that we're talking
about might in fact be the sprint
version of the optimus g pro and if
that's shipped with a with the
snapdragon 800 i think we can all agree
that would be it would be in very
interesting if maybe a little bit of a
niche coup for sprint I don't think it's
going to happen because the spring
doesn't want to cannibalize its own
products and on the other hand I think
that I'll read that Taylor just in a
second I forgot what I was about to say
I can't I hate multitasking good real
life I need to reference yeah i think
that the ls and the e categories are two
different categories so while the
Optimus G bro might be the e980 the ls
980 will be a follow-up to the ls970
which is the Optimus G and in this case
the ls 980 will be the g2 that could be
I you know that it's definitely wouldn't
be the first time we'd seen
manufacturers alter model numbers based
on carrier wishes obviously we see they
just look at the galaxy s4 launch in the
US and they all have different model
numbers it's like sphl 720 or SGH I
something for what's it called for AT&amp;amp;T
but I will see this is not going to be
something we're waiting for everyone
obviously the 800 is is a big deal it
was just nice to get a refresher on why
it is a big deal Before we jump into the
next of it because it is related
somewhat and we're still in android
don't you guys find it weird that google
i/o happens next week and we have no
leaks we have no rumors we have no
implications or hints of what what might
happen aside from the usual blah blah
blah I'll be honestly I keep forgetting
io is coming up because we're not
getting any crazy leaks out of it so I
mean the Nexus 7's i'll refresh and exit
seven like the 7-inch tablet or
something to the effect like a successor
to the Nexus 7 we won't see a new phone
because the nexus 4 wasn't released
until November yeah no no upgrades on
the Nexus 10 unless they add new storage
capacities same thing with the four but
what I'm really looking forward to and
most people probably aren't they've
probably already forgotten about it but
the Nexus Q man yeah Oh everybody hey
you always get that and and if I ever
say anything about the Nexus Q on on
Twitter everybody gives like just gives
me hell over there like why would you
even still use that thing you're the
only person ever that's ever done
anything with it ya know but I don't
know I guess all well I don't know if
you saw my video on the the IR blasters
on the HTC one in the galaxy s4 I have
my Nexus Q hooked up to my television
running cyanogenmod 10.1 yeah which is
pretty cool I mean it's cool for my
friend like I from a geek perspective
and it's fun that we like use a keyboard
with that and all that kind of stuff but
i don't know like TV integration with my
home entertainment like integrating my
mobile lifestyle with my home
entertainment systems has never blown my
skirt up I've never gotten excited about
that nothing I've seen from samsung or
HTC has made me has made me get excited
about it the only thing that I like is
my apple TV hooked up to my TV because
that that's what I was about to say yeah
Apple did that without sounding like a
fanboy Apple did that for like years now
and it's basically the same concept it
does run iOS not Android but then again
it has complete integration with your TV
computers tablets yawns and everything
aside from the fact that the Nexus Q I
think that excess cute looks awesome and
it's just like black so you're hanging
out like why I don't understand what the
what the value proposition is for me if
I already used apple TV I get why it's
exciting in the down the road why will
be exciting for regular consumers
especially as Android
keeps accelerating in its in its market
share you know because sumption but oh
good because I'm part of the Google
ecosystem I buy my movies from google
play yes yes yes so I always wanted
something to stream my Play Movies to my
television and that was the answer and
luckily I didn't have to pay anything
for it so for android fans that Q might
be what the apple TV is for Apple fans
right and in by the way i will say that
since i don't use an iOS device with
regularity there's a big gap in my apple
TV like a usefulness but ya know the
cute yeah i think that i would get a
cute i'm not i'm not saying it's a bad
product all i'm saying is oh I think you
should be excited for for the new yeah
whatever no the original one was a flop
that's why Google never sold it right I
mean it was overpriced and it didn't do
much of anything so out of the box it
was kind of a waste but there's so much
potential for for Google to do something
awesome with it so that's what you're
excited about 4i oh yeah ready to see
some data that I'm excited for the Nexus
7 and maybe we'll get a glimpse of 443
or do we think that's too early I think
that we will have a some sort of a minor
android update which will not be jelly
bean it will be probably an in-between
thing with the new rumors even though
logic dictates that is that it this is
the time for jelly bean but kill Empire
goodbye happy healthy yes I mean jelly
beans been around for a year now so yeah
yeah yeah yeah let's uh let's just
quickly quick I just want yeah what
you'll see this is why we're here over
90 minutes okay I was gonna say that I
might have an aneurysm if they're giving
out glass at i/o because I've heard I've
heard rumors no way do you think the
heard rumors last I mean last year they
sold pre-orders to explorers for fifteen
hundred dollars but now they're talking
about a price point that's anywhere from
two hundred dollars to six hundred
dollars and they've given out crazier
stuff than that I mean last year I know
everybody that was there walked out with
a nexus 4 not a nexus for a Galaxy Nexus
a nexus 7 8 Nexus Q and a Chromebook all
that together all of that together that
was what everyone at i/o got last year
all the attendees that went to all the
events the moma
Elsie Michael Fisher on camera with not
his gunnar optiks but within google
glass i'll stop watching his videos well
you're mrs. stop watching Tony because
I'm trying to find one of those glass
pieces real quick oh you'll is a viewer
I need to get enough of that guy forgot
to tell him yet i need to get yes you do
you told we'll talk about this later did
yeah this is not what I wanted to say
quick trivia if you I mean ok Google
Nexus 7 is the name of the 7-inch tablet
it is you for a refresh quick trivia if
you are Google what's the name of the
tablet google nexus 7 to google nexus
7.1 now i'm kidding and have a slightly
intrumental screen size bump now you
know I do that's one of the worst things
you could ever do is name a device after
its screen size because because you have
how do you follow it up and to you can't
just bump the screen size every time so
it's going to be a problem this year I
don't I I think that they're going to
react to the changing landscape and
they're going to react to this to the
pressure of phablets pushing screen
sizes up and they're going to bring
release a competitor to the note 8 and
it's going to be the nexus 8 I really do
think it's going to be a bigger screen
device I was about to say something like
that now with the nexus 7 being gonna
snooze device and the nexus 7 3g being
also a second Nexus 7 there's two Nexus
7's done by a sous what if now Google
blaze with Samsung for a second Nexus
tablet in addition to the Nexus 10.1 and
come out with a nexus 8.0 since the note
8.0 is there and the technology is there
if there are a nexus 8 I that was in the
form of the of the note 8.0 except
without that stupid physical home button
and without the hyper glaze and I'd miss
the S Pen but I would camera hi it yeah
the camera hop on a tablet just um I'm
gonna put in one thing for my wish list
and I know it's outlandish it's crazy
it's probably not ever gonna happen
again or not I won't say ever but not
this year not this year and not at this
I oh I want another HTC nexus oh I do i
do I told i told jeff at an hour in iron
and are
meeting SES I said he said what do you
want I said if there's one thing that
would just make my life complete right
now another HTC nexus hey refresh at the
nexus one with modern specifications and
a little bigger well Taylor you have
your first yeah first adders decisis you
can get it's not the nexus one let's
talk about a different manufacturer
let's talk about a manufacturer we
haven't given a lot of love recently I
want to talk about motorola very briefly
steven wrote an excellent piece called
Motorola's x phone is still just a rumor
and i'm already let down which is dif
you know wat muah but man reading those
fees I just I can't disagree with
disagree with him Steven really Steven
shank really sets the sets the tone here
he sets the scene says this is the bed
that Motorola made here are these rumors
that came out of that this captivating X
phone and we're now seeing leaked images
that seem to indicate that Motorola
having strayed into this area where with
the razor and the razr maxx where they
were like wow we finally found our
design our design language this sharp
this Kevlar these angles that's mean
it's like a like a big nasty truck and
we love that about it alpro really and
now yeah you know it's like okay we're
done with that but you know and and part
of the explanation for that might be
that it might be Google's influence
finally starting to take hold after the
acquisition which as we all know takes
forever for that kind of stuff to happen
but I'm looking at this kind of rounded
object on this leak that you know to
cover cya may or may not be legit it
looks a lot like a nexus 4 yeah that
somebody took some like like like a belt
sander to the corners and made him a
little bit wider radius yeah they had
that device has no volume rocker is that
true yes there was a video that was that
leaked several months ago I don't
remember exactly when but it was a video
maybe last month but it I know I covered
it yeah yeah there's a guy was yeah
there were two things that were really
really strange about this phone one
there was no volume rocker the guy held
it and twisted it around in front of the
camera everything no volume rocker and
the rumor before that video
no was that it would have a touch panel
volume slider yeah we've seen that
before on devices on an HTC smart device
i think back in the day well that's good
so when you hold your phone you will
just lay with the volume without sending
it now I do that on samsung devices
anyway cuz their volume rockers are so
it's in cydia and this device that i
can't remember the name of it was like a
motorola q competitor maybe it was the
dash and instead of a jog dial on the
side it had a touch-sensitive strip on
the side but i don't remember what
device it was maybe somebody out there
commenter can can can let us know but
anyway go ahead and there was one more
thing and i can't remember for the life
of me oh yeah the screen the screen yeah
as it was like i think it was i think
was a reflection of a window in front of
the guy were behind him depending on how
you receive that whatever would've went
haven't but if there were two lines that
went down the middle of the display and
he was tilting it at different angles
but made me think that there's no way it
was a reflection but i don't i don't
know there were two lines that went down
through the display that made it look
like it was raised in the middle was
very on the sides yes Laurel site it's
very strange I don't know what it was I
think it might have been a reflection
but I don't know I feel like a
conspiracy there is trying to ya dip
take like one of those like the freaking
Sasquatch video from whatever well I
think one one thing that at least some
of us can agree on is that we're glad to
see that circles widget if nothing else
i'll be excited to see this based on the
circles widget alone but III don't know
i don't can we what could we see that at
i/o we it's it's possible i keep trying
to kind of dig with our PR people at
various you know whether it's motorola
whether it's verizon whether it doesn't
really matter but it is I'm just like so
what about that and you know will kind
of get these answers just like can't
tell you about that for another few
weeks or something like that and I'm
like okay all right unless we know what
when can we when we can expect something
edge according to the latest rumors the
X phone itself has been postponed yeah
there's a shoe late late autumn which
gave birth again to new speculation that
this might be the new Nexus phone and
blah blah blah right right so either way
anything I need to text her I need to
text my BFF Michael yes you do
actually it's who i was talking to yeah
I figure yeah yeah anyway let's let's
move on to Windows Phone we spent a long
time in Android unless you gentlemen
have some unfinished business and a
droid that we need to address real quick
always androidland of unfinished
business we're already at 52 minutes and
yeah yeah but we have no why of us today
so that is very true because there's
nothing worth talking about in iOS even
though LLL just drop a sentence when the
time comes no all right uh Nokia Lumia
928 can we agree gentlemen the the least
the worst-kept secret in history this is
an order or the best controllably yeah
I'm everything's controlled leaks now if
I'm not everything but most if this 928
was a controlled league it's a stroke of
genius because like not only are there
leaks on the internet which we expect to
see there's landing pages and stuff but
there's now what ads oh yeah there's
impressed there's a print ad and this
isn't even the most impressive bit but
there's a print ad in what Vanity Fair
magazine that is a two-page spread says
right Nokia Lumia 928 it's got the
verizon brandon right over the screen
but also a freakin a freakin billboard
alongside the highway that was my friend
it was up for one day and then it was
taken down is that right it's not
somebody's not trying to keep a secret
that's that's probably the point i don't
think that this phone will warrant any
events or anything more than just a
press release from nakia horizon agreed
i don't think unless we see this at the
at the london event which is no chance
well you don't think we'll see it like
just as i'm not saying the london event
would be four to this device
specifically but i feel like this is one
of those things they would throw in at
the end after revealing something really
like you might be right because the
official renders which nakia themselves
published on the landing page are
missing the verizon branding are they
really yes they are look at that I see
that there so there's no verizon
branding on the on the landing page but
there is one on the Vanity Fair ad yeah
interesting shopping yeah what were you
doing at its best that looks interesting
now that the side of this device
definitely looks like it's reflecting
more light than I would expect actually
the whole physics of that
physics but like the the whole layout to
that just the perspective is off yeah it
is I'm just like this doesn't make any
sense like the lower edge of this device
appears to disappear under that guy's
thumb it's got a its got a very
chamfered edge they're like yes but the
top surface doesn't like the left side
yet but I did so what are you looking at
oh look at the title image on the on the
landing page post oh I was looking at
the end see the bottom on the bottom of
that device you can see the whole edge
all the way up to his thumb and on the
top all you see is the profile of there
yeah what is going on with this image
somebody got carried away photoshopping
and apparently well check out check out
this boast which has renders so there's
renders in addition and this is on ok so
this is the post that Tony was pointing
to me right before we started
broadcasting which is called listeners
Nokia Lumia 928 vs apple iphone 5 vs
samsung galaxy s3 video quality
comparison and this includes in its
title image a render of this mystery
device yeah so you can see that that
edge but the perspective of this landing
page is just off yeah yeah deficit way
off Tony tell us a little bit about this
comparison this video quality comparison
i'll drop the link in the rundown well
this is basically video alon Nakia Nakia
i used used to and from what i see
continues to do comparison videos and in
this particular video they are pushing
the low light performance and optical
image stabilization on the 928 which has
the same sensor the point 1.7 megapixel
sensor as on the Lumia 920 as expected
and they're putting it against the
low-light sensitivity off the iphone 5
and the galaxy s3 not for maybe they
couldn't get a device anyways they use
an SLR this time and I haven't checked
yes if that was me last year but I I'm
not going to say anything because no you
know this is for the phone I usually
don't judge camera quality based on any
comparisons and OEM comparisons or other
persons I judge camera quality when I do
the comparisons in my controlled
environment where I my eyes can see what
I have captured do you not agree camera
comparisons when we do them it sends me
on the trip of a lifetime between like
highs and lows because the actual work
of capturing the images is some of my
favorite work i do at pocket now it just
basically walk around town find various
lighting conditions and take photos with
like five different phones that's fun
they've got really but then you come
back home you come back to the office
and you spit your like six hours later
you've been in front of a computer for
more than half a day in your eyes are
bloodshot and you're like maneuvering
photos around embedding captioning oh my
god it's the worst ever but the worst
experience I've had in pocket now was
the one comparison before and after the
update oh my god yeah I know I put
probably 15 or 16 hours under there and
then they live it phone like updated and
wiped itself and I lost everything at it
done yeah and then you you post you post
the results of all your hard work and
five minutes later the first comment is
gay let's move on for the luminate I
think we're gonna I think we're gonna
see it and it's going to be cool it's
gonna be exciting but I don't want to
get off of Nokia too quickly because we
have to talk about this the shareholder
kind of venting session that apparently
occurred this was posted may 7th have
you guys read this this was supposed to
yesterday at 5pm I hadn't heard just the
headlines ok I finished work at 3am I
didn't read any no I feel you so let me
tell you what happened apparently there
was there was a recent nokia
shareholders meeting where investors
voiced their frustrations with the
choices the company has made and these
shareholders parently urged CEO Stephen
Elop to take steps to bring its success
back on track one of these people says
after taking time taking them to explain
that he truly believed he lopped to be a
nice guy one of these shareholders
continued are you aware that results are
what matter the road to hell is paved
with good intentions please switch to
another road please Wow yeah I read
somewhere I can't remember where it was
but there was a an article about nokia
and someone claimed that Stephen was a
mystery lab I
I should say yes was a Trojan horse from
a Trojan horse from Microsoft only keeps
saying that since since since every 2011
yeah yeah yeah so I think nokia has made
all the right decisions and chose all
the right paths they could have chosen
except for one and if endless that is
not see I'm not saying that Windows
Phone was a was a bad choice to regret
I'm saying that they might have maybe
thought of the future and fought numbers
and have a separate line up for windows
phones and a separate line up for for
Android but that aside the the hardware
is top notch as usual they are
pioneering cameras and and and
everything which is imaging related so
it all comes down to the road and
switching roads currently the road is
Windows Phone and switching roads would
probably mean by from what I interpret
from that person's thoughts switching to
android which is never going to happen
no totally make yalla yalla yo yeah well
that would be interesting if Nokia were
to get like all those people back that
said left in disgust or not dismiss I
shouldn't say that we've talked them and
that wasn't the case but but here's the
thing I think it would have been a very
very bad move for nokia to try and do
both of these because look at what HTC
HTC basically did that right HTC's in a
situation where they had a really good
android reputation which nokia didn't
have but that's the one thing that's
different and HTC decided while we're
going to make a line of premium windows
phones and we're going to make a line of
premium android phones and then what
happened the windows phones didn't do
terribly well because windows phone is
not doing terribly well it's improving
but it's not doing terribly well overall
and then HTC basically shut up
completely about the 8x I don't know
maybe I'm wrong but I haven't seen any
HTC sourced advertisements about that
but it's Microsoft pushing those phones
and I said that a couple weeks ago and
you were like no no no they didn't
really yeah I said they like they pushed
everything they had they put everything
they had into the 8x and then like a few
months later the like bailed well
alright so maybe so if that's the case
then then I owe you an apology yeah
you're right but we the point is that
like yeah if they did that what if no
kata that what if no
had another crutch to lean on in the
form of Andhra do you think they would
have liked transformed a windows phone
to the extent that they have because I
think they're doing a lot of good for
the Windows Phone platform they have
made windows phone I'm sorry that was I
should have said Tony Oh Tony was trying
to talk just then and I didn't hear him
wrong no I just I just wanted to say one
thing we have a saying around here which
if I translate sounds something like
this rather than being the last person
in a metro I prefer being the first
person in a small village and this is
probably what what Nanaki I thought
talking about kind of like the big fish
in a small pond thing something like
that yeah yeah but I don't believe that
if they would have chosen both baths at
the same time they could have pulled it
off and and I I would I hate being an
analyst but I think that by this time so
two years later I think that they would
be heavily breathing down Samsung's if I
were Stephen Elop I would have been
absolutely irate after being the
selected partner for Windows Phone and
releasing their Windows Phone device and
then the next phone that comes along the
8x being the signature Windows Phone
device or Windows lemay I think we've
definitely uncovered that before we go
yeah that's it would be what its is such
a but at that point your nokia nokia or
nakia should have said hey we've got to
explore options we need to explore
options that would have been the call or
the conversation i would have had if I
were in his shoes at that very moment
well who's to say they didn't I mean I'm
sure they'd probably did that very
secretly and they probably told
Microsoft as much like listen you guys
are being yeah this is double beeps
right ya know yes I'm going to be a big
now you know all right so all right so
good so I'll say it anyway and I think
you should leave this part but with the
beach that's what I'm doing so so yeah I
mean they're like okay well Microsoft
you're being books to us why don't we
just go ahead and we're exploring our
options and we're not going to publicize
the fact that we're exploring options
and I don't think they
right am I forgetting something that was
any kind of Likud or what no no leaks
but I know that they they be bunk to all
the Android rumors so yeah I I think
that Nokia doesn't really care if the
HTC windows phone 8x is or is not the
signature phone because I I don't have
the exact numbers but the vast majority
of windows phone sales go to nokia so i
wouldn't mind being called an intern and
have twice as much or three times as
much salary as as the editor-in-chief
sure sure yeah I I don't know I think
that um I can understand this the
shareholders position here I mean the
company has been doing has been doing
very well for the windows phone
ecosystem I think we owe a lot to nokia
but i also think that if I were an
investor in the company I too would be
very frustrated at this point but
tonight those those shareholders had at
one point a word to say back in 2011
when when that strategic alliance was
signed I mean right but I don't think
anybody could predict what the landscape
was was gonna be like back then I think
there was a lot more hope for Windows
Phone battled removing the big upset
like how here they come yella Percival
is gonna develop a great example now why
take it out on a steep knee love because
of the decision which has been I believe
collectively mate yeah well I think
that's kind of this shareholder
mentality right it's like him well we
were with you back then but now we're
not and you're the one that's gonna hang
for it pretty much I do have a question
so if windows are not windows if Nokia
was to bail on Windows Phone all
together with the platform just died Wow
no I wouldn't had it wouldn't it
wouldn't do nearly as well that's a
really solid question so I just made
this point in the ax t vas after the
buzz where I was like listen one of the
most significant things that's happened
to the achieve s since if we first
reviewed it was that Nokia released its
here suite for the entire windows phone
line up that's here navigation that's
here Drive beta and it's here transit
and that has like single-handedly
improved the entire the worth of the
entire windows phone line I would say no
exaggeration like 15 to 20
sent for a lot of people myself included
so you know nokia is a massively
significant force to Windows Phone oh
yeah i don't i don't think Microsoft
would let windows won't die just same I
definitely wouldn't but tell me what was
your answer to that question it worries
me a lot that after two and a half years
windows phone is still below five
percent their stagnating according to
the latest numbers they've seen an
increase of point one percent I mean and
that's that's not knock yes well that's
not htcs fault that's not Samsung's
fault and you know what that's not even
microsoft's fault i think that people
who at that point said that it is too
late for microsoft to join this game
they might have been right even though
back then yes I defended Windows Phone
and Microsoft with my left last breath
oh I I I kind of disagree with you Tony
I blame microsoft holy for anything
they've done here and that's not
necessarily their own fault it was just
a very bad decision the opening
marketing I've said it before was just
the worst possible thing they could have
done save you from your self or save you
from your phone people didn't want it at
the time people still don't really want
it and at this is kind of unrelated to
think of Paul Miller's you know leaving
the internet for a year he thought the
internet was a problem but he found that
it wasn't and I don't think that you
know addiction quote-unquote to a
smartphone is a problem necessarily with
the phone it's more of ourselves and I
don't think a an operating system that
promises to be boring basically appeals
to anyone so I kind of blame microsoft
for them for that initial positioning
that yeah that set them up for failure
yeah I get that point I get both ones i
actually like that ad campaign but i
understand the objection to it there
there is something that that kind of
springs to mind here and i just wrote a
note to myself that maybe i will write
an editorial on this but you know we
haven't heard a lot from the stock
android camps and since the nexus 4
drops basically you know in the jelly
bean
that too was big dealing whatever but we
haven't really heard a lot out of stock
Android obviously iOS has been you know
kind of stagnant and we're waiting for a
big upset there but we really haven't
heard much out of we out of out of
what's new about Windows Phone because
there isn't like Windows Phone 8 has
kind of you know come out and here are
the features we announced a long time
ago and we're kind of holding steady
with them and the the ecosystem has been
the big units right do you know why app
titles have been added well but I've got
a follow-on question Tony I my question
is does anybody think that and you guys
are going to call me an idiot does
anybody think that the salvation to
Windows Phone might lie in finally
allowing manufacturers to skin it no
well maybe because because look at the
response to the one look at look at the
response to sense 5 which has been quite
positive despite the fact that people
seem to hate blinkfeed for no reason
maybe within limitation I say yes but I
mean like within limitation I agree I
always wanted a wallpaper yeah sure but
no I think if Microsoft would allow that
that will be against their entire
principle the the core idea at which was
at the basis of Metro UI and windows
phone itself which is to to unify with a
common design language across yes I mean
they offer you the colors and and that's
really that's that's it what what other
things would they allow you to do while
you would still keep the general design
guidelines which they push out to
developers so so hard I don't know
that's a tough question but the Metro UI
is not as well received in the PC world
so to that end they're probably and when
windows blue is supposedly going to come
and change some things but i don't know
i think the unified experience that they
wanted across those three different
platforms mobile and then the tablet
like smartphones tablets and PCs I think
that's kind of a pipe dream for them
right now because Metro doesn't
translate to well to a desktop
experience yeah so maybe it's time
if you have a touchscreen on it it does
get yeah if you have a touchscreen but
if you don't right but i don't think
it'll be a problem i think that i think
that problem will evaporate as
everything becomes touchscreen driven
may be anything but i don't a real um
yeah well I talked to three or four
people at the coffee shop that I go to
all the time and three of them have just
completely gotten rid of windows 8 they
went back to windows seven like they
purchased a separate license to go back
to windows seven because they hated
windows 8 so much three of em did three
out of the four and the fourth one just
said he just deals with it yeah he said
he hates any deals with it so none of
them actually like windows 8 i'm gonna
say something bold here I'm sorry who
did I interrupt odd that was me but take
something bold Tony haven't heard from
you in a second I I think that it is my
perception again that Microsoft doesn't
really care that much anymore about
Windows Phone when when it was new and
fresh oh we could see was Steven Ballmer
Steve Ballmer all the time everywhere
2011 mwc he was there 2012 mwc he talked
about all the 500 features coming to
noda or mango or whatever it was this
year they were not there we're not
seeing him being that enthusiastic about
Windows Phone remember those developers
developers developers know Steve Steve
Ballmer is nowhere to be seen and
Stephen Elop is believe it or not in my
perception the image of Windows Phone
now oh yeah III get that sure and that
takes a little bit of pressure off
Microsoft because they can then that was
part of the driving force I think behind
the partnership with no key in the first
place is in nokia now you know has to
shoulder some of the burden of of
pushing Windows Phone i I don't know I I
wonder if they actually care lesser I
wonder if we're just in this low between
revisions that is natural and that
happens to everything like I said about
stock Android a second ago I don't know
I I want to touch on the that this next
surface model I change to run down a
little bit if you like you guys when we
refresh because while we're talking
about the modern UI while we're talking
about Windows 8 vs windows 7 we're
hearing rumors that the next surface
model could be a smaller cheaper variant
also may not arrive until 2014 which
when I read that headline which my heart
just kind of sank because I think even
though sales might be a little bit
better than then were then we were
expecting a couple months ago I dont
still don't think they're very good am I
wrong on that guys no no they're
terrible yeah they're they're actually
performing very poorly yeah from what I
read last they were well below
expectations rights and i think that the
new surface hardware is exciting because
the surface is the hardware is the best
part of the surface story oh yeah I love
that hardware if that Windows 8 so
desperately needs a revamp you're
talking about the RT version and RT
right yeah that's that's another thing
right so I haven't gotten any further in
understanding or liking my Envy x2 then
I was the last time we talked about a
month ago and that is not because of the
hardware it's because of windows 8 and
you know this is this is when the
commenters will will arise to say I
don't know what I'm doing and stuff like
that and you know what you are right I
do not know what I'm doing inside
windows 8 and I I may never in its
current incarnation and not for lack of
trying it's just so frustrating to have
an OS that looks so pretty in the modern
UI but which works functions so so
poorly as you describe it it's exactly
what I felt with the first iteration of
windows phone seven point oh ah sure and
I get that I mean if 700 was lacking so
many features and and yeah I don't think
I liked it though needs copy paste right
right but but and now I I want something
I want Windows Phone 8 to go the route
of windows phone when I want windows 8
to go the route of Windows Phone 8 where
Windows Phone 8 I have my objections to
it but I find it to be a very very
useful fun responsive stable etc etc etc
OS and windows 8 has to has to match
that and it's harder to do them and on
the desktop but it just has to yeah the
only thing keeping me from actually
using a Windows 8 or Windows Phone 8
device Wow I hate that yeah I hate it so
much but the only thing keeping me from
when using Windows Phone now is is
google services windows right and we've
and do
don't get along well yeah the apps are
slowly coming along and that is they are
that's one of the things that was
keeping me away and in the hardware's is
compelling which is something I can't
say for every Android manufacturer but
yeah I need Google services and and I
think for Microsoft to to figure out
that not everyone wants to use SkyDrive
and hotmail or live or whatever they
they killed hotmail or not ha know what
they kill and I killed something not
everybody wants to use their services or
their ecosystem because they don't
necessarily compare or translate that
well to four basic consumers they
definitely work well for enterprise but
for basic consumers there are better
easier services yeah but I think that's
not the problem with the new users it's
a problem for for switching I understand
that windows phone is not stealing users
from Android or iOS at the the extent
they would have expected or they hoped
they would write what what is
interesting in my mind is that they're
not even getting new customers who are
getting there from smartphones for the
first time right well but about the
point I'm trying to make is that I can
go on an iPhone and I have all of my
google services and they're almost
almost as good as they are on an android
phone you go to Windows Phone and that's
not necessarily the case it's not only
to know it's you can take that qualifier
right out of there it's not at all the
case yeah that's that's what I was
defending I was saying that and yes you
are tied in with with a ecosystem or an
offering that you're not brown to switch
but if you were a first-time smartphone
user and you wouldn't be tied in gmail
and all the Google ecosystem and
offerings then you will be probably more
tempted to go okay let's go live let's
go Sky Drive but no yeah well don't do
that but I and I don't even know if
that's the case like I say that to throw
a bone to Microsoft and stuff but I know
at least over here in the in the circles
I travel in and there are many and
varied you know Microsoft doesn't have
any any any cool power whatsoever there
is no nobody saying that they want to
use outlook.com there's nobody excited
about ie10 no matter
good the commercial say it is no matter
how awesome the music on those
commercials is like it's like Microsoft
is not cool no by and large and you know
Google is I think cooler I think people
are more afraid of it certainly but it
also has unleashed a whole lot of
products on the public that that worked
very well especially in a mobile sense
so I would say that Taylor i agree with
you and I would put it my ideal would be
a Microsoft Microsoft Windows Phone that
interfaces deeply with Google's
ecosystem that would be my ideal thing
because just because you use Google
services doesn't mean that you
necessarily really enjoy using Android
the front and Android right yeah what if
what if I could access all that through
a UI that I prefer which is Windows fun
yeah um and and despite what the
television show says the ad spots in the
television show nobody says Bing it
nobody said just being Miss Piggy nobody
says that whenever I join ironically in
a situation people are just like what
LOL nobody says being it and and I just
I literally cannot stand being come on
tell you i canta what you know why cuz
you've been screw gold all your life I
use let me google that for you for
everything or even my personal uses
let's uh let me have an announcement Oh
what's your attachment not related at
all so instead regulated HTC first

nice phone I don't do your contract yeah
my clean with that poem is it sighs I
mean my Hulk hands were just too big for
so I this is an interesting thing to
tell her you said to somebody tweeted at
you from droid dog and you don't
remember who was I'm putting out a call
to a bar not sure who I'm sorry well
yeah but you
Ashley you didn't know who was I'm
putting on a call to any commenter who
can help there's a guy out there who
runs a website that's called like
smartphone review com or something
similarly sounding it's very
straightforward in the title and he's
based in New York State he's a he's a
bald guy maybe about all of our ages and
we see him at a lot of events and he was
our buddy for a while but damned if I
can't find his website and he held a
place in us in line and one of these big
Samsung events recently and good I've
been wanting to thank him forever but I
don't know where he what side he's at
and I've even forgotten his name because
I'm horrible with names oh yes footnote
to if I ever meet you in person I will
shake your hand you will tell me your
name but the timer handshake has done I
will have forgotten your name I'm
stadium just such an I'm so dumb about
that my brain just doesn't hold onto
names I'm to a TD when I meet people and
I'm like yeah yeah nice to meet you what
was your name again exactly yeah no it
takes like four or five times so anyway
I can't excite us find this this this
really nice guy awesome dude who runs
the site that would be great leave a
cheetah she post on craigslist yeah I
should yeah like the missed connections
yeah you held our place in line and and
we were friends then you disappeared
what happened one for every city right
yeah I closing out windows phone the
YouTube app after oh my god after like
two years has finally seen a major
update I haven't you didn't like using
the browser yeah like the old app if you
don't use Windows Phone the old app was
basically a link to the to the mobile
YouTube like a shortcut aggregator yeah
oh my god so hate it when blackberry did
light like you you download the app from
from blackberry world this time download
in the app and then it's like I was just
finally I have it and you click it and
it takes you to the browser mw2 calm in
the browser yeah ridiculous so awful i
had a twitter client around on Lewis
your edited that did the same thing yeah
I'm like it's a twitter client like of
all things you should at least do
something like encapsulated it within
the app not a twitter client that just
takes you to mobile twitter like so
that's that's what happened with with
youtube and it's funny that you
mentioned blackberry because blackberry
is our last category before listener
mail the blackberry r10
I think everyone can agree this is the
prettiest device they've ever seen has
gone up in photos yes this q10 oh wow
this thing wha so they are ten much to
be a budget a budget device running
blackberry 10 looks exactly like the
iPhone won the first original iphone
yeah you yeah shiny plastic ya know that
is ugly even the body buttons yeah yeah
even the volume button send that they've
got their little mute button in the
middle there and I'm just different they
didn't copy anything right now you know
it doesn't look good um I feel like
though that that's that's missing the
point of whatever the SDR 10 is meant to
your budget device and blackberries if
it looks like blackberry is trying to to
replicate their old approach which is to
kick out like a bunch of curve variants
for different markets and do what do we
think guys I i think the blackberry
question is still so up in the air I
would like to hear whether you guys
think that that it that they have a
chance of surviving long enough to make
this staggered approach possible what
one thing I suggested before these two
devices came out the q10 and z10 I said
blackberries should just trash
everything they've done in the past and
just starting you so bring the new
operating system but bring truly new
hardware not the same old stuff that's
what we're seeing the same old stuff up
the q10 is a device that was rumored
back in two thousand freaking for as the
Magnum I remember reading forums that
was crackberry forums I would read them
all the time so this is like a bold but
it wasn't the bold with the touch screen
because this thing has no buttons and
that was what that device back then was
had no physical like navigation like
great n Wessun wasn't rumored back don't
like that it's a software is the story
on this thing you know yeah and that's
what I'm saying they should have come
forward with new new hardware not the
same old same old granted granted that
aside I'm actually wanting a cute in so
well we the entire in that team
would like a cute n as I've mentioned as
I've said in the comments to couple
people I know you guys want us listeners
you want us to review the q10 I
definitely want to review it you know
we've never
covered blackberry before the kid the
z10 was the first BlackBerry I think we
have recovered besides listen or maybe
was the storm Tony I think yeah yeah
auntie Adam Adam Lane he was my friend
still has a storm we're not a guy Matt
Berger we don't night we don't have a we
don't have a long history of governing
blackberry so they don't really pay much
attention to us I have to I have to bang
down their door to to to get blackberry
to pay attention to us and they're very
nice don't get me wrong I like dealing
with them but did you know we're gonna
be delayed on getting BlackBerry devices
for a while guys so please be patient
with us as we build a reputation with
them eat email me up after this Michael
about blackberry oh well well so to
answer your question I think about
blackberry the same thing I I think
about microsoft and and I think that
they the entire situation is out of
their control and I think to explain my
thoughts and my statement blackberry did
exactly what Microsoft did Microsoft
laid down on its laurels with windows
mobile 6 points something 6.5 sure and
just waited for Android and iOS to catch
up blackberry did the exact same thing
no new device is no news nothing for two
or three years a period of time in which
android and iOS four blooming and now
they're just fighting to get back
something from what they lost the
proximately seventy percent of their
market share absolutely it's kind of
like a trust issue I mean you you cheat
on someone or you lie to someone or you
know break their heart anything and in
this case yeah or or be ignored but the
like trying to get that back after the
fact is much harder than it was to get
the first time yeah it's much much more
difficult and I will say this that we
have to give them a little bit more
credit than they did they did try okay i
mean the storm is a big joke but they
tried with the store and they tried with
the storm to ethan's nice they tried
their darkness well they tried with the
torch i'm talking about everything
before blackberry 10 like they actually
did try branching out the problem is
they didn't go far enough and they
didn't do well enough so you know didn't
just sit there separating a touch from a
click action was brilliant but very very
very very poorly executed yeah i agree i
think the
septa the storm is one of the most
compelling things I'd heard of I mean
like a touchscreen that also has
happened that has physical feedback
that's all yeah I don't think that way
to do it no yeah a single button in the
middle of the display no yeah that was
bad even the storm two like I said I
have a friend who still has the original
storm and a week for her every night I
don't I would give her an iphone yeah oh
I was like please that's a move on to
listener mail unless you guys have a
have a final point to about a ladder
nostalgic are you um one thing I keep
hearing from what's a hold on wait hold
on what for what I love my love my bold
9000 I love dimensional bold yeah man I
never had it I never owned it but the
original bolt came out just as I was
getting I think my iphone 3g the only
iphone I've ever actually bought and I
went into the AT&amp;amp;T store and I saw the
bold 9000 I was like oh wow this is
beautiful and that management's my curve
8350i which nobody had and I liked that
too but you have a great best keyboard
ever no I wasn't like I was a blackberry
fanboy in the day um I saw yes install
custom apps back before like the I had
to install custom apps back in the day
when the backlight wouldn't stay on I
can't to install a cast him out to get
the backlight to turn on when you
pressed a button I had at least 20
different blackberries 20 yeah I love
blackberry I was up like very fanboy
like eight a literal fanboy I had the
bold 9000 the 9700 the Pearl 9130 the or
not anyone added to have that one the
8130 the 9130 the 8330 the 80 yeah 900
and people these are not phone numbers
yeah I had all of them pretty much guys
I loved blackberry I ran a blackberry
site you know what I'm like here I you
know what I what I'm really enjoying
here is that I think as recently as six
months ago we were sitting on this very
podcast probably talking about talking
about how blackberry was very likely to
close up shop in the next few weeks even
I think I probably said recklessly at
one time or another and now they've got
two new smartphones soon to be three new
smartphones on the market we getting
here we're hearing all these returns of
you know all these rumors of high return
rates and stuff and some of them are we
debunked and some are not but you know
they're still around and they're still
selling units I I think that's very
impressive and now that we're in massive
company right and and also though
they're they're building their ecosystem
more importantly they're not just
selling units they're also building an
app ecosystem very quickly even even as
even if you take porting from Android
into account yeah so that's cool i mean
i don't want to golf clap i do want to
say one thing I keep hearing people say
thorsten heins it's torsten torsten yeah
yeah torsten people torsten sounds like
calling me Tyler I'm not Tyler hey Tyler
hey no I get it all the time I had a
boss that called me Tyler every day now
like its Taylor I'm leaving after this
on my day come on yep speaking of which
what my name's don't call me Mike people
in the comments don't call me my I don't
like that Nick yes what up Mikey oh you
Mike oh yeah only one bonus points call
me Michael motorcycle that'll really win
you go ahead tell me what we gonna say I
was about to say that strange things
happen to me when I'm on the podcast I
just had a notes application open on my
computer and while I was talking to you
guys I'm listening and clicking he left
and right and I closed the notes and at
one point I was being as do you want to
save or not then I hadn't so Oh No so
what gentlemen if I promised you
anything by the end of this week or by
set or you guys asked me to do something
then please send me the email again
because there was a two-page note there
which is now not being sane Tony oh
sorry man would cover feature huh no no
that's for losers yeah that's first
that's for reckless but who would do
that excellent yeah we're all Cowboys
here this is how easy all right let's
jump in the listener males we get Tony's
mind off his loss of data here can I oh
I'm not sweating it you guys will okay
and i just think we are almost exactly
on time we are well if we didn't if we
weren't doing listener mail would be on
time we're behind cuz listener met we
have three pieces listener mail we're
all time read on we're not on time Randy
muth Randy muffs random youth sorry we
just talked about mispronouncing names
and I'm gonna do it to all these randy
says
hi Michael first off just wanted to say
I always enjoy your reviews and all the
packing out team is just doing a really
great job thank you very much Andy Randy
damn so yesterday I rushed home since I
saw that my HTC One waiting for me but
when I opened the shipping box that
sprint sent me I had a very unpleasant
surprise there was no plastic film all
the stickers on the side to hold the two
sides together were cut and new ones
were put on and the new stickers were
dirty sprint at first was like oh well
after sending spending some time talking
to a manager Sprint is sending me a new
one but it won't get here for over a
week so I'm just wondering asks Randy
what your thoughts on getting a new
phone where the wrapping is open have
you seen this before or heard of this
and do you think it's petty for me to
have sprint send me a new one where the
box has not been open Randy Randy thank
you for writing in first of all second
of all sorry we didn't get to this
you've you've had your new HTC One for
like two weeks at this point this is
very old listener mail but think if my
sclerosis is not kicking in that he
commented in one of my pieces and i
replied to him or there was somebody
else with this exact same story well if
that is the case and you've all right
this has already been answered then I
you know it's just a compelling to me
because the most fascinating part of
this piece of listener mail to me is do
you think it's petty for me to have
sprint send me a new one oh no not
absolutely not know if a product comes
to your door like oh yeah absolutely
bang the door down until they get you
what you paid for like we've talked
about this in other contexts with Apple
sending out iphones with dents and dings
in the transferred edge we've talked
about it with HTC One and its its its
manufacturing you know inconsistencies
absolutely if something comes to it I've
sent stuff back for less if a device
comes out of the box and the screen
protector has obviously been taken off
once and then reapplied and it's got all
those bubbles underneath it you know get
out of here I don't want anyone has been
touched by by human hands that are not
quality control people in the factory if
I'm buying a new device I deserve a new
device and so do you Randy written by a
new car with three or four hundred miles
on it with you exert its its know you
you bought something new you get it new
and you get it pristine exactly and I
granted I didn't get a new iphone I got
an iphone that was pretty banged up when
I take it or took it out of the box but
I didn't get it replaced so well and and
that's the thing I you know I think it's
a different story when you're when
you're getting a device that
is on launch weekend and there's going
to be a back backlog or backorder for
four weeks well maybe you have to sit
there and live with that and that really
frankly sucks but that's a different
judgment call right now you know with
this kind of situation where you have an
easy replacement yeah no no you're not
petty at all Randy I think that's gonna
do it yeah it's good that you did what
you did the only way a phone should come
with a screen protector or the plastic
film reapplied as if it's a review
device and someone else has had it first
and evens in and I hate it even then I
hate it I absolutely sell it was a
refurb yeah so the way that that happens
sometimes listeners is you know the
different outlets get different review
devices at different times and depending
on your relationship with the
manufacturer or the carrier sometimes
you first sometimes your second
sometimes your third so we've been we've
been in all three categories we get you
know we have different ships everybody
so whenever I get a second-string review
device that somebody else has had I'm
like oh you didn't put the protection
Wow oh that's when we go to unbox it and
everybody's like fake this is fake you
are but you're already real yeah what's
best is when the previous reviewer
doesn't clear it first and oh yeah
gallery is full of balls of like is
there you know dis shovel department I'm
like oh well that's cool cuz ever I I
got a I got one a few weeks back and I
booted it up and when I did it said we
wipe complete like hmm because I
couldn't tell I couldn't tell that it
had been used oh really the plastic on
it was was perfect oh it was probably an
actual factory refurb then maybe yeah
but yeah I open the box and it said wipe
complete like what no I've been fooled
let's a second piece of listener mail
here this is from i love this hey guys
my name is Daniel Bell Joe siddha and in
pronounce the sea and parenthesis right
next door come on Michael try it the
best I can do Daniel I'm your follower
from Costa Rica awesome now my sister is
about to get a new phone and she wants a
smartphone with a physical QWERTY
keyboard and a touchscreen what
recommendations would you give her what
which is a cute n yep yeah so yeah if
she's a new smartphone buyer then the
q10 actually might not be a bad choice
considering I think we've said several
times that leaping into a nascent
ecosystem is
a lot easier if you haven't come from a
previous one but if you go ahead time if
you can hunt down with elvin you bro go
with that Oh a dell venue pro running on
ya own 75 wasn't bad but most I just
can't deal with sliders I can't do it
yeah sly did you know no venue pro was
nice I will give it that but I can't do
with sliders but if she's on that an OS
like I do the only other option than his
Android because iOS obviously doesn't
have any excuse me physical keyboards
the only other option is to go with
something like the droid 4 from Motorola
which is probably called something in it
different different in international
markets and it will flip out the flip
been told or the motorola Photon from
Simon not really pop back in the day or
the flip out the football God the thing
was so bad you know what I said that
that small square thing which flipped
out actually yeah yeah yeah it's done
everything ok we had one of those and
the flip back of the backflip yeah back
with the screen on the wrong side of the
thing yes um yeah so all these are
options you shouldn't go for yes indeed
neither should you go for the palm pre
three even though i want to recommend
that it's so difficult it is it is we
read an editorial about this i feel like
once a month or so where it's like it's
so difficult to find a physical QWERTY
keyboard and a touch screen and you know
bundled into a good device yep all right
you can find good device you can't find
great ones you know my role mostly half
hazard I guess yeah yeah and so Daniel
that's a very difficult question she's
not going to find a whole lot and the
only thing that I will say and this is
exactly what what most people don't want
to hear is a touchscreen keyboards are
are the predominant choice now they are
they're much better to whether they're
better for a lot of people I feel like
allowable are hesitant to even try them
is trial 8-pin you'llyou'll it'll change
your life get out of here yeah yeah
you're just asking for it for a device
category that's dying so yeah I've got
an editorial on this later this week
actually go cool oh good yeah well that
Alex I'll postpone the one I was gonna
write for next month okay Tony put that
in your notes Oh
yeah well start a new one I will I was
wrong four pieces of myself crushed yeah
poor Tony sends just ahead still looking
at the empty trash bin no you didn't
finish her reader Miller his hotel sorry
yeah you're right Daniel also asks about
hi Mase said something about using the
VPN settings on his android to get apps
that wasn't available in it weren't
available in this country running
normally could you explain how to do it
Daniel asks no I there's no need to
explain i'm also in hymas shoes i don't
live in the US but you don't have to
have an actual VPN so that she can dig
into settings and and then do some
hocus-pocus there you need to go into
the Play Store and while you are in the
Play Store you need to search forum
application which is cold I'm browsing
my list now hotspot shield VPN it is a
free application which allows you slow
VPN speeds in the US for us I be but if
you need higher speeds there's also a
subscription which will cost you around
nine dollars per year so that's you just
fire it up Play Store sees you in the US
and boom uh-huh that's actually not bad
I did not know that we were gonna have
to actually have an answer there thank
you Tony yes well glad we had you cuz i
would not know and not have known that
answer that at all start talking VPN i
really get lost quickly my eyes glaze
over this hi pocket now team from gel
Loman I think we've heard from jail
before I was just wondering what
everybody does outside of pocket now or
is pocket now enough to be able to live
you don't wanna know I think she'll
means for employment not for recreation
PS is Brandon still vegetarian is he I
don't know I checked yes he was really I
was hoping to answer this when Renner
was on the air but there's another piece
of listener mail want to answer when
Brennan is on the air because it has to
do with the old school pocket now so it
to answer your question broadly some of
us are work for pocket now full-time
others juggle pocket now and a bunch of
other commitments I actually still I
actually still do that i actually do
still have other income coming from
other places
but in addition to being full time and
then some of us are part-time and
full-time elsewhere and some of us are
just contributors and we have like the
whole spread don't we gentleman yeah I
am full time all three of us on the air
a full time right now Tony Taylor and I
are full time but I work on personal
projects when I have a spare moment
which is not very often do you get paid
do you pay yourself from left bucket to
write bucket nope doesn't count good
cost savings yeah well one one day one
day yeah it counts because I'm working
towards a goal but other than that it's
not like I'm just building airplanes
like toy airplanes in my side or my
spare time I'm working on projects
interesting that you bring that up see I
do i do do that yeah my run a YouTube
based business that focuses on scale
models so that that's actually really
cool yeah i love i love RC and stuff oh
thanks i didn't know you'd seen it yeah
yeah rapid new Dion it's time for self
pimping rapid Nadine I saw the boat on
the frozen lake oh you saw the ice boat
yeah that's not one of our more exciting
ones watch the submarine missile
launches those are fun I just link me to
it I sure will I definitely will and
i'll link you to the coolest video i
ever saw on YouTube guys my dinner is
getting cold okay a final piece of
listener mail now that uh wow I don't
have apparently now that all major OEMs
accept HTC seem to be rehashing old
designs with new features gimmicks and
aggressive marketing drives do you think
that it's time to look at the small
local OEMs like the Lloyds the ODA
phones and even India's micromax as the
innovation drives in the industry yes
I've just I know LG I don't know who
wrote this piece of email because I
copied it that's from from from Joe
lumen it's a BS after the BS or maybe
it's a copy-paste video no it's a copy
paste fail so this is a really good
question and yes i think that the
smaller companies are really gonna kind
of prompt the bigger boys to stay on
their feet as far as innovation goes ooh
listen to that siren muted himself yeah
LG is underrated as one of the
innovators they're not exactly one of
the top brands I guess there
among the top but they're not the top
brand but they have pushed innovation
for several years in the mobile space
for now or currently um they were the
first with a dual core processor yeah
their first with 3d their first has been
shot but what about that like they're
really small guys like the the yotaphone
world Yoda phone I am so excited about
that thing I was just talking to the
other phone guys yeah well I mean I I
wish they would upgrade the specs for
when it's actually ready yeah which I'm
afraid they probably will not do because
I costs a lot of money right but but it
is an innovative concept right is it
together the principal and the real
question is you guys us geeks are
excited but does the rest of the
population care about yotaphone I don't
think not yet because it's not invisible
yet but even when it becomes visible
right all right I don't have people
gonna care maybe not but i think the
effect that those kind of companies will
have on the industry overall is for
profound because the bigger guys will
look to these smaller players and say oh
that's a really good idea and for lack
of a better term let's steal it it'll
buy them out right right goodbye though
yo yo does not exactly small they're
backed by um oh god who are their back
by is it the is it a Russian carrier
like they are just not know Russian
company which goes international is
small hmm yeah well the Russians don't
do don't do much smaller right i mean
like that kind of a thing yoda if i'm
not mistaken is backed by russia's
largest carrier really huh wiley nice i
read an elaborate booth we saw it
freaking mwc remember that toner yeah I
see when I google it so yeah so I think
that in short yes these these companies
play a vital role in ensuring innovation
goes for it especially in a climate
where shows like CES and mwc are
starting to feature the big players less
and less predominantly because the big
players want to have their own shows and
the these big CES and mwc shows like
have to feature the is the little guys
and look at what little companies can do
look at what like you know five people
started at Pebble you know and there's
an accessory it's not a mobile phone but
still well they were a company before oh
well yeah I was I know that was in pulse
but alert alert uh yeah um Keota phone
is backed by the parent company
Yoda hey it is a significant player in
LTE hardware so they're there no
stranger to mobile phones that's just so
they're like Huawei where they have a
big infrastructure foot yeah yeah yeah
well that is an awesome question sorry
that we do not have you have your name
on the air as I'm an idiot but I'll fix
that in the in the post itself and
thanks to all the listeners who wrote in
somebody tweeted at me earlier with is i
just sent in a piece of listener mail
but it's very long i wonder if it will
be read I'm so sorry as you can see why
like this file yeah exactly we just
don't have the time for long listener
mail please do write in folks we owe the
addresses at the end of the show but
make sure and keep it brief because we
just don't have time for long emails I'm
so sorry but unless either of you
gentlemen have anything do you not at
all any more coffee that's it me too
