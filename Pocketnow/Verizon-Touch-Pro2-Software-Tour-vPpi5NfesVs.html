Pacquiao calm and this is a software
tour the verizon touch pro two so the
device costs around one hundred ninety
nine dollars subsidized for a new
two-year contract and perhaps the lack
of software on this device is why it is
so inexpensive so I'm just going to go
into some of the programs right now and
as you can see a lot of the the basic
their programs are already they mainly
come with Windows Mobile itself so we
can scroll down we have Jet Set print 5
which has allows you to actually print
from your windows mobile device so if
you have a word document you can just
plug the device directly into a printer
through a USB cable and you can actually
print it if you have that or through a
network printer and go into mp3 trimmer
this allows you to actually edit an mp3
so if you have a song it would like to
put as a ringtone you can just make it
shorter let's say you just want the the
the chorus to be the ringtone on your
device you can just edit the mp3 on this
little program right here so that's
pretty cool just go back
we can get mobile email so this device
allows you to use verizon's proprietary
email service here quick gps remote
desktop mobile and of course our VZ
navigator and go into that so the VZ
navigator is actually just verizon's a
proprietary navigation program that they
use through their service and this is
actually an internet based navigation
program so you do have to have an
internet connection in order for this
program to work and of course this
device actually is not connected to a
network so it won't work actually right
now so there's eggs out of this so one
thing that's nice about this device
opposed to some other windows mobile
devices on verizon's network is that the
gps is actually unlocked so i'm just
going to go into a garmin which i
installed on this on this device so if
you can see this little symbol right up
here it actually has the GPS activated
on this device so i can just click on
there and look at it it's not going to
work 20 a surprise is actually found a
3g gps location inside but anyways the
gps is actually unlocked on this device
so it works with other programs as well
the last thing I'm going to show you is
the touchflo 3d it's a pretty basic it's
just the same exact touchflo 3d that
we've seen on other devices and in fact
they haven't really changed too much on
it it works that pretty much exactly the
same as other devices the only thing
that's a little bit different is the
color arrangement but other than that
there's not too much change on this
device so this is a software tour of the
verizon touch pro2 and in case you
missed it check out these unboxing and
the hardware tour thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
