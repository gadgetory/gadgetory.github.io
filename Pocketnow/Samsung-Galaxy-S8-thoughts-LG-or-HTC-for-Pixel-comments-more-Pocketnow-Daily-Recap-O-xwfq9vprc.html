really underscore really that was a bad
joke really I know I know I've been
doing these for years you end up running
out of them you should send me some in
the comments man that's right it's that
time of the week after much petition
thank you so much for asking for this
video to return let's do it I'm high
literally that I was pocket now and this
is the out daily recap to last
week so last Monday was just two days
before the galaxy s 8 announcement there
were rumors of a samsung s guard a
service where the company would pretty
much replace whatever happened to your
phone and anything and well we kind of
didn't really see anything at the event
being mentioned it could still happened
though and I asked you how much would
you be willing to pay we had 593
comments agreed high mid should be free
after the notes fiasco my impressions
was that this should be a free service
mainly with everything that happened
with the Galaxy Note 8 there are
companies that already make this free
like in the case of ZTE and hcc did it
to a certain degree in the past so yeah
I mean why not if these companies that
don't have the economical leverage of
Samsung can do it for free why not
Samsung if Samsung has a guard program
for free they will sell crap load of
phones I do feel that way I mean the
best way to gain credibility is to tell
consumers that there is nothing to worry
about and this is pretty much what the
service would be samsung guard should be
for all samsung phones if I broke my i7
edge again I would cry I have to agree
with you mainly because of how expensive
it is to replace these displays when it
comes to samsung then on Tuesday the
topic was the galaxy note 7 apparently
it is going to return refurbished and I
asked you if you would be willing to buy
one we had 774 comments I would
definitely buy the note 7 I went to it
was a great phone I had to replace it i
had to return it I wish I didn't mainly
because of how much i love the device
but that doesn't change the fact that I
had to note 7 every launch would pretty
much go out of stock whichever region it
gets introduced in I am in bring it on
you know I think that would happen the
note 7 was an icon I feel that
regardless of what happened to it people
would
still want to buy just to hold on to it
i guess i would buy a note 8 your
comment was short but to the point and
you know at this point in time and with
all the changes of the s8 i would
actually consider it twice because yes
the no date must be amazing and its mind
if it'll be a good idea to just hold on
to the money and get something else for
now let's jump all the way to thursday
because on wednesday we were at the
unpacked event we were talking about the
google pixel there are rumors of the
pixel three might be either manufactured
by HTC or LG both companies are
currently fighting to get this contract
and i asked you which company would you
prefer we had 746 comments samsung needs
to build the next pixel please that's
actually not a bad idea I think LG
should make the next pixel phone they
have a great reputation in the Nexus
line you know it's funny the Nexus
devices made by LG were never my
favorite to be totally honest with you I
think the hardware was block it wasn't
really cool in my opinion I think my
favorite Nexus would still be the nexus
6p and before that would be the Galaxy
Nexus none made by LG mainly right now
the reason why would prefer LG is
because of the g6 I am in love with that
phone HTC or LG doesn't matter they just
manufacture I doubt that they have a say
in the design both are competent
manufacturers I do agree both companies
do an amazing job with their products
when it comes to manufacturing but it
doesn't really work that way when it
comes to odms podiums do not have the
final say but they do suggest and yeah i
think that the LG suggestions mainly
after seeing what the g6 is like would
be awesome and then finally on friday
the topic was the galaxy s 8 where we're
going through our overview of how the
phone had sold in pre-orders etc and i
asked you if you made up your mind and
chose a specific variant in size we had
929 comments i pre-ordered the essay in
black getting my gear VR hmm interesting
i actually did not take the black one
mainly because it's really good on
fingerprints be onyx black last year did
an amazing job up to the point where
every single s7 that i use this of an
edge a7 were all onyx black because of
that but hey we'll see three
ordered my essay plus and silver can't
wait to get it you know I really like
the silver approach this year because
it's not as reflective as last year last
year it looked like if it had this cheap
wallpaper in this year it seems like if
it's got this texture and I love the
fact the bezel of the front are black so
I think that's an awesome color choice
SI plus an orchid grey is my favorite
choice but I'm also leaning toward the
maple gold not that it matters because a
case is going to hide the color of the
phone i am not a fan of cases so i might
not be using them and i have found some
amazing VRS design galaxy s eight places
that are transparent that i would highly
recommend but that being said I actually
chose the orchid gray si+ that was my
favorite color I think just because it's
unique but then again that's just me you
also have an awesome choice base that's
it for the bargain out daily recap thank
