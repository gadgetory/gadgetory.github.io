show us a device with four cameras at
the back and slimmer bezels Apple is
putting away other projects to have
their marketing team promote iPhones and
boost sales and Qualcomm showed us
everything we need to know about 5g in
today's tech summit in Maui I'm Jaime
Rivera and make sure you're following us
on Instagram we have a full live stream
explaining everything you need to know
about 5g of everything that was
announced today
this is pocket out daily powered by
qualcomm the official news today begin
with everything that was announced today
at the Qualcomm tech summit here in Maui
strutting with 5g we saw network
operators like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
committing in the United States for 5g
in early 2019 in addition to other
network operators around the world we
also saw Samsung not just showing us a
demo smartphone running 5g but also the
fact that there are other devices that
the company is creating in order to
allow five do to reach IOT etc there's a
lot of complexity into what Qualcomm is
making here particularly because they're
figuring out not just sub 6 for 5g but
also a millimeter wave which other
manufacturers say it's just too
difficult they've even come to the point
of building the own antennas that will
allow millimeter wave in a smartphone
and they've showed it in their demo
hardware everything looked great and we
cannot wait to see when it goes live
other than that the Qualcomm Snapdragon
855 got announced but we've got more
details on that tomorrow yesterday we
just got the confirmation that it will
be 5g capable through the x50 Snapdragon
modem in addition let's talk about
Samsung and in addition Huawei we've
been covering the fact that they want to
punch a hole in a smartphone's display
for a bit actually make sure you watch
our Instagram livestream as the demo
device had a camera in a very
interesting location watch the Instagram
livestream but yeah they're fighting
over who's first and now lenovo comes
out of the blue and just says we have an
event on december 6 and the teasers are
that we're gonna see a device with that
sort of design as well and that's gonna
be interesting let's see who wins in the
end then launching a which is what
matters
I'll talk about Google as the company
has apparently acknowledged that there
is a lot of bugs in there pixel devices
by the way I already got a replacement
for my pixel three Excel because I was
having issues with mine with
connectivity and battery life so the
company is committing to sending up
software updates to fix all the problems
from the speaker issues to everything
else so stay tuned for that update
I can't wait to mine and let's talk
about Apple in a very interesting report
we hear that the company has already
instructed their whole marketing
department drop all your projects right
now we have to sell iPhones because
they're not selling well and the company
is obviously worried I mean if the
iPhone would launch as its own company
it would be bigger than a lot of the
company's tech companies out there so
yeah for Apple this is a huge chunk of
the business and there's the reason why
there I mean I even hear that they're
discounting the iPhone 10 are when you
do a trade-in to up to 450 bucks because
obviously we're not caring about that 10
are so yeah stay tuned to see when they
will finally drop those prices a focus
that's the way you sell more and finally
the hot new they have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 yesterday we covered
the fact that there were renders of
three cameras and an interesting punch
hole on one side of the screen now we
see that the screen is the same on
another phone with even slimmer bezels
and four cameras at the back and at
first I was like oh my god this looks
like a Photoshop job I'm not sure if
it's real these are renders obviously so
let us know in the comments what do you
think number one do you think these
renders are real and number two what do
you think do you like him or not because
in my case I'd like to see how that
display works but everything looks hot
