pocketnow.com and today we're looking at
a free new app for music fans
it's called lyrics finder and as the
name implies it allows you to search a
music database for the words to your
favorite songs you can search by a
song's title artists and even partial
text let's take a look so the main menu
is pretty simple with just two options
let's start with the search feature at
the top we have the search field
followed by options to search by a
song's title artists and text I'm going
to begin by searching for a song called
run this town which is by jay-z locally
go and as it's searching it'll actually
display a random quote by a notable
figure which I guess is kind of neat
okay so let's click the first result and
here we are with run this town by jay-z
featuring Rihanna and Kanye West you can
scroll down the lyrics by using the side
scroller or the big buttons at the
bottom let's go back and this time I'm
gonna search for an artist let's type in
Lady Gaga this is only for demonstration
purposes I swear there's a random quote
again Wow okay 21 matches for Lady Gaga
okay let's go back finally I'm going to
search for some text in a song let's
enter exit light which is from the
chorus of Enter Sandman by Metallica
all right we have a bunch of results so
let's click on one for enter sandman'
and here we have the keywords that we
searched so it works by the way the
green highlighting is for songs that
I've previously viewed you can also
expand the search results by pressing
the more button and it can be expanded
up to a hundred matches let's go back
main menu and we'll go to cache this is
essentially a search history so you can
quickly access songs that you've
previously viewed it's a convenient way
to keep track and reaches it's all the
songs that you've searched so overall
lyrics Finder can look up songs and
delivery results quite quickly it's
unclear which database this program uses
but I've been able to find many songs
from a variety of genres best of all
it's free and it will help you learn the
correct words to your favorite songs
I'll post more information on
packing.com as to how you can get it
that's it for now thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
