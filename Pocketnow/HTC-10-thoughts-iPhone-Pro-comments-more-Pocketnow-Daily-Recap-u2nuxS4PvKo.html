PocketNow weekly recap we want it back
guys I wanted it back to the reason why
I don't write opinions on your questions
nowadays is because you don't do recap
videos the recaps are back the only
reason why I stopped doing them was
because I needed Sundays off guys hina
has the single coolest shirt ever you
mean right now that's right it's that
time of the week I am hi Mary bit of
this is pocket now and this is the
pocket out daily recap the last week on
Monday the topic was 3d touch or a home
button in the iphone 7 there are more
rumors that this might probably see a
change with this design and I asked you
what would you prefer a 3d touch or a
physical home button we had 479 comments
keep the home button 3d touch is useless
you have no idea how much i agree with
you i don't find any purpose for 3d
touch it's a cool gimmick but that said
it's a gimmick def keep 3d touch as long
as they can find the way to keep touch
ID there are rumors that LG hell no LG
has published that there is a display
that now allows that the question is if
Apple will adopt it but I don't think
it's gonna be that easy I like physical
home buttons i love that Apple and
Samsung have stuck to them you know I
like physical home buns as well I just I
don't know ever since I started using
capacitive unlock buttons I prefer those
actually on Tuesday the topic was apples
quarter results for the first time in
history the iphone is down in sales by
ten percent and ask you what do you
think Apple did wrong with the iphone 6s
we had 1173 comments thanks a lot same s
maybe add widgets to software oh god I
am so tired of the whole comment of
let's add widgets you know widgets are
cool but they're not the reason why
android cells I don't think they did
nothing wrong I just think android
phones got better you know I think that
you nailed the point for the first time
ever i feel android phones this year are
far superior than the iphone and camera
quality inexperienced in battery life
there is just no reason to buy an iphone
right now i find it in my case i use the
iphone for the audio of this video
oh and that's probably the reason I'm
always carrying one but not necessarily
because I don't drift to an android
phone as my daily driver primarily
anyone that has not figured out that
they are being ripped off by Apple needs
jesus oh my god I just feature the comet
because I found it hilarious on
Wednesday the topic was the new Moto X
there are rumors on what we're getting
and I asked you what would you like to
see on the next Moto X we had 755
comments fingerprint scanner quad HD
amoled below 5.5 inch screen and a small
body the whole purpose of the Moto X has
never been to have a small body on the
contrary it's the substantial device we
all want so I wouldn't count on that I
just wish they'd fit a bigger battery on
that substantial batter up sorry design
fingerprint scanner quad HD AMOLED pure
Android USB type-c front-facing speakers
same design I find USB type-c to be
currently overrated but yeah fine why
don't we get that for me it would just
be the fingerprint scanner honestly
lenovo will have to be very hands-off
with a new Moto X for me to be
interested so moto maker design lingo
and fingerprint scanner in the dimple oh
yeah in the temple that would make a lot
of sense we saw the leaks of the Moto G
which had this horrible squared a
fingerprint scanner I I don't find that
that should be the way to go we'll see
on Thursday the topic was the iphone pro
we saw some leaks that there might be a
connector included in everything and I
asked you hey if we're going pro do you
think the Apple pencil will make the cut
we had 545 comments Steve Jobs said it
himself who wants a stylist so my god
yes you know the Apple pencil is not a
bad stylus but the whole reason why you
have to carry that thing on the side and
the fact that its larger than any pencil
out there and that the S Pen just makes
it look terrible just makes it pointless
so one's gonna give an S about the Apple
pencil support as long as it retains the
ninety nine dollar price tag it's
atrocious yes I find that the other
problem with the Apple pencil is that
the price tag is just horrible
ninety-nine bucks you crazy the pro name
is just a way for Apple to screw more
money out of people they're doing it
with the iPad and yes by the way for
those of you wondering where I read the
comments the ipad is still here that's
what I still use I was just waiting for
Huang to send me back the 9.7 inch pro
but yes I feel that this whole Pro
moniker has no reason of being except
for the fact that they just want to
rebrand things to get you know the brand
back on top and it's not gonna happen
and then on Friday the HTC 10 had just
reached carriers and I asked you if you
were getting one we had 772 comments I
really like this phone but I'm with AT&amp;amp;T
i'm using the 10 with AT&amp;amp;T i love the
way it performs i have no clue what
happened here I mean AT&amp;amp;T used to be the
exclusive partner for HTC I don't know
what's going on this is probably the
best HTC phone ever and it's not going
to happen now that's weird not
interested in any new flagship my s6
edge is doing very good for now i don't
know maybe i'll get the galaxy s 8 edge
or maybe just maybe the iphone 8 i know
it's just hard to decide right now i am
actually using the tennis my daily
driver and i don't think it's gonna
change yes we are getting two new tents
just very unhappy about the silver only
color option for verizon okay i saw all
the color variants at the pre-brief i
will tell you this much i originally got
the black version of the tent and I
didn't like it this aluminium color
silver with the black display is
gorgeous it is gorgeous i love this
design that's probably my favorite i
don't think it's that bad by the way
that you only get that color option just
go look at it you'll probably like it
that's it for the pocket out daily recap
