the Samsung Galaxy S 9 the iPhone said
is waiting on a new software update
given some issues and it seems that a
few Android OMS are willing to challenge
face ID as soon as next year I'm Jaime
Mehta Rivera and I'm about to get on a
plane but you know me I cannot leave
without getting you the news this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with overexposing faces and deals
let's talk about Newegg again we keep
getting more Black Friday deals in the
list this vast in the case of new egg
but probably the most interesting one
only works for today the LGB 20 is 285
bucks and for those of you that are
starting on youtube or that want to take
vlogging seriously the V 20 is probably
a really really good way to start you
can learn more in the description now
let's talk about the Verizon pixel 2 in
pixel 2 XL those of you that want to get
these phones and I would not see why not
now with the saturation fix on the pixel
2 XL that has become my favorite phone
and you can get it for 50% off in
Verizon so long as you bring a trade-in
now interesting if you're trade-ins are
new like in the case of the iPhone 6
something or 7 you get 50% off but then
if you've got old phones like in the
case of the HTC One m9 and another vast
list you can get 25% off which is still
crazy again more in the description now
let's talk about iPhone tens and bugs
for those of you that are in cold areas
and notice that your iPhone is freezing
up but no pun intended or pun intended
but it's happening to a lot of people
there is a software fix that's coming
very soon Apple has been dealing with a
couple of bucks with this phone and it
makes sense I mean this is probably one
of the biggest revamps and Apple
technology in a long time so yeah expect
these things to happen it's the curse of
the early adopter and hopefully that'll
get fixed soon I'll talk about the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 we get information on
it's possible processor apparently the
Exynos 9810 will be the one that takes
over here but most important is that it
seems that this whole architecture is
not going to change apparently we're
still gonna continue with the same 10
nanometer process from TSMC meaning we
might not see more efficiency or a
faster phone it's just going to be a
newer phone and hopefully they bring
some rebounds and changes obviously we
will share more as soon as
learn more information and finally the
very hot news today believe it or not
don't come from the regular players
let's talk about Qualcomm Oppo and
Xiaomi apparently these companies are
planning to team up according to digit
times to bring a competitor to face ID
now if you remember when we heard the
news of face ID analysts were predicting
that OMS would take up to two and a half
years to be able to replicate this
technology it seems that these companies
want to do it next year and bring that
to their flagships next year I'm a big
fan of Oppo phones so I can't wait to
see what they bring but it leads me to
the question today I mean do you really
think that we need face ID in the future
that this is the future of how to unlock
your phone I think it's not in my
particular case I feel that touch ID you
know fingerprint scanning should
continue and I guess Apple was just
trying something different here but this
is my opinion I do love the facial
scanning and the an emojis but I don't
think this should be it leave us a
comment down below your opinion is very
crucial here friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow us I'm
fucking out comment suscribe to our
channel by hitting this button up here

out daily up here and our thoughts on
the iPhone 10 down here you also follow
