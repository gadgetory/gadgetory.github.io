gets a possible pre-order date Google
Play just kind of leaked the most
affordable pixel variants to expect and
it seems we might get an Amazon
competitor to air pods with Alexa I'm
Jaime medley then I end up it is Friday
and the body knows it which of your in
Latin America that's a very popular
saying this is parking out daily
sponsored by the honor of you 20 if your
shoulders today begin with I don't know
if I should call this a deal or not I
mean I am NOT a fan of the home pod up
to the point where I haven't really
bought one and I don't really care but
if you're in the market for one and you
think that 350 bucks is crazy which I do
agree with it's now 299 $50 on discount
I'm not saying it's enough of a deal but
maybe you want a home pod that's the way
now let's talk about Amazon and the
future of Alexa as a I'm hoping mine
doesn't pick up the audio but point
being is we've got some trusted sources
claiming that Amazon is working on an
air pods competitor that they want to
built in the voice assistant that I
can't mention the name right now and
yeah that's I think that's actually a
cool idea I find that this is probably
one of the best voice assistance and
I've been testing it for pretty much
just a couple of months so I can't
imagine how good that would be so long
as they get the audio right now let's
talk about Samsung the Galaxy S 10 and
the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner
obviously it's state-of-the-art
technology because it uses sort of sonar
technology to be able to detect your
fingerprint through the ridges but
that's all fine until you bring a 3d
printer apparently it got spoof recently
obviously you need a lot of tech to have
that 3d printer and make that work but
yeah it just proved that there are ways
to fool the system I know they're
complicated but yeah that's something
that just got discovered apparently now
let's talk about Google and they're more
affordable variants of the Google pixel
3 and pixel 3 XL which are dubbed a 3a
and then three axl we've got Google Play
pretty much leaking the fact that these
devices exists are go and juanito with
your funny names but anyways
specifications are pretty much the same
that we've already seen with a lesser
processor on the smaller bearing the
better processor on the larger one and
then the usual suspects that we've
discussed already up to boredom
we just I don't know exactly when we're
getting this I wonder if Google IO or
what
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10
5g this is definitely one of the phones
that I'm actually looking out for not
necessarily just because it's pretty
much like a galaxy note without an S Pen
but the fact that obviously it brings a
different color option it brings 5g
connectivity for whatever that's out and
it brings time-of-flight sensing in
addition to other things we heard of a
possible launch in May now we hear the
pre-orders are gonna happen on April
18th we still don't have a price but
then the launch is apparently going to
be on May 16th on Verizon I'm looking
forward to it let's see if it does
happen let us know in the comments down
below I mean do you care about this 5g
variant or have you already chosen a
Samsung Galaxy S 10 that already
launched we'll see what we get I'm
really interested in this 5g device and
friends today's episode of the pagano
daily is sponsored by the honour view 20
this has proven to be one of our
favorite phones of the year thanks to a
gorgeous and unique back design a
whopping 48 megapixel camera that brings
an awesome night mode along with an
ultra clarity mode for better photos in
all scenarios it's one of the first was
a time of flight sensor for state of the
art 3d sensing and better portraits it's
also one of the first with a hole-punch
design for a selfie camera with one of
the smallest we've seen in the market
price this plus it's powerful caring 980
processor just $600 and this is why it's
so hard to beat follow the link in the
description below to learn more about
what makes the honor of you 20 so cool
