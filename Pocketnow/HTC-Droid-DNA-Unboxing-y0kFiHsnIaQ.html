pocketnow.com just back just this minute
returned from a whirlwind trip to New
York City where HTC and Verizon Wireless
invited us at pocketnow to witness the
results of their latest collaboration
and that turned out to be the droid DNA
from HTC we're going to unbox it we're
going to show you what's inside the
packaging take a quick look at the phone
we're gonna have a full review coming up
in the days ahead but until then let's
take a look at what's inside the box
once again I'm Michael this is pocket
now let's get to it so sometimes
unboxings are not the authentic things
that they seem to be sometimes for
whatever reason we have to get inside
the box before we actually show it to
you but that is not the case here this
device has not been powered on this is
going to be a true unboxing right off
the bat we can see that verizon HTC
making a big effort to set this device
apart we have a nice little window there
with the droid eyeball shining through
very creepy as is their habit verizon
HTC branding they're certified for 4G
LTE of course and a little list of what
the package contains but let's not dwell
on that let's actually find out for
ourselves take off the sleeve here
really nice to see premium packaging you
can't tell you how often we see
packaging that just doesn't live up to
the device inside let's go ahead and
pull this and pull this apart this is
not taped it it's just a really snug fit
I want to say give a big thanks while
we're at it look at that to HTC and
Verizon for giving us this review unit
to check out for you here there's a
little pull tab down under here where we
can just pop the device out so we don't
have to shake the box around and risk
dumping the device on the floor just
pull the phone out put it aside for a
second pop out the phone holder here get
a little finger tab here alright so
here's our SIM tray removal tool tool is
required to install your SIM card thank
you for the information see
verizon start guide the same thing in
another language there's probably an
easier way to do this isn't yes of
course there is we just pulled it up
that way a lot of user information there
there's our SIM card underneath it all
that's outside and underneath not a
whole lot going on USB cable charger the
last three phones of unbox have had the
same array of of non accessories
definitely headphones differently not
showing up as often as they used to but
that's alright let's go ahead and put
all that stuff aside there and bring the
phone back into the picture here screen
protector as is becoming common has some
call outs for the power and lock key up
top the SIM tray next door to wouldn't
get up close there and see this kind of
curved construction of the device here
fits very nicely in the hand pretty tall
in the hand as well very very light if
there were a removable battery the two
thousand 20 milliamp hour battery in the
back is not removable but if it were I
would say that this doesn't feel like it
has a battery in it back home and recent
apps they're USB charging port covered
with a flap on the bottom next to the
microphone there and the 4g LTE and
beats audio branding HTC branding right
in the center as we saw earlier today
and the camera lens up top so just to
finish up this video let's see if we can
pull the screen protector off here let's
listen to the awesome sound that makes
oh that's amazing put that aside while
we're at it we'll go ahead and pull off
the camera protector here as well we
have a phone that is ready for its first
power on you're gonna have to wait for
the full review video to see that first
power on because this device does not
have a charge currently but hopefully
you will not have to wait long for that
as I mentioned before we're gonna have a
full review of the droid DNA in the
coming days until then keep it locked to
pocket now you can follow us on twitter
at pocketnow tweets follow me on twitter
at captain two phones leave us a thumbs
up here on the video if you liked what
you saw few have a
you'd like us to respond to please leave
it on the post at pocketnow.com till
then thanks very much for watching and
we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
