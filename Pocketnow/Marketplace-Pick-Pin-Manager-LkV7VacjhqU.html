Paco calm and today i will show you
value phones pin manager and this is a
free program on windows mobile
marketplace and the application is
pretty powerful and i'll show you some
features about it so I'm just going to
input my pin right here and my pins
pretty simple it's just help so I'm
going okay and it's just going to give
me a little blurb about registering with
value phone calm which is free and
allows you to sync up your device and
I'll show you that in just a minute and
there was no and here I have some of my
personal information so i have a bank
card so i can go in there okay so it
just says the title is visa and i have
my account number on there as well as my
expiration date if I go down I have my
secure code which is the code on the
back I can also assign a password
sometimes when you buy things
internationally you have to have a
password on certain websites and I also
a picture right here so the cool thing
about this program is allows you to take
a picture of your card so just in case
you did input your information
incorrectly you have a picture right
there saved on your device so i can go
back and now if i wanted to view my
driver's license i can click here okay
so it's just under the category of
drivers license and title i just put
Washington and my driver's license
number of course it probably wouldn't
need a password for her driver's license
but if I did want to take a picture I
can have a picture I can have up to five
pictures of my driver's license some
drivers licenses have barcodes on the
back so i guess if you did get pulled
over without your license you would have
a little bit more proof but i don't know
if that would really get you out of a
ticket so I'm just going to back and you
can set up email accounts insurance
information take a picture of your
insurance card you will always have
proof of insurance on your device even
if you don't have your insurance card
with you especially if you use an
internet based program like assurance or
the general or some other
geico or somewhere some some insurance
company where they email you your
insurance cards and you neglect to print
them off and put them in your car you
can also input wireless LAN keys so if
you have many wireless LAN keys that you
need to save this is a great program to
do that go in here and to add info we
can select from many different
categories as you see bank cards bonus
cards documents driver's license email
accounts instant messaging insurance
lock pins mail-order catalogs
miscellaneous online shops and many more
the cool thing like this is all we have
to do is select one of these let's say
we want to add software and the annoying
thing about software especially if
you're a gamer is you have to keep the
access code in order to play that game
if you've lost the box or the little
insert inside so I'm just going to
select a title here let's try Raptor or
something like that and then info and
just a pic and password new okay anyways
you get the picture and cool thing about
this is all I have to do is click here
and it will launch the onboard camera
I'll just zoom out a little bit and now
I have a picture of an item right here
all I have to do is take a picture of
this
and it will close and now it has saved
the image on to my device so if I have
lost that code all I have to do is click
on this image and now I can see what the
image is and this is in the marketplace
pic and the pyramids called value phone
pin manager and it is free application
on windows mobile marketplace all you
have to do is search for pin manager to
find it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
