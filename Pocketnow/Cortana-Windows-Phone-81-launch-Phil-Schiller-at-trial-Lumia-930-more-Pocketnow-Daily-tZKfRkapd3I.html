aside from some lumias and Cortana the
Apple versus Samson trial continues at
this time Phil Schiller talks back and
BlackBerry has decided to file a divorce
against t-mobile I'm hi Mary that I and
just remember this blackberry uh never
bite the hand that feeds this is
a daily let's try something off of some
sort of official news as we do know that
the Samsung Galaxy s5 will not be ready
for sale until mid-april and still we
know that there are some Korean
companies and carriers that begin
selling it again Samsung will or so they
say and as it turns out we do have
positive sales for this galaxy s5 so far
obviously the phone is barely in the
market for a little while and we should
expect to be getting this phone very
soon in the pocket outlast for review so
we'll keep you posted on how worth it is
it now let's talk about blackberry and
t-mobile as we've got some very
interesting developments BlackBerry has
decided to not renew its contract with
tmobile to cell phones in the United
States through the carrier because
t-mobile decided to switch to anybody
that wanted to change their blackberry
phones for any other phone because
obviously blackberry 10 was a big
disappointment and I guess libraries
team is very personally and it's really
odd considering the fact that you know
the company really needs a lot of help
right now and the last thing they can do
is shoot down sales opportunities but
anyways let's see how that goes now
let's talk about the apple vs samsung
trial as this is day 2 and this trout
should not last too long but this time
it's the opportunity for Apple's first
witness which is the senior vice
president of Global Marketing which is
Phil Schiller and very interesting he
ended up reading the same statement that
he read in the previous two trials that
have been between Apple and Samsung and
it argues that definitely you know
Samsung has benefitted from Apple's new
innovation and it's really hard to tell
the innovation came from Apple or from
Samsung again the arguments are really
interesting and it keeps going we just
don't know exactly how Samsung is
planning to counteract to that let's see
how the drama continues in this so
father now let's not about standards and
this is very interesting a lot of people
complain about usb because you never
really know which side you're whole
when you connect it you have to look at
the cable and then connect it to the
computer or to your phone and works the
same way on either but apparently we are
getting a new version of USB that's
coming very soon and because of its size
it could be that this Cable will work on
both phones and computers obviously we
still don't know exactly how that's
going to be linked to the scripture for
full details on what to expect but it
would be really cool if that would
happen soon and finally for the very
very hot news of the day Microsoft
finally announces almost everything you
can think of at its BUILD conference
today we get Windows Phone 8.1 we get
the new Lumia 930 Lumia 630 635 we got
court Anna announced we get the Nokia
sian update for its current smartphone
lineup a ton of announcements and a lot
of detail that I really can't fit into
this segment sorry little description
for everything to read about there is a
lot of hot stuff being announced today
and I'll tell you it's really cool that
we don't have to wait a year to get them
as Microsoft is doing a better job and
launching things very soon but that is
usually the question of the day what do
you like the most about everything that
got announced today because in my
particular days I'll tell you this much
I like Cortana the whole concept behind
Cortana and everything sure it looks a
lot like Siri but it's kind of smarter
and it's really cool but leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is filming sure you follow us on
parking i'll comment subscribe to our
youtube channel as well he'd also follow
me on twitter and i'll just quarterly
