one unit will be thicker than the
average feature moto Z gets leaked and
don't expect many design changes and
Microsoft starts gearing up from some
sort of an event in May
I'm hi Mary that and yesterday I asked
for jokes I ended up getting comments
about my name again so for now enjoy the
t-shirt this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with deals as
a leak oh may not be having a good time
in the United States but it feels that
tax rebate season is the best time to
give you something so for now devices
like for example the lead pro 3 in
addition to others are being offered
with as much as $50 off but they're also
bundling a deal with DIRECTV
that I would highly recommend you look
in the link in the description now let's
talk about Microsoft as the company has
already sent out invitations for an
event to happen on may 2nd and this
event will be focused on education it
wouldn't be the first time but
apparently the company wants to try out
something new Chromebooks are really
dominating the education space right now
starting with the price tag so it seems
that we might be getting a new surface
that's underpowered probably a successor
to the surface 3 that hasn't been
refreshed in a while and it seems we
might be getting Windows cloud which is
the Chrome OS competitor let's see what
we get and for those of you fans of the
Moto Z and I know they're not many of
you the modular concept is there not
really a big fan of its design and
apparently the design is saying we've
got some leaked renders of the Moto Z
force design almost remains the same
about the only thing that changes is
really the fact that you get a dual
camera and that is great because you've
got one of the most insane camera hubs
in history which actually allows for the
moto mods which are making a comeback so
let's see now I'm probably one of the
most interesting turn of events let's
talk about the next generation Apple
watch apparently there is this project
that's been 5 years in the making
it started with Steve Jobs his idea of
having a wearable that would actually
help you track your health like truly
track your health with a full glucose
tracker for diabetics for example and
well
he hasn't really figured it out yet but
apparently there's the secret group
working on this again for five years and
it seems that they've achieved progress
to the point where a trusted sources
claim that it is already in trials that
government authority is already looking
at this could this be the major feature
of the next generation Apple watch only
time will tell and finally the most
interesting news to date in addition to
those of the Apple watch have to do with
the next generation iPhone it's got
leaked if it this is the possible design
and let me just start it off by saying
it's horrible that camera hub vertically
looks horrible in my opinion but this
would be the first time that we see
designs that don't really look as bad
once you get the final product now it's
really hard to tell design materials
what we do notice which is the most
important is that the bezels are pretty
much taking a step back just like we see
with the LG G 6 and the other is that
apparently this phone is getting thicker
or at least one of the variants is a
full millimeter thicker than the iPhone
7 plus and the 7 plus is a thick phone
it leads me to the question of the day
what do you think about these design
renders do you think that Apple will
make a phone goes ugly in my case you
never know let's see what we get leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
