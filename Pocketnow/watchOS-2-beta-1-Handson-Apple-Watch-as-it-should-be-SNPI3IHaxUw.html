its current state is not what the
company intended it to be and part of
the road to solving this is launching
watch os/2 later this year I'm high
memory that I will pocket now and let's
take a quick look at watch os/2 beta 1
watch os/2 may be visually identical to
the existing version that everyone is
using but Apple has baked in a ton of
really neat tricks that help it become
less of a slave of your iPhone and more
of a true competitor to other wearables
in the market some of these features
like native applications won't be able
to be shown on this video because we
sadly have to wait for developers to
deal with that first but we'll be
looking at these in future videos and
betas to come as a timepiece the Apple
watch received a few new updates there's
a new photos watch phase that is
populated by the photo albums you have
stored on your watch and the swap every
time you lift your wrist which can be
very nostalgic every now and then
there's also a really cool time-lapse
watch phase of hot cities around the
world but don't think the list is big
users and developers are also given the
ability to create new complications in
order to adapt the watch to your
personal needs but the my personal needs
require an analog clock and I don't see
that feature available here though a
neat feature is time travel where you
can rotate the digital crown on your
watch phase and see upcoming
appointments and yes you even get
options for a nightstand though keep in
mind you actually have to set the watch
on its side for this to work when it
comes to communications you can now add
different sets of friends because you
most probably want to segregate work
friends personal etc and you can
interact with these friends with
different doodle colors now even though
that's probably one gimmick I would
rarely ever use if you're using Apple's
email application you can now respond to
emails from the application as well
though again limited to the very dated
iOS application FaceTime audio is now
also supported for phone calls as well
something that should have worked from
day one and well it's great that it's
now available health and fitness also
received the major update as third-party
native applications will now be able to
contribute to your fitness activity and
even use health kit resources as well
you can now tell Sri to start a
30-minute run as well and Cirie will
respond accordingly so in that case
you'll also be limited to apple's
proprietary workout application
we'll report back on accuracy for these
workouts though as my experience with
watch OS one was really not positives
specifically when it calculated distance
ran for example other iOS 9 enhancements
like Apple wallet and public transit
will also be supported here but again
these are things that need to be tested
once they're available and so far that's
really the morale of beta 1 for watch
os/2 we're not sure if Apple will
provide consumers with a public beta but
beta 1 has proven to be very buggy in
response times and then the fact that
it's still waiting for developers to
take advantage of it will report back
with born as soon as Apple populates
more features in future betas to come
we've got a lot more coverage of iOS 9
watch os/2 and much much more so make
sure you follow us on social media
subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
you can follow me on Twitter I'm
underscored iveta please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw I
am Hein that'll be better thank you very
much for watching we'll see you on the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
