phone is one of the sharpest coolest
looking mobile platforms out there but
it just can't seem to gain any traction
now after almost two years without a
true flagship a seven point six billion
dollar write down and a massive round of
layoffs Microsoft is counting on a brand
new operating system and mostly new
hardware to make a phone worthy of the
fans I'm Michael Fisher let's find out
if that phone is finally here in pocket
now's Lumia 950 review in the hand the
Lumia 950 is an almost totally
unremarkable smartphone it's matte
finished polycarbonate evokes memories
of older prouder Lumias like the ten
twenty and nine thirty but it lacks the
reassuring heft of the former and the
classy metallic trim of the latter also
absent is any of the whimsy of earlier
Lumia designs the neon colors replaced
by staid black and white options at just
over eight millimeters thick and 150
grams in mass even its size is
middle-of-the-road fortunately if you
like us you just can't live with that
you can gussy it up a little bit with an
aftermarket back like this leather one
from mozo but keep in mind then you're
spending even more money than the phone
already costs get past that forgettable
design and there's plenty to like here
starting with the display this is a 5.2
inch panel with a clear black
polarization filter for enhanced
daylight readability and it brings with
it the usual inky blacks and heavy
saturation common to OLED screens and
from the moment the little Microsoft
logo pops up on the boot screen you know
you're looking at a quad HD display it's
sharpness makes the text on live tiles
come to life and it's especially evident
on the little notification symbols in
the read on status bar windows looks
great in quad HD Windows Phone fans have
been waiting nearly two years for a
proper flagship so the Lumia 950 s story
is very much centered on
the 950 comes packing 32 gigs of storage
29 of which are available out of the box
and it also offers a microSD slot for
storage expansion that slot sits
alongside a 3000 milliamp hour battery
which is also removable a rarity these
days and that battery is rechargeable
via USB type-c or by Qi or PM a wireless
top-up most of that juice is going to go
to the Snapdragon 808 processor and
three gigs of ram that make the whole
thing work there is one more trick
hiding beneath the Gorilla Glass 3 here
and it's a doozy hit the unlock button
and you're greeted by Windows hello an
infrared sensor that grants you access
through an iris scan it takes a bit of
training and it's not a hundred percent
effective because it's still in beta but
it's surprisingly speedy when it does
work and it's so futuristic
so Wrath of Khan that we can't call it
anything but awesome for all that's
changed in the jump from Windows Phone
to Windows 10 we're glad to report that
the Start screen is much the same as
ever with options galore for minimalists
and info hounds alike we're in the
latter camp so our Start screen is
packed with data from headlines to
notifications to weather reports all of
it instantly visible the moment we
unlock the phone this kind of glance
ability goes back to the very first days
of Windows Phone and it remains one of
the principal benefits of the platform
iOS and Android offers similar
functionality through widgets but they
lack the cohesive look and feel that
Windows offers elsewhere things are more
conventional and less consistent where
older Windows Phones used elegant and
easy to control sliding panels to access
different app screens Windows 10 relies
on hamburger menus aping one of the
worst design precedents of iOS meanwhile
longtime Lumia staples like double tap
to wake are notably absent from the 950
even as old touches like the always-on
glance screen remain the result of all
this is a mishmash of holdover features
and absentee ones with the occasional
WTF peppered in still using this phone
after a long windows phone sabbatical
feels a lot like coming home
we love hearing the woodpecker clack of
the excellent virtual keyboard now with
the Handy cursor control managing email
and calendar appointments through the
new Outlook apps is a beautiful
experience thanks to the slick UI design
the Cortana virtual assistant is really
good at context and a simple hey there
Cortana is enough to wake the phone if
you can't spare a hand sadly a Windows
Phones most enduring challenge the app
gap is actually getting worse with apps
like Bank of America chase Intuit mint
NBC American Airlines and hotel tonight
all shutting the doors on their Windows
Phone apps in 2015 meanwhile apps like
Instagram haven't seen a meaningful
update in over a year and stand in
titles like the Microsoft made Facebook
app are slow and riddled with bugs there
is some good news on the horizon here
all new Facebook Instagram and messenger
apps are on the way from Windows 10 and
because these will be universal apps
they'll work on every form factor from
the desktop to the handheld that's part
of Microsoft's new pitch with a hundred
and ten million Windows 10 devices
currently on the market the company
hopes to attract developers through
sheer scale and we've run into some
pleasant surprises - we found apps we
didn't expect to find from fallouts
pip-boy companion to the obscure live
ATC air traffic control scanner
Microsoft has a few winners in here -
the new Maps application does a nice job
of providing integrated directions for
driving walking and public transit and
the tongue-in-cheek MS DOS emulator
contains a few great Easter eggs for all
you hardcore nerds who long for the days
of Windows 3.1 running on the desktop oh
and speaking of desktops if you invest
in the right accessories the Lumia 950
is capable of converting itself into a
semblance of a Windows PC using a
feature called continuum we cover this
feature in greater depth in a separate
video which will link you to but in some
it's a larger canvas for your smartphone
that works really well as long as you
can find yourself to light work the
Lumia brand has been built in part on a
legacy of excellent smart
cameras and the specs here definitely
measure up this is a 20 megapixel sensor
with a 6 element lens and 5th generation
optical stabilization its aperture size
is as large as the galaxy s6 while it's
triple LED flash is designed to avoid
blowing out flesh tones shooting with
this phone is a lot of fun launching the
camera is as simple as pressing the
shutter button and focusing can be done
with a half press on the same key by
default the 950 will shoot in automatic
mode and that includes a rich capture
feature that optimizes the photo right
after it's taken and using the flash in
concert with this feature means you can
go back in and adjust the flash level
after you've taken the photo the
software lenses from previous
generations are still here allowing you
to add functions like document scanners
barcode readers or fun filters and a
shot-by-shot basis and if you don't want
post-processing messing with your photo
quality Microsoft still offers a full
suite of manual controls with everything
from ISO to exposure time to focus
adjustable on the fly this phone is a
pro photographers dream date that's not
to say it doesn't struggle in more
casual scenarios despite the optical
stabilization our photos often featured
a fair amount of motion blur especially
in low-light now we don't have the
steadiest hands around but even when we
stabilize the phone against a tree it
didn't always save us from a blurry shot
and while photos appear rich and vibrant
on the Lumia screen they sometimes seem
a bit dead when viewed on other screens
still it's an excellent camera we'll
shut up for a second here and let you be
the judge
if you wanted more 4k video samples from
that camera test well so did we but our
Lumia 950 doesn't seem to like shooting
4k video it's buggy in other words so
much so that we requested a replacement
device from Microsoft halfway through
our review process while the new unit is
better it still hasn't fixed all the
problems we ran into it the first one
which included the notification shade
failing to deploy even with repeated
swipes the camera button only working in
portrait mode possibly a feature but if
so it's a dumb one outlook taking way
too long to fetch and send email Windows
Store downloads and updates frequently
timing out for no reason the People Hub
not reliably syncing with the Google
Apps account Live Tiles getting stuck on
the same image regardless of new updates
and finally restarts boy howdy does this
phone love to reboot with no warning
all right look Windows 10 is new but
this isn't a beta product and coming
from Windows Phone 8 which was pretty
rock-solid these stability issues are
disappointing voice calls work as they
should and they're plenty loud via the
built-in earpiece aside from a few
dropped frames here and there the
graphically demanding asphalt 8 runs
well as do less intensive titles the
only game that really tripped the phone
up was modern combat 5 but that was
mostly in the cutscenes audio quality
over the rear firing speaker is on the
tinny side but quite loud and there's a
dedicated equalizer featuring many
custom options and virtual surround
sound for earphone listening and finally
the Lumia 950 is about average in terms
of endurance it's unlikely to last more
than a day of heavy use but its various
recharging options make life easier the
USB type-c charger is pretty zippy and
the wireless charging ensures you'll be
able to top-up on either your own
charging plate or at your local
Starbucks
Microsoft told us it built the Lumia 950
for the Windows Phone fan
it's an effort the company says to
provide that audience with a phone
they're proud to carry that's savvy
positioning on the part of Microsoft
because those fans are the only people
to whom we can recommend the Lumia 950
Windows 10 mobile does an awful lot of
cool stuff and does it with a sense of
style that it's iOS and Android
competitors lack we're longtime Windows
Phone fans at PocketNow and we're pretty
excited by the potential this device
embodies some of us are even considering
buying one but outside the windows found
fan circle the Lumia 950 does very
little to earn its $600 price tag it
struggles with the very fundamentals of
the smartphone experience like shooting
video and checking email it struggles
with the same app gap problems that have
plagued its predecessors for the past
five years and it seems to have been
designed to blend in not to stand out as
the Windows 10 ecosystem grows we may
eventually see the day where a Windows
powered smartphone has a place in
pockets other than Microsoft's devoted
following but today is not that day the
Lumia 950 is a smart phone for the fans
and it's a pretty good one all others
for now need not apply
we've got so much more detail including
a full continuum right up in our
complete Lumia 950 review at pocket now
folks check it out at the link in the
description and be sure to let us know
what you think of Microsoft's latest hit
us up on social media at pocket now till
next time this has been michael fisher

watching we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
