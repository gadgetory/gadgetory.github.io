pocketnow.com and this is round two of
the browser speed test with the new
froyo browser which is claiming by
google to be the world's fastest mobile
browser versus the opera mobile 10 on
the HTC hd2 and Safari on the iphone 3gs
let's do it okay so the reason we're
doing round two is because in round one
we left flash 10.1 beta stay on which
really slowed down a lot of web pages
yes it gave us Flash content but it also
means scrolling slow and some pages just
did it load as fast as they would have
if we turned it off so now it's off
let's see how big of a difference this
makes now that the playing field is a
little bit more even so we'll go into
all of these devices and will launch the
browsers will be on the same Wi-Fi
network all right here we go punch that
browser this browser and this browser
we're on different pages here so let's
go to pocketnow.com on all of them try
to do it at the same time but you know
how difficult that can be so we'll just
do a one two three and they're off again
we've got flash 10.1 turned off on froyo
here let's see how fast it goes they're
still going looks like the iPhone finish
first looks like hd2 finished to second
and actually froyo finish last let's
take a look at scrolling now with flash
off it's a lot smoother here in Froyo so
let's zoom in here to a particular link
and we will click on the same permalink
and then we'll bounce around to a few
other websites to see how fast things
are or how slow they are depending on
which browser you're talking about ok
let's try we're just going to do one two
three one two three
HD to finish first iphone second the
froyo browser third it looks like it's
getting hung up on something here on the
page but i can assure you the flash is
not turned on so let's go to another
website let's go to say New York Times
so NY Times ok and we're going to do one
time one two and three see which one
gets there ok so the froyo browser was
there the fastest even though we started
here hd2 finished second the iphone 3gs
is coming up third let's move down the
page and see what it's like they all
look really good just like the desktop
it's just a matter of which gets done
first let's go to another website
let's go to dell.com just to a should
have some extra graphical elements that
could slow things down right here we go
we're going to go go and go okay so
we're getting the mobile site on these
two devices so let's load up the full
site if there is a link down here it's a
view full PC site and we'll try to get
those at the same time that we can't I
can't zoom in there so let's just try
this view full PC site nope that's not
right sometimes these links are so small
it's difficult to press there we go for
you full PC side so one step ahead on
the Froyo it was extremely fast you move
around on the screen front on the screen
go up here so we can do for home for
home and for home
froyo finished first looks like overall
froyo is finishing first it's not first
by a huge margin but overall we're
getting it to be first let's go to yet
another website will go to say cnet com
all right we're ready go go go we're
getting the mobile version here the
iphone version here and the full version
over here on opera mobile all these
websites have have mobile versions so
once again I'm going to go to the bottom
and click on the view full cnet site
link did take there oh there we go can
zoom in a little bit beautiful scene at
site beautiful cnet site and I'd leave
this didn't translate into what I was
hoping it would so anyhow we'll compare
I guess in this case a froyo with the
hd2 since the hd2 actually seems to be
outperforming the iphone browser so
let's check screen rotation speed here
so faster on froyo let's do it the other
way if we can get it right faster on
froyo definitely and let's go to one
more website and compare these two
browsers let's go to gizmodo com I think
what's going to happen is that the hd2
is going to load the full site and then
the nexus one is going to load the
natural site so let's give it a try okay
good this is perfect test see which one
finishes first
okay so froyo finished actually about
still going so we're up to like seven
seconds now eight about eight seconds
faster that's very significant comparing
these two browsers and we'll jump around
see how scrolling feels very smooth on
both devices although let's see if we
get checkerboards we don't get
checkerboards at all on on froyo whereas
on the hd2 if you go really fast you get
kind of the checkerboard pattern so it's
another way that the Froyo browser
really has a some great performance so
let's zoom in on this picture and we're
going to tap on the picture at the same
time load the the permalink page here
they go it's really amazing how far web
browsers on mobile devices have come
here they go and look like Froyo finish
first
very good and I just want to bring in
the iphone again and we're going to go
to gizmodo and do the same test that we
just did with that with the with the hd2
and the nexus one so again we want to go
down to the full full view here and
we'll go back to the homepage on froyo
alright let's do a screen rotation speed
test froyo is faster froyo is faster you
don't have that screen on a minute and
animation let's scroll down fast and see
what happens on the iphone 3gs if we get
checkerboards whoops no it's pretty good
pretty good so let's go and click on an
image here let's click on this one stop
it again tap
froyo is faster iphone 3gs is struggling
and go back to the home page and try one
more link just to triple check
okay we'll go to this here click on this
image see which comes up faster
so yeah froyo is faster froyo finished
about up to about five seconds now
before the iphone 3gs and sometimes more
than that on the HTC hd2 so i think it
can be said that if you have the flash
turned off or you can even have it of
course enable only when you want it to
through the settings here so where are
we go down to enable plugins on demand
so that it says it asks you if you want
to turn on the flash content on a per
case basis when you do this fro your
browser is indeed ninety percent of the
time the fastest mobile browser of any
smartphone operating system and that is
quite a claim and that's extremely
important because are the core functions
of a smartphone is the browser and the
froyo browser is awesome so that was
just another test round to the mobile
browser comparison test with froyo on
the google nexus one be sure to give the
video a thumbs up if you liked it and
