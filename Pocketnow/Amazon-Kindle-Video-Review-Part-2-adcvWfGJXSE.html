pocketnow.com and this is part 2 of the
video review of the Amazon Kindle now
I'm gonna pick it up here and you'll
notice something you see that the screen
has a bit of a glare and that's
unfortunate because often times when
you're reading with the Kindle you're
gonna have an overhead light source or
be next to a lamp and having a glare can
be bothersome if you catch it in the
right angle it's not as Glary as say an
iPhone but it's still you know it's
still an annoyance anyway so let's turn
it on the Kindle has a 6 inch screen the
resolution is 800 by 600 the screen
technology is called it's called an
electro phoretic and display for the
rest of us we call it II tink because
it's made to look like ink on a page
just like a real book and it does a
pretty good job I'll give you a good
example of that in a second to select
things with the Kindle you use this
selection wheel on the bottom right here
you kind of drag your finger along it
and this interesting looking Chrome I
don't even know what to call it let's
call it a chrome strip moves up and down
and when you find what you want I'm
gonna go to the tipping point up at the
top you just press it inward and it
selects it and here we are in the
beginning of the tipping point and over
here I have the actual book so we can
kind of get an idea of how the contrast
compares from the Kindle to an actual
book I'm gonna get real close here the
contrast is much greater on the Kindle
than it is on a computer screen but it
still could be improved I mean this is a
first generation product that the back
could be background could be whiter the
text could be blacker maybe the next
generation product will have even
greater contrast I'm sure it will and
and thereafter eventually we'll have a
device that can literally replicate the
look of paper but until then it does a
good job to change the page as you know
you press this next page button the
screen flashes every time as it has to
read your all itself now something I
find a little bit of annoying is is that
there's a lot of wasted space on the
left here and on the top I feel like
they could push the text into that area
because as it is there's a limited
amount of text that
fit on one screen at a time let me show
you the the kind of layout of every page
you've got the the name of the book in
the top here and it tells you if it's a
sample the author and there's a little
flap there that denotes whether you have
it bookmarked and I have this page
bookmarked down here we have a location
tracker this is how you know if you're
halfway through the book or you know
almost done down here we have a wireless
meter but it says off because I have it
turned off to save battery life the left
of that is a battery meter and to the
right of that is menu now there's a lot
that Kindle does that a standard book
can't do for example you can change the
text size and I do that by pressing this
text chooser button down here and then I
get a pop-up and then I use this
selector to say I want to go to the
number three and let's see what that
does the screen refreshes and it's much
bigger okay good
something else you can do with the
Kindle that you can't do with a standard
book is look up a word on the fly well I
mean if you have a book you got to get
the dictionary find the letter P for a
certain word and you know look down the
page there's PRP you know and it takes a
long time at least it takes me a long
time on this let's find a word that we
want to look up doo doo doo how about
inflatable there's inflatable I know
what that means but perhaps someone out
there doesn't so I'm gonna click on
inflatable I'm gonna actually click on
the line and what it does is it gives up
brings up a context menu
I'm gonna choose look up and it will
show me the definitions of the words on
that line and it takes a moment but here
we get put 25 foot and it's page 1 of 2
so I can go to the next page and on the
next page will be inflatable there it is
and if you want more details about the
word inflatable you can select the word
and it takes you into a screen that
shows you pronunciation and sometimes it
shows you the origin of the word as well
which is really helpful and when you're
done with that you click on the back
button
so reading what the kindle is an
enjoyable experience I like to keep the
text size on the smallest so I can see
the most amount of text on the screen at
one time the time that it takes to turn
the page is about one and a half seconds
and if you kind of compare that to a
book if you're reading along it's about
it's about one and a half seconds - so
it's comparable in that in that sense I
really like the reading experience it's
comfortable on the eyes my eyes don't
get tired I can get into the book into
the author's world as I can with a paper
book so just because it's an electronic
device doesn't mean that you know it
feels like I'm reading off of a computer
because it doesn't that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
