order in 2016 but oneplus has spent the
last three years proving that you don't
need to break the bank to expect more
just four months after the release of
the 1+3 the company decided that it
could up the ante yet again for the
holidays and now it's time for our full
review I'm home already better with
pocket now and this is the one plus 3t
what do you call a beautiful phone
that's running all the latest and
greatest hardware that can power Android
we mostly mail these as flack ships but
in the case of one-plus this is more
rebellion than anything the company
prides itself in launching flagship
killers using the price tag as its main
go to market strategy and so far that
has actually worked I have to admit this
is my first time actively testing one
plus unit and let's just say that the 3t
has me very impressed visually the 1
plus 3t is identical to the 3 and that's
the main point of Marvell see this phone
weighs exactly the same as its
predecessor but sports 13% more battery
the guts are now more powerful than
Snapdragon 801 processor and 6 gigs of
ram along with storage options then go
from 64 to 128 gigabytes there's still
no expandable storage but options for to
send cards continue in this new variant
there's a new sapphire lens cover
protecting the 16 megapixel shooter
that's now improved with E is supports
for the old oh is and the new 16
megapixel selfie camera with improved
low-light performance oh and if you're
liking the new gunmetal color option yes
that's also a new change everything else
remains the same I joined one in the
opinion of the 5.5 inch 1080p optic
AMOLED display isn't our favorite and
the speaker design and placement could
use a little more originality to avoid
muffling but that would be nitpicking my
week with the 1+3 T has led me to one of
the most delightful experiences I've
ever had with an Android phone and the
build quality and feel in the hand play
a major role in this now to be honest
what I've liked most about this phone is
the software if you notice that my
launcher bares a striking resemblance to
the pixel that's because oxygen OS is a
customization dreamboat oneplus actually
knows how to make circular folders look
good and the option for circular icons
is far more standard than what we see
from Google I also love the approach on
the soft keys you can customize every
single thing they do want to swap their
order go right ahead
do you prefer soft keys instead of
hardware yes you can do that want to
launch the
with a long press go ahead want to
quickly multitask to your old
application like you can a nougat yeah
you can want to call the notification
shade with a button this phone won't
stop you the notification shade also has
the nougat approach of primary icons at
the top that are customizable as well
there's even a functional always-on mode
that triggers whenever you hover your
hand
no there is no Google assistant but you
can set your home button to press and
hold for Google now search and I even
said double tap on the home button for
now on tap about the only thing missing
is split-window multitasking but and
everything else Bravo 1 plus this is by
far one of my favorite launchers hands
down I've been using the 1 + 3 T for a
week in New York City and on dudas and
this phone is a beast it powers through
software without a stutter and it plays
graphics intensive games like the
flagship should now phone calls on
either SIM slot are what I'd call
average the problem is that this is not
the loudest earpiece that I've ever
heard but I wouldn't call it the worst
either battery life is also very
pleasing I mostly tested the 1 + 3 T
with just one SIM card and it pretty
much lasted through a day of moderate to
heavy use and I do love - charging every
single time as you do get up to a full
day of use for just 30 minutes on a
charge the camera experience is also
proven to be relatively good for a phone
in this price range during the day we've
got deep color saturation and contrast
on photos and in low-light I can't say
this camera does hold its ground in
comparison to some of the other
flagships that it's trying to kill video
stabilization also proves to improve in
comparison to the experience of the 1 +
3 which I found to be great
about the only spot where I'm not really
impressed are in the improvements in the
selfie ground mainly because it was
extremely hard to get a stable shot in
low-light I'm not sure if this has to do
with a software problem or anything but
sadly the selfie camera is not what I
would call impressive with all its
improvements in low-light overall even
with the things that aren't really
perfect I have to admit that I am very
impressed with my experience using the
one plus 3t for various reasons I had
never really had the opportunity to test
the oneplus in the past but this is one
phone that I'm really going to struggle
moving away from you've got great build
quality one of the best launchers I've
ever tested for Android a very good
camera experience and a price tag that's
just really hard to beat for everything
you're getting really the closest
competitor to all these specifications
is a whopping 220 dollars more expensive
and I can't really say that it's better
than the 1 plus 3t I highly recommend
you buy this phone because this is one
of those experience you just won't be
able to understand unless you really
give it a try
