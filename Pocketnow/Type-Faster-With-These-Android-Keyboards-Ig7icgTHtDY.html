Android phone I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and these are a few Android
keyboards that will help you type faster
one of the greatest aspects of Android
is the ability to replace virtually any
aspect of the operating system that you
don't like with ease so you don't like
the default browser change it not a fan
of the stock launcher change it and if
you just can't stand the stock keyboard
change it over the course of a few years
third-party Android keyboards have grown
in numbers popularity and functionality
although there are dozens of replacement
imes there are a few that have
rightfully earned a name for themselves
by helping frustrated mobile users type
faster or accurately and with fewer
errors SwiftKey originally just an idea
between doctor ben Medlock and John
Reynolds has since flourished into a
thriving business one of the most
successful and likewise popular
third-party keyboards available on
Android the standout feature of Swift
key is its artificial intelligence the
way it incorporates natural language to
learn the way you type and immediately
begin predicting your next words simply
sign in to Facebook Twitter and Gmail
and Swift key will begin parsing your
accounts to learn your typing habits in
a matter of minutes its able to
accurately predict the way you type and
guess your next word the first time you
use it it's a bit creepy but after you
get used to swift key finishing your
sentences you learn to expect it and
become much faster at typing last year
SwiftKey introduced a couple new
features the first of which was a new
algorithm which inserts missed faces and
separates words automatically you can
literally type an entire sentence
without ever needing to press the
spacebar the second feature was swipe
like gesture typing bring all these
features together into a single package
and you have yourself one of the most
advanced software keyboards ever swipe
was a software keyboard that brought
gesture typing into the limelight
single-handed the idea is that simply
sliding your finger between letters
instead of tapping them one by one is
both quicker and more accurate of course
there is a small learning curve in the
beginning it takes a bit of practice to
get out of the habit of pecking away at
a tiny keyboard but once you get the
gist you'll be sliding your finger
around the keyboard faster than you ever
thought possible just watch out for
those short words as those continually
prove to be the most tricky in more
recent versions swipe has added
prediction software and the ability to
learn from your
accounts putting it and SwiftKey on a
fairly level playing field swipe unlike
other keyboards mentioned in this video
is not found in the Play Store instead
you will find a public beta download on
swipe site linked in the description
below keep in mind both Swift key and
swipe are often used by manufacturers
and their proprietary keyboards the
Samsung Galaxy s4
for example incorporates Swift key
technology in its stock keyboard and
countless devices have come pre-loaded
with swipe over the years getting away
from gesture typing for a second thumb
keyboard is great for the more
traditional type ER especially those
with tablets or tablets gesture typing
is not nearly as effective on a larger
device you have to drag your finger
significantly further and on some laying
the tablet down and typing in a more
traditional QWERTY fashion as possible
but when you're holding a tablet laying
on the couch or in a position we're
laying the tablet flat to type with 10
fingers isn't possible typing with two
thumbs or packing with a single finger
can be quite cumbersome thumb keyboard
splits the keyboard in several different
user definable layouts that make typing
with the thumbs more ergonomic and
simple it also works on phones for those
who prefer typing in landscape or the
less traditional one thumb one index
finger style in truth the stock Android
keyboard has come a long way since
Gingerbread in the Android 4.2 update
Google made some much-needed
improvements to its keyboard not only
does the new keyboard offer word
predictions it incorporates the
ever-popular gesture typing capabilities
unfortunately many manufacturers remove
the stock keyboard in favour of their
own so if you're not running stock
Android and it's not readily available
in the input method menu you're out of
luck there are some third-party
keyboards that try to mimic the stock
jellybean keyboard in the Play Store but
they aren't exact replicas Android has
also sparked some innovation in some
keyboard developers - keyboards in
particular think outside the box outside
the constraints if your typical QWERTY
keyboard and implement totally different
styles of input altogether the first of
which is 8-pin using a large circle in
the middle four quadrants and a rather
daunting letter layout this keyboard was
developed after some research on how
people continuously draw on a small
piece of paper with a pin you might want
to check out their video for a better
explanation it's difficult to get the
hang of and not exactly practical
but it's quite fun and interesting to
use the second is menuhim currently
being crowd funded on indiegogo minimum
also breaks from the typewriter mold and
shrinks the keyboard down to a single
row of letters the prototype version of
menuhim is expected to be released in
early 2014 and public betas will be
available later this year it's
impossible to cover all the third party
keyboards in a single video so be sure
to share your favorites in the comments
