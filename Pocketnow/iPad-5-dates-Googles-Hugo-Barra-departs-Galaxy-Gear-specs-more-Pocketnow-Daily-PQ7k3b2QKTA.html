September launch looks tricky leak
samsung galaxy gear specs include some
odd storage options and Google's ovata
leaves for some better luck in the
Orient I'm high memory that I and tell
me something is it just me or when you
hear the word galaxy year the last thing
you think of as a watch this is pocket
now daily letters day off with some
official and unofficial news on the
official side if you're interested on
the Moto X on Verizon it's now available
online in black and white and that's it
there is no customization options yet at
least for verizon but if you're
interested in this phone in europe
apparently we know that there is going
to be some sort of a budget Moto X for
Europe and apparently it will have some
replaceable back plates which we wonder
why never made it to the original phone
in the US now let's talk about nokia and
their phablet project apparently it's
going to be called banded and well lumia
1520 is gonna be the name and we finally
get its first photographed being
compared to what we think is a Lumia 720
and this thing is not only massive but
it's got this protector cover that looks
like an iPad Smart Cover on one hand and
then on the other hand if you look at
Windows Phone it doesn't really look
like if it's real but i don't know let's
see how that goes now let's talk about
samson first of all the galaxy gear
we've got some leaked specifications on
this SmartWatch links down below the
list is kind of big but probably the
most interesting products that we get 6
and 8 gigabyte storage options I've
never heard of 60 gigabytes before but
first of all why would we want so much
storage on a watch next to wonder I
wonder what they're planning with this
thing but on the other hand we've got
some prices for the galaxy and X you
know that sort of DSLR camera that runs
android and prepare those 17 hundred
dollars if you want that thing with the
lens anyways now let's talk about the
ipad we get another leak body of the
ipad 5 that looks just like an ipad mini
only bigger but well trusted sources say
that apparently this tablet will not be
ready for a launch on September 10th
apparently we will be getting another
event for the iPad which is pretty much
what happens almost every year anyway so
stay tuned for that let's see what we do
get on September attempts we haven't
even gotten invitations for that thing
and finally for some interesting news of
the day we all remember obovata which
was pretty much available in every
keynote when any nexus product was
launching was google's VP of Product
Management for Android and he just
confirmed that he's leaving the company
for Seattle me which is an oem in China
which is kind of interesting I mean that
was a really good job at Google it's
kind of interesting to see what he's
planning to do and what will happen to
the Nexus lineup for Google's Android
project in the future so that was you to
the question of the day do you think
that will go about us departure will
influence in any way what happens with
the Nexus product lineup or Android in
the future in my particular case
honestly well android is going through a
lot of changes a lot of these are
interesting like for example what's in
darts doing with the chromecast then
it's mixed with android and everything
but leave us a comment down below i mean
i'm not really sure what to make of it
yet of course friends is always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone it's
outgrowth mushy follow us on out
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
as well you can also follow me on
Twitter I'm underscore iveta let's give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I am hina Rivera thank you very
much for watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
