light which is technically not
everything this which is famous for we
have new renders of the galaxy note n
that show off the new color variants and
they remind us a lot of a certain device
and trumps administration just gave us a
little bit of needed clarity for the
Huawei case though sadly not enough I'm
Jaime Mehta leave it and I cannot wait
for a phone call from my ten-year-old to
have a long conversation about the new
Nintendo switch and how much he wants
the yellow variant this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for a new
pixel probably you receive the promo
code email that I received to where you
get up to three hundred dollars off a
pixel three-year pixel three Excel think
about it is if you received two emails
it's for a reason the first one had a
wrong promo code that because of a
glitch you weren't able to claim now
there should be a second email with the
right ones you get from the two hundred
to an extra hundred dollars off
depending on what particular case you're
looking for you can learn more in the
description and for those of you that
claim that there are not enough where OS
smart watches out there I'm actually one
of them my boy just came out with a new
version of the tick watch pro now with
4G LTE the company has reengineered the
watch leverage its 4G LTE wireless
connectivity it's probably the
snapdragon where 2100 SOC yes not the
3100
it features one gigabyte of ram 4 gigs
of storage that displays the same dual
approach from the standard version
meaning a 1.3 9 inch OLED with 400 by
400 pixels in addition to an FS TN LCD
screen to save up on battery life price
tag is 279 you will get it as soon as
August 10th 2019 expect some coverage
very soon as our unit has already
arrived and now let's start out the
greatest crossover since Avengers and
game those of you that have been wanting
to be able to watch YouTube on your fire
TV now it's official that it's available
but also it's the other way around if
you have an Android TV or a chromecast
you will notice that prime video is now
available and this is actually great
it's good to see companies working
together I don't necessarily see any
catches as to loopholes they have to go
around to be able to purchase content or
anything which is great but I'll be
giving it a try soon and I'll let you
know if it's
actually that way obviously again it's
great news and now let's discuss the
huawei ban in the United States and
specifically the fact that we had
president trump claiming that he was
going to ease the ban on the company but
we didn't really get any specifics as to
what we finally get clarity until today
US Commerce Secretary just said that
they would issue a license to products
that are not a threat to the US they did
say that Huawei is still on the entities
list and doesn't change the scope of
items requiring licenses we still don't
know if they can use Android or not but
we do know that Intel and Holcomb have
been silently rooting for the government
to ease the ban as they state that
smartphones and laptops servers are not
security issues just to give you an idea
while we spent 11 billion dollars
purchasing u.s. equipment last year so
obviously a ton of companies are being
affected right now let's see how things
evolve is obviously Android is our
biggest concern here and let's now talk
about the Samsung Galaxy Note and we're
getting close to the impact event we get
more details as to essentials like color
variants in addition to final design
which I am really liking a lot we have a
prism silver that looks a lot like the
p20 pros gradient color and the usual
black variant this is actually the
regular Note 10 which is why it lacks
the extra camera lens and samo will
sources also tell us that the 5g variant
of the note 10 will bring from 256 to up
to one terabyte and that one terabyte
variant is actually going to bring 12
gigs of RAM obviously it's not a novelty
to have 12 gigs of ram at a time with
the 1 + 7 Pro has it pretty much on
there $750 variant but we'll see how
specs evolve and how that pro variant is
gonna differentiate and finally the
hottest news that I have to do with
Nintendo's announcement of the new
Nintendo switch light for those of you
that have been wanting to pay less for
the Nintendo switch experience it's here
but there's a catch see usually blight
versions of a product are just less
powerful devices that provide the same
experience or a slightly watered-down
one this one is not think of the switch
light is more of a DES or Gameboy that
can play Nintendo switch games this
means that this is a handheld only
device - it won't come
the hub in the box and you can't just
buy one and connect it to your TV that
won't work
technically you can play all existing
games but Nintendo made so much emphasis
on games having to mention that they
support handheld mode that it does make
us think that we might see games that
won't work in handheld mode in the
future the joy cons are also built-in so
don't break them I've already replaced
the pair on my switch still they do
bring improvements in better directional
controls as alternative to the joysticks
this also means that controls don't have
vibration or motion supports but you can
pair a standard set of joy' cons with it
obviously sold separately really the
only benefit over the standard switch is
improved battery life thanks to a better
chip placement color options will be
yellow gray and turquoise and expect the
launch at September for $1.99 definitely
the switch light is more of that switch
they want to buy for your kids but it
makes you wonder exactly how much is it
better over the standard switch for less
than $200 of a price difference it's not
really that significant if you think
about it let us know in the comments
down below what do you think I mean do
you like the switch light do you not
like it because in my case for me the
whole concept of being able to talk it
and undock it is really what makes the
switch special for me I honestly don't
but we will definitely review it and I
could probably be wrong leave us a
comment down below let us know what you
think friends again if you want to get
the news earlier follow us on packing
