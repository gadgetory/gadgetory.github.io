fingers before turning a page on his
iPad like seriously I'm as English is
more faster than Apple's 812 Bionic
whatever pixel 3 is more disappointing
than my life choices oh my god dude
really that bad that's right it's that
time of the week I'm hi Metta leave it
out this is PocketNow and this is the
bargain out daily recap your comments
for last week so on Monday the topic was
the 1 + 60 the company made their event
date official and up I asked you if you
were looking forward to it we have 300
comments 1 plus 60 will be my first one
plus smartphone and I'm extremely
excited for it let's hope it doesn't end
up being my last yeah definitely I
remember the time when I didn't try the
1 plus 1 or the 2 I didn't really care
about them and then the 3 came out and I
didn't care about that then the 3 T came
and I reviewed that and then that's been
all uphill from there they've done a
really good job if the 1 plus 60 is on
t-mobile like the rumors have stated I
will be getting one if not I'm going for
the note 9 wow dude that is an insane
price jumper yeah I mean you're entitled
to pick whatever works for you both
phones are definitely comparable oneplus
is my Apple no matter what they release
I'm buying I know a lot of people that
have that level of fandom and that's
good I mean there are certain brands
that deserve the support and then on
Tuesday the topic was Huawei and the
fact that it was being teased that made
twenty pros the fastest phone ever even
if then benchmarks it wasn't faster than
the iPhone 10s I asked you if you were
looking forward to this product we had
370 comments I just don't want to pay
1000 plus dollars for a phone yeah that
price tagging on the May 20 Pro was it
was tough
can't wait for the made 20 pro dude I
felt the same way when I was briefed and
now that I have one that I've been
playing with one oh my god what can I
say it's it really lives up to a ton of
things but it's not the perfect device
like every single one out there May 2000
is looking tasty with ud fingerprint
scanner three cameras I think it's going
to be my next phone not only that man
it's not just what it has but it what it
can do with all these things combined
I'll keep you posted on my review and
then on Wednesday the topic was
polarizing we talked about the Samsung
Galaxy Note 10.1
being the first device from Sammy that
would kill the headphone jack no no God
please no no no asked you how important
it is free the freedom how do you feel
about the company doing this we had 820
comments
Samson needs to put in a high-quality
deck very in tune by AKG in next year's
phones and leave the headphone jack
alone I believe that's already in surely
it doesn't have a bitrate of other decks
that we've seen from companies like LG
but it's a really good one I still don't
see the need for companies to kill the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack what did
it do to you have you forsaken our
headphone whatever brother any I don't
know man it's a lot of companies are
using it with the excuse that it's old
that it's analog that you know that you
need extra space and that they want to
fit it with battery to a certain degree
I'm like alright fine tell you what if
you tell me that USB C takes up less
space why don't you just give me two
ports and fine I'll make the move to a
USB see Jack I just don't want one port
on my phone that's my problem I've been
saying it for a while now if these
phones are gonna get rid of a headphone
jack make sure bluetooth headphones for
free yes I would definitely agree with
that and that's interesting because you
can find some really affordable options
online and I mean they could come up
with something yeah not so good but then
you have the option of buying something
more expensive if you do or I wish that
were optional when you buy the product
we include this but we'll give you a
discount with the bar buying this phone
for the headphones that would be great
then on Thursday the topic was the
iPhone 10 are there were speculations as
there's gonna be huge demand from China
I asked you if you're anticipating it we
had 172 comments iPhone 10 are at 720p
in 2018 nope definitely unknown
yeah I can't wait to pay 879 euros for a
64 gigabyte 10r and get less than a full
HD LCD display I have to dude I totally
agree I I don't know I don't I'm not
saying it's a bad phone I'm just saying
wow man really that much money for that
little waiting for the holidays then
making a choice for phones too much
variety right now definitely man TEKT
over phone Tober or whatever you want to
call it has been insane but really great
offerings it's great to have competition
but yeah it would rather wait you'll
probably get some good deals
then on Friday finally I asked you one
more time are you excited about the
oneplus 60 there were teasers of a UI
redesign and we had 360 comments what's
so kind of bummed that I won't have a
headphone jack I'm still excited for the
oneplus 60
I hope they add stereo speakers I
seriously hope so too they needed that
and I definitely don't like the death of
the headphone jack they've come with
some reasons for that but I just got why
I'm looking forward to the one plus six
I'll be in the New York launch
you mean the 60 and yes I will be at the
event as well so make sure you say hi 60
Plus t-mobile take my money oh my god so
I did some testing what the one plus six
on t-mobile and even with the phone that
wasn't really tuned for t-mobile it did
great so I can't imagine a phone that
now is we'll see that's it for the
parking out daily recap thank you very
