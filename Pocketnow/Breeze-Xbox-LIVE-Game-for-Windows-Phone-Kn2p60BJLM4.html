and we're going to do a quick preview of
a new xbox live game for this phone
let's check it out okay here we have
brees new xbox live game from windows
phone and this one is free in the
marketplace and we have ads at the
bottom but it's pretty fun tap here to
start begin the game you can hear some
relaxing music you can select the game
mode touch mode or tilt mode so with
touch will touch the screen to make the
wind blow and blow our little flower
around so I like that better than tilt
and we could choose normal or hard and
let's just play so this is my little
flower and I'm not supposed to let it
touch the walls here so if i press
really hard it's going to blow a very
strong wind and i have to blow the other
direction to make a turn and
so we got obstacles to go through
there's a spinning spike full I broke it
that time okay here we go and I'm
supposed to get those Sun shines all
right okay not do it very well get the
last one and now that's the end that's
the goal and we finished you have air
brakes you can use five of those per
round maybe you have five lives let's
just try one more and so I'm going to
get that sunshine and get that one
so you just touches a little breeze and
blows the flower around watch out for
that thing it's nice relaxing music and
there's my goal the stop button will do
your air brake to slow you down in case
you were you're going to hit something
bad so that's a free game lots of fun
your options can calibrate it there's
your instructions sounds usual stuff of
course you got leaderboards and
achievements and that's pretty much it
you got a bunch of different levels lots
of fun so I hope you enjoyed this video
give us a thumbs up if you did and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
