s5 split the mobile tech fanbase into
two bitterly opposed camps almost
overnight one group saw only a marginal
improvement over last year's already
vanilla Galaxy s4 while the other saw a
waterproof powerhouse packed with the
latest specs and wondered what the other
guys were complaining about which group
is right well we've spent a week
learning that the answer is neither and
both I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow
and this is our video review of the new
Galaxy s5
when we say powerhouse
we made it it should come as no surprise
that Samsung has packed our AT&amp;amp;T Galaxy
s5 with some of the most powerful
innards available the Snapdragon 801
beating at its heart is blazing fast
the optional storage expansion is
cavernous the big display is Super
AMOLED and pixel packed and the sensor
and connectivity package is extensive
only the 2 gigs of ram and paltry 16
gigs of on-board storage fail to impress
but a powerful spec sheet is nothing new
its par for the course with flagship
smartphones and it's something Samsung
is delivered before where the company is
often taken hits is an industrial design
and sadly the s5 does little to change
that it's by no means unattractive but
no matter what the ads say it's also not
the manifestation of modern glam
whatever that means it just kind of
exists but that's not all bad as we
touched on in our comparison with the s4
earlier this week the new phone is
larger and heavier than its predecessor
but that makes it substantial enough to
avoid feeling cheap and the new dimpled
back cover makes it comfortable to hold
ten minutes after you take it out of the
box it feels like you've carried it
forever
many will appreciate that comfortable
familiarity not to mention the s5s
durability that doesn't mean it's
milspec but the phone's casing will keep
out dust it will also survive immersion
in fresh water for up to 30 minutes at 1
meter depth and also if you just want to
have some fun with underwater photos or
video
you can do that too we'll say it again
Samsung really deserves praise for
bringing this ability to its halo
smartphone in our view it's absolutely
worth the slight inconvenience of the
repetitive software warnings and the
protective hatch on the USB port we
think the Fitness mavens Samsung is
trying to seduce with this phone will
agree those exercise aficionados will be
pleased to know that the s health suite
is still here in all its glory with the
coach by Sigma app letting you set
fitness goals and tell the phone just
how horrible your diet is and your
stress levels are in addition to the
existing pedometer speedometer and GPS
tracking the s5 also sports a heartrate
monitor overall we'd say it works fairly
well but it's tough to imagine all but
the most dedicated gym enthusiasts using
it and even they would probably opt for
a wearable solution anyway and while
we're talking about things you'll
probably only use once yes the Galaxy s5
has a fingerprint scanner it's cool in a
futuristic kind of way but it is hard to
swipe a button mounted at the very
bottom of a smartphone and the sensor
itself is quite finicky meaning you
almost always need to try more than once
to unlock the phone the PayPal
extensibility is clever but it's not
enough to get past the fundamental
unfriendliness of the execution and
after using it for a week we're happy to
turn it off forever fortunately things
are a bit brighter on the software side
overall the OS is now somewhat cleaner
in many corners with accents that make
the interface uniquely Samsung without
cluttering things up too much in a fun
twist on the ordinary circles have a
bigger presence in areas like the
notification shade and the settings menu
and the latter though still cluttered is
now searchable which is nice the
substitution of a multitasking key for a
menu button is also quite welcome
there's a new and refreshing emphasis on
the little things for instance the
process of making a folder on the
homescreen has been tweaked to make it
easier one-handed operation is just a
swipe away and when you call someone the
phone reminds you of the last time you
spoke with them
and of course old favorites like
multi-window are back probably samsung's
finest contribution to the world of
Android but for all its high points the
new TouchWiz also carries a pretty heavy
load of junk buried in its massive
system image or all the things we've
come to loathe about Samsung software
dialog boxes ranging from the repetitive
to the nonsensical ugly iOS like badges
and a sluggishness that isn't evident
out of the box but which creeps in over
time as the software bogs down and slow
animations lose their luster buried
among the new nice touches are vestigial
remnants of the old TouchWiz like those
dated icons in the app drawer or that
bloop tapping sound that hasn't made
sense since 2012 now we get the feeling
that Samsung is on the way to crafting
something pretty compelling here we just
wish they'd gotten all the way there
before releasing this build of touch
with the software driving the camera is
similarly soft in the middle
while we're excited to see the company
has consolidated many of its crazy
shooting modes into just a few hubs
along the bottom it's really just moved
the complexity and hidden it behind the
settings cog which stands sentry over a
grid containing 27 different buttons but
ok
suppose you're fine with a little
complexity as long as it also brings
added capability well you'll probably be
right at home here the galaxy s5 16
megapixel camera delivers very nice
results of course most cameras these
days can claim the same if the
Lighting's good enough but the s5 brings
a nice combination of high contrast
strong mid-tones and HDR mode and just a
touch of added saturation that may not
please the die-hard photographer but
which gives photos that added pop that
we liked a lot
sadly night shooting is not the s5
strong suit with lots of noise and very
dark results notwithstanding the
much-ballyhooed
ISO cell technology
a few features stand out the new
selective focus works fairly well when
it's stringent conditions are met
letting you decide your focal point
after your shot is taken and the virtual
tour allows you to make a kind of
walking map of a space much like Windows
Phones lenses you can download
additional plug-ins for the camera via
the Samsung App Store if moving pictures
are more your speed the s5 will stand
you in good stead so there's no optical
image stabilization software
stabilization is here and 1080p and 4k
shooting modes are supported as is high
speed video for slow motion playback
just as with stills colors are rich and
contrast is high even if audio is a
little on the muffled side muffled is
also the word callers used to describe
us when talking on the Galaxy s5 giving
the phone's voice quality a score of
between 6 &amp;amp; 7 well that's to be expected
when the speaker is soaking wet
that happened even when the phone was
bone-dry the loudspeaker is also nothing
to scream about fortunately other
fundamentals are more solid reception
and data speeds are excellent on att's
network in and around Greater Boston and
the phone's outstanding benchmark scores
are matched easily by its graphics
performance which really shines on this
gorgeous display whether you're cranking
it at maximum brightness or taking it
down to a measly two Nick's for
nighttime gaming the latter level will
be kinder to the battery of course and
while you don't need to walk on
eggshells around the 2600 milliamp hour
battery you'll still want to keep an eye
on things be a little more conservative
and you can probably squeeze out 4 to 5
hours of screen on time and many more if
you jump into ultra power saving mode
the Galaxy s5 was supposed to change
things it was supposed to be the dawn of
a new age for Samsung a product lighter
on gimmicks from a company newly focused
on listening to its customers this phone
is not that well not entirely anyway the
gimmicks have been reduced in number but
they're still here and once again their
execution doesn't always live up to
their mV
and hiccups in basic areas like software
and voice quality prevent the galaxy s5
from actually achieving the epic status
its advertising promotes the new Galaxy
s5 is a beautiful screen an excellent
daytime camera wrapped in a dust proof
water-resistant casing packed with the
best internals money can buy
while we're eager to see what Samsung
can do with a little more time the
galaxy s5 will serve most 2014 flagship
seekers just fine something we missed
wondering about the score see our longer

comparisons here on YouTube for more
