the user criticisms to heart and the
Galaxy s7 is designed to answer some of
those criticisms I'm Juan Carlos
paganella for PocketNow and here's a
brief look at the build quality and
water resistance returning to the galaxy
s7 brought to you by D brand Samsung
reps on hand were refreshingly candid
regarding previous Galaxy phones the s5
was a feature packed handset but was
kind of ugly Samsung was so focused on
improving the design and aesthetics for
the galaxy s6 that we lost some
lifestyle features like the removable
battery SD card slot and the
water-resistant build two out of three
of those emissions are returning to the
s7 users complained and Samsung improved
the manufacturing process enough to
bring back ip68 water resistance and the
microSD card expansion slot we've seen
terrific evolution from Samsung dating
back to the rugby which had covered
ports watching as Samsung opened up the
headset jack on the Galaxy s4 active all
the way to last year's Galaxy s6 active
where the microUSB port is exposed but
still water-resistant it's impressive
seeing this metal and glass build that
Samsung was able to properly seal up all
of the crevices the speaker grille the
SIM card or the home button fingerprint
scanner and the edges around the camera
module the s7 gains about a millimeter
of girth to house the larger battery
helped sync the camera module and that
might contribute to any internal sealing
samsung might have applied to deliver
the water resistance if you've been
paying attention the phrase water
resistance has been used throughout this
video instead of the phrase waterproof
the capability to survive 1.5 meters of
fresh water for up to 30 minutes this is
a lifestyle protection option for those
times you might get pushed into a pool
or for when your phone might take a
brief dip in a sink or other fixture in
your home a sealed backplate should
handle short drops better than the old
plastic tab Samsung used to use but
anything more severe which might crack
glass or dent the metal rim will likely
compromise the water resistance here
this is by no means a rugged phone but
it's always appreciated when companies
address situations which actually help
our phone survive daily life abuse it's
the grand experiment how our sales
affected by directly listening to
consumer requests for all the people
claiming they'd be fine adding some
extra thickness for a larger battery
there's a lot more to cover though once
we get the galaxy s7 into review have
that larger battery hole
to a more powerful processor in GPU so
stay tuned for more coverage once we
start reviewing the phone proper and
pocket now is MWC 2016 coverage is made
