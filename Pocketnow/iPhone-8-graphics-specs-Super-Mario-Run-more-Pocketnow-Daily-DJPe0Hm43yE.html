major boost in GPU performance
SuperMario run goes live for many of us
Generation Xers rejoicing and Fitbit
hopes to keep pebble customers happy at
least for a year
I'm hi Mary vana and actually one walk
with the bass in Hatton wasn't enough
I'll probably have to do that again
today but anyways this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
the greatest news of all actually we
have been waiting for Mario or any cool
Nintendo titles to reach iOS and Android
right now in iOS exclusive Super Mario
run goes live it's free if you can test
it for a couple of levels I believe it's
only three and then after that you'll
have to pay ten dollars for the rest of
the game but so far actually kind of
enjoyed it a little difficult to play
but anyways I am rejoicing I don't know
about you other official news have to do
with Apple and the company's warranty
policy for air pods
it's not going to be as bad if you lose
them but it's not gonna be great
either $69 if you lose either air pot or
if you lose the charging case but in the
case of wear and tear over time its $49
in the case the battery gives you
problems but obviously this is anything
that's over warranty everything is
covered within the warranty
except for you losing them which is most
probably what'll happen first that's
what the spotlight over to another
controversial topic we are worried about
the feature of pebble mainly for those
of us that have ordered pebble watches
and are either waiting or not getting in
or whatever but anyways if you were able
to secure a pebble watcher you're
currently using one Fitbit has committed
to a full year support so it's gonna
work for another year before you're
gonna have to resell your watch or
whatever this is just going to be
preliminary the company is not even
confirming a future after that but
anyways it's a start and since
controversy is part of the news today
believe it or not BlackBerry has
announced an extended partnership with
TCL for those of you that don't know TCL
is the company that's built the latest
BlackBerry's D Tech 50 VTech 60 yes they
look a lot like Alcatel phones because
TCL is the parent company of Alcatel so
now it's pretty much the parent company
of BlackBerry's hardware division
blackberry is committing to building
more software as the company is shifting
into a software and security
bini and TCL will be in charge of
selling manufacturing and everything
that has to do with blackberry
smartphones so I'm not really sure if
this is good news I'm hoping that we get
unique hardware from TCL but we do know
that the future of blackberry when it
comes to hardware might work might not
we'll see how it goes and finally some
of the interesting news that they have
to do with the iPhone 8 and its hardware
we've just discovered that the GPU on
the iPhone 7 wasn't really that great
apparently Apple use the same GPU that
it used with the Apple a9 on the iPhone
success and apparently mainly it had to
do with a power consumption and
overheating
apparently Apple is going to use the
latest generation power VR GPU for the
iPhone 8 and it's going to bring better
power consumption better power drive
whenever you're playing games etc but
you know I've always asked myself in the
question of today if you could narrow
down how many hours do you gain every
day how many would be beefed because
I'll give you my example I really don't
play more than 30 minutes a day if at
most every other day but I've known
people like one who could play for hours
what is your case leave us a comment

goes if you want to get the news earlier
