gonna show you a cool new application by
SPV and the program was called SPB TV so
one of that so the program is kind of
like an update to SPB online and it
actually gives you the online player
right here and it's lot smaller than SPP
online as well and it will give you the
channels lineup and if you go into here
to TV Guide you can also pick which day
you like the channels before you can
pick different channels some channels
are just generic they'll only give you
one specific thing to to read on there
but as you can see to the channel and
it'll flick scroll as well so go back
and we're just gonna play a channel here
there's many different channels all
around the world so let's see here let's
go to comedy time play that okay so as
you can see the channel play is very
clear and we'll just go turn this down
real fast I'll turn that down and we'll
go into settings so you can also pick
different channels while you're watching
this one in the background so if you
wanted to say you want to watch the news
or something so I don't go to Sky News
which is a UK broadcasting channel
and then it starts playing and it was
actually some channels like to show you
the connection speedier acquiring you
change the brightness so if you wanted a
brighter or darker you can do that you
can also change the volume so I wanted
to be a little bit louder but we'll make
it quiet right now you can also change
high and low media streams so go back
and there's many different channels a
lot of them are based outside the United
States which is kind of a downfall but
they do give you some pretty good
channels in the US so some of them are
mostly weather channels you can pick on
this I'll show you the current weather
which is pretty neat the program also
gives some options so we can change it
from left or right-handed side and you
can stretch the video to fit the full
screen and can select which channels you
want so these are all the channels so
you get the penny Pentagon channel Sky
News which is UK and I'll tell you which
which language they are in as well which
is pretty neat because a lot of these
programs some of them are actually in
different languages as you can see
French Spanish Italian and Russian so if
you don't like a specific channel you
can just delete that and save so hey
okay so another cool feature about this
program is that you can flick scroll and
pick different channels and to just
select you can either click on one of
these or click on the window here and it
will switch over
so that is SPB TV thanks for watching
I'll post a link on parking calm as to
how to get this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
