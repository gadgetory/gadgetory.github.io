going to show you a cool new application
by SPV and the program is called spb TV
so go to that so the program is kind of
like an update to SP be online and it
actually give you the online player
right here and it's a lot smaller than
spp online as well and it will give you
the channels lineup and if you go into
here to TV Guide you can also pick which
day you like the channel to be for you
can pick different channels some
channels are just generic they'll only
give you one specific thing to to read
on there but as you can see to the
channel and it'll flick scroll as well
so go back and we're just going to play
a channel here there's many different
channels all around the world so let's
see here let's go to comedy time play
that ok so as you can see the channel
plays very clear and we'll just go turn
this down real fast we'll turn that down
and we'll go into settings so you can
also pick different channels while
you're watching this one in the
background so if you wanted to say you
want to watch the news or something so
I'm going to Sky News which is a UK
broadcasting channel
and then it starts playing and it was
actually some channels like to show you
the connection speed they're acquiring
you change the brightness so if you
wanted a brighter or darker you can do
that you can also change the volume so I
wanted to be a little bit louder but
we'll make it quiet right now you can
also change high and low media stream so
go back and there's many different
channels a lot of them are based outside
the United States which is kind of a
downfall but they do give you some
pretty good channels in the US so some
of them are mostly weather channels can
pick on this i will show you the current
weather which is pretty neat the program
also gives some options so we can change
it from left or right-handed side and
stretch the video to fit the full screen
and can select which channels you want
so these are all the channels so we have
got the penny pentagon channel Sky News
which is UK and I'll tell you which
which language they are in as well which
is pretty neat because a lot of these
programs some of them are actually in
different languages as you can see
French Spanish Italian and Russian so if
you don't like a specific channel you
can just delete that and save so hey
okay so another cool feature about this
program is that you can flick scroll and
pick different channels and to just
select you can either click on one of
these or click on the window here and it
will switch over so that is spb TV
thanks for watching i'll post a link on
pacquiao calm as to how to get this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
