the Home Shopping Network there's only
ninety-nine dollars so what can go wrong
now this is going to be the Nokia Lumia
521 and it's actually a very popular
device we didn't really expect it to be
so popular and we're going to unbox it
this is adam link from pocket now let's
check it out all right let's get to it
got our nice pocket knife here I've ever
see and here we are there's the box
let's put that over here and now there's
other stuff that came with this ninety
nine dollar deal let's see a little case
I want to look at it right away and you
can actually choose which color kate's
you want from the this Home Shopping
Network deal and i got a blue one it's a
kind of glossy just rubbery there you go
and we also have headphones I have to
look at these right away blue and white
you got a clip you gotta mark phone you
got an answer button feels a little
cheap but what do you expect there you
go your butt's pretty good actually
here's our welcome guide know your facts
with the package includes activate your
device prepaid
Oh 3 bonus gigs there we go and what
else we have a car charger I don't think
I need to open this just a seerat
lighter adapter marker your speed on the
other end all right now let's look at
the real thing this is a our retail
packaging oh hey there's a nice big
window with the phone and it looking
good that's okay we have some
information on some plans you can get
for this that's pretty cool and on the
back just a little bit of getting
started information there you go this is
quite different from some of the other
packaging for tmobile phones now let's
see how do we get into here oh yeah
that's pretty
very unusual for folks we package this
this nice old plaster here's phone and
we have our sticker that tells you where
the volume is power camera quick search
on back charging port headset port all
right let's just put it right here see
if there's anything else in here
cardboard sim card a all right okay
here's a charger now what's funny here
is this is not a USB port it's just
essentially a plug hardwired to a micro
USB port on the other end this is kind
of a flat wire looks like it's for non
tangle so that's that's pretty
interesting and you also have a USB
cable to plug it into your computer
let's open this the look how look at
this oh no look how short that is that's
kind of cute okay so but advantage one
for charging one for plugging into your
computer pretty nice and here's a
battery we're going to need that and
here is where we have looks like just
more documentation i guess i can leave
that in the package all right that over
there and you want to hear the peeling
off don't you I know you do all right
here we go
Wow I'll get a little piece of dust I
already so there's the device let's take
a look around very flat top screen there
there's your speaker buttons on the side
they feel pretty stiff camera bun half
press full press you can actually feel
it pretty nicely there's the power
button it's pretty thick but what do you
expect oh here's something else we can
pull off actually this is instructions
on how to open the battery so we kind of
need that there we go and here's your
micro SD card slot so you can add more
storage memory for this this Windows
Phone 8 so you can only use the micro SD
card for videos music and photos but
that's pretty good to have there since
it only has eight gigs internally and
there's your micro sim port so I'll have
to get one of those and the battery goes
like so there's your 5 megapixel camera
let's see put it back on and now we
don't need this anymore I can get it all
right ready there you go that over there
so white plastic I got the USB port on
the bottom nothing over here on the left
headphone jack up here 5 megapixel
camera there no flash nokia logo speaker
and no camera on the front but you know
who cares about that if you're gonna do
skype you're going to have to point it
any bathroom mirror let's see if you'll
turn on
and there you go this feels really no
key quality that's the entire ago that's
pretty solid okay so it's going to have
to do a little setup but in the meantime
let's look at how it compares to the
other windows phone available on
t-mobile this is the Lumia 925 and the
weight is actually pretty similar but
you can tell this 925 is much more
premium and ought to be 4i me how about
for four hundred dollars more and you
can see the thickness difference there's
the back alright so after the stuff
finishes setting up we will take it for
a more in-depth spin and maybe give you
a little quick review that's it for now
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
and we'll see you next time I'm talking
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
