the Home Shopping Network
there's only $99 so uh what can go wrong
now this is gonna be the Nokia Lumia 521
and it's actually a very popular device
we didn't really expect it to be so
popular and we're gonna unbox it this is
Adam Lang from pocket now let's check it
out all right let's get to it got our
nice pocket knife here I've ever see and
here we are there's the box let's put
that over here and now there's other
stuff that came with this $99 deal let's
see a little case I want to look at it
right away and you can actually choose
which color gates you want from the this
Home Shopping Network deal and I got a
blue one it's a glossy just a rubbery
there you go and we also have headphones
I have a look at these right away
blue and white you got a clip you got a
microphone you got an answer button just
a little cheap but what do you expect
there you go your butt's pretty good
actually here's our welcome guide know
your facts with the package includes
activate your device prepaid
oh three bonus gigs there we go
and what else we have a car charger I
don't think I need to open this just a
turret lighter adapter micro-usb on the
other end
alright now let's look at the real thing
this is a our retail packaging oh hey
there's a nice big window with the phone
in it looking good that's okay we have
some information on some plans you can
get for this that's pretty cool and on
the back just a little bit of getting
started information there yeah this is
quite different from some of the other
packaging for t mobile phones now let's
see how do we get into here oh yeah
that's pretty
very unusual for phones to be packaged
this this nice little faster here's the
phone and we have our sticker that tells
you where the volume is power camera
quick search home back charging port
headset port alright let's just put it
right here see if there's anything else
in here cardboard SIM card a alright ok
here's a charger now what's funny here
is this is not a USB port it's just
essentially a plug hardwired to a micro
USB port on the other end this is kind
of a flat wire it looks like it's for a
non tangle so that's that's pretty
interesting and you also have a USB
cable to plug it into your computer
let's open this but look how look at
this Oh No look how short that is that's
kind of cute okay so but advantage one
for charging one for plugging into your
computer pretty nice and here's the
battery we're gonna need that and here
is where we have looks like just some
more documentation I guess I can leave
that in the package alright look that
over there and you want to hear the
peeling off don't you I know you do
alright here we go
Wow I'll get a little piece of dust IRD
so there's the device let's take a look
around very flat top screen there
there's your speaker buttons on the side
they feel pretty stiff camera button
half press full press you can actually
feel it pretty nicely
there's the power button that's pretty
thick but what do you expect oh here's
something else we can pull off
actually this is instructions on how to
open the battery so we kind of need that
there we go
and here's your micro SD card slot so
you can add more storage memory for this
this Windows Phone 8 so you can only use
the micro SD card for videos music and
photos but that's pretty good to have
there since it only has eight gigs
internally and there's your micro SIM
port so I'll have to get one of those
and the battery goes like so there's
your five megapixel camera let's see put
it back on and now we don't need this
anymore I can get it alright ready here
you go
that over there so white plastic I got
the USB port on the bottom nothing over
here on the Left headphone jack up here
5 megapixel camera there no flash nokia
logo speaker and no camera on the front
but you know who cares about that if
you're gonna do skype you're gonna have
to point it any bathroom mirror and
let's see if you'll turn on
and there you go
this feels really new key quality that's
good there we go that's pretty solid
okay so it's gonna have to do a little
setup but in the meantime let's look at
how it compares to the other Windows
Phone available on t-mobile this is the
Lumia 925 and the weight is actually
pretty similar but you can tell this 925
is much more premium and oughta be for
you know about for $400 more and you can
see the thickness difference there's the
back alright so after the stuff finishes
setting up we will take it for a more
in-depth spin and maybe give you a
little quick review that's it for now be
sure to give this video a thumbs up and
we'll see you next time
I'm talking about
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
