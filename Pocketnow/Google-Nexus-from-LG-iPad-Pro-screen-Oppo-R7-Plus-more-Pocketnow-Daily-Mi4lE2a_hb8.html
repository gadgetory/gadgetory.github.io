option to launch along with the phablet
LG confirms that there is qualcomm fast
charging on the LG g4 sort of and the
ipad pro won't just be larger but more
advanced in a couple of ways i'm high
meadow iveta and if you could change
anything from the parking out daily what
would it be leave us a comment down
below yes this is parking out daily the
official lucid I have to do with Oppo as
the company has unveiled the phone that
it's been teasing for the last couple of
weeks or should I say phones the company
has just published its Oppo r7 and are
seven plus two devices one larger than
the other and yet they both share the
same 2.5 D glass that makes them seem
like if they don't have bezels but the
larger Oppo r7 plus does it have
capacitive buttons and there are some
changes when it comes to its in design
even though they both look almost
identical we should learn more from
these products on May twentieth and it
seems that LG has been getting such bad
publicity for the g4 when it comes to
the Qualcomm quick charging option or
the lack thereof on the g4 that the
company has just confirmed that there is
the technology built in the Snapdragon
808 does support it the problem is that
the charger that's bundled in the box is
not quick charge 2.0 you will need one
to get this feature so if you do have a
galaxy s6 charger they're handy which we
did test it on our g4 review units it
does work we just wonder why the charger
wasn't bundled and we've been following
a ton of rumors of the future Moto X and
probably one of the biggest points where
we want the phone to improve is on its
camera quality and today we get some
rumors pointing to optical image
stabilization making the cut in addition
to some clear pixel technology that
didn't really work on the original moto
x we still don't know exactly what other
implementations Motorola wants to bring
to this phone given the amazing camera
quality that we already get with the LG
g4 and galaxy s6 there's a lot of
competition that the company needs to
live up to and i doubt that consumers
will just let the next moto x get off
with a lesser quality camera
I've got some trusted sources talking
about the ipad pro again and this time
we're talking about a new type of
display technology that should come to
the tablet first of all it seems that
it'll be a GM w technology and not a
typical LCD tech that we see today as it
seems that the components needed for LCD
technology have 12 years to live meaning
that yeah Apple wants to move away from
this technology the newer one will
apparently give Apple options for better
types of displays in addition to the
support for flexible displays and more
efficient production costs because we
know Apple does that we even hear that
apple will consider sapphire for this
tablet the only problem is that
apparently it'll launch in 2016 yeah
that's the problem and finally for the
very hot news of the day we've been
covering the news of a probable Nexus
phablet coming soon from Huawei this
time as the OEM but we've also covered
separate rumors of the smaller Nexus in
the works and those died away quickly we
now hear some trusted sources claiming
that this product will happen it's a 5.2
inch display Nexus built by LG and these
are really great news because if it's
going to be based on the g4 and the
GeForce camera this is going to be
probably the best Nexus ever the one
we've been waiting for for the longest
time but it leads me to the question of
the day we had to choose between a nexus
based on the LG g4 or a nexus based on
any huawei phone being a phablet which
one would you pick because I wouldn't
even think about it I would go for the
LG option hands down immediately even if
it wasn't solely based on the g4 but
leave us a comment down below what's
your comment friends you know the drill
