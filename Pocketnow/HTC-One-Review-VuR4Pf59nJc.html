random intamin from pocket now and this
is our full review of the HTC One let's
get to it
HTC really needs the one to be a success
the last two years have been tough for
the company because of lackluster sales
of devices especially of last year's
flagship the One X which we found to
have problems with camera performance
and lag enos in the operating system
fortunately the HTC One is truly
different not only from anything HTC has
done in the past but from other devices
from other manufacturers such as Samsung
and LG the phone itself made from glass
plastic and a lot of aluminum is
striking the 4.7 inch 1080p display is
flanked by two amplified speakers that
together produce the loudest sound we've
ever heard from a smartphone the sound
is not only loud but clear we weren't
able to get the speakers to distort
whether on a call with speakerphone or
listening to heavy metal at loud volumes
the one also has Beats Audio which in
this case provides an equaliser for boom
sound boosting treble and mid-range it
just sounds great turning the phone to
the sides we see the HTC - the same
trick with the one that it did with the
DNA and even the One X the edges are
extremely thin and then the phone tapers
to a larger thickness in the case of the
one at nine millimeters around the back
while nine millimeters might seem high
for depth the phone feels very thin in
the hand it's also relatively light at
143 grams which is 10 grams heavier than
the Galaxy s3 this extra weight
translates to a high-quality feel
reinforced by the cool aluminum backing
that looks as nice as it feels the one
is available in black and silver and we
heavily recommend the silver because it
does a fantastic job at deterring
fingerprints and dirt because of this
the HTC One and silver always looks like
it just came out of the box in an
obvious reflection of the iPhone 5s
design the HTC One has chamfered edges
which gives the otherwise brawny looking
phone a more elegant balance we haven't
been using the HTC One long enough to
comment on the durability of the
chamfered edges and the phone in general
but we have reason to believe that it's
much less fragile than the iPhone 5
the phone is well waited in the hand the
rounded back allows the phone to settle
nicely in your hand our only complaint
about ergonomics is that the phone is
tall so one-handed usability is tough
unless you have huge hands let's talk
about specs the HTC One is powered by
qualcomm snapdragon 600 quad-core cpu
running at 1.7 gigahertz the one has 2
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage
with around 26 gigabytes accessible by
the user and all the usual ratos you'd
expect not present in the one is a
thermometer and hygrometer has found on
the galaxy s4 but we're not sure if
getting temperature and humidity
readings from your phone is something
that is actually useful let's talk about
the display it's a 4.7 inch 1920 by 1080
Super LCD 3 panel which gives the one an
insane PPI of 468 you can't see pixels
so don't even try the screen has
fantastic characteristics like excellent
viewing angles above-average contrast
and color reproduction that rivals that
of the iPhone 5 overall the screen is a
stunner running on Android 4.1.2 the HTC
One comes with the Sense 5.0 skin
we don't usually like sense because it's
been too heavy and intrusive in the past
sense 5 is the first version of sense in
a while that enhances Android rather
than 2 tracks from it it was built for
1080p screens
unlike previous generations which means
that you get a ton of beautiful detail
whether in the calendar app and settings
in the notification shade or just
looking at the battery indicator at the
top Sense 5 is delightful saved for a
few annoyances the first annoyance is
blinkfeed it's essentially a news
aggregator for your home screen while it
is indeed nice looking it might be
useful for those that don't feel like
going into multiple places for their
news and updates it's customized ability
is limited you can only add sources that
are pre-configured there's no way to
change how the tiles appear and it just
doesn't work the way you want it to
for example we'd love to be able to give
more weight to certain sources like by
having Twitter and Facebook updates show
up first and then news flowing after
that but for what it is blink feed is a
neat feature if you don't like it you
can turn off all of the sources and use
another home screen
as your main home screen or just use a
third-party launcher this is Android
afterall
beyond the blinkfeed the typical Android
home screen experience is there with the
addition of HTC's beautiful widgets we
just wish we could change the grid size
beyond the tiny 4x4 because with so much
screen space on the one it would be nice
to be able to use the home screens
better the same story holds true in the
app tray which doesn't use space well
and there's a huge weather widget at the
top of the app tray
no one asked for a weather widget within
the app tray it's just not a good use of
space customizing your home screens is a
bit awkward in sense 5 for example you
have to drag icons to the top of the app
tray before you can add them to your
home screens not only that but it's
impossible to add a folder with quick
dials or quick settings into the dock
HTC says they're working on a fix for
this as you would expect sense touches
every stock application the multitask UI
accessible with a DoubleTap of the home
button present you with a grid of 9 app
previews which is really nice
this is infinitely better than the
Annoying 3d interface present in the
last version of sense for the multitask
UI in terms of performance the HTC One
is consistently fast everything you do
whether launching an app going back to
the home screen opening a folder taking
a photo replying to an email or
downloading an app seems to happen on
the same beat the performance of the one
is reliably and predictably good no
matter what and we love that we almost
never experience lag it's just fast even
asphalt 7 which seems to have shoddy
performance on every Android we've ever
tested was pretty darn smooth on the HTC
one as good as we've ever seen now let's
talk about the camera HTC is once again
claiming the third camera takes amazing
shots they broke that promise with the
HTC One X and with the one we're left
disappointed once again unfortunately
while the one does indeed have amazing
low life performance in fact it's able
to see more light than our own eyes in
some situations the resulting photos
often lack adequate color saturation and
come out soft with a lot of noise
sometimes not only that but at 4
megapixels you can't zoom in very much
megapixels do matter and we wish that
HTC would get the camera
in one of their phones Samsung can do it
Apple can do it Sony can do it why can't
HTC make an amazing camera video
recorded in 1080p also came out pretty
lackluster in terms of color saturation
and they also had a lot of noise but
then there are some neat camera features
like zoiy zoiy essentially takes a mini
video when you take a photo it seems
strange but it's actually quite cool and
this does a few things first it allows
you to choose the best shot from about
20 resulting photos and the phone tries
to do that for you also it brings your
gallery to life as these little animated
Clips give you a new way to look at
photos you've taken now let's talk about
some test notes battery life is no
better or no worse than most phones out
there like the galaxy s3 iPhone 5 or
Lumia 920 this means with moderate to
heavy use you'll get through a day if
you're going to have a long night out
you're going to want to top off the
phone by charging it charging the HTC
One takes a typical 2 hours to go from 0
to 100% but the latest Snapdragon chips
have quick charge 2.0 which is supposed
to cut charging times hugely we just
didn't see that in HTC One perhaps it's
not enabled yet or at all our review
unit was the international version which
does not have LTE support we tested the
one over 80 over HSPA+ and generally got
good results with only occasional loss
of signal we attribute this to the fact
that the HTC One is not intended for the
US yet but it will be soon it's going to
be available on all four carriers in the
spring and we're very excited for that
overall the HTC One is one of the best
if not the best phone we've ever
reviewed if you can get past the
mediocre camera the combination a
fantastic Hardware loud sound excellent
performance and a gorgeous screen makes
a strongly recommend of the HTC One we
give it a 9 out of 10
and of course the Galaxy s4 is on its
way out and when it comes out we're
going to be doing extensive comparisons
between that and the HTC one but for now
the HTC One just cannot be beat if you
