a video review of maca Yama's touch
this is a new web browser that was
announced a couple of weeks ago and is
available for use on Windows Mobile 2003
five and six touchscreen devices
unfortunately it's not available for non
touch screen devices so windows mobile
five smartphone and windows mobile 6
standard edition devices are excluded
from this application today I'm going to
give you an overview of how this
application works and I have it
installed currently on my 18th detailed
and I'm running on AT&amp;amp;T 3g network so
let's get started let's start the
application here and it starts up and
right now it's going to bring this I
believe to MSN's website which it has
and you'll notice it brings you to this
full screen view first thing I noticed
was kind of annoying it on this full
screen view is there's no indication of
how to get to the icons and as you
notice the other thing i don't like was
on the right or in the bottom there's no
scroll bars so i have no idea how far
down i am on the web page now all i have
to do is no I could just flick and
scroll on this but I have no idea where
the bottom of the page is and I have no
idea where I was at any point in time on
the web page so that's so my first major
inconvenience I found on this
application after going to makayla's
website to figure out how to use this I
clicked on the d-pad key brings us to
these six icons the first icon is the
back key the second icon is a question
mark which you would think would be the
help manual but it's not it actually
brings you to google to do any searches
on the internet so i think that's
another second major inconvenience there
you would think that it's a manual but
it's not it's actually a search engine
the third icon is the URL URL or the
address bar where you can just type in
web web pages you want to visit the
fourth icon is a close button but in
order to close application you have to
double tap on it as opposed to the
single tap that you used to I assume
this is set up this way just to avoid
any accident
closure of the application the fifth
icon there is just the user settings and
the six icon is a toggle to switch
between desktop version and mobile
version of any web pages so if a web
page that you're visiting has a mobile
version you just click on that and it
will make it easier for you to navigate
so let's go through these icons first
we'll go through the search engine here
brings up this half hazard Lee arranged
soft keyboard here at the top you'll
notice that it's got the vowels aeiou
and then just below the next four rows
are the consonants but in you know again
no real arrangement that I'm aware of
and then the last two rows are the
numbers zero through nine across the
side we have the the Delete key a period
the slash I'm assuming that's a space
key the dot-com for a quick typing and
an enter button so if we use this unless
search of pocketnow.com again I'm kind
of struggling to find where each of the
letters are we click and enter it's
going to bring us to google and it did
it did find thousands of of matches on
pocket now and if we click on the
hyperlink there will bring us two pocket
knives website and again you know here
we are in pocket now and you'll notice
again there's just no scroll bar so I
have no idea where I am on the web page
real inconvenient if i click on back for
a second you can actually use your d-pad
the left keener on your device it'll
bring you back let's see here if I click
on the search search box here I don't
get my soft input panel then I would
normally get on my my touch on my at&amp;amp;t
tilt you know i have i'm using bouticks
touchpal and i would usually use that to
type things in
and it's not showing up so the only way
I can actually type on this is looks
like if I just take it off his cradle
here I have to use my hardware keyboard
to type so users of devices that don't
have these hardware keyboards would find
it really inconvenient to use the only
way they could get back to searching is
clicking on the question mark here and
looks like I've discovered out a bug
here doesn't want to get out of this is
there we go it didn't reset thee the
soft keyboard back to this original
original view so I'm just click enter
oops the next is just the URL key again
it just brings you back to this so if i
type pocket now again we have a dot-com
button here it brings back to pocket
that website again just really slow to
use i find we're going to go the next
icon we can go through is the settings
here so here you can just adjust the
settings on the device the first is what
home page you want to go to by default
it's set for mike uyama but as you saw
it went to msn so not understanding why
that happened the next thing you can
change is just how long you want the
controls to show up on the screen
between 1 and 10 seconds you can also
change the keyboard layout from vowels
on top which we saw before to alphabetic
and then at the bottom we just have
access to hear the help manual which
again you would think would be on the
question of art but it's actually in
these settings and it brings you to
mocking Yama's website and shows you how
to use the the application going back
here's an about button it just shows you
that it's touch browser doesn't really
show you the version numbers and then
we just have the cancel on the Save
button so we'll just save that and use
the alphabetic keyboard and then the
last thing you'll see is the toggle
button so if we toggle back and forth
there really wasn't any change here on
this on this web page let's see if we
try another web page let's try let's try
Yahoo's website
it goes navigating as you notice every
screen tap creates that loud annoying
beeping noise and unfortunately in the
settings I didn't see any way to turn it
off so when you're using this if if
you're using this browser just make sure
you turn the volume down on your device
otherwise you're just going to hear a
beep every time you use it which is
after a while can get pretty annoying so
here we are in yahoo and it just brings
us to the mobile version so it doesn't
look like it really navigates to a full
version of the website so that's really
again just another major inconvenience
if I click on this actually I was on
mobile view I apologize i switch to the
desktop view let's see that does
anything and it really didn't so yeah it
doesn't matter it just recognizes that
you're on a mobile device and so it's
just going to default to the to the
mobile view of it so you know at first
class this browser looked like he was
promising it it it promised full screen
iphone type views like sephora i have
the iphone safari but after going
through it there's just a lot of just
major nuisances again the lack of the
scrollbars the inability to use your
soft input panel when you're using these
search fields here and that annoying
beep and the keyboard itself now i find
it just hard to recommend using this
application you can if you want to try
it you can't get it I'm akiyama's
website which is WWE can accom and if
you decide to purchase it it's available
for sale for 1495 so this has been rated
one with pocketnow.com and a video
review of Makkah Yama's touch browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
