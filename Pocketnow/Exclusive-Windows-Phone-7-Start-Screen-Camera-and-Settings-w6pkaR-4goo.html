pocket now calm and this is another
exclusive look at Windows Phone 7 in
this video we're going to talk about the
Start screen the settings and the camera
application so let's get to it you are
now again we just want to emphasize that
what you're about to see is not final
hardware or software it's not a
representation of what you're going to
be able to get when Windows Phone 7
devices start shipping we're doing this
for fun just to give you a sense of what
Windows Phone 7 is all about so let's
get started with that the notification
screen actually gives you a lot of
useful information so on the bottom you
get notifications of missed calls miss
SMS and if you had any missed email and
it also kind of bounces on the bottom
which is pretty cool because it shows
you what's behind just a really cool
effect I think above that is a
notification for your next appointment
followed by the date and the time and
along the top you just get your system
notification Wi-Fi status and battery
status so let's slide to a mock and we
reveal the start screen now the premise
behind the start screen is to give you
ease of access of information and
actions which is a great idea it's a
vertically scrolling list that you can
add endlessly to you can have a variety
of different tiles as they call here so
you can have tile notifications for
phone and for mms and SMS and for email
or you could have live tiles so for
example the people tie on the upper
right corner is a live tile you can
actually see information be updated
within the tile in real time so I can
just glance up there and see who is
updating their status on facebook
windows phone 7 does not integrate with
Twitter right now but again this is not
final release maybe it will when it
comes out that would be a nice addition
and there are also other things that you
can link to your Start screen you can
link a website shortcut so here I've got
a link to mobile twitter com and you can
also link your favorite people which is
something that for example the iphone
can't do you can't put a link to your
favorite people on your main screen so
that within one tap you can dial them
out very nice feature okay so let me
tell you how I have set up my Start
screen here
of course I have no third party live
tiles to work with but presumably when
windows phone 7 comes out there will be
a wide variety of live tiles tiles to
show sports scores to show twitter
status stock status whether status all
sorts of things so really within one
glance you could just look down your
Start screen and know what is going on
without having to dive into applications
pretty cool concept if it comes to
fruition okay so here we've got the
phone app the phone tile showing me that
I've one missed call here's the People
Hub and you've seen that a lot and from
the People Hub I can pin people to my
start page and it jumps back and now I
have a new person down here so I'm going
to take that off okay jumping up to the
top we have an indicator for SMS we also
have a indicator for email I'm not going
to talk about those two things in this
video down here with an indicator
calendar which obviously jumps you into
calendar now what is a little bit
annoying about how Windows Phone 7 X
right now and again this may change it
may not change is that if you are on the
bottom of the list of your Start screen
and you go into an application when you
go back to the start screen with the
start button you are taken to the top of
the list always to the top not to where
you left off kind of an annoyance but
not not too big of a deal here on the
Isle link to Internet Explorer so I can
quickly get to the web browser I've got
a link to the zune application and it'll
show you a little this is another
example of the live tile function it
will show you a little example of the
music that you are listening to
previously so if i tap into here you can
see kind of the music that i was
listening to i don't know exactly what
it was but a nice little feature they're
down here i've got a link to
mobile.twitter.com because there are no
third party apps for Windows Phone 7
available right now I'm having to use
the mobile site for Twitter which is not
too big of a deal it's very easy to pin
websites to your start page you just
expand this upward you hit pin to start
and bada-bing it is there take that off
to keep it clean now I've got a link to
the marketplace which again isn't really
in use right now because windows phone 7
isn't out below that I have a link to
the pictures hub and this actually shows
you your latest picture
that you took with the camera so I took
a picture of some crackers in a bowl and
it just shows you a little preview of
that down there then we have the camera
application well I like to take pictures
and here's the settings and here are two
people that I call on a regular basis
kind of bouncing around and moving
around kind of as if they were alive so
that is how i have my Start screen set
up there's a lot of promise to how you
can have your Start screen arranged once
you start integrating third-party tiles
and especially the live tiles that
update information in real time so let's
bounce it to the camera application just
talk about that there's a really cool
feature of the camera application now
when you go and take a picture and let's
say we're taking a picture of the nexus
one here and by the way all windows
phone 7 devices will have the very nice
to have camera manual camera button when
you take a picture this is not going to
be the best picture watch what happens
it slides over to the left now this
isn't a new thing where a smartphone
operating system will give you a quick
way to get back to your picture but I
think this is the easiest way of any
smartphone operating system you simply
swipe to the left or swipe to the right
and you are taken to the picture you
just took if you want to go back in time
you keep going and if you go all the way
to the right you're taken back to the
live camera view which is just a really
cool way how they integrated the the
camera application with the photos
application actually recorded some video
over here this device is capable of
recording in 720p but again this is
prototype hardware so you shouldn't
really judge it on that so that was a
little look at the camera application
and I think it's here we go let me just
jump into the settings real quick and
again this most likely isn't final in
fact this is LG branded so it's very
possible that this isn't a windows phone
seven specific feature so we can change
the photo resolution hit back button
white balance color effect photo quality
I'm sure that some OEMs will be able to
customize the photo application based on
the hardware that's actually taking the
pictures so let's jump back to the start
screen now let's talk a little bit about
notifications because notifications are
very very important I want to call your
attention to the top of the screen here
very interestingly these the network
status and Wi-Fi status is not showing
up unless you tap and then it pops up
very interesting and you have to wonder
do you care about seeing your your
signal strength all the time or would
you rather have a cleaner look and have
that information be hidden away as is
the case in this particular build of
windows phone 7 just something to think
about so what I'm going to do is send
this phone a text message so you can see
what it's like when you're working let's
say you're on the web and suddenly a
text message comes through so so I'm
going to take this other phone here and
send a text message watch what happens
okay there we go text message and you
get a little preview which is really
awesome and what you can do is you can
ignore it and it will go away or you can
tap and it will bring up the text
message and this is the really cool
simple interface for the text messaging
program so simple so you can use the
on-screen keyboard of course say hello
how are you a really really sweet
keyboard by the way except from this
angle it's difficult to you to use and
so that's how notifications occur they
occur on the top and again this may not
be final but this is just the way that
it is now so what I'm going to do now is
call the phone and you're going to see
what it's like to receive a call on a
windows phone 7 device so I'm gonna so
I'm going to turn it off
okay and here we're getting a call and
if there is a caller ID associated with
this you'll actually get a big bright
background here and what you can do is
slide up to action on it but that's not
enough you have to determine if you an
answer or ignore it I'm going to ignore
it and then you're going to see now I
have two missed calls here in the
notification area and if I slide up now
the counter has gone up to two another
thing that's kind of cool another cool
effect is that the counters actually
change after you unlock the screen not
before so for example if you haven't
turn on your phone for a while and you
unlock the screen and slide the the
unlock screen up and you have 10 emails
this will go from 3 to 10 before your
eyes it's just a cool little effect that
makes your phone feel kind of alive I
think that's a good a good metaphor to
use ok so finally let's bounce into
settings take a look at what you can
change in Windows Phone 7 right now
again I'm sure the settings will change
but just want to give you an idea of
what it's like right now so we can do
some application specific changes to the
settings or anything just go into system
and from system we can go into ringtone
and sounds the Metro interface continues
and we can change the ringtone so we can
tap on a particular area you get the
point it's never fun to change her to
change your ringtone nothing special
about that we can change the theme so we
can have a dark background theme which
is perfect for a mo LED displays or we
can do light which is good for you know
standard LCD displays and then you can
change the color accent to a variety of
different things let's say blue with a
white background and now if we go back
we have blue with a white background and
notice what I just did I went back to
the start screen and then I hit the back
button down here and it took me to the
to the previous screen kind of stepping
me through time just quite nice the
windows phone 7 platform may not have a
multitasking interface but you can very
easily jump back to applications that
you are working in previously so the
back button gets a ton of use in
windows phone 7 so now that we have a
different brighter theme we can turn on
airplane mode again just a simple toggle
switch here we can turn Wi-Fi on or off
bluetooth on or off very simple stuff
email and accounts you can add a variety
of different email protocols although
i'm sure the list will get bigger when
you can buy windows phone 7 device but
you can add exchange of course gmail
yahoo a hotmail you know the usual
suspects we can change the lock screen
and wallpaper and the behavior so the
screen timeout until tells you tells the
device how long until it shuts off can
change the wallpaper of the lock screen
and it comes with some pretty fancy
wallpaper to start so let's say we want
to have this interesting one set as the
wallpaper we hit the check mark and it's
done let's go back location turned on so
that will work with Bing Maps cellular
i'm using this over AT&amp;amp;T right now can
change the date and the time we also
have brightness right now it's set to
automatic some people were asking about
the brightness during the previous video
or we talked about the browser and I
mean the screen gets pretty bright not
that it matters this is the maximum
brightness it's very bright not that it
matters because this is reference
hardware and it's not intended to be
final release so let's scroll down a
little bit more we have keyboard you can
change the keyboard to another language
region and language ease of access
speech auto confirmations is turned on
find my phone is presumably a feature
that they will have enabled so that you
can use a web interface to locate your
phone which is always a nice little
feature there now let's swipe to the
right real quick and see if there's
anything interesting here so let's see
if there are any game settings Xbox Live
is turned on although the service is an
active yet Internet Explorer this will
take you to the same settings that you
get if you were to access them from
Internet Explorer Maps marketplace it's
not much you can do right now with with
the with the settings here for the
applications so we're not going to go
too far in search will let your delete
history and use your location so overall
I've been able to cut
demise the Start screen on windows phone
7 so that it works for me i can quickly
dial the people that I care about I can
see certain updates and I can jump in
and out of applications that i use on a
regular basis again the promise of
Windows Phone 7 is that you will be able
to have a lot of third-party live tiles
here that really bring information to
your fingertips and I think that if that
promise comes to fruition it'll be a
fantastic paradigm a new paradigm on how
we should interact with our devices so
that was another quick look at windows
phone 7 please thumbs up this video if
you liked it and be sure to subscribe to
our channel also if you didn't see the
previous video where we compared the
browser of Windows Phone 7 to iPhone and
Android you got to check that out i'll
put a link up on the video to get that
and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
