keep take care of you do you like
hamburgers and high I mean all the above
so we we add nuts it not to interrupt
we've 85 viewers I just saw a counter at
the top of the screen and that's pretty
cool and now it's 87 can't believe
people are still watching yeah we can
probably reiterated this is like it is
only the second time we've done at
official pocket that sanctioned hangout
and also this is absolutely my first
time doing a hangout of any sort so I
can't figure out a lot of the stuff but
I did just figure out the group chat so
that's fun so if you're not actually
talking right now and you want to talk
in the group chat
I'm like there and if anyone has any
pointers for how to figure this out
Benjamin are you a a veteran of hangouts
or are you also a novice like us oh I've
been trying to make hangouts more of a
regular thing because we're doing it for
my work too we use Google on or trying
to use it further you know work work
type and also using it for personal
thing that's so nice so seamless and so
easy you could just upload things yeah I
was gonna say well because we don't know
what we're doing we've got some
malfunctions going on here why not what
kind of phone yet veteran um why got a
nexus 4 nice nice don't they got there
are some bars there's my nexus 4 right
there the nexus 7 to go along with it ah
and then you gotta have the nexus 10
going with it right oh hey here and then
I'm talking to you on a Chromebook whoa
you you see cotton and looking at the
google shirt too you found your match
Joe I've got a similar arrangement going
on here except I've got the the HP
TouchPad in addition to the to the to
the pre three and and an HP beer as well
so I feel you I have the family together
as well you just keep those in your
pockets at all times or did you bring
them into the chamber just for the sake
of it I have I had pouches uh built into
my thigh just Michael's like here's
every product that has ever on webos oh
it's such a mess in here um so how are
you do you like the Nexus 10 or the
nexus 7 better um you know it's that's
really hard the resolution on the 10 is
just you can't beat it's amazing crazy
high it's so good that is beautiful and
it's light it's really nice to hold the
thing about the Nexus 7 is just being a
little bit smaller it seems to be a
little bit faster because I am getting a
little bit of the the lag and reboots on
the Nexus 10 that some people are
getting too so hopefully this new update
of four point two point two when
never comes out I'll hopefully fix some
of that at lag eNOS and reboots with the
nexus 10 so there are hoping for I
didn't I didn't know about those did I
Joe are you having the same issues I've
been running cyanogenmod 10.1 on both
the seven and and the 10 I don't have
any reboot problems but I have heard of
that problems that people are having
with the stock roms and I feel for you
that's that's not cool yeah that is a
bummer I don't know if it did that yeah
I I normally have run room and you've
got money rooted stuff that I used to
run like in her neck internet there we
go yeah oh you know we're back awesome
okay I was just mentioning that I have
run rooted since I ran a evo 4g back in
the day so I always used to run custom
roms and all that stuff but a lot of
this I've gradually gone towards a a
stock experience because it seems like
Android and Google have moved towards
including some of those features in the
stock like like notification bars like
lock screen features like so a lot of
that stuff I've really I used to run
crazy crazy roms with inserts and all
the theming and all that stuff but it
seems like it's made a point to where I
don't even run anything but stock now
except stock rooted just to deal with
like setcpu and use defender you know
things like that there are so many
things that that started off in like
cyanogenmod community like lock screen
widgets or even just third party you
know which with widget locker and quick
toggles in the notification shade and I
wonder if if Google looks at this stuff
from the third party community and does
it or if they were going to do it anyway
right my screenshots just being able to
take a screenshot by power down or I'm
down in power I know that's longer to
say that yeah before I mean you had to
have root you had to have special
side-loaded apks you had to have all
these crazy crap going on to just you
know make it work so
it's pretty nice ever I really like the
direction they're going and obviously
you can see I'm a fan and sure are um
well let's uh let's talk to some other
people to get other people chances good
talk I don't like to kindly as guys I've
i'm not sure i'm a noob at this but i've
read that there's a maximum number of 10
people who can be parked at the same
time so I'd like those who talk to us to
exit this chat so other people can join
and we can talk to more you'll see
ourselves in the recording and thank you
very much for joining so far Ahmed and
Benjamin well thank you guys I
appreciate all your your work and keep
up the good work and I enjoy watching
all your videos and updates thanks a lot
for hanging with us better hopefully
we'll see you later oh yeah hopefully
we'll see you next week yeah and we
still continue from left to right I have
next up Henry lavender that's a great
name well hi I let mr. lavender hello Oh
minimum do you um I'm sure you've gotten
this before but do you like the scent of
lavender it is it is a nice yes we've
got a I'm detecting a an accent on your
dialect there were you calling us from
today I'm calling you from South Wales
uh-oh hope so his British which means
he's from Europe and maybe I could talk
to him with that fake British accent
you're making your American accent tony
is probably the best way how can I say
Jennifer you gotta bust out your text
with accent at some point you're a
little Texas very pressed you think
nothing but the best thing that can
happen to you honey honey makes
Americans not dumb real Oh what some
barbecue what's uh mr. anything either
one thing is always sweet back to my
Russian English if you wait good keep
that layer going so I want to ask you
this time as Brandon I like your
question but i want i want to ask it
once this this episode what uh what
device are you carrying there Henry i'm
at the moment i'm using a what x-class
nice
very nice did you have the 1x ya know if
I'd thought I've always liked HTC I'm
probably one of the few who like sense I
love sense that's nice yeah what do you
think about the sense five weeks um I
don't like them hmm i don't know if it's
a jealousy thing or just now I think
next month would be like em7 is gonna
come out I'm like I should wait it or
whatever though is that way isn't it
though yeah I also on the on the desk
I've i found a Galaxy Note guys the
original cool dwelling running some sort
of rom I'm not sure which one oh that's
fun are you um as far as the One X goes
like I mean are you uh fairly satisfied
with the experience overall I mean how
does it how is it as far as
responsiveness goes and all that kind of
stuff free as responsiveness goes I was
a bit worried because the whole Tegra 3
thing but this this is beating perfect
this hasn't slowed down or crashed what
once the xbox is the way the X should
have been yes definitely yeah I think
well I've only gotten hands-on time with
him once Brent it was the same time he
was you and I in New York City right was
it the AT&amp;amp;T thing yeah and I was like
you got so you guys aren't doing this in
the white polycarbonate they're like no
this is just black and like awesome oh I
don't want it everything wasn't the guts
you know I loved the 1x that I wanted it
in white and it was out my god wanted it
cyan hmm I never got that wish why won't
you ever learn to what's inside that
counts it's I refuse topic color
allowing from that that New Age thinking
know what are you equipped with the
tablet besides the note here I do have a
nexus 7 let's not with me at the moment
it's on charge I i rooted it I'm and a
flashed a new rom on it today I know
just one second the other side up or
tayyab katakana please mute your
microphone because the always
looking to you and when we talk to you
you can unmute it okay uh okay thank you
very much and back to you Henry I
flashed a new rom on the nexus 7 but two
days ago I was fed up with the stock
failed it was unusable totally i would
say i was that's why i brought it up
because i am not a guy who flashed his
roms and very often i tend to run stock
but damn it this update on the Nexus 7
has just made it it just lags like it's
a bit that's unusable ah yes it's very
close down using yes so I've managed to
find some room and I flash one with the
old tablet UI thing so with the
notification and the three buttons on
the bus every time yeah better anyway
because you want to be reaching all the
way up to the top of the screen for
notifications anyway yeah I don't want
to be using a phone UI I want to ask you
something else you're a nexus 7 user
what do you think of the leaks for the
samsung galaxy note 8.0 um i like it
because i had the original note before
and i like the whole a spin thing it
does add a lot of value to divisive no
it's just a stylist basically and what
about the outer aspect um from what I've
seen of it I don't like the physical
button on it I mean that's you're not
alone in that totally Whitman that's how
a tablet should have especially if it's
going to be one of that size just on
screen I think I why does it have a any
ear piece you supposed to use that as a
phone oh my my prayers have been
answered I hope you can use it but I
promised on the podcast I'll make a
demonstration this is the ipad mini and
this is how it looks in my hands see I
mean I can stretch my hand this far now
the the galaxy note 5 10 is actually 11
millimeters even wider than the ipad
mini so that means that it will be
probably another another finger wide and
and you cannot hold the Galaxy Note 8.1
hand even if you have huge hands then
how will you hold it to your ear like
this with you then I do something for me
pretend like you're not on a call
and and set the tablet is somewhere in
your room and pretend you pick it up to
use it as a phone and pretend like
you're not even on it just outta see
what it would look like yes hold that to
your head can we can we do that ya later
you're just just the switch domain
camera to me oh look on me I'll click on
you okay it should be frozen on you yeah
somebody's going oh I mean yeah it's
brandon hello on the handout right now
i'm on my love the big ones the ipad
mini you don't want me to switch i can
switch hold on me switch to my mat hello
oh my god oh this is this is too big so
probably probably seven incher would be
good for me as a daily driver which
would support calls but eight inches no
and yeah you guys laugh but I gladly
talk on this one you know the way that
looks I feel like a nexus 7 would almost
look right like yeah this is that seven
and hmm yeah maybe that if the nexus 7
hat no bezel then maybe mmm-hmm I mean
it's probably the the notes eight-point
always probably this much even wider so
this is the nexus 7 this is the ipad
mini and imagine the note 8.0 even wider
and that's too much for me so uh I while
we're talking about big devices I just I
got something in the mail today from
from one brand and minimum uh lucky it's
right lucky that's right here and um I
have a feeling I'm gonna be just just so
so blown away by the quality and an
awesomeness of this device is anybody
recognize that oh my gosh what's a beer
monstrosity oh my god EOG intuition if
you're on verizon wireless the only one
who liked that phone what that was I the
only one who liked that phone you
actually you did like this you've never
said that publicly before really no take
it back yeah hey my god I included the
stylus I thought I lost it but like the
stylist is a joke
the worst stylists in the world did in
the box it's a box abuzz oh my god yeah
it's what they expect you to carry that
thing around with you it doesn't go into
the phone you gotta put it in your
little shirt with a pocket protector if
you you know well i was gonna say
there's no like there's no silo I mean
you just got to carry this around like
this pen from Samsung that brilliant
product guys I'm gonna shamelessly step
in and I'm gonna ask Henry if there's
anything he wants to tell us if not then
we had lots of other people and we are
expecting you next week no I can't think
of anything awesome thank you very much
for jalandhar yeah you thank you well
yeah I'm the bastard i'm kicking people
out i'm just trying to keep this in
motion no it's a good flow i think it's
good we've got 120 viewers which is
awesome we should probably tell even
more people let's i utilize our social
networks you do that and next on my oh
here's an here's a guy i know is much
yes I know him from the comments from
twitter i know from youtube so welcome
who but yes but make sure to unmute your
microphone because i cannot hear
anything you're saying it should be
about a nun on the button button on the
top right that's it hey hey now I'm show
everyone how is angry goo goo goo it's
only a hobby here where are you from the
I am mean 10 fighters in some of 34

hoping that it gets up to 34 Fahrenheit
here in Utah today and we have freezing
rain I may not be able to make it back
to work because the garage maybe frozen
shut so welcome nah dude right there I
shot a a sample video outside with the
TV Odyssey before
Boston here and I think we're at about
somewhere like negative negative 10
below Celsius or something like that
it's just it's absurd here today live
weather report from pocketnow.com the
live weather there you go so much is
what device do you use and I am
currently on a Lumia 900 ooh windows

in a patina can you guys hear me no no I
just saw yesterday on way we don't want
to interrupt that AT&amp;amp;T is big but I can
get it yet okay I think we have several
audio so I'd like you guys to mute your
microphones if you are not talking to us
until we talk with you so that there's
no more audio mess and white noise and
stuff like that thank you we're gonna
call Tony the stuff the mute master
someone's got to do it I I think it
wasn't Matthias pointed out that we can
we can mute anybody we want by hovering
over their their image down below thank
you to everybody right now that's a bi
idea ok Joey why are you muted I'm not
muted come i muted you just can't hear
me ok here we go oh there's a if you go
to the Hangout toolbox you can control
everyone's audio we're learning oh I see
what you're you know if we cut out like
all the all the google hangout learning
curve from this broadcast it would be
like eighty percent shorter yeah but we
can also publish this as a walkthrough
or tutorial how to you go not to google
earned with us the team at pocket now
captured the whole hanging out is out
takes awesome pretty much hang god bless
bloopers all in one absolutely summit is
how long have you been following
now almost a year now
it's actually a I cannot funny because I
saw the video from YouTube but I never
dented in the club until a year assured
I'm given a program in your world that's
an interesting i think a lot of people
you know see us on youtube and they're
like you got a site yeah i mean that's
so that's where we uh sorry call home
it's got some cool stuff there it's
something like I do every day I come to
work and I just take your block hey
great very cool thank you yeah we are
like there are commenters who uh who

your coin and I'm from Pakistan hey
you're welcome hey thank you hey ya lost
last time I saw your show kind of go
envy is like oh I should have been there
like it was a really cool show we will
die you liked our first hangout that was
a disaster it was like this is a
disaster to know like a captain I kept
laughing tore the whole thing like when
that would what was the guy's name Marco
he could like keep putting those light
him in his camera it looked like a funny
I enjoyed it yeah that's the idea that
shouldn't be comedy
I think what do you mean it I think what
he means to say is that we have funny
faces that you know especially no no I'm
not I did I don't mean that I'm just
saying was like a entertaining let's not
call it funny hats call it entertaining
no I I also was watching it because I
couldn't join in i guess i didn't know
it was happening until it was happening
and so i was watching it and I was like
alternately cursing because I couldn't
participate and then cracking up because
it was something it was great yeah it
was quite entertaining and quite good
topics also like because i like it
because it mentioned hd2 and 82 is my
like the gateway to all know effective
in I didn't know what homes or anything
was until I what random elements video
how are you pretty android on hd2 that's
how I like started like suddenly like
phones and everything I would continue
my HT to videos except my hd2 has long
been stuck in a reboot cycle it just
doesn't can i send it to you unser nova
yeah we could he can use it as a
paperweight or what just kind of sit you
know what am I gonna play babe no the
hd2 I had it had like the sunscreen
issue I had stopped like touch just
stopped so I had to replace it i don't
even have it right now so i feel like
you know I've never had one but I feel
like you like like losing an hd2 is like
one of those events in a phone owners
life that you remember right whether it
dies or whether you lose it or what I
would like no it's like the most awesome
phone and we're like you can do anything
with it I nothing will have to do it why
can't we make more phones like that I
mean that was the perfect tone well what
woody nothing that is so amazing I don't
know it's made so easy to do everything
right I mean I just so one video that
like Brad minimus to video and I was
able to put like all the radio I could
you change the radio and everything and
I could put the next reform on it and
that was like no even the ted i am a
lawyer so i have no background have
nothing I mean I'm
lawyer I could do it you got every care
what would you say if your lawyer your
mouth shut well yeah but I'm saying back
there I was like in the law school so I
had no idea of how r anyways and what I
just feel what anything is I could do it
that alone is an amazing track for
meeting I was about to ask you something
can you tell us a little bit about the
mobile landscape in your country do you
have the latest bones what the prices
are how how is the market looking yeah
or we have the latest phones from
Samsung Samsung religious hair like
everything was a little even there too
yeah and we have nokia but nokia is
kinda like the low-end nokia is very
popular like the people use it for every
day but not Lumias no one likes Lumias
here symbian phones Asha phones down
thumbs no no don't know even the DeMars
like the feature phones don't like
they're gonna fight for 1,100 sir okay
like you can we have like we know
prepaid packages so people carry on like
two sims or 3 sims and they use like
those mini fellows for and they have
like battery for three days so that's
what but how do you run applications on
those phones hey they don't need
application they just call it text and
fix is just a phone he know a pier view
yeah yeah so and only used to put phones
here but now sony has stopped sending
phone so that's like a bummer but we
still get phones from like people who
get import those phones from Dubai and
put it we have companies who put their
own warranty and this Alec here so you
haven't FLT no LTE we have 3g but that's
only limited to certain areas but we
have a very big broadband network stay
along like the most time on edge or 3g
that is good well thank you very much
for joining us hope to talk to you again
next week we'll be here hope you'll be
here definitely definitely out here and
I'm not sure who's next in line but I've
seen this face for quite some time so
Mike Letterman hi yes I've seen this
face in quotes because I see some
glasses some diving classes where are
you from Michael little Letterman do you
hear me I think it's microphones
manatees talking I see if you're talking
Michael maybe you might check your
microphone for for a mute settings in
the upper right corner
no one is talking yeah no one it's just
okay until until Michael gets back let's
talk to I see somebody here Michael
Thompson oh yeah every night and we can
hear you hi welcome half like some icon
hello Brandon pleasing take it away Oh
where you from Michael I'm from Denmark
nice nice what kind of phone do you use
uh actually my normal phone is the
galaxy s2 that is an old one one of the
best friends I did you get the end jelly
bean update no I'm not yet um I don't
know when it's going it's in Spain now
yeah it is so your honor yeah yeah I'm
still wrongs targa actually haven't
rooted it the thing about it but I don't
know the whole thing would void
guarantee a warranty and ensure that i
don't i started with the optimus 2x from
LG and that was the biggest mistake of
problem ate my whole what the world's
first dual core smartphone yeah the
Tegra 3 disappointed you I noticed a
check for 20 yeah was it yeah I did
hecka to the Terra too yeah the whole
Caroline's yeah yeah but the but at the
moment actually i'm using this phone the
padfone 2 oh nice job DUS celestone to
us i just woke up um I got this from
Mesa so it it's not actually mine i'm
testing at foreign fall so you're in the
business too um not really it's a it's a
come aboard it was a thing that they're
doing in the Nordic countries where they
give up a couple of them to test it next
time when when you hear something like
that I'm real close and I can move to
the north
countries so yeah I'd see some let's see
some padfone 2 it shows they had chosed
everything well yeah I'd love to see how
the the dock connector on the on the
phone there how it plugs into the back
Brandon your cameraman switch is
switched to Michael please you Michael
Thompson um yeah I don't know what how
well you can see this um it has it has
this 13f can connect the dock connector
here and two holes uh-huh besides is and
these well slice down to it right here
way to have be exactly the same on the
sides they have these rubber there's
nothing so it doesn't scratch up the
handset but they have some Robinson uh
not so it doesn't scratch it they do
that by having an elevated a bit decided
I guess but the amount of things holds
it in place Wow Michael from from the
Nordic countries I have a question this
does the fat phone to also come with
that crazy stylus and the headset
included just like the batphone London
no so how do you talk on phone if it
rings when it's inside your tablet um
they have some different they have this
oh this is quite hot um they made a
widget that has different settings hold
on your camera was falling apart for a
second ya gonna do this oh they're a
good idea yeah and it has the cha-ching
settings where you can it can do some
intelligence we're kind of equals them
off so they both have battery or you can
do so just charges the phone yeah I got
that but my question maybe maybe let me
rephrase entering it's down here you
have some incoming calls also but you
would have to have a
other bluetooth headset or you can do it
with the speakers then there was my
question because with the batphone one
you had a stylus which was like a pen
and that had a big it up and yeah and he
were basically talking at that diabeetus
doesn't really hit while you were doing
a pig I'm picturing who are from Star
Trek yes hello hello one of those as
well I'm separated anything as a phone
Michael Thompson do you have also
another dedicated tablet or is this kind
of your your thing for now this is my
thing for now my I gave my girl from the
Nexus 7 that's very nice against it yeah
um so we have that the house it's also
we debate all the time on the podcast
whether the PadFone concept makes sense
and I always think that it wouldn't work
for me because I want to have two
separate devices so that if I like the
phones in one room and then the tablet
dumb terminal is in another room it's
like you know kind of misses the point
what are your thoughts on that do you
like having the singular device or would
you rather too um well I've been
pondering about that too and it is a
hard question but I actually like to
have it like this as I like the PadFone
idea just because you also have the what
kept data on it so if you're playing a
game which end you have the lives clear
that's again not not all apps can sink
sink that so so that's I don't have to
play the same levels in angry birds over
and over that's interesting because a
lot of things sink gmail contacts and
calendar and even web favorites and
everything but something's don't game
states and home-screen placement like
how you have your widget set up yeah so
I I'm just another voice little lending
some credence to that because I play
rise of glory on every Windows Phone
device that I have
every Windows Phone device that I review
but I always have to start from level
one whenever I get a new review unit so
I've never gotten a something like the
sixth level he drives me nuts so that
must be nice Michael Thompson is there
anything else you want to tell us um no
I don't think so Betty don't Tony I I
want to say can we uh get wheat Michael
please can we come can you come back on
the air again at one point cuz we were
not done looking at that padfone 2 yet
and you're fun yeah sure I just wait a
minute thank you very much for joining
and hoped you see you again next time
with the bad phone yeah sure you're
right and you guys want to pick somebody
oh no Michael Letterman do you have your
audio this time and we still cannot hear
you well let's get goodness i miss huh
she's working it out did you mute him or
on youtube i unmuted him there's a
button in the upper right corner it
controls your mute button you probably
have something to tell us but you can
write in the chat if you have any oh
you're my go-to Michael Thompson is uh
is very helpfully showing us what we're
that mute but thank you yeah yeah wow
what magic okay Michael Letterman until
you figured it out let's talk to Pedro
Costa and you need to UM you too right
there in here me know yes we can okay
hey I know a manger hey Petra that's
that's kind of a goal like a garment rig
you got going there can you hear through
here okay through the hood uh yeah
Michael you want to do some singing
together
is actually my first time in the podcast
know the potty I diposkan a podcast or
what no it is not we're not sure what it
is yeah yeah it's not thought it is what
it is need to hang out we're just
hanging out good chillin we're just
chillin I just choose where you coming
from bedroom uh Portugal cool ice not so
nice why not why not so nice because of
the Akuma economical crisis and all that
you know that's affecting the entire EU
region so you're no we're not we're
above the level of Greece but not so bad
I believe me I'm in Romania and i'm at
the same level so i feel you okay and in
the u.s. we have a fiscal cliff awesome
that's awesome I want to sell some
bungee cords to two people so as we
approach that fiscal cliff I can
capitalize on it why are you working
with their paper hey drew it's actually
a pretty bad cell phone but it has
custom roms so it's kind of a little bit
how bad how about me talking what are
you working with arm v6 it's not bad
it's a smartphone but you know what's
the mount of like it what's the model
number name it's a GTA blade ZTE yeah
did we see that at CES time no we saw is
actually the first flight so it's like a
model from 2009 it's really old oh sweet
i remember rock´n´roll style I think
there's a desire HD competitor right I'm
just making that up no I guess I think
it was re i guess it's a desire s desire
s competitor sire is a custom rom on
like a like a four or five year old
phone at this point I how's that working
out for him curious like I think you're
this is a first for the for the Hangout
certainly
oh it's running pretty good running on
jellybean 4.1 uh custom roms for the win
I was gonna say Joe you got a reason to
say about this that absolutely woman
that that's the whole reason why custom
roms and unlocking your boot loaders is
so much it makes so much sense you've
got an older phone which the carrier
doesn't want to support the the
manufacturer doesn't want to support and
now all of a sudden look at the open
source community comes in says this
phone still works it's still a nice
phone let's just update it yeah and we
can it's the way it should be so I don't
know what I was going to say so just
keep on the show thank you very much and
I have an announcement everybody who
managed to talk to us please I'm not
kicking you out but please be so kind
and leave so others can join the hangout
until we figure it out or Google figures
it out how we can talk more people at
the same time and yeah and 40s by
everybody for the bucket now guys we're
getting close to one hour are we
extending going above one hour uh we got
about 12 minutes left yeah I was gonna
say I'm here for about another 15
minutes and then if you guys want to
keep going I can join back in the chat
but no no voice and video let's make the
best of it mr. mr. Poole snorky
Armstrong that sounds like a u.s. name
oh yeah we have another instance of
mutant microphone Oh welcome i'm gonna
start australia yeah good eye why why do
they say Down Under I mean I know but
what what say what what sign that's a
good question so you don't know either
not how this droid how we st. weather
reports from all around the world how's
the weather like in Australia ah crazy a
climate um miss baby boys there's been
rained is all sort of things going on at
the moment good that's good it's good
that it's not snowing tell us what
devices do you have
I had a nexus s in the Nexus 7 good good
combination I was just thinking about
the nexus s because I've got this the
samsung at Eve Odyssey which is like a
samsung focus and a nexus s had a baby
but I i missed the curve you know I like
the Nexus S is big antenna bulge on the
bottom and the curved designed you still
do you find that it still works well for
you yay it makes really good actually
good yeah that was it that was such a
good still is a good phone with the
curve i think the Galaxy Nexus on occur
it curves good i mean your face is cut
my face is curved it looks like your
face no no i don't think they should
keep me I mean I've got this often as G
here which is like um it just you know
it's like it doesn't it doesn't uh
someone take it take it away your happen
it's already tired of the optimus G yes
guy season about the optimus G real
quick please I I lied to myself about
the optimus G yeah you know you know I
said you know how they said the nexus 4
has touch screen issues and the nexus
tree is better but it's not fixed it's
this in a Cell touch it's that same
slight mountainous lag that you get on
the ipad mini on the iphone 5 on the
nexus 4 and the LG optimus treat they
need to do the technologies it's it's
odd it that i will never get a phone or
device again with in-cell touch that's
probably not true but i'm gonna say no
okay so here's what thought here's
here's the fix for that we got to get
phones that start recognizing when your
finger is closed and then we won't
notice the lag as much we'll have more
proximity-based stuff that would be an
improvement which sony phone did that
where you could bet they basically
interact with the phone and you
shouldn't touch you weren't supposed to
touch the screen there was a sony phone
which did that i can't remember now yeah
it was one of those mid-range ones but
i'll be like you know the note 2 and the
note do it with the S Pen like you've
got hover ability there and then you
got the Lumia 920 if you get close to
that screen you can manipulate it
because the sensitivity is so crank up
so their phones that do it hey Tony my
wife says um that we should put the
video on that on the on the pocket now
Paige at the top because it's confusing
because she's definitely right and I
will make sure for next week to do that
okay hi wife hey Brandon's wife anyway
um so who is up next let us see if
anybody wants to pick let's talk to
Daniel yeah hey Daniel make sure you
knew it's Daniel right yeah yeah how are
you and where are you from um I'm from
Malaysia we have such an international
audience we are well that is fun so how
how is it in Malaysia summer days took
painting occasionally yeah you think in
note to note too very nice your home
screen let's try to get it closer look
at that read all your data this case oh
yeah you're holding up click on your oh
yeah there we go chunky it's hard to are
you running a custom theme or like a
third body launcher know is the default
one oh it's TouchWiz yep you know the
funny thing is i bought the phone they
come with this cover casing yeah the
flood cover yeah well now that that's
not the fifth gotta flip cover something
way different is that like a seidio case
or something something like that we
didn't did it come in the box no it's
not in a box it's like ah from the
seller kind of thing oh yeah yeah it's a
gift yeah you know the funny thing is
like it's like Deanna approve cover so
when I just one day I was trying to use
the S Pen so the S Pen kind of effect
I'd a magnet so when I draw it's kind of
like uh huh so that thing is magnetic
yeah oh it snaps into place and
interferes with the S Pen that is
annoying I've never heard about that
that's uh somebody somebody didn't think
that through my tires after some time oh
man and I just updated the 4.1 point2
and I I think it's quite good do you use
the a multi window feature yeah but
that's the one thing you know this um
the back space where you can have you on
this one right the back button mm-hmm I
can't edit this oh wait there's not
there's an edit button down below there
yeah but you know you you can't bring
your own apps yeah there's only certain
apps that are supported for from all T
screen yeah it's a pain at least there's
more than there were on the on the
kyocera echo de do we have a special set
of okay I'm gonna make it hmm all the
echo he's found these YouTube sounds are
great but inevitably you click them like
five seconds too late and you know me
making it pretty funny is all about
timing and it's like oh sorry I was
coming thank you invent that was funny
five seconds ago precisely uh okay
Daniel is there anything else you want
to tell us um nothing much but just want
to say that Brendan actually helped me
helped me a lot in my first phone
actually bought the HTC incredible s
true your review and like you know
that's awesome man that's why that's why
we do it so I to hear that we help you
out but I get rid of that light not too
long ago and then I got this phone it's
quite a good who
slow they have the Ice Cream Sandwich
install it was right over laggy Daniel
thank you very much for joining us come
back next week and I think we'll get
back to Europe this time with the with
Reese luck would please unmute your
microphone welcome good evening to you
thank you you have an awesome name if
that it makes me it makes me want to
have a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
although it spelled differently yeah but
but they are great now amazing let me
ask you something when you eat a Reese's
do you start with the outside and then
eat the inside or you just buy track I
just full-on Tran you're gonna want to
do what you guys are talking about you
you just go right for you don't don't
mess around yeah don't beat around the
bush straighten this hang out have a
clean tag Tony or what i'm not sure but
if it's added we just lost it Reese what
kind of device you're working with their
i am using a open for AA an iOS user
joins the joins the fray this is cool I
got nothing nothing wrong with that no
not love love oh I don't come I love my
iphone this just funny gets gets me
through the day um it's a great advice I
was about to say when i was in london
for the samsung galaxy s free event that
i was commuting like three hours from
the hotel to the convention center
everybody in the tube had iphones so I
phone is huge in the UK yeah yeah i
agree i noticed that there seems to be a
lot more iOS users here than there's an
android however since the release of
android 4.0 specially the pickup is
becoming more and more especially with
the Samsung galaxies there is tickling
the one to break which are very popular
devices here as well and also windows
film gains a lot of Mark market share in
UK yeah yeah I'm actually thinking of
upgrading to Windows Phone in three
months probably at nine twenty so here's
a good tough question for you were
you're switching from iOS to Windows
Phone why not to Android i actually used
android and before now i'm not a huge
fan of it not not say there's anything
wrong with android it's just not my
thing not sure why maybe the interface i
mean i know a lot changed especially
with the release of ice cream sandwich
and sleeting revamped it and it is a lot
nice advice but I'm certainly just not
interested in androids especially with
the with Windows Phone 8 it just looks
fluid it's nice to use its attractive
and just great pieces really you're
describing it's it's funny you say that
I think of the upgrade tendencies people
are used use iPhone go to Windows Phone
because it's like this sort of this this
smooth you know controlled always fast
always fluid always beautiful experience
whereas Android it's there but it's got
this the stigma where where you know
people try to Android a year to a poor
jelly bean and they they found it to be
slow but yeah I think windows I think
you're going to accept you probably have
purchased a handful of apps and you're
kind of in the apple ecosystem so you'll
have to I guess is that a consideration
or you really just stick to free apps um
mainly free apps do have a paid app
particularly angry birds so the lavanya
votes and I do have my am my iPad Mini
which I do intend on carry on using my
main tasks on my web browsing documents
on the go and things so it could be
interesting managing between a Windows
Phone device and then I've had you know
with the totally different interfaces
because they're not even alike in any
way yeah totally different did they're
both locked ecosystems yes yeah that is
one thing i do like with android how
open is you've got the ability to do
noon of anything you want with our
android which is quite
tip which I can see why a lot of people
are going over that especially coming
from the iPhone because you know the
iphone is got your background and that's
really all you can customize on their
own frustrating isn't it it's just so I
want to change you did work for me but
why can't you yes it's funny it like
Android is the modern-day windows mobile
it really is because and windows mobile
you could change anything back in what
2006 and before yeah yeah although what
means I've actually held up for grading
to win this phone is 53 10 I'm quite
interested with the look of blackberry
10 I didn't tell me I have an old
blackberry bold here that I used before
I got my iphone and then I grew angry
it's a bold the bull yeah the prettiest
back there ever was if you asked me
because of his banner yeah um it's a
light blackberry bit there's nothing
much you can do with it it's email text
and it's awful for web browsing
particular these black r is for the
keyboard and the non-touch screen so you
got the touch pad you can move that aro
around it's great time yeah I love it
nice need whatever yeah sometimes those
I miss him I I'd like to have like a
roller ball or a touchpad where I could
just precision point that pointer sad
when that went away from the the nexus
one and the HTC g2 yeah yeah quite like
the newer flat freeze weather is the
touch pad rather than the ball because
the problem I had with this was a little
piece of dust would get into the ball
and that yet you did need to find new
ball it would just ruin it in seconds
you gotta get in there like you pop the
ball out like that and that those
outfits in the mall and stuff they'd
have like blackberry repair stands where
they could pop off the faceplate and get
in there with a q-tip or something and I
clean the rollers on the ball and it's
like what is this 1994 what's going on
and I charge you ridiculously
for that yeah they were special q-tips
though you know they're not just regular
q-tips I am premium price per q-tip
Reese thing yeah go on go on I was just
gonna say i actually have a samsung
galaxy i'm not sure the model here i did
use for a few months that has android on
i believe it was 3.2 i believe the first
that they updated it to I mean it was
good it was a good little interim phone
before I got my iphone but it was laggy
poor poor fact I mean I couldn't even
run angry birds on it I think if there's
if there's one truth to the world that's
if you can't run Angry Birds what's the
point right yeah reason i was about to
thank you very much for joining us and
hope to see you next week and I was
about to ask the guys do we have time
for one more color or should we wrap it
up I can stick around for one more I can
do one more yup let's do one more ok
this time Brandon you pick one thank you
very much Reese and please mute your
microphone thank you Casper is that your
name oh this is a Michaels best
Michael's friend from the podcast yeah
hey Casper I like the eye like the eye
are you in front of a fireplace you have
a nice orangey maybe a really good tan a
well-lit Casper yeah good good to see
you on a hangout I didn't it took me a
second to find you nice to nice to see
your face well nice to see you too thank
you guys where were you from I'm from
Poland wait wait a pole and then then
it's Casper void in yak yeah really
close now screaming now it's got better
bleeping up so no it was close yeah
buddy close actually the closest anyone
has said I get most people's i would say
gospel any good night I've been
traveling a lot to Poland and Bolin is
one of many countries in Europe yeah
with my job before pocket now and I want
to ask you something about mobile
landscape I know that
era was a huge I mean when I was in
Poland through 2005 and nine between
these years era was the greatest largest
carrier in Poland what's the situation
well now it's uh kind of difficult to
say now there's a new player mix play
and it's and it's gaining a lot of
market is the message gone domestic
courier or some joint venture some other
companies getting in the Polish market I
think it's uh it came abroad but I'm not
really sure what it is a tie is gone so
it's similar now and the situation is
changing i would say oranges is the
largest one marriage yeah right in the
and + now might get some attention it's
the first carrier that's the offers LTE
so oh you got a nice nice yeah yes so
Casper what's your what's your next
phone gonna be um I thought it would be
nexus 4 but it's difficult to get one
yeah yeah it's still there still at
they're still backordered right yeah and
it's not available here in Poland so
yeah it sorry look you're either and you
need to or are you thinking of taking
advantage of that of your newfound LTE
or is that not I was concerned actually
the only phone that we have here that
supports LTE is Lumia 920 and a 20 so um
you know LT in Europe is not popular
frequency do you use because all phones
should support LTE um I've nothing to
frequencies I don't really know but from
what I've heard we don't have any any
phones that support healthy I've been
thinking about buying notes too but I
don't know it's too big or not it's a
it's a big risk to buy one do you have
retail stores where you can you know
debut sample them and take them you know
you have a demo unit is yes but you know
it's very different to hold it for five
minutes and have it for some time
absolutely when I was playing with it in
a shop I thought yeah it would be nice
but I'm not sure whether it would be
good single long-term you know I'm a
little surprised that nobody has branded
me a samsung fanboy yet because I'm seem
to always be pushing their products but
I found with my time with a note too
that it felt more manageable the more
time went on like it was huge when I
check it out of the box I was like this
is ridiculous but then I you know I five
days I was like all right and then I
went back to my was carrying galaxy s3
at the time I went back to it and I was
like well this is just too small to get
anything done yeah notes do this great
and now i'm rocking hd2 so yes very nice
nothing just somebody kill that thing no
you can't kill it that's the thing it
will never die except Brandis I wanted
to switch and i bought the galaxy s2 but
after using it for six hours i pricked
it and you went back to the apt yeah I
had no choice the gs2 is dead you know
in three years from now people r gonna
come on and say I'm the galaxy s7 and of
course the hdq it's doing well so we
gotta have like an hd2 day like a
celebration where we just like I don't
know we gotta do something that you get
a reduction a bucket now HD to meet up
yeah that's a cool idea I yeah when
