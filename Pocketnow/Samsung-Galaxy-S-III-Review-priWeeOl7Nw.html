pocket now calm and this is our full
review of the Samsung Galaxy s3 there's
a lot that we really love about this
phone there's also a lot that annoys us
and in this video we're going to tell
you about everything so let's get to it
we are testing the 16 gigabyte white
international version of the galaxy s3
which happens to have the proper bands
to access 18 T's 3G network in the u.s.
in terms of design the galaxy s3 bears
little resemblance to its predecessor
the galaxy s ii samsung went for a much
larger 4.8 inch display which dominates
the front of the device it's got one of
the thinnest bezels we've ever seen on a
phone lending even more attention to the
1280 by 720 Super AMOLED pentile display
more on the display later here at the
top we have a chrome earpiece which is
flanked by the proximity and light
sensors plus the 2 megapixel
front-facing camera up here there's also
the ever useful notification light which
glows blue if you have a new message or
amber if you're charging the device
below the screen you'll find a rounded
rectangular button which acts as the
home button you can also use it to
launch s voice with a double tap or to
bring up the task manager with a tap and
a hold on the right of the menu button
you'll find the back button and then you
will wonder why the back button isn't on
the left which would seem more intuitive
our best guess is that since the back
button is used much more often than the
Menu button
Samsung wanted to place it with an easy
reach for those that hold the phone with
their right hand
and it's easy to get used to on the left
is the Menu button an interesting
addition since Android 4.0 encourages
OEMs to phase out the menu button in
favor of in-app menus the developers
should include in their apps having a
legacy menu button is helpful though
when running programs not optimized for
Android 4.0 it's a better alternative to
what HTC has done with the One X by
placing a menu button on screen and by
doing so taking up precious pixels like
the Samsung Focus 2 backlight
illumination of the buttons is kind of
muddy and low-quality looking as you can
see here just kind of a small issue
the front of the device is covered with
a single sheet of glass which is
slightly rounded towards the edges in a
very subtle way which might help to
avoid the accumulation of Pocket lint
this piece of glass is lined with an
attractive silver border when you're
looking straight at it thanks to the
trim that begins on the side of the
device while the curvature of the trim
on the side would imply that the galaxy
s3 is curved like the Nexus S or Galaxy
Nexus that is not the case it's flat
looking over to the back we see the 8
megapixel camera LED flash and speaker
we can pop off the back battery cover
easily it's flimsy but that really
doesn't matter it's thin to keep the
device thin behind it we can see the
large 2100 milliamp hour battery the
micro SIM slot and the microSD expansion
Bay the galaxy s3 has a nice in hand
feel thanks to rounded corners and edges
unfortunately though the super slick
coating means that the phone becomes
very slippery should your hands become
even the least bit sweaty while you're
using it you'll want to get a case with
the galaxy s3 with a texture to it so
that it feels more secure in the hand in
terms of size the galaxy s3 is a similar
footprint to the HTC One X and is a bit
thinner actually because of this it
slides easily into the pocket and feels
comfortable in the hand obviously it's a
lot bigger than the galaxy s2 which only
had a 4.3 inch display so that's
something to keep in mind let's talk
specs the galaxy s3 is running an Exynos
1.4 gigahertz quad-core CPU with 1 gig
of ram we're seriously starting to
question the merits of having a
quad-core processor as they seem no
better than dual-core processors in
day-to-day usage more on performance in
a bit other specs include bluetooth 4.0
NFC FM radio gyroscope and the other
goodies you'd expect in a phone of this
calibre the camera on the back takes
photos at 8 megapixels it can record
1080p video at 30 frames per second now
let's talk about software the galaxy s3
is running Samsung's latest Android
interface TouchWiz 4 which sits on top
of Android 4.0 point 4 Samsung is
calling TouchWiz 4 nature UX because
they say it's inspired by nature what
this means in practice is that sounds
and wallpapers all have kind of a nature
theme it's really just a theme for
example to unlock the screen you splash
your finger around through a pool of
water
unlock the display we found the nature
theme to be a bit gimmicky and it really
didn't provide any sort of improved
experience it's not really a selling
point it just adds a little bit to the
experience but nothing really out of the
ordinary as with previous versions of
TouchWiz you can specify how many home
screens you want out-of-the-box Samsung
provides a large handful of widgets all
which can be found in the ICS style
launcher what's frustrating about the
TouchWiz 4 launcher is that it doesn't
allow you to make folders like you can
in stock Ice Cream Sandwich meaning you
can't drag one icon into another to
create a folder instead you have to
press the Menu button add a folder and
then add icons to the folder it's
cumbersome and Samsung should have left
Ice Cream Sandwich the way it is in this
respect the launcher looks very much
like stock Ice Cream Sandwich but it
adds some enhancements like the ability
to hide certain apps and organize apps
by various parameters in typical Samsung
style the notification shade has added
functionality from here you can toggle
various system radios enter system
settings or interact with notifications
like stock ICS you can swipe off
individual notifications beyond the home
screen TouchWiz extends deep into the
operating system affecting nearly every
stock application which is both good and
it is bad in terms of the good the
calendar has added functionality that
reminds us of what is found on the
Samsung Galaxy Note also in terms of the
good the browser has the Handy pinch to
show tabs function which makes it easy
to switch between various web pages
though of course many will get a
third-party browser that fits their
needs just the right way and more on web
browsing performance in a minute then
there are places where TouchWiz just
doesn't belong chief among them is in
the email app where Samsung employs an
ugly combination of black and blue to
make a really ugly design then Samsung
has placed the action buttons for email
on the top of the screen often
necessitating the use of a second hand
due to the tallness of the device HTC
has it right with the One X where the
action buttons in the email application
are at the bottom of the screen where
your thumb is likely to be another
niggling issue is that there's no option
to turn off the delete confirmation
dialog you have to confirm every time
that you want to delete a message and
there's no way to turn it off
what's worse is when you delete a
message there's an awkward delay which
was a flaw found on the Galaxy s2 it
takes several seconds sometimes to
delete an email that's kind of crazy
while we're an email let's compose a new
message and talk about the keyboard
options
Samsung has tweaked the stock ICS
keyboard but not for the better a
combination of not good enough touch
sensitivity an overzealous autocorrect
makes the galaxy s3s keyboard a headache
to use you can use swipe like keyboard
tracing but using this feature may text
input even more cumbersome perhaps this
and some of the other issues could be
remedied in a software update but as of
now the galaxy s3 really needs a
third-party input method perhaps
something like Swift key because the
keyboard is just not good enough out of
the box the Galaxy s3 is a nod flag when
you're in an app and you want to go back
to the home screen it turns out that
this is a result of the system waiting
for a second press of the home button to
activate s voice fortunately if you turn
off the double tap function by going
into s voice settings you can fix this
issue but it's not very obvious let's
talk about s voice which is Samsung's
copy of Siri we tend to wonder if
Samsung would have bothered to include s
voice of Siri didn't exist nevertheless
it's there an S voice works much like
Siri although it's a bit less accurate
we found it most handy for setting
reminders alarms and new calendar
appointments but using it for things
like calling people or checking the
weather seems to take more time when
compared to launching an app manually
and just doing it yourself the Galaxy s3
is a quad core Exynos CPU our
expectations were sky high for the
performance of this phone because its
predecessor which backed a dual core
Exynos CPU is still to this day one of
the fastest phones on the planet with
that said we were a bit disappointed
with the performance of the galaxy s3 we
found the galaxy s3 to be on par with
the Galaxy S 2 in terms of day-to-day
performance and only in a few cases a
bit faster launching apps for example is
superfast seldom with any lag also super
fast is browsing the web let's jump into
the web browser and load PocketNow
page load times are good and even better
is how effortlessly the Galaxy s3
gets the page loaded into memory
allowing for navigation that is devoid
of white spaces which can be typical of
lesser performing phones gaming
performance was good too but not amazing
for example while playing GTA 3 we
experienced some noticeable lag playing
Shadowgun which is actually a Tegra 3
optimized game it wasn't as impressive
as the 1x for that reason but in Google
Play there are no apps that can
specifically take advantage of the quad
core Exynos protector 3 devices like the
One X there are plenty of optimized
titles that really show off the
processor in terms of network
performance we tested the International
Galaxy s3 on AT&amp;amp;T and experienced pretty
typical results of about 2 to 4 megabits
per second down and 1 to 2 megabits per
second up the actual AT&amp;amp;T version of
this phone due out in June will have
better network performance and support
for LTE where available the galaxy s3
does particularly well over Wi-Fi
providing speeds almost as fast as a
wired connection which is really really
impressive faster than any other phone
on Wi-Fi call quality on the galaxy s3
was way above average thanks to a
combination of noise cancellation
achieved with a secondary microphone and
improved sound quality on the handset
itself provided by an equaliser called
sounded crisper and more clear than any
smart phone we've ever tested the
display is a familiar Super AMOLED panel
at full 720p resolution similar to the
Galaxy Nexus it has a pentile sub pixel
configuration which means that sub
pixels are shared between pixels
this means that text and certain
graphics are noticeably grainy for
example take a look at this text from
the New York Times app text isn't nearly
as sharp is found on the One X which has
much better
RGB sub pixel matrix another downside to
the display and this can be fixed with
software is that the auto brightness is
far too dim and adjustments to the
brightness are not smooth because of
this issue we left the brightness at
immanuel 50% beyond these issues the
screen on the Galaxy S 3 exhibits
fantastic contrast and deep color
saturation which we've come to expect
from Samsung's AMOLED displays now on to
camera quality the galaxy s3 takes
photos almost as good as the iPhone
RS photos came out well saturated
low-light performance was above-average
and super fast shutter speeds were much
appreciated 1080p video recording was
also above average in terms of overall
quality thanks to smooth frame rates
fast white balance adjustment and crisp
audio now let's go through some test
notes the Galaxy s3 has a lot of little
features that are unique in the industry
for example smart stay which actually
can negatively impact battery life when
turned on and if it is activated a lot
we'll check to see if you're still
looking at the phone when you reach the
end of your screen timeout interval
which by default is set at 15 or 30
seconds well it's a bit creepy to think
that the phone is looking at you to look
for eyeballs it actually does work and
it's a it's an interesting feature
another great feature is that you get 50
gigabytes of Dropbox cloud storage for
two years that's better than the 25 gigs
that you get with the HTC One X but of
course with all of this cloud storage
after the two years if you're using all
that space you're gonna have to start
paying for it so it's a little bit
annoying in that respect in terms of
battery life the galaxy s3 is above
average with moderate use you'll get
through a bit more than one day with
heavy use you'll make it through a full
day but barely overall we found the
galaxy s3 battery performance to be
almost as good as the One X which has
very good battery life for a phone of
its type so here's what we like and
don't like about the galaxy s3 we like
that the galaxy s3 looks different than
any other smartphone that's super thin
bezel and handsome silver accent we like
that the photo quality is good enough to
keep up with the iPhone 4s and we like
that the performance is second to none
at this moment in time it's a very fast
phone even though it didn't blow us away
we also like that the battery life is
above average we don't like that the
phone feels slippery in hand we don't
like that TouchWiz 4 provides a poor
email and keyboard experience and then
it does away with easy folder creation
paradigm brought forth an Android 4.0
finally we didn't like the performance
didn't exceed or even meet our
expectations for Samsung's flagship for
2012 in terms of pricing and
availability you can buy the galaxy s3
unlocked now from clove co uk for 416
British pounds which
about 650 US dollars for the 16 gigabyte
model it comes in marble white or pebble
blue the galaxy s3 will be available on
all US carriers for around $200 for the
16 gigabyte version with a new two-year
contract look for that in June overall a
lot of our annoyances can and will be
fixed with a software update whether
it's from Samsung or from the developer
community at the end of the day those
looking at the galaxy s3 will also be
considering the HTC One X which do we
recommend if you're looking for the best
out of box software experience with
solid performance the HTC One X can't be
beat but if you're looking for the most
impressive hardware with great future
potential if you're willing to root your
device and install faster third-party
ROM the galaxy s3 is a no brainer we
give the galaxy s3 a four out of five
keep an eye on pocketnow.com for the
full review where we'll have more
remarks about the galaxy s3 and if you
like this video please give us a thumbs
up as always thanks for watching and
that's it for now
