we're going to take a look at this
software tour of the LG thrill 4g let's
check it out so first off we're on the
lock screen here we got the date and
time we got some notifications we got a
little calendar appointment and it says
slide up to unlock so we're going to do
that and here's our default home screen
we've got a widget already there some
icons and we can of course swipe around
there's a3d plus widget music news
social and a blank one and we can pinch
like that and get to see all seven and
you can switch really easily to each one
that way we can tap and hold and move it
move them around or delete them like
that and i can set default home screen
by pressing that first and then choosing
which one I want menu button doesn't do
anything here over here we have our
settings are accessible and changing the
wallpaper of course and it's got a nice
interface for that so there's your
wallpapers you can choose from
and this is actually the customization
you I so we can add widgets to and we
got a pretty nice selection which knows
social plus some of these are already
there I'm going to put the application
manager and I can put it anywhere I want
so there you go folders and shortcuts
you can do course as well and back will
get me out of that so there's the home
screen stuff and here's the application
tray now we have applications separated
into different sections here's our 3d
applications up up there and then
regular applications here comes with
Kindle yellowpages some 18t programs i
lapped live TV my ATT kick light is
there 18 to code scanner application
managers really the task manager 18t
navigator family map books browser usual
stuff it does come with facebook finance
latitude of course
here's music players office these are
all the included program smart share and
then downloads are separated again by
default but I can change layout so
there's a page page view and you see a
little slider up top pretty cool and we
can change layout to list and this is
easy to find programs by alphabetical
order okay
and we can change categories around here
too or add categories if you want to
organize your apps in a different way so
let's check out some of these 3d
programs first off pressing this 3d
button up there will get us to the 3d
hub kind of thing probably not going to
be able to see this in 3d since this
camera is one lens but you can pretend
without be looking 3d there's your 3d
guide let's check that up and it's just
kind of tutorial ish stuff there's
youtube let's check that out
and it's not in 3d but it has links to
videos that are in 3d and we have the 3d
gallery this is pretty cool it's going
to ask me well it's going to tell me to
take a break sometimes because you might
get some dizziness and stuff so here's
some pictures I took there's a video and
you don't get the full effect but you
can imagine this this is 3d video 3d
camera games let's go to the camera real
quick
so up here is a toggle between 3d and 2d
that little button right there I can
also use this button to toggle between
2d and 3d I'm gaining can't really tell
on this video let's try some games we've
got some cool ones Nova is kind of a
first-person shooter asphalt 3d let's
golf and culvers travels again if you
get tired dizzy you can see when I turn
it you can see the different fields okay
it's going to have that so that's about
it for the included bundled apps and
customizations on the LG thrill 4g stay
tuned for our full review Wilker up some
more and that's it for now
