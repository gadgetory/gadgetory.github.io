the Google pixel will be updating on its
network Samsung profits are gonna take a
dramatic hit with the galaxy note 7
debacle and it seems that Samsung is
already working on a sort of a revamp
for the galaxy s7 edge I'm hi Mary vetta
and what would be your favorite piece of
technology this year it was a comment
let us know I will have my review for
mine very soon this is parking out daily
official news today begin with deals and
a very good one actually one of my
favorite smartwatches this year is the
Moto 360 second-generation those of you
in the market for a really good android
wear watch i highly recommend this one
it's currently available for just two
hundred dollars on amazon and on best
buy and in the case of the female
varying you can get it for 230 which is
great i highly suggest you follow elects
other official news are probably not so
warming for those of you that really
want to give a try to android 7 dot 1
nougat and all the variances with the
assistant and everything which obviously
also means that you'll be able to test
it on nexus devices those aren't so good
as apparently you are going to have to
wait until december for the Developer
Preview meaning that yeah after the
Developer Preview goes alive we're gonna
have to wait a long time for it to get
official for every other device that's
not going to be fun others said these
have to do with Samsung and obviously
the whole galaxy note 7 debacle I know a
lot of people are already returning
their phones and I think that's the
smartest thing to do but for those of
you that are wondering how this is going
to hurt Samsung actually the numbers are
staggering the company's apparently
already posting that it will be losing
1.8 billion dollars in revenue this
quarter why because the galaxy note 7
was that inflection that would bring
extra revenue for the fall and that's
not going to be the case for those of
you that are wondering exactly how Sammy
plans to fix this problem obviously we
would love to see another note this year
because it would be terrible for you
know us to be stuck with a two year old
note 5 which was a good phone but not a
great one still apparently Samsung is
planning to make a quick little small
revamp with the galaxy s7 edge we see
some leaked images of the blue coral
back
of the galaxy s7 edge so for those of
you that wanted that color variant which
is the one that I have for the node 7 I
highly recommend it let's see when it
launches and finally the very hot nooses
they have to do with the Google pixel
and Verizon for those of you that
remember the fact that we were
disappointed that google claims not to
be handling software updates with that
phone because they're only going to be
in charge of security it seems that well
Verizon just heard the news that nobody
was happy with that and the company has
just pretty much confirmed that we have
nothing to worry about apparently
software updates will be on par in the
case of the Google pixel for verizon in
the case of every other Google pixel how
these company is going to figure it out
it's going to be rather interesting but
it leads me to the question of the day
are you going for an unlocked Google
pixel are you going for a verizon google
pixel are you going for any other phone
this year in my case I am trying the
unlock variant let's see how it goes
