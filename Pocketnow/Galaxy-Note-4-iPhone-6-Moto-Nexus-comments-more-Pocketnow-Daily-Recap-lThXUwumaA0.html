when you guys just make up your mind why
are you not mentioning my comments there
you happy now hey Jaime I got the same
shirt as yours and i knew i wasn't the
only guy with good taste dude that's
right it's that time of the week i am hi
Natalie there this is pocket now and
this is our pocket now daily recap for
last week so on Monday asked you what do
you think about the galaxy note 4 leaks
as we got the first pictures of the
phone we saw the metal chassis we saw
the leather back and everything looked
really cool and we have 650 comments out
of which one of the commoner says I hope
the note 4 is not 2k one of the greatest
features of the other note lineup is the
great battery life 2k on the LG g3 has a
large amount of web browsing cut down
compared to the g2 and well let's hope
they figure out the technology AMOLED
technology is supposedly better
inserting things and hopefully that will
be the case in battery life and shark
car says if the pic is true it is hot
definitely hot I will sell the g3 and
get the note for any time if Samsung
will minimize the bezel and increase the
battery life and yeah why not let's just
see what they bring I do find the design
to be elegance but then again it looks a
lot like a note 3 as well and then
terzic says it's the same old samsung
and i think a lot of us agree with that
then on tuesday asked you what do you
think about the leaked specifications of
the google nexus 6 as you remember there
is a motorola phablet that's being
rumored and apparently you'll have a 5.9
inch display that's only 1080p that's
really not flexure specifications for
the end of this year we have 709
comments out of which honest says I hope
everything about the Nexus 6 is right
except for the 5.9 inch display that is
huge and we agree with that five point
nine inches is extremely uncomfortable
and it's not Motorola like but then
again if they figure out a way to get
rid of the bezels five point nine inches
would make sense craig nelson says I
think 1080p is more than enough for me
don't need a 4k display the Nexus 5 had
up to the date specification when it
came out and it didn't have the latest
and greatest about the phone and it's
still fantastic the only thing I'm
really looking forward to his android l
and you make a really solid point there
1080p is actually great again the
problem is the screen size so let's see
where that goes and well frame says a 2k
screen is really overkill I don't really
see that as a must-have specification
overall performance and camera
quality or more important a 1080p screen
is fine oh and please don't skimp on the
battery capacity this time okay and yeah
you make a solid point there 1080p is
fine again as long as the screen size is
not so big and let's hope they figure
out things like battery life because
that has been an issue hopefully we get
a replaceable one this time then on
Wednesday asked you what do you think
about the samsung galaxy alpha as the
device had just been announced and yeah
it is a galaxy s5 of the metal chassis
and a smaller display legend
specifications and everything that looks
like an iphone and we have 697 comments
out of which games daily says Samson get
ready for apples lawyers and we do agree
with that let's see how long that will
last the men that says a middle phone oh
that's so new and yeah that's actually
very disappointing the fact that
companies are not experimenting with
other materials but then again one of
their materials could there be for phone
building you know the Kevlar thing that
Motorola use is cool then another
commoner says Galaxy alpha should be one
of the best mid-range phones if its
price not too high we could agree not
agree because of the specifications it's
not really a mid seared phone or at
least that's not the way they want to
sub they want to cater to the iphone
crowd so we'll see how that plays out as
I think that Samsung's intentions are
different then on Thursday I asked you
if the rumored specifications of the
galaxy note 4 would make you want to
jump to a valid if you're not currently
using one or if you wanted to adopt the
Galaxy Note 4 as yeah quad HD display at
a lot of great specifications we have
637 comments out of which one of them
says yes I'm switching as soon as it's
available i'll be upgrading from my
stinking galaxy s3 and yeah that is a
very much needed upgrade dude then j
pisa davia says might switch from i am
made to a note for especially because
they didn't make the display bigger and
the smaller vessels means it's a smaller
than the note 3 and i'll wait for the
pocket i'll review and yes a lot of us
will be waiting for the pocket now
review because a lot of the things in
this design looked really compelling but
i do agree i mean sometimes i use the
galaxy note 3 i compared to the m8 and i
do appreciate the fact that there are
less bezels on the galaxy note 3 i
sometimes feel it less comfortable and
then finally on friday i asked you if
you would pay for a higher story
option for the iphone 6 just to get
sapphire in the display as the rumors
are that only those that would pay for
the higher version of the iphone and
storage will be getting this technology
we have 418 comments out of which air
can write says I always buy the higher
storage iphone anyways just hope that
they have 128 gig version this year and
the rumors are that there will be the
128 gigs and yeah I do the same thing
that you do only this year with so many
expandable storage options in android
it's really difficult to move to an
iphone 6 with 128 gigs when i can do
that easily with a One m8 or a galaxy
note 3 right now then Sergio 9n says
yeah why not it's something unusual too
much Gorilla Glass I want to try it and
yeah that probably is a good point I
just I don't know I wish the iphone had
expandable storage I guess that's my
biggest problem lately then another
commoner says this is ridiculous the
iphone is already the most expensive
phone so far this place should not be a
good option it should be a standard from
Apple it seems like Apple is just
milking their customers and dude by the
way making sapphire is not cheap that's
the reason why nobody else does it so
I'm not going to agree with that
necessarily but then again yes in most
countries the iphone is more expensive
or if you want more storage options it
makes it extremely expensive so I do
understand your point but you're not
obligated to buy an iphone or obligated
to buy on phone with sapphire so it's
really up to you in my case I don't
think that I would spend more money for
sapphire but then again because I pay so
much money for extra warranty in order
to switch my phone whenever I smash it
it'll all depend on what the options are
thats it for our pocket out daily recap
