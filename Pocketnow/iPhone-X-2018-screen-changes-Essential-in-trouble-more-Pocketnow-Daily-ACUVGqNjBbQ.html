like Bob the Builder there's a slight
possibility that Apple might use OLED
for all of its iPhones going forward
while we may be joining the race the
foldable displays and launching
something soon and sadly essential is
struggling I mean things are getting
really bad I'm Jaime Rivera and believe
it or not this is probably one of the
first Friday's ever that I was not
counting on happening so quickly we have
a lot of work coming up this is
PocketNow daily
the official news today began with deals
that have not ended the huawei mate n
Pro considers to be one of those devices
that we highly recommend watch our video
for that but if you're still in the
market for one I mean it's dropped the
price up to six hundred and fifty bucks
and some Mother's Day and it hasn't
ended on Best Buy so if you're in the
market it's probably the best time to
buy learn more in the description now
let's talk about the vivo apex that
device with 93% screen to body ratio
that's been leaked and that selfie
camera that pops up and down
ok let's ditch the whole concept thing
as of now we received an official email
from the company with an event happening
on June 12th in Shanghai so yes the
affix is happening let's see this is the
feature of smartphones Apple I hope that
many companies follow this design and
not the knotch
let's see what we get now let's talk
about essential in some sad news today
we were hoping for an essential phone -
but we've got some reports from
Bloomberg that apparently the company is
on sale that the essential phone - is
not going to happen and well we don't
know exactly what to expect going
forward from the company we hear that
the company is just trying to sell but
it's looking for investments it's not
necessarily how the company wants to
close down and we hope that's not gonna
be the case as well products usually
need more than one generation to work so
hopefully that essential phone tool will
happen at some point
now let's talk about Huawei once again
as we hear that the company is
partnering with VOE on a foldable OLED
display and they're actually preparing
to launch something at some point
probably by end of this year early next
year and you know foldable displays have
been the thing from Samsung and
obviously I'm sure that these companies
internally know something we don't as to
what projects they have with these
foldable displays so stay tuned this
might be really cool if they figure out
how to revamp tablets using this
technology and finally the most
interesting news today have to do with
the affordable I phone which we here is
going to be priced between 550 and 800
bucks and well most of the rumors claim
that we were going to get an LCD on this
phone and that was going to drop the
price but apparently a
according to some trusted sources that
have already showed us patents in the
past no it seems that all iPhones are
gonna bring OLED technology how is Apple
gonna cut corners with this design or
something to make it more affordable
it's hard to tell
it's kind of early right now in the
supply chain for us to be able to
predict that but in today's question let
us know not necessarily with either if
we're getting OLED or what materials but
do you think that between five and eight
hundred dollars would be reasonable as
an affordable iPhone in my case I let's
scratch the 500 that's just not gonna
happen I'd say be above 650 or something
I feel if that's gonna be fine not
affordable but fine leave us a comment
