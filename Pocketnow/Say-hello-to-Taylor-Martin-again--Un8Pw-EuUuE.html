that if you don't like these stock
services or applications you can
generally find a replacement fairly
easily I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow I'm Taylor Martin with pocket
now I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
I'm Taylor Martin this is pocket now for
the last time I'm Taylor Martin with
pocket now and this that's what's in my
bag I don't know I felt compelled to
just say no turn off your phone and and
just enjoy the things around you doesn't
have to be the woods doesn't have to be
some crazy long backpacking trip it
doesn't have to be anything other than
just sitting on a couch with your family
this Christmas or whatever holiday you
celebrate and having a conversation here
with the guys were back in Pisgah this
is part of the Linville Gorge hey guys
welcome back to another mini mod and
this time I'm gonna show you how to make
a DIY firestarter one a sharp blade for
cutting things this is the same knife I
used to cut myself out of my mother's
womb there's not a damn thing you can do
with a smartphone that I can't do with
it I don't even know how to begin this
I'm back I guess that's the best way to
put it so I'm Taylor Martin and this is
PocketNow
so yeah many of you know that I left the
channel back in 2014 I was a little
burned out I was a little fed up with
smartphones in the way that the industry
was going there was a lot of innovation
for the sake of innovation who pushed
the line nudge it rather to nudge the
line just enough to make people
interested in the next phone and a lot
of this still going on but there are
also bigger changes being made
especially in the cameras and in
different technology so I'm back and I'm
kind of interested in taking a new look
at the smartphone industry because my
time away afforded me the opportunity to
step back and view smartphones from a
consumer perspective how does a
professional reviewer or a hobbyist but
really just using a phone as a
utilitarian tool to get the job done and
get me through my day and I think coming
back with that new perspective will be
particularly valuable to some of you it
feels good to be back it feels good to
be back in front of this camera and back
in front of this audience which I've
missed you guys I've missed all your
support all the hateful hateful comments
believe it or not I've missed that
interaction and I'm I used to sit around
with my girlfriend Alex who's still here
she's working right now but we used to
sit around after I had upload a video
and just laugh at some of the hateful
comments and how ridiculous some of them
were and I look forward to doing that
again we'll finally here on the channel
making product reviews again as well as
comparisons I'll be only PocketNow
weekly on Fridays most Fridays probably
whenever they need me or want me on the
podcast and I will be exploring or
experimenting rather with new video
ideas during the channel bring you guys
some stuff that you haven't seen before
so that's my plan and what I plan to
bring to the table a different outside
perspective that I did not have before a
more mature perspective slightly better
video quality but I'm still just Appel
and still just as Kermit E some things
never change anyway I'm so happy to be
back the podcast last week was a ton of
fun I really truly missed that I missed
the camaraderie I missed working with
people I'm working by myself in this
office for years and not
talking with many people outside this
office so it's good to be back in
working with friends old friends crews
