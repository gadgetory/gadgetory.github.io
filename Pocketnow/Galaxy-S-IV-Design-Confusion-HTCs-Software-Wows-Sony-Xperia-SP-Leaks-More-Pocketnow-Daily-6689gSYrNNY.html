transition simple case manufacturers
can't decide on how the galaxy s4 will
look and the Sony Xperia SP gets leaked
I'm hi- ana and i'm heading to tgif once
this video is over this is parking out
daily now get this new installment HTC
is planning a major overhaul to their
HTC Sync manager in order to support the
fact that you could pull full backups
from an iphone to be loaded on your new
HTC One and sadly yes it's only
supporting HTC one's once they make the
market but the idea is that you can pull
your contacts calendars personal
information your photos and your media
from your iPhone directly to the new HTC
One once you pull it out of the box
makes you wonder why they haven't
figured that out for other Android
devices and makes you wonder why it
can't happen with the HTC One X for
example new rumors show us how the ipad
mini 2 will look and you don't need to
take a wild guess it looks exactly like
the ipad mini one though it's hard to
tell at this point what sort of changes
will happen in the internals for the new
design that's pretty much like the old
design the question is an apple will
bring a render display to this ipad and
even though everyone is crossing their
fingers waiting for that honestly i
doubt it will keep you posted now let's
talk about the galaxy s4 usually the way
we know how devices are going to look
before they're launched is because
somehow case manufacturers are able to
get the devices before they're launched
really cool but the problem is that
these new case companies cannot figure
out how the galaxy s4 looks and this is
just to prove a point of how Samsung can
be secretive with their new device
coming up though we're not sure if
that's really a good or a bad thing
we'll keep you posted obviously the
galaxy s4 may land and march 14th so set
your calendars now other new leaks show
that Sony is working on a new Xperia SP
for those of you that thought that the
alphabet was done with the Xperia Z less
device pack some decent hardware we have
a 1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro
processor along with the usual suspects
but the question is where will this
device land when it comes to a market
maybe probably not necessarily United
States probably just a specific market
the design is kind of cool but we don't
really see this happening for mwc 2013
so just stay tuned we could be surprised
and finally for the interesting news of
the day recently Windows RT customers
were surprised with the great news that
there's a jailbreak feature for Windows
RT tablets but sadly back then the
problem is that you couldn't pretty much
load anything that was at an ARM based
application but this new emulator has
just debuted in beta and it allows you
to load 32-bit Windows applications into
Windows RT but it's obviously a beta
it's not really perfect but that really
leads me to the question of the day
think about this if somebody out there
was able to figure out how to bring
windows applications into Windows RT and
not Microsoft why didn't Microsoft
figure it out I mean seriously I feel
that the only reason why Windows RT has
not taken off is because there aren't
any apps and makes you wonder why
Microsoft is not really giving it the
potential that it should receive it was
