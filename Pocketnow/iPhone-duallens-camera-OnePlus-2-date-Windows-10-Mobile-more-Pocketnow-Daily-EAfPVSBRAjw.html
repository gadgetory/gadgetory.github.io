watch straps with functionality for the
Apple watch the 1+2 finally gets a
defined release date it seems that Apple
is closer than ever to a dual lens
iphone camera I'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter
recording this video from one country
and editing in another I call this
globalization this is poking out daily
the official news today start with the
reserve strap and that is the name for a
new smart band for the Apple watch with
the intention of adding an extra 30
hours of battery life which in the case
of an Apple watch which provides you a
day and a half of battery life this is
pretty much doubling it it's a good idea
good concept not very well I don't know
the design is not the best but then
again it has the functionality it
connects that secret point inside where
you connect the Apple watch straps which
is really good idea the only problem is
number one you have to wait till the
upper third number 2 250 dollars for
that yeah bad ugly and a new build of
windows 10 just became official for the
fast lane and well it brings up some
fixes to the installation and restore
process but you will still get this like
really odd boot animation at the end
which could seem like if your phone has
hung but it really hasn't so just beware
of that addition to other UX fixes like
in the case of the edge browser moving
the header you know for address bar and
everything so yeah a couple of neat
changes that are coming we just don't
have a date for windows 10 mobile yet
that's how about the one plus two we
still have not seen the phone yet but we
have a teaser that it will be available
on july twenty seventh and apparently
that's a launch date meaning that's when
you can buy the phone and it seems that
they're teasing a VR headset along with
it which is cool let's just hope they
make this a free accessory or they make
it extremely affordable just like we
want the phone to be we'll see about
that now one of the cool things about
beta software is what it reveals and it
seems that OS 10 elcapitan or El Capitan
is triggering two things number one a 21
inch 4k iMac which is due for a major
refresh thank you we're waiting for that
because the 5k imac is just too
expensive but even more interesting is
the fact that we see a bluetooth remote
that is intended for the Apple TV
not necessarily for the Apple TV this is
a touchscreen remote that will allow you
to get force touch functionality and we
just wonder what exactly Apple is
intending with this next generation
Apple TV and for this remote as well so
stay tuned for the events that are
coming this fall and finally for the
very interesting news or rumors of the
day we've got some trusted sources
claiming that Apple has been working on
dual lens cameras for the past three
years and they haven't gotten it right
because number one either the resulting
photos were too blurry or they couldn't
find the supplier that could build
enough of these and we're talking about
the little dual lens cameras just like
the ones we see on the HTC One m8 or
what I'm nine plus and yeah it seems
that Apple is working hard end up it
seems that one it just found the
supplier that can build them and to it
seems they've figured out the technology
with this eerily company that they
bought so it could be that the iphone
successor iphone 7 is getting this
feature but it leads me to the question
of the day what do you think about dual
lens cameras do you think that there is
a point for their existence because in
my case I really didn't like him on the
one I made I would have preferred a
regular camera which is on the One m9
now but leave us a comment down below
