making a circle around the enemy and if
I'm able to do that successfully without
hitting them they will be sucked in and
I'll get more points so the game
progresses like this unfortunately I
just got hit by one of them so now I
just have to continue and I want to
collect some more of these other guys

it's pretty big combo because other
people landed inside that circle and
there's many different game styles to
play snap music is a free application

item here so let me just scan a barcode
ok so now for the Kate will you mean
much more information than is on the
label of the ingredients as well as the
nutrition information and I can view the
grade that this food product has got
alternatives the
healthier choices and it looks as though
