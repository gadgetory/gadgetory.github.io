makes me look like a boy band member
performing on stage but if you have been
listening to the podcast since I started
hosting you know that usually means a
special edition is coming your way
and besides speaking of wearable
technology that's exactly what this
edition of the weekly is all about
coming together after the Qualcomm
Snapdragon wear event we have a lot of
special guests today to talk about the
Snapdragon were 3100 and what it means
for our smartwatches and given the fact
that this is one of the only times
during the year that we can all
congregate into one place and I have the
ability to press record on it we do talk
a little bit about the trials and
tribulations of being a creator hello
everybody and welcome to episode 323 of
the weekly brought to you by pocket now
and xda-developers recorded on Monday
September 10 2018 from smartphones we
moved to smartwatches and all of the
different types of wearable tech that
they still aren't releasing but you wish
you had when you were a kid so let's go
ahead and get chatting I am your host
for the weekly it's Josh or vegara
what's going on everybody and we are
joined by hi meter Vetta the host of the
PocketNow daily you all know who he is
I'm sure a lot of you will be really
excited to know that after I took on
hosting this podcast I was really happy
to get Michael Fisher the mr. Mobile
himself to come back to the podcast
after all this was his baby once upon a
time and he has given his blessing for
me to take it on to in his words evolve
it further we're also joined by Danny
winget who is always fun to be around
and we're really happy to have him on
the podcast also with us as someone you
may know as tech me out ravinok Austin
is on the podcast and then finally we
have some chime ins from a1 Russell
Holley of Android Central who was
accompanying Michael Fisher on our
journey to the breather room where we
finally were able to record this podcast
there are a lot of big names on this
podcast for today so make sure you head
over to the show notes if you want to
follow any of them across social media
or on their own respective YouTube
channels they also give their shout outs
over at the end of the episode so make
sure you stay tuned until the end for
that as well but with that said let's go
ahead and fade into our episode on a
coffee fueled afternoon in San Francisco
I'd pick pick up that mic let's do this
you know I'm doing the intro afterwards
so we're just gonna we're fading in
right now whenever you're ready
alright I can't believe you got the
reference design watch I have to give it
back okay fine but I hope you think it
looks kind of cool about it is the
rotating crown yes or the rotating side
button or RSB is what you're referring
to is the internal Google nomenclature
for the best feature of a wear last
device hey you guys just released the LG
watch sport meat ball and it has a great
rotating thing what do you call the
crown and they're like the RSB
oh my sweet I'm into it you felt so Star
Trek right then yeah man so why don't we
get like a small recap of like what is
like it's being covered by all the
coffee everyone needed to be on the cast
but we have the chip right here the chip
is actually in there that the
coprocessor is in there okay so what
we're looking at JV uh-huh is what like
a tiny little thing that's what a
quarter the size of a pinky nail there's
like a very small piece of likeness so
freakin micro yeah yeah yes and I was I
would led to understand that this was
the coprocessor which was part of a
larger wafer oh it says it does say the
team cheering so that's the whole thing
we're looking at the 3100 that is the
whole Russell's like
it's a party okay so this is actually
the snapdragon 3100 is the same SOC as
the 2120 nanometer process yeah which by
the way is twice the size of the chip
that's in the new samsung galaxy watch
the thing that is different is this
coprocessor which is separate so it's
actually the same physical hardware with
with this separate smaller and that's
why they're making such a big deal out
of the the coprocessor coprocessor being
so much smaller ah because they're they
didn't they intentionally didn't tell us
that the regular processor for this is
actually the exact same physical size
because it's the same silicon yeah as in
the original process is that I had made
my script for my video thank you so this
is just somewhat misleading like text on
here because it says it's basically
something marketing the platform and
then she's holding up a lucite block
containing yeah yeah yeah you take it
apart while while recording a video and
for Danny the coprocessor will fall out
and be lost and think it's tiny though
it is very small so Vimy so what what
let's let's uh for anybody that doesn't
know what we're looking at here and why
this is so important today in particular
what does this coprocessor looking to do
in the snapdragon 3100 platform and
wants to take it away I think I think
the the importance of this coprocessor
is obviously to give you the best
battery life which is the biggest flaw I
think in any SmartWatch right now is
because you're charging it daily or
you're charging it once every two days
and this is an ultra-low power processor
or a coprocessor to help with those
things and it's a an independent
processor on its own which is kind of
interesting that they would still use
this part of an SOC where you have
essentially a main processor and a
coprocessor when that can actually
function on its own already mm-hmm
so that's where it's interesting anybody
else you because you've been now I've
been looking at this thing for all day
so you had a long conversation at our
podcast last week yeah over my
disappointment I told them about
swatches
my disappointment about smartwatches is
and always on display that's not so good
or limited my disappointment has always
been that Fitness on where OS is
terrible with the exception of the polar
m600 and then my other disappointment is
obviously you know battery life just
it's not great and so it seems that this
3100 is addressing all of this through
that coprocessor that coprocessor takes
over whenever you're not using the watch
for launching applications which nobody
uses apps on smart watches anyways true
I mean I don't think yeah I feel like a
lot of us are in that boat but you know
and we're the geeks that are supposed to
tax them yeah right right right
whenever I fire up a Smart Watch app
it's very typically to do it for a
review video right it's like here you
can play Tetris on it or whatever it's
like where you know Spotify will help
you if you want to download offline
music and stuff but all these use cases
are so far outside of what I use we'll
watch for executively use them just for
notifications and you tell me you don't
watch videos on your galaxy watch weird
right yeah you can only watch snapchat
[Laughter]
Highfill eda spies all three of you
right now I'm the only way of this
podcast does not have a galaxy watch oh
I just realized that yeah sorry man
sorry oh I'm a second but you're the
you're the host of this podcast is the
only one with a yellow S Pen on the
purple Samsung Galaxy Note nice thank
you very much I am I'm how did that come
to be by the way okay so I went with I
got the lavender one and actually you
can get the s-pen for 50 bucks at Best
Buy
and well they do sell them separately
then they do even that leak was proved
correct okay there you go nice I have I
have the yellow S Pen here and even
though this was a lavender phone I put a
skin on the back and then a fine brand
yeah the villain of my favorite video
game of all time Mega Man X there you go
man there we go man anyway did the I
wanted to bring up the Galaxy watch
because first of all I'm you all have
the 46 millimeter eye look I think we
all have the 46 yeah yeah I told them
whenever you finally decide to get me
1 2 42 so hopefully hopefully that
what's the decision on the 42 why
because I want to see how it is I want
to see how the watch performs and looks
and like blends with the style when it's
a lot more accessible to a lot of people
because even the 46 if I were to put
that on right now I would probably feel
a little bit no I'm just a little too
big I have speck wrists I'm taking it
out for three runs already I will tell
you it is heavier than the average
fitness couch for running you've also
got like a big old I'm not using rolling
garage door on there big beefy metal
link wristbands obviously switch well
cuz accessibility on a SmartWatch is
kind of half the battle if you're going
to look at a slew of smartwatches and
one of them is really big and you don't
really it's not that you don't like
wearing it but it's big you're not gonna
wear it as much true so the 42 I want to
see that actually be it make the
difference gotcha in the design even if
it's the pink one I don't care but you
do get hit with a little battery life
though right exactly has a smaller so
you got smaller battery battery life for
you guys because for me it's funny I
woke up one day and it was dead yeah so
would you leave always on display honest
though its number one question don't I
try okay the first day I was at 50%
battery the next I'm getting I really
any watch that does not have enough
power to tell me the time whether I'm
looking at it or not whether I'm moving
it or not like it's just I have a very
hard time accepting so I leave always on
display on and I get about two days to
two and a half days between the charges
on the 46 that is perfect I don't know
if it's perfect it's not what I'm
getting it needs more but it's better
than what was out there well one of the
things that was announced today at the
thing was that now the the 3100 is gonna
have native support for I think I read
this right for dual displays right yeah
stuff that tick watch and Casio have
been doing now will be natively
supported you won't have to get a
manufacturer to do something special
with it yeah and which is fantastic
that's great really cuz that's what I'm
so spoiled now by wearing those big
chunky Cassio's all the time which you
know for all the other things you can
say about them when the main display is
off and that LCD is on up top you can
read it in any condition yeah and you
don't share as well but in the tick
watch behaves exactly the same yeah
so like that's fantastic it just takes a
long time to get from the minimal
display back into the just that amount
of time is really annoying because
you're basically it's oh you mean to
switch out of I'm sorry just switch out
of the timepiece my exact power mode
you're booting the watching the watch
and it's just kind of annoying I just
mean when that secondary display comes
on when it goes into standby yeah so
when the main display turns out that's
on yes so what are your impressions over
the 3100 Mike I was just looking at my
favorite paragraph of my notes because
it like breaks down everything annika to
know less indeed didn't feel didn't feel
great run glass so I bust up my key to
fill up here brought to you by
blackberry low power mode power
reductions versus the 2100 this is what
I love low power mode uses 67% less
power on the 3100 GPS uses 49 percent
less key word detection for okg 43% less
the clock update for once a minute you
know like telling the time is 35 percent
light mp3 player 34% avoids quick they
take so much less power to do everything
yeah and that should result in a lot
better battery life and then in the very
next paragraph they're like yeah four
hours to 12 hours over existing designs
and I'm like that doesn't sound like a
lot that was a confusing slide right
very confusing slide but apparently I
think there's different ways to
interpret that that that slide in
particular because four hours to 12
hours is like active use and not sitting
there in standby yeah so that could
translate to a day to day and a half
more yeah power consistent I think if
you are within that 95 to 5 ratio that
they came up with where users 5 percent
of the time just want the time and
everybody else you know sorry users just
want the time 95 percent of the time and
then 5% they'll be using the watch
actively mmm how do you that what do you
agree with that number ah I do and I'm a
big SmartWatch fan and I wouldn't say I
use it more than 5% of my day I guess
yeah I guess I guess that seems a little
middling like I I wouldn't say that I
thought the SmartWatch skeptic and I
feel like 5 is kind of low I feel it's
low because of the amount of
notifications we get
yeah but what do you do with the
notifications though you just swipe them
away that's it or you just look at him
and you move on that's the thing but the
moment you do that you automatically
switch from the coprocessor to the big
processor yes so that 5% at least in my
user scenario that won't that won't fly
yeah I don't know go ahead but don't you
have to actually physically touch the
display to make it go to the to the
regular processor right not the
coprocessor or handling that side of it
though yeah so does the coprocessor does
the coprocessor handle the notification
side yes yes notifications yeah take a
moment you flip it on and activate the
screen you're back into the dayside
regular platform and you're interacting
with the watch but still it's such a
short time when you interact with the
watch and you're going back Juliano
where OS where you can't even read the
damn notifications yes of course anybody
used a new where so far yeah the Casio
at Aoife had it and but what do you
think is a dramatic dramatic it looks
better
yeah I feel like it's more functional
yeah I agree like basically you've gone
from this model where there's a lot of
conflicting UI elements to like okay
swipe in from the four cardinal corners
of the compass to do everything did you
say a function way I don't know which I
would love to hear that term used for UI
design that's great yeah yeah that's
very function way but but it is right
it's like you swipe down from the top
four settings you swipe up for
notifications you swipe left for google
fit you swipe right for google feet for
now that's that's super simple and it's
been overhauled to be black like you
know so that if you have an AMOLED panel
there's not you're not senselessly
illuminating a white card for no reason
you know it's just like how are you
expecting the notifications to from
other applications because obviously
it's in a controlled environment you
have hangouts and you have you know in
this demo version but like if you have
something from an app that usually
populates so much data on a notification
when it
don't look weird there well you're gonna
have to scroll past the amount of text
that it's trying to render in that
little oh in the stream in the
notification window I imagine it
probably does some smart what do you
call it
sonication yeah yeah I hope so because
those those everything was coming out
perfectly there's no truncation in the
demo of breakfast it's always Alice yang
exactly if you want to go hang out
tonight I'm so sick of I wonder what it
would look like if when it's truncated
it's gonna be annoying and that's it's
always been annoying on a SmartWatch for
me it's I don't know I feel where OS has
I honestly I haven't had enough time
with the new version I the things that
would disappoint me the most were the
fact that I needed another watch to be
able to do Fitness it couldn't just be
one watch for every yep and so I would
like google fit is the worse to start
with and so another thing that I like
about this you know this whole
coprocessors thing is the improvements
to Fitness and the fact that now OMS
will be able to tailor their own Fitness
algorithms to the watch it won't be
dictated by the Qualcomm chip and they
also what they integrated the GPS into
the chipset now or something the what
they said sensor fusion or something
that they attached the GPS now to the to
the chipset so that that's what makes it
more efficient and faster so that could
be something where I mean for you I'm a
you work out quite a bit when you run
for long periods of time I mean like you
said if you can use one watch now to do
Fitness and your regular SmartWatch
though this could be a big deal because
you know if you're running for an hour
hour and a half and then that GPS is not
getting it's not just obliterating your
entire battery life yeah you know but
the metrics that they provided were a
little bit weird and the refresh was to
just three hours for fitness no an Apple
watch will last a lot longer but did
they say that during those situations
that can go up to 15 like yeah they said
they can in the case of layers but they
were like the standard of the industry
right now is three hours for fitness
activities not the case of the Apple
watch Wow the Apple watch will last a
lot longer than that you'd do a full
marathon and still have enough juice to
get home yeah cuz I've gone cycling with
the that I usually do like an hour and a
half and I don't find it to because they
were saying
that it could deplete 50% of the battery
life in that period I mean like
continuous GPS tracking yeah yeah yeah
but it doesn't it doesn't take away
fifty percent of energy I can't wear a
watch when I do martial arts I can't
tell you sorry I didn't know that around
housing the the GPS module this is one
of my favorite things about like
Qualcomm announcements because they will
sit there up on stage and literally tell
you stuff like yeah we took the GPS
module we put it on a different place in
the DSP and they're like made the power
amplifier out of gallium arsenide this
time fully nerding out and none of this
is gonna be usable but it was close like
we moved the gps module a couple microns
closer to to this to this core component
and that is gonna result in increased
accuracy and better and more efficient
power management it's like this kind of
stuff the kind of science that goes into
this is really really compelling to
admire yeah of course like yeah we are
the 5% of them and even compared to the
95 that everyone else is just like oh
that's cool yeah and then what are the
people realize how hard that is probably
an engineering yeah right look at the
size of that thing and you ever think
moving things just a little bit is yeah
but it's just hilarious just from a
consumer perspective I've read comments
or it's like oh just 10 nanometers but
the other one is 14 it's better I'm like
this oh right sure yeah so by bringing
it back for a second to the galaxy watch
do we have any information as to what
the SOC sees architecture is and how I
know it's a smaller nanometer yes an
external processor but I think this is a
new chipset if I'm not mistaken it's the
same architecture but on actually it
can't be the same architecture but it's
not it's on a smaller nanometer process
but it's that the performance is very
similar to the older watch like the gear
s3 frontier and things like that so
informants wise but that's why it's
getting better battery life I wish we
have more of that info though cuz like
yeah but this will be direct comparison
to my understanding the first company
ever come up with the concept in mobile
for the coprocessor that handled motion
was Apple with when they AE whatever set
seven I think it was wait hold up was
that before moto at the Moto X first gen
came out with its coprocessor that
always monitored for the camera twist
action question I don't know yeah we got
a confirmation from Russell that yeah
yeah because you had they had to have
that for the voice stuff right yeah but
there was nothing before that that as
far as I know moto was the first one to
implement oh I was nodding to the Apple
did yes so but it's it's a necessary
being is that now this to our
understanding nobody has bragged about a
coprocessor handling the the light
lifting on on smartwatches I don't
wearable first I just wish we had that
info cuz I would I really want to see it
direct comparison cuz I'm excited to try
the galaxy watch because I was a fan of
the gear s3 and I want it to last more
than two days and I'd really love to see
that happen my gear history with last
two days yeah would last two days for me
I want that for five really need we
really need this is the week is what we
need yeah yeah and that's the thing I
think I said that in your video you know
Josh and I know you're with me on this
we started with smartwatches with the
pebble mhm and you could get four days
out of the pebble even if you were using
the hell out of it yep yep so that's you
have to like on have to remove that
memory once you have it do any of you
what you okay you're wearing a motive
ring so I know what the answer is to
this money but do you guys do any sleep
tracking at all yeah that's one of the
reasons where I use gallic the galaxy
watch yeah because I use sleep as
Android whether it's on the galaxy
watcher on iOS watch and has a companion
app but like it's using processing power
overnight so you're cutting more battery
life so I want that to be remedied by
these new smartwatches otherwise I'm
gonna remain a skeptic that's why I have
this this last for three weeks factors
because I mean look at these watches I
mean you if you want a really slim
design you're gonna get small battery
unless the batteries change yeah battery
tech has to change
yeah I think that's gonna be the next
revolution in everything I mean we just
need better battery tech very sorry
now you're awake well we have we we had
Russell a couple times earlier but
Savina did you want to join us yeah I'm
through I'm gonna surrender my mic for a
hot second it became a party up in here
I like it
yeah but also like we haven't we have
like really soft lighting coming through
the windows so we're like all chilled
out and you're right Danny the moment I
hit record your voice changed I'm sorry
I had to go soft and mellow for this
Danny normally I'll be a little wilder
than this Michael could you just it's
looking okay all right cool he's on card
together all right so uh why don't you
give our audience a little bit of
background with you well I run a channel
YouTube known as tech me out and on my
channel I pretty much cover a lot of
like unboxings tutorials top Android
apps top iPhone apps so guess I try to
do a little bit of everything but it's
all tech based welcome
we apologize in advance for everything
we talked about why how did you feel
about the announcements today I mean I
remember seeing you a lot at shows and
whatnot recently more recently and it's
really fun to have you good to be there
yeah how do you feel about the 3100 I
like it um I know I was telling Danny
earlier that but um I like the fact that
it does kind of merge what you would go
to a SmartWatch for and then a regular
watch so that you don't have to choose
yeah yeah because I know sometimes that
I do find myself torn based upon certain
features that I may want in that moment
and but I think the thing I'm really
excited about is the fact that it's a
little detail but big you can always see
your watch
yeah yeah that makes a huge difference
and it's like I think I've gotten so
accustomed to not being able to see it
that when they said it it was like you
know what that would be nice yeah so
this is the only thing about the Apple
watch two things about well it's not the
only there are two things that the Apple
watch does great risk detection is one
of
yes it's the watch that gets it right
every time like it could be the smallest
movement but it knows exactly that the
movement this way is not for the watch
phase like it knows which particular
movement it always works and then the
second one like seriously Fitness is
it's very accurate in terms of series
one is the worst I still tell people do
not buy it to launch the apps will still
not work that well yeah three and I'm
like you're still not gonna care about
the apps but then the watch actually
works really well it's just the ugliest
watch in the market and that's what I
was going to talk about like I know some
people have a preference towards a
circular design or a square design and I
do have a Samsung watch at home as well
so I like the design on that but it's
something about the circular design I
don't know this looks better I guess cuz
it's more like a traditional watch none
for me the materials as well like
aluminum you drop that watch on concrete
it'll look yeah horrible yeah yeah I
think they missed the mark on that
because it just the watch isn't is not
very pretty whatsoever
and I think especially for females I
think it's it's even worse because you
know like like we can put like a metal
band on it make it chunky make it look a
little better but for females is really
tough yeah I have to admit so we'll see
what I mean the new Apple watch is not
gonna really be much different honestly
I mean it's got some you know there's
rumors that they're doing a bit although
there that there's gonna be everything's
gonna be ceramic yeah the backside of
that the backs are ceramic you know yeah
they're currently ceramic anyways yeah
ever since series to the back of ceramic
but they want to do ceramic all the way
around
exactly it's how they gonna sell this
for the same price and it's a bit quite
well ceramic the here's the thing when
they came up with the Apple watch
edition I'm like why is it so much more
expensive just because it's ceramic like
sure ceramic is not gonna scratch like
stainless steel but it's not that much
more expensive that's best Apple tax
it's brittle yeah you gotta define that
it's cuz you got the addition that's why
yeah but it's not which was that one
again okay my god thousand thousand
something it's before amazed like that
one
that's expensive I will always cringe
when I hear that that number watch it is
Wow
yes yes I think the one thing that we
forgot today was where I think another
thing cool about the 3100 is that how
you can pretty much shut off the larger
processor and like if you you can always
have the watch on which is great because
it's like when is the last time I mean
I've done that plenty of times where if
your watch is dead and it's still in
your wrist it is completely a brick you
can't do anything with this a baseball
with this you can literally make the
watch you're gonna have it function as a
watch and and extend that battery life
which is I think a big you can turn off
the a 7 yes you can
yeah see that's a big deal yeah that is
a really big so now you can have a
functional watch without the rest as
charged
yeah it's fully charged until last year
30 days 30 days and it has the dual the
dual display so you can put that watch
face on there so you can yeah watch so
now that's another this-- game-changing
in the smallest ways I feel like what
everything compounds to be a big
platform I did not catch that old you
have 20% battery you can it'll it'll
give you the option to automatically
switch and the battery will last you for
a week just doesn't watch it kind of
reminds me similar to the note 9 I know
like typically when I was on my iPhone
and I'm on 20 to 30% I get nervous
because I know it's about to go down at
any moment you know but with the note I
didn't get that type of vibe like when
it hit that mark I don't know it's just
working so well to utilize my battery
life it has left so it kind of puts me
in the mindset of that especially
knowing that Qualcomm is powering that
as well as with the wire so yeah
unless you're gonna paint 2 and 20% is
like you've got three more days yeah
we're in a really great place in terms
of battery life when it comes attack
like everyone to making better try this
year and I think it started with a key
one last year one was legendary it was a
legendary blader you know what the
problem the funny part is like we went
through the briefings they sent us the
units and they never said that the
battery life was legendary yeah and it's
not until I started using the phone and
I'm like oh I'm still at 80% and it's
the end of the first day and then the
next day oh I'm still at 65% it's the
end of the second day and I'm like what
were you guys gonna tell me that this
processor was so good mm-hmm you know
well I wasn't working with but then it
started then you lose there for a while
and got laggy after the honeymoon stage
is over then you're like uh but you know
ya know what the battery life II one was
always laggy yeah
hey shut this off blackberry and I'm so
proud key to user all right and I I want
to put my key one in a glass case and
just be like I'm always gonna so two
things that are missing here hmm your
keyboard in your pop socket oh I I
didn't want to put a pop socket on here
until like what's the Caesar I was sure
that the skin because it would hold the
pop sorry I don't want the skin it
doesn't look like a JV phone I mean if
you look at every other customization
yeah I just wanted I wanted a black and
yellow phone so I Wendy brand was like
hey did you get to know nine and I was
like yeah and then at my doorstep was
every single skin though man yeah and it
gave me two of each yeah do it for me
it's hilarious how much I complained
about having the black no date and just
because it's so difficult to film and
such a large phone it's just the worst
and now that I have this blue note 9 I'm
like oh I was looking at my comparison
footage well as I was putting the review
together last night and I'm like God
that black note aid looked really cool
anyways like it looked really badass
yeah I would a hundred percent get the
black one and buy a Levin 100% yeah yeah
that would be exactly what I think but I
still think I like what I'm not buying
it yeah
yes my shoes that's all I need one is
out the blue one I like the view cuz
it's still I don't know like the fact
that it's still kind of dark like the
one to my bag over there but I have the
lavender you made the calls that you
said you were gonna make yes I did yes I
did I have two of them sorry hey what is
it lilac yeah yes yeah using it without
a case you don't care I don't care this
one's already got a crack on it oh no
what strut has been dropped my son
decided to swap this out of my hands
there's a crack in that corner right
here single hairline cracks I believe
are covered by the warranty no nice I
don't know I'll have to figure it out
but it's he you can see the bottom where
it hit right there
ooh but you know what this thing came
out hits straight concrete and did not I
mean that's test to the bill quality
didn't on the first yeah well on the
second new to unit okay no no behind me
is gonna go smash this scene with Josh
Oberg are being like it's drop test time
we need those again that is such an old
life let's go to was it at Hong Kong it
was Hong Kong a long time ago this is a
former life remember that before we had
slow-motion you slow down the regular
footage it was like remember the name of
the plug-in on After Effects but yeah
exactly
and it would look all warped out and
everything yeah those crazy yeah doing
drop tests now would be so easy cuz like
you can just use phones yeah you have
like awesome slow-motion on folks 1080
and you just build a senator Blaine
that's all
what are you dropping outside though
yeah middle of uh
Quarry Bay I think in Hong Kong yeah I
was really more people thinking when
they were seeing you do that on it's
like you I got it I got quite a few
looks and I actually that we actually
got a small crowd one time yeah and they
were just watching and they were just
like oh I can just see it now I would
say something now but I don't want you
it's always like you can just hear the
accents going crazy yeah
that moment of silence when the phone
drops anywhere yeah it's like everything
just it's not quiet for a hot second
like yeah everybody looks wrangled yes
right when they slo-mo everything the
moment that something's like falling or
dropping or whatever because that's
literally how your mind works the moment
that phone is on is what on its way down
the only thing that beats the clattering
to the ground sound is when you're on a
plane and some of their drops a phone oh
and it's just that carpet is so thin and
it just reverberates through the whole
plane and everyone's looking under their
chairs oh my god cuz there's somebody
like two seats down drop their phone and
I was like which one that I drop did I
hurt you key yeah you you we were
talking about this he came with eight no
I brought the one plus six
I brought the p20 pro the pixel to excel
the iPhone ten sadly they're creeping up
to eight bro okay now we've been talking
about the poor battery life on my iPhone
10 I'm charging it right now my battery
life on my iPhone 10 is not so bad
because I rarely use it now there was a
time when it was like my go-to phone
yeah and the biggest problem is it's I
get comments all the time they're like
why are you always using an iPhone
you're always using an iPhone and I'm
probably reviewing another phone and I'm
like cuz you guys want Instagram stories
and those are they still suck on Android
they're better but like this phone
particularly will halt its will crawl
the moment that you're using social
media for some stupid I think it's a bug
within within this phone
my Instagram yeah yeah and also of you
if you still have seen detection active
on the phone it'll take like a split
second but it'll pause like the
viewfinder yeah for some stupid reason
in the case of the note 9 and so that's
the problem like if we want to do social
media we sadly you have to carry a damn
iPhone if we want to do QA
you remember when when you wanted to do
responses on your Q&amp;amp;A and video oh poor
my do stories yeah I was like how do you
get that picture in the background of
your answers for the for the questions
on IG stories and she's like I'm on an
iPhone I was using just one plus 6 and I
was like I'm actually using the
Instagram beta and even they're still
not features not they're so annoying you
see and that's the thing man
I mean at least iPhone you I give them
that social media always runs better but
you know I I don't think it's it's
iPhone per se I think it's developer
developers developers just want to
support iPhones because how many SKUs do
they have to support like how many is
not as hard it's not as difficult for
its lazy developers no but I mean you
were like on pixel and stuff I mean it
should be a lot better you know like
things coming up visual corpse you know
that support and all that should help no
like they did the change like in the
past Instagram for example was literally
a screenshot of the screen yeah exactly
it wasn't real like it was not on the
camera itself Wow no but that's what
visual court a when they gave it that
access now it's coming from the camera
instead of the screenshot stuffs that's
why snapchat sucks so bad on Android
yeah it's horrible
yeah it's never good
where are your specs by the way I'm okay
that's deaf or HOH little people care
about snapchat knows well though yeah
nobody talks about spectacles they were
like mortifying yes better looking once
yes oh you don't look like such a douche
when you're out there exactly
cuz you do have that little bit of that
factor whenever we're just imagine you
running up to somebody
those are my comments on my note 9
review oh he's like great video bulldog
face and like so the internet is just
cruel like ii so it's so you're better
looking at me you should see the guy's
face it's like I love that this turned
into like the trials and tribulations of
the influencer because these are the
only times that we all really gets it
again we talked about 3100 for like 10
minutes yeah you can - except the turn
influencer Michael he has disowned us I
couldn't find a better word I just hate
that like media content producer like
okay cool but that's all I can really
what the funny part is that I was in
Berlin on the Metro and there was this
probably 16 - say I'm gonna bring it
back to smartwatches soon there was this
16 - 17 year-old girl just standing you
know she was heading somewhere she her
makeup and everything clearly pointed
out to somebody that was like into a lot
of whatever music or whatever and her ID
said influencer and so I'm like what are
the boundaries of the term influencer
right it is super generalized and
actually I'm not a huge fan of it either
honestly but so what do you like to
refer to yourself as well I mean we just
use Danny
we're just sayin but I mean Indiana and
I create content I just feel like it's
just creating yeah it's just a big
generalized thing but that's what we are
we create content I mean yeah yeah but
the thing is that the creator yeah
you're an influencer by the trade that
you do because you are you know people
follow you people see what you do and
then if you like something then you know
somebody else might like it too so maybe
I can see where the term comes from
influencer but I just don't think it's
the right term I remember hearing one
time I got called it one time to you a
thought leader where's that makes it
sound like I'm with the wrong crowd I
thought yes I'm saying she said thought
leader are you saying th ot no dude
that's a joke I'm making it when someone
calls you that I feel like I'm running
with the wrong crowds oh and thought
isn't your an opinion leader
folly which is a really weird term as
well influencer now exactly were there
all right well when it comes to the
smartwatches I'm one thing that really
stood out to me during the presentation
was that they weren't just talking they
were talking about smartwatches in
particular but there were other
categories that they alluded to that
they were going to be developing for I
got excited when he said contacts
because I really want that so once I
still don't have the new app techs
capable headphones it's either that or
it's some new Bluetooth protocol but it
was something where that so you know
that the way they work right now is one
headphone is piggybacking on the yeah
okay so the new technology will allow
each headphone to independently connect
yes yeah and therefore because one is
not in that pic one discharges more than
the other and therefore the that's the
reason why battery life on these are so
little apparently that'll up to double
the battery life on really looking
forward to that for sure
this is qualcomm man like I ever since
we did that tour you weren't in that era
were you in the frozen dude I was like
from what they're building in drones
yeah obviously what they're doing a
mobility I like for me augmented reality
is like whatever but they're there
they're there working on everything but
they are pretty much doing a lot of
stuff that other people don't know about
like you don't really notice it like
when we went on the tour that was a
thing is you realize how much technology
that Qualcomm has been a part of yeah
and it's actually mind-blowing to know
that there's a lot of the stuff that
wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for a
Qualcomm this is pretty nuts that's
what's really smart by Snapdragon thing
like yeah needs to be dense we pushed
more inside I just feel like that they
haven't pushed themselves forward to
tell the history of this company because
the company is so heavily invested in
the old cell phone technologies and
everything else that came to be so you
hear and you're like well how come this
is the first time I'm hearing about it
while I was a story not out there
I was amazed and then when I thought
about it and it's little things like
you'll see powered by Qualcomm or
Qualcomm or just something on the device
in which you're using but you're so
caught up in the device you really don't
pay attention to the little things like
that like what's helping this be what it
is as great as it is yeah
younger dog I see it as typically not as
the funny part it's yes you know some
companies it's like it's like LG and
their smartphones like they're they
don't do a great job at marketing their
smart phones and their great phones you
know it's some companies are like that
yeah so what yeah yeah I was gonna say
maybe they're not the greatest phones
but I'm not saying that it's like
there's nothing perfect per se you know
but they do have good phones but they're
completely I feel like every year that's
LG's talk we're always like okay the
most underrated phone this year is and
it'll be like the G Series or the V
Series it's always it's always
underrated because they don't push their
smart phones enough and they're always
really crappy with timing for some
reason yeah they're always falling
behind other people's releases and just
people just don't seem to care about
those phones I mean that that's the
reason why people like us like we have
to make sure that we are thought leaders
and Michael Fisher carries around the g7
for that wide-angle all day so we know
about that which is probably the most
practical secondary lens that there is
no so for everybody looking for the what
is the underrated influencer that would
be mr. Michael Fisher are you from the
couch so okay we talked about how smart
watches you you you had a thought about
I don't want to say that word anymore
now that we made the joke you had an
opinion that the circular design of a
SmartWatch is a lot more desirable and I
and I agree with you with that um but I
remember making the argument back in the
day that I wish smartwatches would just
go radical just go for something crazy
and wasn't there something in the add
the new be alpha well that's one and
there
something like that insult the newbie
alpha because according to them it's not
a smart watch what is this supposed to
be you get you get the same thing
Michael
Michael you should talk about it cuz you
really only oh yeah watch both of you
guys video about that are you talking
about the new V alpha the wearable
smartphone the wearable smartphone are
you gonna like not gonna work yeah well
here's the thing it's it's an
interesting use of a flexible OLED
display that wraps around your entire
wrist yeah it would be a lot more
interesting if it didn't look like you
they had to saw an Apple watch in half
and put it on either side of it to make
it work but yeah you've got to have some
somewhere to put the camera and the
buttons and stuff I get that but it's
it's just so so much reference design
and so not likely to be a consumer
product even though they're saying
holiday 2018 dude and the thing about it
was just the the conversation with them
was like no this is not a SmartWatch
it's a smartphone it's a wearable
smartphone according to them and so I'm
like okay okay good and and what's the
timing what are the thoughts on this
concept like what the plan that they're
like this is not a concept this is a
product sure and fine you can get away
with saying that but not at the same
trade show where like every time I think
about maybe reaching out to touch it you
have like you know a dude ready to
tackle me it's not ready in any sense of
the word in the South Hall of CES right
yeah they only had two on site that I
saw there that's ray two on this okay
and then they had a third one but it was
it was
no you couldn't show the first of all
everything that was on the display was a
demo you couldn't touch it you couldn't
even touch the hardware I was like okay
so that and I was like is that tainless
steel and they're like they don't know
right and aluminum they don't know what
version of Android is this we're not
saying what silicon does it run on we're
not saying it is like okay we're gonna
launch this in the next three months and
it does and that's actually the last
point I wanted to make like the only
reason that I stuck around and did a
video on it was because it is from Nubia
and they've been around a long time you
know they were a part of ZTE and they
were spun off and they've made some cool
stuff they've got that gaming phone
they're like there they started the
squeeze feature
edge thing with the almost bezel list
display on one of their phones and it
was like this brick it was it was made
to be squeezed where if you squeezed it
with light squeeze they made it so that
it would be able to detect how many
fingers are on one side so so clearly
your thumbs on one side but if you were
to squeeze it with like two fingers on
the other side it would be one function
three four yeah yeah the edge was able
to detect how many points of pressure
were being applied Oh which Microsoft
was doing that on the canceled McLaren
on one of their windows phones that oh
my it's like one of my first mr. mobile
videos you know did one as well but ya
know like it was that was such such cool
stuff and I am NOT surprised at all that
it found its way into a into a Nubia
yeah this was a long time ago too
it was like my first Aoife or something
like that but the thing is like I just
want to see more of those designs just
appear like one of my dreams like being
the guy who uses something on an ad-hoc
basis like I just want this to be a easy
to use Notification Center you know what
this does I I said this on the cast last
week I haven't set up so that the the
app on the phone only sends
notifications based upon a string of
search terms and that one search term I
put in there is my girlfriend's name so
one might win it on the gear no no on
the me BAM so whenever any notification
comes in in the word ISA isn't that
notification
this vibrates Wow no my god my
girlfriend wants to talk to me so like
that's what I want I want that level of
customization but would be great if we
could just get like you know those slap
bands remember those yeah yeah yeah why
can't that be just like an ePaper
display and just boom and it just turns
into like a notification thing that's
that should be all it is it's because
it's too simple and that's the problem
is simple sometimes is the key yeah
manufactures don't want to make
something simple they want to make
things everything absolutely but see
that's the problem when you have
engineers coming up with the names of
the products or the functionality
because they could come up with a lot of
things the question is what exactly is
it that you're gonna use or not what do
you find you like yourselves using the
most for your SmartWatch what is like
your go-to things Fitness Fitness is not
there like I have a box like one of
those watch cases I have one of those
full of smartwatches and I will either
drift or a gears 3 yeah which is now
this galaxy watch or an Apple watch
that's all I'm gonna use because for me
I I hate the whole idea of I woke up in
the morning and I have no sleep tracking
because on on where OS it's terrible
unless you use that particular app and
it's not even that great and so and then
you go train but then you're going with
another watch and that one is not
connected to the same ecosystem and then
you go a go downtown for example
probably for a shoot I made all these
steps and all that informations not
there and so for me it has to be like if
I start my day I want to start my day
with one watch yeah and ended with that
watch and so that for me that's Fitness
is key and those are the only two
watches and if I had to pick between
both of them like the Apple watch wins
by a long shot
yeah not the best execution like for
example things that upset me about the
Apple watches if there are no if they're
trying to force developers to create an
app for their for the watch and so if
you don't have an app the notifications
are very limited and interaction and so
that for me on its own is like oh it's
it's it's frustrating further not to be
consistency which is one thing that I
like about
where OS where every every notification
is the same things I like about where OS
versus other things that I like about
watch OS are funny
I hate Apple Maps but turn by turn out
but walking directions walking
navigation is better on the Apple watch
it's it's hilarious when when Google
when Android wear well where OS would be
like head Northwest to this and then I'm
like do you really think that I'll be
popping out a watch if I know exactly
where Northwest is I that's the reason
why I don't know where I am you know I
don't I don't there's not a compass for
me to know where Northwest is and so the
one thing that I like about the Apple
watches is gonna be like head left turn
right it's very discreet too so like say
for instance we're in San Francisco I
don't want people to know that maybe I
don't know where I'm at I can feel it
vibrate it's like and it does it
constant like you're gonna be turning
soon and so that you know discreetly
that you're going to be turning that's
another thing yeah and you just did the
the motion of I use this because it has
a very strong vibration motor mm-hmm and
in subtle it's not too hard but it's
definitely enough to get such a problem
waking up in the morning I almost got
that shock bracelet okay I just I I
agree and like I love the Michaels
review of the first Apple watch now
Michael this whole perspective of yeah
you have the the rotating crown but then
you have to interact with the display
instead of interacting with the button
like who came up with that design of the
user interface so you don't like
spinning no so spin it but then have
that that be a button not that you have
to spend the rotating crown and the
intentional straightener that's
counterintuitive and the same thing with
the GATT with the Galaxy watch where you
you rotate the bezel but then you can't
press the bezel or something like that
so if you remember blackberries when
they had that that the wheel it was
you would rotate the wheel and then
select with that not channelling sure
that easily just make that rotating
thing touch-sensitive so you can rotate
it and just tap it
I'd like a tick watch the first tick
watch did you ever use the tick watch
one and - the first one - no this is the
first time I've ever oh that those were
awesome because you start to interact
with the with the screen and that will
always be a pain point for me when it
comes to smartwatches cuz if I'm gonna
spend that much time going like this I
might so just take out my damn phone
yeah that's something I've always hated
about smartwatches personally but the
tick watch had this little like touch
sensor very on the side so you could
just be you should just go like that
on though and it doesn't roll it was
kind of nice they called it the tickle
did you ever accidentally did you ever
accidentally trigger that no never
actually it wasn't neat it was just high
enough on the body that your wrist
wouldn't like cause it to happen but you
had to deliberately go like this okay it
was kind of nice and and just just
little things like that just make me
happy
when it comes to smartwatches and we
don't get enough of that like the last
thing was this and the secondary screen
take watch pro this is the last
innovation so if something like this
will feed even better innovation from
these smartwatches because they can be
used more often yeah then I want that to
be the case yeah for me I ever since the
first pebble which was my first
SmartWatch I can't go back to a regular
watch yeah but again for me honestly I'm
still frustrated with the way
notifications are portrayed I feel even
that that first pebble that first user
interface was for me the best one when
it came to notifications it hasn't been
replicated even you know now with Fitbit
it's not the same yeah I don't like it
and so I missed that from the pebble
like for me it's not just that it was my
first watch is that it did everything
that was essential right actually I'm
pretty excited we talked about the new
wear OS earlier in the show and I'm
actually rather excited to see what
happens with this new generation of
watches because I think manufacturers if
fossil is any indication manufacturers
have finally woken up to the desire I'm
the part of a lot of users to have a
rotating side button and that really
does I mean I like that better than
anything else now you know we were
willing to use that G watch man did with
the LG watch sport I wish
because for a while it was the only
thing I could you could have with as big
as that watch was the RSB was like a
soup can sticking out the side of it
unless you get such an easy grip on it
you always knew where it was and so like
I would just fly through my messages or
it flies through the feed and like
you're not getting your finger in the
way of the display it's like it's always
fast its responsive and it's cool and
that paired with you know all the
optimizations we're talking about now
has me much more excited for this coming
generation of where OS watches because I
think they're going to be more usable
and more useful than ever no and I like
how much they paid attention to luxury
brands where it's like yeah if it's a
boy or if it's a Mont Blanc if it's
whatever watch it is and people can't
see the watch face all they see is blank
yeah that totally takes away from the
experience like yeah the watch faces
everything it's what makes a watch stand
apart the most in a regular watch are
those that do like labels but want a
SmartWatch that kind of appeals more to
fashion yeah such as I'm interested to
see where they create with Louie Vuitton
like I don't think they've ever had a
SmartWatch happy they have okay so I
hadn't seen it but I think it's
interesting that you know I'm not a bad
person when it comes with this kind of
stuff I'm not either but there are
people that Danny like you know what
brand would you want to see something so
cuz you ever think if you go out and buy
like a Rolex right it's still a Rolex
five years and it'll be a Rowland
forever my dad has had a Rolex for
thirty years but if you spend $2,000
like on a Louis Vuitton SmartWatch what
is that gonna be in two years no it's
gonna be a nothing I wonder if that's
one of the many reasons why because they
didn't make significant changes to the
processor and stuff I mean they were
like connectivity is great this is like
there was nothing to update that for me
was a weird argument you know I don't
know if it's because they don't want to
make what's already out there obsolete
so quickly or what maybe because I mean
I was laughing about that the gentleman
I forget his name who was giving the
presentation I love smart watches I have
a hundred of them yeah and I was just
like and you're about to make all of
them
silly lay right now your your job is to
make all of them irrelevant but that's
the thing let's let's be let's be honest
were they great nothing they all can
admit that they haven't been that great
like we talked about it like smart smart
watches em is stagnant for years now
literally this this is that's why I
think this chipset is such a big deal
yes it is going to reinvigorate this
entire SmartWatch industry again because
I mean there was no reason to make smart
watches I think in the last year so
we're and are you uh gunning for them I
don't know I think I kind of agree with
the generalized thing the fossil group
will probably make the best range of
watches that are affordable I think but
there's also other brands that are out
there that really the fashion brands
won't you should please think and
recreate that magic of the first one
over sixty sixty continues to be even
with the time you know knowledge of all
time yeah and please stop complaining
about the damn flat tire no but even
with that I think there was there was a
charm to that watch still yeah I don't
know what it was like the screen was so
in-your-face yeah I don't know what it
was because there was nothing else it
was it was the audio right like it
assigned to I think design was key on
that one yeah it looked really good you
ever use the falster the Skagen foster I
have not it's like I do not write any of
our watches and they let me see it an
ephah yeah the thing is the foster two
was an outside Aoife just ahead of was
thinking why did they even release these
watches without the new chipset that is
that's actually mind-blowing especially
if they're partners and why would they
release this and not wait for the 3100
which they already knew about obviously
if they are partners why why do you know
are you confirming that Michael yeah
well now that now that the 3100 is
finally dropped this would be the time
for Casio to drop a press release saying
oh yeah by the way that watch we
announced has a 3100 in it yeah that's a
good idea now wait a second but it's
Casio why are you expecting that you you
dog in my castle
dogging him do you know what processor
was on the first pro tect pro pro
whatever the first pro track
yeah was probably the snap four hundred
exactly it's probably the they never
told anybody what it was oh oh they said
these Casio just hasn't released it same
never what silicones powering and never
do oh but you can just download you can
put on um you know like Z CPU or
whatever what are you use to find out
the hardware and Android devices like
wrong eight a sixty-four CPU Z thank you
yeah I don't know so we should I don't
know I don't have the authority to
actually has a thirty one hundred in it
they get somebody on the phone from
Casio right now call them who cares
call them right now I'll put my money
down on a foster to especially if it
have it yeah I could agree yeah that bad
the foster and the Skagen and all that
so I would pretty much go for that but
is exciting though to have another wave
of smartwatches at least Nicola made of
watch I mean I think this opens up for a
lot other manufacturers that aren't the
typical Android where you know smart
watchmakers yeah I think they'll come
into the game now because of the fact
that I think they can do something
unique
without yeah just like the whole sort of
brand thing who's missing
Samsung making another we're always
watch affair yeah I'm so you gonna have
a lot of people come in and in a sports
brands now like they said the unnamed
sports brand is supposed to make a watch
you know with all these new sports
features and I think that's that's great
that if if if GPS and sports and
tracking can be better and just like I'm
a was saying if you can finally now use
a where OS watch that does everything
yeah that kind of changes the game and
puts pressure on Apple to make even a
better part than what they have find out
cuz I'm even concerned like I've been
using a poll around six hundred for
training in some cases it's probably my
favorite where OS watch and I'm like I I
don't learn until now that the out that
polar could not tinker the algorithm for
the fitness part so I'm like was this
really a polar watch or not whereas now
with these changes every OEM was going
to be able to do their own stuff their
own algorithms everything you had
you think more clothing brands might
enter into it now especially with their
approach to try to get the fashionistas
and everything like that do you think
that's why I was saying Adidas because I
think adidas would be perfect for this
type of watching because they've never
done wearables I was thinking more Under
Armour no one I get it I know that they
haven't done it before but that's what
I'm thinking that they might somebody
like adidas might enter this market
because like you said that you know this
if SmartWatch has become hot again
especially in the Millennials and that
kind of thing where shoes and like you
know sneakers now and like this dis
fashion thing is really popping off
right now this could be really huge for
somebody like Adidas to come into makes
make some different brands you have to
think like okay well what if like you
know like Kanye gets into a SmartWatch
or like that's partnered with adidas or
Drake or like what whoever that's out
there that could be a big deal I think
well I think we've thoroughly exhausted
the you know I was wondering how far we
would get with smartwatches for a
one-hour podcast and then 20 minutes in
the middle we're about influencers it's
just a great time to be able to hang out
