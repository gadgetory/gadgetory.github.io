if you're on AT&amp;amp;T and you want an
android 3g phone you don't have many
options you have the motorola backflip
which is the only android device that
eighteen t cells right now but in our
tests it's not a good device it's slow
its buggy the hardware is kind of weird
kind of analogy with that weird
backflipping keyboard you also could
choose the sony ericsson xperia x10
which is not for sale yet it's going to
be for sale very soon but people have
complained that the interface is slow
and it's also going to be very expensive
you can also get the acer liquid which
has the eighteen t 3g bands and runs
android but it's running an older
version of android and also it's made by
acer so the hardware is low quality and
finally you have the google nexus one
which just recently came out in the AT&amp;amp;T
3g flavor i know this phone has been out
for a long time i know it's been talked
about i know we talked about it back
when the t-mobile 3g version came out in
january but I figure hey it's a chance
for another unboxing so let's do it
here's the unboxing for the 18 t3g nexus
one let's do it alright i'm probably
going to experience some vision here but
hey again it's a chance for another
unboxing now this device is particularly
important to me because i'm going to be
using it as my daily driver probably
until the next wave of phones come out
later in the summer and one of the
greatest things about the google nexus
one is that it's got a extremely robust
development community around that you
can go to XDA developers you can swap
roms you can put the HTC desire rom on
this and get the sense interface which i
just i think is great so here it is
nexus one again we've seen this before
but let's uh let's unbox it again so it
opens up i think like so no specs on the
back strange i don't think the original
nexus one left the the back totally
blank perhaps they're using the same box
for all models so that they don't have
to print many different models for the
t-mobile version the AT&amp;amp;T version and
coming up
verizon version so here's the good old
nexus one super thin device one of the
thinnest if not the thinnest Android
device they make let's take a look at
the included accessories Google gives
you a case of course got the android
logo it's not made out of leather just
basic materials some instructions
warranty statements headphones and then
we've got the battery which is the same
battery as found in the HTC Desire which
we recently reviewed on pocketnow.com so
it's a 1400 milliamp hour battery the
battery life on the Nexus One and the
desire in most cases and then our test
is quite good and of course we've got
some headphones so let's let's see the
desire mmm so the nexus one is going to
look exactly the same as the nexus one
on t-mobile they're all the same they
just have slightly different internals
to have the UMTS 850 and 1900 megahertz
band which will let you get 3g on AT&amp;amp;T
which is really what we're after here so
there aren't going to be many follow-up
post to this particular unboxing but be
sure to check out pocketnow.com or we're
always talking about the latest and
Android and Windows Mobile and other
smartphone hardware and software hope
you like the unboxing that's it for now
and for the moment of truth to make sure
double check that we're going to indeed
get 3g over 80 here going to slide this
in an tada we have 3g but do a little
speed test here ok so pretty good not
amazing i'm going to test it again 850
kilobits per second i'm looking for
something above one looks like we've got
an error of here so i'll test us further
not report back on exactly how fast the
the 3g comes through here on the nexus
one made for AT&amp;amp;T</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
