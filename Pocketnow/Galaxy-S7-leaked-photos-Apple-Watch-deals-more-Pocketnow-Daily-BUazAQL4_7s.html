what the final design might look like
major discounts reach the Apple watch
ahead of a refresh and it seems that
Instagram finally woke up and smelled
the coffee about some features I'm hi
Mary vana and as Joe Levi would always
say it's a great time to be alive
yesterday I was at the tropics today I'm
freezing my behind off in New York this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with the Apple watch those
of you interested in getting Cupertino's
only SmartWatch well apparently there
are some discounts starting today and
target as much as a hundred dollars off
and select variants which is a lot of
money compared to every other Apple
product but then you have to remember
what they were in the fact that probably
by March which is a month from now
you'll be getting another Apple watch it
seems now a company that just woke up
and smell the coffee about features is
definitely Instagram or should we say
Facebook which is its parent company as
of the day you get a new feature which
finally allows you to have multiple
accounts and if you're asking yourself
why would you want that I know it's none
of you hate to see running photos on my
feed so I could actually create a
separate account that just has to do
with running and that's actually cool a
lot of people actually do have separate
accounts because of their different
hobbies makes a lot of sense hopefully
it'll reach your devices soon and
speaking of changes one of those that we
are extremely skeptical about is the
future Moto X mainly because now lenovo
has decided to kill Motorola for what it
was and even though there is the
probability that this might actually get
better than worse well we do have some
leaks today in photos that show was that
Lenovo was already working on the new
design of the Moto X if you're weren't
exactly of what we're getting it seems
that we're getting something very
similar to their current Moto X at least
from the backs that we see obviously we
are still far from a probable launch so
stay tuned as we learn more and speaking
of changes those of you the thought that
nothing would change on the Galaxy s7 it
seems that there are some software
improvements particularly with and
always on display Samsung pretty much
invented hemel the technology and is the
only company doesn't necessarily take
advantage of it with an always-on
display and apparently that is going to
be the case the Galaxy s7 will innovate
with this feature and hopefully
figures out a way to optimize that with
its processor and everything in a way
that it actually remains always on but
let's see and finally the very hot news
that they have to do again with the
galaxy s7 and mainly with changes as
even though we thought that nothing was
going to change in the design we do see
some leaked photos so that it show as
the curve back and in addition to that a
very different type of camera hump we
did know that the camera hump was going
to get slimmer but apparently the design
is also going to change and that's
because there's an added feature and
that bonus as apparently it is getting F
1.7 aperture which is crazy it goes from
1.9 to 1.7 ditching what the LG g4 did
which is great news but obviously we
can't wait to test it out whenever we
get a chance to do so and it leads me to
the question of the day do you care
about specification like that on a
smartphone camera when you buy at the
you know the lens of 1.7 of 1.8 or you
just really want the phone to take good
photos and that's all you care about in
my case I'll say that I just care about
the phone taking good photos but leave
us a comment down below we can't wait to
hear your opinion friends as always you
