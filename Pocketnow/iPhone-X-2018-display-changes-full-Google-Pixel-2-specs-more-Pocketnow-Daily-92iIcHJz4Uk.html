the bezel even if you get an LCD variant
leaks of the ztx on em show us that the
Kyocera echo might be making a comeback
and we finally get dates and a price tag
for the LGV 30 I'm Jaime Rivera and the
only way that I could get this video up
on time was actually pre recording this
is parking out daily the official news
today began with an announcement that
many of us were waiting for for those of
you wondering about the LGV 30 which is
so far one of our favorite phones and
we're still using prototypes October 5th
pre-orders on t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T and then
deliveries apparently will be somewhere
around the 11th or 13th you can learn
one of the description most important
the price tag if you do the numbers sum
it all up apparently it's going to be
between eight hundred eight hundred and
ten dollars which is significantly below
other phablets and you're getting a ton
of phone here probably one of our
favorite cameras for those of you that
got yourself the Apple watch Series
three with the whole idea of downloading
Apple music on your watch and then
notice when the watch arrived that it
didn't really work
watch OS 4.1 is going to address that
there is already a beta available it's
already being tested and it's showing
that the service actually works only the
battery life is terrible because it's
still in beta well keep you posted as
soon as the official release arrives and
we get more details on the possible
specifications on the future of Google
pixels most important variants in
storage 64 128 gigs those of you
wondering yes IP 67 is finally reaching
both devices and one of the most
interesting things is that apparently
the active edge whatever thing that's
going to come is not just coming for the
smaller Google pixel apparently it's
coming for both even though the curved
display is only coming to the larger
variant you can see the spec sheet in
the description as well now let's talk
about the ZTE axon M we've got some
leaked photographs that show us the
revival of the Kyocera eco which was the
whole idea of having a phablet or should
I say it's a tablet no wait it's
actually a smartphone that you can open
and turn into a tablet it's dual
displays that connect together back then
one of the things that we hated the most
about the echo wasn't the idea the
problem was the implementation Android
just wasn't ready for something like
this and obviously it's been year since
then
I can't wait to see what ziti comes up
whether this is true and finally the
very hot rumors today have to do with
the iPhones of next year again we're
already talking about them we hear that
yes the Japan display option is going to
happen but for those of you that we're
wondering if that's going to make the
regular size bezel prone iPhone
apparently it's not seems that Apple is
going to kill the bezels next year and
it's the reason why it's making the jump
to Japan display because it wants to
remove bezels across the board and just
give you an option for LCD or OLED and
we wonder exactly what the tears are
going to be here but regardless it
leaves it to the question today let us
know what do you think do you think that
bezel should truly die in smartphones
that company should figure it out just
the way Apple is trying to and other
companies like essential are in my case
I do feel that it's the way to go we
want more display and less phones to
handle but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
