and we're going to do a quick preview of
a new xbox live game for this phone
let's check it out this week's xbox live
game for windows phone it's called
dodonpachi maximum and it's a vertical
scrolling shooter game let's check it
out right now apparently has to boot up
and let's just go straight into it
choose your battleship and we're going
to go with that one here's your levels
it's kind of the first one and you just
gotta shoot the enemy spaceships while
voting avoiding their bullets
there's a lot of stuff going on
have some interesting graphics here
though Oh
so we get three lives per level and
here's the boss at the end of the first
level
oh I didn't get it so there we can just
start right over again but let's look at
the other options there's the story
where you get some little notes kind of
introducing you to the game just how to
play tells you about the two finger
laser bomb that's how you move it so you
press two fingers and that'll kill
everything on the screen and making this
bowl for a little while you also have
play data credits of course settings is
just for the sound and you can erase
your data leaderboards I'm number one
and achievements of course there are
plenty will give you a two hundred
gamerscore increase so that's a quick
look at dodonpachi maximum it's a seems
like an average vertical scrolling
shooting spaceship game but there's a
lot going on and graphics is very quick
so you might like it and it's pretty
cool so that's it for now give us a
thumbs up like this video and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
