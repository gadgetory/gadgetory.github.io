in the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 the
difference is substantial Microsoft
decides to make it easy to keep
upgrading your surface and Google's
former head of social claims at iPhones
take better photos than Android I'm high
metal ivenna and this is going to be a
crazy schedule as I will be traveling
tomorrow so I have to figure this one
out this is parking out daily the
official news today I have to do with a
new program called Microsoft Surface
plus the whole idea here is that it's
actually financing for up to 24 months
for a new surface but the cool part is
that if you want to upgrade your surface
you could actually do so after 18 months
to the latest and greatest version of
whatever device you picked you can learn
more about the program in the
description I actually find that very
compelling now let's talk about the Moto
z2 force and something we actually
discovered exclusively if you remember
in the past that shadow shell display
that you had on previous force devices
that could be replaced you could
actually pay for the replacement of the
screen mainly because it was easy to
scratch the biggest problem is that
we've just discovered that you can't do
that anymore actually Motorola is
telling us that number one it's too
expensive to replace and there were too
few cases for it to be economically
feasible and number two they're
recommending you buy a screen protector
buy a screen protector for a display
that's not supposed to be easily
breakable and you're not supposed to
scratch anyways anyways you can learn
more in the description and speaking
about weird news if you haven't noticed
blue phones have been banned from Amazon
and one of the main reasons is due to
privacy concerns apparently these phones
are collecting data and it's not
supposed to be as much as it is the
promise the Blues already addressed
complaints about this months ago and
according to the company the rules for
whatever privacy it should be able to
collect or not haven't really changed so
it doesn't make any sense over why this
is happening but yeah if you're trying
to buy yourself a very affordable and
looking blue device you can't do it on
Amazon just yet we'll keep you posted as
soon as we learn more now the spotlight
over to the comparison of comparisons
obviously whatever the iPhone 8 and the
Galaxy Note 8 go live we will definitely
have a comparison for you but we've got
one leak today where we see the possible
display of the iPhone 8 compared to the
possible display of the Galaxy Note 8
and yes the note 8 is a behemoth
compared to the iPhone 8 you have to
remember the iPhone 8 is supposedly 5.8
inches diagonal but obviously on a
smaller frame and chassis no bezels and
we do have some minor bezels on the note
8 compared to the iPhone so if this were
the case even though the note days
supposedly 6.3 inches diagonal obviously
those bezels make it a little taller
than it should compared to the iPhone 8
still it doesn't really matter both
phones are gonna be beautiful we just
can't wait for these rumors to actually
be true and finally the very interesting
news today have to do with a topic I
usually don't leave for the hottest news
but this is just good debate you
remember victim Till Troy he used to be
the head of Google+ we know it failed we
know that that's probably one of the
reasons why he's no longer in Google but
the funny part is that recently on his
Facebook he posted that it's amazing how
I phones are able to take amazing photos
that he no longer needs a DSLR because
of the whole portrait mode you can take
gorgeous photography with the iPhone and
he went up to the point of claiming that
there are so many reasons why iPhones
take better photos than Android it's not
necessarily that there isn't innovation
in the case of Android but because
Google becomes this huge hurdle where
only aims have to be convincing Google
of allowing new innovations and that
this could push innovation up to two
years you know what the funny part is
that I don't agree with it like I've
been using Android phones for
photography evidence the LG g4 because I
felt that there was a major boost there
are cases like the Google pixel where I
don't even know how that phone is
capable of taking such amazing
photography but anyways it leads me to
the question today I mean do you agree
with Vic do you believe that iPhones
take better photos than Android devices
again in my case I don't believe is it
