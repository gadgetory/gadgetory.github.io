and Barcelona same booth
lots of people hanging behind the camera
and I have the guava Essen g6 4G with me
which is the brand new phone announced
today and you will see some of its
details after this short intro so we
just managed to score a p6 the white one
is the S&amp;amp;P six the black one is the
brand new g6 just in order to show you
the design similarities between the two
and while the p6 is somewhat thinner and
we're not talking millimeters protecting
the below one millimeter you will see
the signature curved part down here
which the p6 lens to the g6 of course
the p6 is last year's phone and the g6
here is the phone we're looking at right
now we're not having flagship 4c
specifications we have a 4.5 inch screen
which has qHD resolution that's 540 by
960 and while we're on the front we'll
see the 5 megapixel camera and turning
it to the back there's an 8 megapixel
sensor with a backside illuminated
sensor in the visual system now this is
aluminum and the current version we are
looking at has a gold brownish tint to
it but it will be available in many many
more versions when it comes to the
market the usual volume buttons up and
down power button nothing fancy you got
a microphone right there well you have
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the
other side and the microUSB port at the
top powering everything is a quad-core
processor a Qualcomm Snapdragon clocking
at 1.2 gigahertz I guess
and one gigabyte a friend doubled by 8
gigabytes of internal storage which is
expandable via microSD in terms of
operating system I'm guessing this is
also running 4.2.2 which is actually 4.3
and you can take a look at the other
specifications right here but of course
guavas own emotion UI on top of it more
camera features like self beautification
and panorama shot but we know that from
the s and made for G that was a quick
look at the ascend g64 gene thank you
very much it is really hot here Hana
behind the camera
I've been Anton and you've been watching
pocket now stay tuned for more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
