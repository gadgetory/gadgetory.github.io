pocket now calm and this is part three
of the video review of the samsung SGH I
620 also known as the Black Jack slider
today we're going to talk about software
this is the today's screen that comes on
the device it's made by samsung and it
has several tabs along the bottom so I'm
going to start at the first one which is
email right there on the left and you
can access your your SMS MMS or email
from the screen if we click to the right
we can access our calendar we can see
the upcoming appointments though if you
click on one of these items it doesn't
take you to that appointment it just
takes you to the calendar it should
actually take you to the appointment but
it doesn't to the right of that we have
the media player if you have a microSD
card inserted to the right of that is
alarms and to the right of that is call
history it'll show you missed calls
there I kind of like this this today's
screen I don't like how you have to
click so much to see the different
things I rather it all be listed right
here on the today screen without having
to actually do anything on the device
there's a task manager built into this
phone and you can access it by pressing
and holding the home button and here it
is it shows you the programs that are
currently open and the the amount of
memory that's being taken up and from
there you can stop all of them you can
stop just one of them or two of them so
that's a good addition let's go to the
Start menu this is all you get not much
we can go over to entertainment and here
we have the standard bubble breaker
solitaire camera application the camera
is pretty good on this it's a 1600 x
1200 that's 2 megapixels going to click
back my files is just a file explorer
internet services we have windows live
messenger windows live and RSS reader
and they actually give you a full
version of opera which is good because
usually opera costs about twenty-five
dollars opera is an improvement over
pocket internet explorer not a huge
improvement but it's good that they
included on this device so i'm going to
go back to the start menu here and then
we can go into applications
and we have file manager standard things
we can go into accessories there you'll
find you know calculator internet
sharing wizard standard things the task
manager also shows up there we can go
into document viewer this doesn't come
with office mobile but it comes with
clear view suite which will let you view
powerpoint presentations Excel
spreadsheets PDFs and word documents so
you're covered there and then over at
organizer we have voice notes alarms
again standard stuff so there's not much
software that comes on the I 620 as you
would expect if you got it from a
carrier when it comes with the basics
the essentials and that's really all you
need especially if you if you buy
third-party software which hopefully you
do it's a lot of good stuff out there so
that's part 3 of the video review of the
I 620</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
