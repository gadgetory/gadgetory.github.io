pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
closer look on the software on the
motorola photon 4g for sprint so sit
back relax and enjoy the show so the
motorola photon 4g is running android
version 2.3 point for Gingerbread and it
has been updated to the most recent
update that just came out for the photon
recently we go up here to display we can
see another kind of a new interesting
feature in pocket detection is a kind of
a neat functionality when you put the
device in your pocket if the screen is
on it will automatically turn off if you
have this enabled and the kickstand
enable allows you to turn on a new mode
when you kick the kickstand out which
will show you in just a second here so
I've got the kick and send out now and
you see here I've got a couple of
options and I didn't set it remembers my
selection yet because I want to make
sure to see you could see what happens
here when you kick the kickstand out you
get the home screen or widget clock and
if you choose widget clock then it
launches into this mode here where you
get a large nice large clock the weather
a couple of pages of icons that you can
cycle through and use you've got some
alarm clocks you can close this view and
then this little button right here
changes the brightness and I tap this
it's going to get really dark because
we've got a lot of light on this camera
there on this device right now so it
goes so dark that you can't even see
this device right now but in the
nighttime mode this is actually very
handy to be able to see and when you
close the kickstand it goes right back
to the standard view if you have that
enabled under battery and data manager
we have data saver and battery mode
which allows you to modify how the
battery is used nighttime saver to get
you a little more battery life in the
evening times or performance mode you
can customize those savings the same
thing with data saver you can tell data
to turn off at certain times and to use
data in certain ways especially
important for those who are on small
data plans are on aren't online limited
plans this is a sprint device
is not a whole lot of non unlimited data
plans out there but since this is a
world phone that feature is important
because when you're overseas data can
cost you a lot more when you're using
the the internal SIM card or another sim
card as far as the home screen is
concerns you can see that comes with a
lot of extra widgets I happen to add
that one the power control but a lot of
other functionality that's here on the
widgets also these notification buttons
here to tell you what's on like the GPS
and 4G service and the cycle 4G are not
available up here in the sprint
notification bar area like on some
devices data widgets the screen you
simply tap and hold like you would
expect on any other Android launching
application if you want to move one
around it creates kind of this green
hazy and with the pin tile screen it's
really hard on the eyes it's kind of
makes this they can kind of see it on
the screen there the sliding back and
forth almost like a bad tie on a TV show
as far as the star bar down here it
comes default with the phone dialer
browser Sprint ID and the app launcher
and you can see the multiple sliders
down there at the at the bottom that the
indicator to which screen you're on you
can replace these icons by tapping and
holding and then choosing whatever icon
you like thankfully the Sprint ID is not
stuck there if you move this print ID
it's also under the settings menu as
well of course there's a lot of splode
on here I got the nascar app you've got
the sprint music plus print radio sprint
TV and movies which the sprint TV and
movies only works on 3g service doesn't
work through your Wi-Fi so that means
the quality of the service is not all
that great even when 4g but you can
uninstall some of these applications as
you can see here I've got NASCAR air and
I can actually pull this nascar app out
if I go down here to sprint zone on the
other hand there's no options you can
add these two groups and if you go up
here to apps you can see there's a
sprint group so you can create your own
custom group to kind of hide those or
you just ignore them like most people do
or root the device and take them all
yourself it's also got a nice little
market access button up here at the top
and it is running the new market view
interesting note skype although it's
supposed to work with most gingerbread
devices does not work with the
front-facing camera or any camera really
on the motorola photon 4g which is a
little disappointing Netflix does run
just fine although the video can be a
little blurry because of the pentile
technology some of the other software
that's on here that's pretty typical of
motorola's social networking or the
media I find that with the social
networking when you add a social account
you can choose Facebook or Twitter and
pose to that but I found that really the
the content that's produced or what you
see on the widget for those type of
applications in this messaging system is
not as good as the native apps such as
the Twitter app or facebook app etc far
as a browser is concerned it's
relatively fast I it got a little bogged
down when especially with our site with
a little bit of fun in the flash piece
or any animation that appeared in the
middle of the screen and again because
it's pentile when you start scrolling up
and down it has a tensile to get blurry
but you can see here I'm scrolling up
and down here it's still trying to
finish loading it seems up just a little
sluggish and that's possibly to do that
I'm taking this more in account because
i've been using another newer device
recently that has been just butter
smooth on the browser but as you can see
here this is our site and it's a little
sluggish probably because of this little
t mobile ad here but it's still hesitant
not very screw smooth scrolling not very
usable I mean it's usable but it's it's
it's frustrating when you're trying to
scroll in and out as far as keyboard
options go with the motorola photon 4g
you have this multi touch keyboard which
see here as predictive text or you can
go with swype which also comes default
installed the mobile hotspot is enabled
on this particular device but the PR
documentation is quick to point out that
you have to have a sprint account in
order to be able to do that of course
there are ways around this as you all
are probably aware as for the camera in
the camcorder there is no way to turn
off the shutter sound every time it
takes a picture you're going to hear the
shutter sound there is no setting to
turn it off and I've checked several
places to try to disable it
unfortunately it doesn't exist as far as
the built-in camera app there are some
settings available as far as scenes go
and effects you can turn the flash on
and off rotate the camera and you can
switch the camcorder here or switch the
gallery the colors on the device when it
takes a photo are a little muted and
don't quite match up rights in fact it
it's hard to see on the screen but the
difference between this orange color and
the red color are are really hard to
tell although it is lacking the bluish
tint that was prone to the droid 3 you
can press and hold on the shutter button
up here and it will focus on whatever
you want if you want it there's no tap
to focus but you can tap and hold the
square to set the focus point there is a
camera button up at the top but it's
single phase only as you press it down
and it takes the shot automatically
there are a few more settings here
picture resolution is set to wide screen
by default I have it switched to large
so I can take some pictures for the
final review video resolution is 720p
only and you can see you can change the
exposure in the storage location there
but other than that you don't get a
whole lot of functionality and the
camera is just okay it's not really
anything right all about it's an all
right device for what you get but with
some caveats gallery for this device
kind of gives you this
stacked look there's not a whole lot you
can do to change that view you can have
it show your friends activities or you
can go right in the camera roll and see
pictures from there as well some other
apps some note on the motorola photon 4g
that are included by default google
books is they're managed a sim card
because this is a world of phone
obviously needing to have that a quick
office rich location all pretty standard
apps as far as the phone world is
concerned there is a task manager built
in which is nice so not the download
third-party app TeleNav gps navigator is
just like TeleNav gps navigator on any
other sprint device that you've used web
talk connector we'll get to in just a
moment this is the HD station the
productivity series from Motorola for
the photon 4G it comes with a little
remote and the remote has a directional
keypad on it to navigate not the mouse
but to navigate through scrolling up and
down left and right it's got the same
menu buttons we got a Settings button
the home button a back button and then
maybe a little bit difficult to see in
this view here you can also change the
volume up and down and mute it other
than that this doesn't do a whole lot
it's got a small battery in it it does
work fairly well for what it is I your
device in this case the photon becomes a
little touch mouse it does that this
dock has some USB ports on the back and
got a left and right mouse button and
they pop up keyboard as appropriate and
then as far as the screen goes you can
see that in over here we have our mobile
view and it is the same as what you
would normally see on your phone is
what's in the desktop mode right now up
at the top we've got notifications and
then over here you get your usual
information like settings and 3G service
and battery life new gmail messages pop
up as usual and then down across the
bottom here we've got the dialer
contracts contracts contacts music
gallery
manager apps for web top firefox
facebook and sprint firefox is a older
version its version for i believe in as
you can see it takes a good amount of
time to actually start up and then
suffers from some problems as far as how
things run you know i'm bringing up a
video here in this case which will run
just fine in a small view but as soon as
you go a large full screen it goes
quickly to gets really chopping as far
as performance goes on the main screen
and on the device itself running
gingerbread the performance is pretty
good i did find that it has a tendency
to get bogged down every once in a while
has a tendency to need to go into the
task manager and kill apps as you can
see it count just locked up there for
just a moment kind of stuck in one spot
this may be partially due to some of the
animation but i think it's just this
particular device is is just struggling
a little bit with speeds now you may be
asking yourself why would i buy this
particular device over a device that
happens be coming out another couple of
days that is the same price with the
same software and probably run smoother
and the answer to that is remember this
is a world phone and the other device
that comes out which will be doing a
hardware and software review on shortly
he's not a world phone and can't be used
overseas well can't be used overseas on
GSM networks that wraps up our closer
look at the software of the motorola
photon 4g for sprint if you have any
comments or questions leave them below
if you'd like to have us answer a
specific question in the final review or
