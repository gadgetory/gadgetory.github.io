g5 at mwc in Barcelona Android wear
finally receives one of the most
anticipated updates ever and sony says
will drool about its cameras very soon
as if we don't already I'm hi meri behna
and device sound funny that's because
half my mouth as under anesthetics right
now you know how lovely that is this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Google's Android wear
as a version 1.4 is finally available
and should reach short devices including
my huawei watch very soon because right
now the only devices that actually take
advantage of everything the new version
of Android wear can do is actually the
Huawei watch and the azuz and watch too
and what you're getting our new gestures
and pretty much every other Android wear
and in addition to that the difference
here is that if your watch has the
speaker which again only to do you now
have also the option to be able to have
enhanced voice messaging in addition to
be able to take calls from your watch
this is awesome and we can't wait to
give it a try and let you know how it
goes as soon as it's available again for
our units house will the spotlight over
to Samsung obviously its new unpacked
event is a big deal as we are expecting
the next generation Samsung Galaxy s7
and this is rather interesting as
metadata from the website teases to gear
360 or something that has to do with 360
which makes us wonder are we getting a
360 degree camera are we getting
something that will allow users to take
advantage of the R is the event going to
be available in VR we're not exactly
sure what we're getting but stay tuned
we will be at the event and we'll let
you know what it is and if you're not
enjoying how annoying ads have become on
YouTube lately after you to Brett we
hear you we feel exactly the same thing
but we still don't find it compelling
enough to pay 10 bucks but you to wants
to change that apparently we are getting
exclusive programming to YouTube red as
a februari 10 which is good news we're
just not exactly sure if this means
exclusive programming to YouTube bread
which will later not come through ads
for everybody else or if it will
probably both things will happen again
of Uri 10 and if you would be willing to
pay ten dollars let us know in the
comments down below now it's far about
Sony the company may not be famous for
his experience lately but it is famous
for pretty much every other great
smartphone camera out there including
the iphone including most sense of
galaxies including even LG's and well
the company is teasing that we will
drool over its dual camera modules which
will air soon not exactly sure when we
know that this is a big deal that might
be coming to the iphone 7 or at least
the iphone 7 plus s apparently this will
be the differentiating factor and this
is such good timing with so many rumors
of the iphone 7 pleasant and finally the
very hot news today have to do with the
LG g5 LG has finally confirmed that its
event for mwc is for the g5 which is
great news though it's rather early the
company usually launches its G
smartphones later in the year after
Samsung does which makes a lot of sense
for competition but hey it's great to
see that we're getting a ton of black
ships at mwc we've already received our
invites we will be covering this event
live as well but we the love to know
something for the question up today what
is your wish list for the LG g5 what is
it that you would want to see on this
phone in my case you have to trust LG
for some disruptive design and most of
the rumors point to that so I would just
love to see the company come up with
something bold and new leave us a
comment down below we look to know your
opinion friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the news
