for October thirty-first the LG G flex
specification sleek and things seem
quite good for those interested and
Samsung's record quarter results tell us
a lot about their high-end phones not
paying the bills I'm hi mera neta and if
this video goes up after midnight please
don't complain just join me with a beer
this is ell daily lets her stay
off with some very interesting official
news you know we got Samsung's quarter
results today and apparently the company
has just made nine point six billion
dollars in profit which is great and you
thought that those 40 million galaxy s4
units that they sold were solely
responsible for these results but as it
turns out they weren't actually the
drivers for this amount of money where
the memory chips that they sold to
competitors and also the amount of cheap
phones that they sold that i'm talking
about those cheap galaxy phones so for
those of you wondering why the galaxy
lineup is available on the galaxy ace
and the duo's and all this just learn
that those phones pay the bills a lot
more than the high info now let's talk
some more about Samsung and specifically
the Galaxy gear those of you that want
this galaxy gear should probably be
where as Best Buy's leaked documents
kind of state that there is astonishing
return rate of almost thirty percent so
much so that best buy is actually
running a full two customers asking them
why they're returning it and obviously
what could the Galaxy gear do that it
doesn't currently do and for me
particularly it has a lot to do with
compatibility but still it is a good
watch that could be a lot better now
let's talk about the LG G flex for those
of you that were worried about this
being another prototype for Korea it
turns out that there are some code names
for this phone coming to the United
States so that will be the case and we
also have some leaked specifications of
this phone it is pretty much a g2 only
in a bigger chassis and a curve display
as well but for those of you that were
worried about a 720p display on this
device the leaks also confirm do you
call that confirm that there is a 1080p
display coming to this phone so stay
tuned for it hopefully next month now
these are some interesting news is there
is a company called opto fidelity that
just ran some tests on the iPhone 5s and
iphone 5c and considered to have the
worst display when it comes to
sensitivity which is really
interesting because it was compared to a
galaxy s3 and apparently the galaxy s3
had twice the amount of sensitivity in
the display when compared to these
iphones and as it turns out yes i did
feel some changes between the 4s and the
five when the five launch but i guess
i've gotten used to it but leave us a
comment down below do you feel that
there is some sensitivity issue in your
iphone there is in my opinion just not
as bad as they portray it here and
finally for the hot news of the day yes
we get some more details or we could
call these leaks that the LG Nexus 5 or
google nexus 5 will be launching on
October thirty-first but this is
interesting since friday is pretty much
over the weekend has started and there
are no press invitations being eaten to
anybody so this could be the case that
this will be a silent launch but these
leaks also talk about an LTE nexus for
coming in the pack so apparently this
phone is staying but that leads you to
the question of the day would you buy
the nexus 4 if the Nexus 5 is also in
the market with those great
specification because in my particular
case they could give me that nexus 4 for
free the nexus 5 has such great
specifications that I wouldn't even look
at it but leave us a comment down below
