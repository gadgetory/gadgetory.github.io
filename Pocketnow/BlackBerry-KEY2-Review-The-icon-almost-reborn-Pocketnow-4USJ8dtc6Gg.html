tradition it meant love it meant
addiction in some cases I'm sure I
wasn't the only guy called a CrackBerry
back in the day and it's one of the main
reasons why the recent ad struck a
positive nerve in my heart I loved my
blackberries back then I used to love my
blackberry I still do but a lot has gone
wrong since then and then a few steps
were done right but the library key one
was a good step in that right direction
but it wasn't quite the daily driver for
me so it's time for round two I'm Jaime
medley that I was pocket now when let's
find out if the BlackBerry key 2 is
finally my daily driver
fun fact what I love the most about
blackberries back in the day is that I
felt that they were the perfect blend
between hardware and software they were
elegant they were fast and they lasted
all day and then some
I feel the BlackBerry key to gets the
hardware right think of the key one on a
very strict diet and then fix everything
I didn't like about it we have a
gorgeous aluminum build match with a
stippled back for added grip and have I
told you just how light this phone is I
mean if you're coming from a key one it
is a dramatic difference now bear in
mind this device is designed to be a
communicator first and therefore the
spec sheet is designed to deliver on
that we have a new qualcomm snapdragon
616 processor for power efficiency six
ago bytes of ram 64 gigs of expandable
storage a 3500 milliamp power battery
with Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 --into
the battery life has proven to be as
good as the key one but oddly for some
reason I sometimes feel the key one
could go a little farther I've ended the
day with at least 50% of battery on this
device pretty much every single time but
I had cases with the key one where oh my
god I could get up to the second day and
even then some now a lot of the power
efficiency comes from having the less
display to power at 4.5 inches diagonal
16 20 by 1080 resolution and LCD
technology we don't necessarily get the
best experience when it comes to media
consumption now don't get me wrong
colors are great but we don't have the
brightest display here and obviously the
form factor gets in the way of 16 by 9
video and then the speaker quality is
not necessarily the greatest and very
easy to muffle so again the experience
of content consumption is not what I
would call its stronghold there in mind
this is a communicator first again and
the bottom 40 here is what makes that
happen mostly I wasn't really much of a
fan of the key ones keyboard but I think
blackberry finally got it right we now
have more spacious keys and
that finish if you like the keyboard on
the BlackBerry Bold 9900 back in the day
this keyboard feels almost as good it is
seriously a joy to type on though there
is a learning curve if you've been
typing on glass for years going back to
pressing keys actually feels awkward at
first it took me about three days to get
used to it that being said I do love
that there is text prediction so I don't
really need to type words correctly and
if you're multilingual like me you can
create a multilingual keyboard in the
settings in order to not have to be
switching languages all the time now for
those of you asking the million dollar
question why would you want a keyboard
in 2018 and it has everything to do with
the experience with the software one of
the main reasons why I became addicted
to BlackBerry's back in the day was
because of how much you could customize
them to feel yours see each key allows
you to set up to two shortcuts and the
speed key at the bottom right allows you
to access these from anywhere in the
user interface want to call on your
girlfriend by pressing the X do it want
to launch whatsapp with the W you can
also do that I honestly find the
experience of jumping between
applications to be cumbersome on regular
phones or even basic things like making
a phone call which is something I don't
feel I have a problem with on the key -
there's even a convenience key for more
shortcuts you can use the keyboard for
navigation gestures and even the
spacebar serves as a fingerprint scanner
and to take photos when you're in the
camera now software is actually one of
the things that I praise on this device
because its unique in the things that it
has to be we have Android 8.1 out of the
box which I praised
productivity being its main focus it
offers essentials like the BlackBerry
hub where you can consolidate all of
your messaging there are slide menus
from the left to right where you can set
your calendar tasks and even other
widgets from other apps security being
also important we have BlackBerry D Tech
which provides full granular control
over what applications can see from your
privacy I'll admit I'm shocked at how
many times apps like Google will use
your microphone without you knowing it
in the background or apps will use your
camera without you knowing it as well in
the background it's maybe question if I
want to use these applications or
not or it's made me use detect to be
able to not allow these applications to
use the camera for example but probably
what's most important is that all these
layers don't really bog down the
experience of navigating through menus
it's definitely not a gaming phone by
any means but it'll get the job done if
you tax it I also praised this device
for the basics of being a communicator
doing a great job to cling to networks
and Wi-Fi in the toughest of situations
and also being really good at phone
calls now moving the spotlight over to
one of the most important reasons why
buy a phone or not I have to say that I
am partially disappointed at the cameras
and I say partially because if you
launch the viewfinder on the primary
shooter you'd believe that the photos
are blurry or bad I think that there
must be some sort of a bug in the camera
app because once you look at the final
photos both on the phone and on the
computer the results are actually really
good there's great color saturation and
detail at this point and even low-light
performance is decent in most scenarios
I can't really say that portrait shots
are the best that I've seen but they're
not bad and the sink can be said for
using this telephoto camera so long as
you do it in daylight video recording is
where things start to get weird again
I'm not sure if this is a software bug
or not but my unit claims to have
enhanced video stabilization and I don't
really notice any when I'm walking
around and even if I find selfie video
to offer a really good crop I also don't
notice the belies a ssin being offered
here and in the topic of selfies this is
another point of disappointment for me
the results are honestly mediocre at
best with washed-out photos even in good
lighting and don't even get me started
about low-light performance sure I get
it the business customers might not be
fans of selfies but I don't think that's
an excuse for selfies to be bad
particularly on this device to conclude
I have to say that I am very mixed about
this device I am one of those people
that actually do love the design I love
the keyboard
I love the conveniences of the software
and oh my god I love this phone's
battery life sadly it's not the perfect
phone and it's not perfect than things
that are very important things like for
example the $650 price tag are very
difficult to sell you've really climbed
into 1 plus 6 territory here and yes I
do get that this phone is designed for a
niche in mind but this amount of money
leaves no room for mediocrity and the
camera experience Falls there in
addition to the lack of essentials like
water assistance my final verdict is
that I do love the BlackBerry key 2 I
will be using it as my communicator but
bear in mind my case is unique I also
carry a second phone that will most
likely serve as my multimedia powerhouse
and also will take better photos than
this phone unless you love the
BlackBerry key 2 for the same reasons
that I do it's very hard for me to sit
here and tell you that this device is
worth $650 I feel that it's overpriced I
feel that there are other options out
there
we'll do a better job in essentials that
are key for users today so unless you
fall under that niche of people that
actually want a keyboard in this
experience my final verdict would be
that you would be probably better served
with other options for a little less
money folks let us know what you think
about the BlackBerry key - in the
comments down below would you be willing
to buy this phone or not and while
