just arrived I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and this is our unboxing of the Sony
Xperia Z ultra but before we get started
I'd like to thank our friends at Negra
electronics for lending us the Z ultra
for the review period and if you'd like
you can check out their site for your
own Z ultra or other devices and
accessories without further ado let's
give this baby unboxed so back in June
Sony announced a new phone the Z ultra
basically a much larger version of the
Xperia Z and the the Z out but is more
like the Z it's got the the body of the
Xperia Z but it is much larger this
thing has a 6 point 4 inch display at
1080p that's a 344 pixels per inch so
it's really high density for a large
display and it's got some pretty decent
specs across the board not decent
it has great specifications across the
board it has a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core
Krait CPU so that's a crate 400 which
means this thing has a Snapdragon 800
cpu or chipset in it and that's
impressive this one of the first phones
with a Snapdragon 800 in it it also has
ip55 and ip57 camera and 16 gigabytes
with 2 gigabytes of RAM so this device
is uh basically a heavyweight without
further ado let's see what's inside the
box and get this baby out of it of
course I've got my my unboxing tool
which everybody always thinks I'm going
to cut myself with for whatever reason
but it is still in the plastic so this
is the first time we've even touched
this box so if we take this off that is
massive now I unboxed and I reviewed the
the Galaxy mega 6.3 I'm a few weeks back
and it was big but this thing it just
feels big it feels bigger I guess I
should say but we should sit that to the
side and see what else is inside the box
so flap you've got your paper here your
startup guide and everything I can't
even get that out of there so I'm not
going to worry about it a UK power
adapter and we've got micro USB cord and
headphones with extra tips so a nice
stuff in the Box headphones and whatnot
which is a rarity these days but that's
all there is it's nothing too special
inside the box let's sit that to the
side and take a look at this thing
because that that is a spectacle this
thing is enormous I mean I've got fairly
big chunky hands as people say and this
thing makes my hands look tiny
it Dwarfs my hands which is hilarious
but let's get this little plastic
wrapper off we've still got some plastic
to take off here - man it's it's really
weird because it has a true 16:9 aspect
ratio I don't know about the dimensions
of the display or anything but it's
really got that that widescreen ratio it
looks like a giant candy bar that's
exactly what it looks like a giant
Hershey's kiss bar or not kiss but a
Hershey's chocolate bar so that's what
it kind of looks and feels like in the
hand let's take this plastic off yeah
not a lot of sound from that so I won't
get it too close to the mic this has a
few information instructions on how to
insert and charge things but as you can
see it's got a very similar design to
the Xperia Z which is which is a good
thing we liked that but it doesn't have
the shiny plastic on the inside which is
also good because the Xperia Z has it
was really bad for finger prints around
the edges on the back we've also got the
same glass in front on the glass so it's
a very minimal design here is your micro
SD card slot 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack got your power button and volume
rocker here it has a lanyard hole with
your speaker to the bottom edge and on
the left side here what is this I'm not
quite sure what that is it just seems
like a seam I don't know
with the seams for these are charging
prongs for maybe a dock and this is your
charging port right here on the top on
the back we've got the 8 megapixel
camera and that's your NFC contact logo
there so that's where your NFC chip is
when you want to share something which
this is like sharing something with a
candy bar it's kind of funny but um this
is your six point four inch display it
takes up the vast majority of the front
and there's very little bezel on the
sides I don't know if you can see it in
the camera I'm going to turn the display
on so we can get a real feel for how big
this thing is and how big the display is
but there's very minimal bezel on the
sides and actually not too much bezel on
the top and bottoms but I think on a
device this big you might need something
a little less thick on the top and
bottom because this is this is huge this
is a it almost feels very similar to the
Nexus 7 and size which is kind of crazy
I mean I know the Nexus 7 is bigger but
this kind of feels very similar in size
and let's get a bright picture up here
maybe a white background sitting there
we go so now you can see that there's
not a whole lot of bezel here on the
sides it's very minimal and it's it's
giant so this has been an unboxing of
the Sony Xperia Z ultra stay tuned for
more videos and content over the next
week including comparisons a full view
and who knows what else so stay tuned
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
