and my last video was a little bit
different than some of the videos that
you've become accustomed to on
pocketnow.com instead of being kind of
an intro with a hands-on man behind the
camera perspective we did kind of a
video editorial was a little bit longer
it covered quite a bit more topics and
went into some detail on some topics
that were kind of peripheral to what
you'd expect from the website it was an
experiment to see if you guys liked it
we asked you to comment and you did and
you loved it so that's great that said
I'd like to introduce you to the very
first android guy weekly so welcome to
the first episode of it the android guy
weekly this is going to be a format
where we give you editorial information
and then we hope that you will take the
opportunity to join in the conversation
and participate in the comments which
will help us not only grow the topic but
it will also help other people who may
have different opinions different views
that's what we love about our audience
but we also want to help grow this into
a weekly event a weekly show so if
you've got suggestions for topics make
sure you let us know head over to pocket
now calm and click on the tip us or one
of my articles and click on the contact
me link right there under the the byline
but that said let's get right into
today's topic so I've been carrying
around a smartphone for well years
honestly I started out with PDAs you
guys remember what those were they
didn't even have phones in them some of
them didn't have Wi-Fi most of them
didn't have Wi-Fi occasionally you'd
have one with Bluetooth but if you
wanted to get your data onto it your
calendar your contacts your email your
PIM that was the word that we use back
then the acronym if you wanted to do
that you had to physically connect it to
your computer and synchronize all of
that data which was kind of a time
intensive process but then you could
carry it around with you if you wanted
to reply to an email you could you
couldn't send it until you got back to
your computer
in we of course know where that went we
started getting cellphone radios and
Wi-Fi and all kinds of cool stuff inside
our PDAs so we could be connected all
the time in fact with Android you don't
even need a computer anymore it can be
your computer you don't have to have
itunes you don't have to have the zune
software you can just literally open it
out of the box put in the battery in the
sim put in your gmail credentials and
you're done you have a fully functional
pim PDA smartphone everything right
there out of the box that's one of the
reasons I like Android so much not to
disparage the other guys but it's a
phone I shouldn't need a computer to use
my phone there are some reasons why you
might want a computer in the mix and
some of the stuff that I've done in the
past regarding hacking and whatnot kind
of requires a computer but those are
peripheral activities but at the end of
the day it's still just a phone it's got
a relatively small screen most of the
time it doesn't have a keyboard there
are some sliders and I've kind of
preferred those in the past what with
the g1 the epic 4g and even the g2 but
the keyboards are really small too kind
of hard to use they're good for her and
cranking out an email or text messages
or whatnot but as far as a Productivity
tool smartphone really isn't best for it
it can get you by in a pinch and mine
often does but it's really not that
great for being well a laptop
replacement so what can you do for that
well the industry saw a need and that
need was tablets it's essentially a
netbook not really a notebook or a
laptop without a keyboard luckily with
Bluetooth we can add keyboards very
easily we can even add a mouse on some
platforms so you can have a near laptop
experience with a very lightweight
device that has usually internet
connectivity that has all the apps that
you familiar with from your smartphone
and well it's ultra portable and the
batteries on last for 15 18 hours
compare that to a netbook you
looking at five to eight and a laptop
two to four if you're lucky so you've
always got to stay close to being
tethered to a wall outlet the bigger you
get tablets fill that niche but a tablet
just like the PDAs from yesteryear well
they're really not all that productive
they're not all that helpful unless
they're connected if you have to go back
and plug into a computer well you may as
well just use your computer right so
carrying around this this slate this pad
if you will doesn't do you much good
unless you're connected that's where
things get complicated and that's the
subject of today's android guy weekly so
I've got a smartphone my smartphone has
a data plan some people have unlimited
data like me I'm one of the old guys
it's kind of fun limited at five
gigabytes they throttle me down to quote
unquote here's my air quotes for you up
to 2g speeds and it's painful I've done
it before it's terrible throttled speeds
may as well be no speeds they're doing
themselves a disservice there by
throttling but that's an editorial for
another episode so let's get back
unlimited data plans are great even
limited data plans a two gig cap that's
probably okay I usually don't go past
two gig I'm right on the defense with
that however some someone's I'll go
above that someone's below that but it's
all there on my smartphone and we're
back to the size issue now I've got a
Galaxy Nexus that's one of the largest
smart phones out there there are a few
others that have bigger screens but
that's one of the biggest and we're
talking just shy of what five inches on
that guy it's huge in fact it's so huge
it took me about a week to get used to
it just holding it in hand and being
able to reach to everything I've got big
hands and I can't even use it one-handed
and hit every point on the screen I've
got to pull out another hand and use my
pointer finger to touch some of the
parts of the screen just because it's so
big my thumb won't reach so let's look
at the next evolution and
we're back to tablets tablet is supposed
to be a two-handed device now most of
the time it's one hand holding the
tablet the other hand poking at it just
touching the screen moving around typing
in whatever it may be launching those
birds against those pigs all kinds of
stuff that you can do with two hands but
it's two hands and it's big right now
the sweet spot for tablets is 10 inches
which is significantly larger than a
smartphone and that's kind of why that
form factor was introduced 10 inches is
kind of the sweet spot for netbooks of
course they have a keyboard with the
most of the time and that's a good size
screen for doing stuff doing productive
stuff not just email not just applying
games not just looking at your calendar
but seeing the big picture actually
working on documents working on
spreadsheets working on well more than
just a very short response to an email
getting in there looking at your whole
calendar view for a month or even a week
it's kind of hard to do on the small
screen of a smartphone but a tablet is
great but I don't carry my tablet with
me all the time why it's one other thing
my phone I have in a holster on my hip
all the time it's there
twenty-four/seven okay I don't sleep
with it it's on the charging cradle then
but you get my point with a tablet it's
something else to carry going back to
yesteryear again it's the Franklin day
planner you know those big binders that
had calendars you know paper in them you
wrote your schedules in and whatnot
that's a tablet that's today's tablet
and it's big and it's bulky and I don't
carry it around with me as much as I
should as much as I'd like to partially
because it's so big partially because
it's not connected it's a Wi-Fi only
device ah but they have connected
tablets don't they of course they do you
just have to pay a separate data plan
for it you know essentially doubling
your costs which I don't think is very
cool at all I've got a smartphone with
data I've got a tablet I like data why
can i use my smartphones data on my
tablet well i can
but that might cost me as well because I
have to sign up for a tethering plan to
use that same amount of data I don't
understand that maybe you carriers can
shed some light I know it's all about
the money and all about the bandwidth
and all about the keeping offenders from
using their fair share yet whatever you
just want me to pay for two plans I get
it that's okay that's business but I
don't want it and I am sure a lot of
people out there don't want to do that
either so what do you do now you've got
to carry not only a smartphone but a
tablet with you another problem with
tablets and this isn't a rail on tablets
video okay another problem with tablets
is let's say I only want to carry one
device great I'll carry a tablet a
connected tablet with a data plan but
now I don't have a phone great so I
either have to use skype or I have to go
to a VoIP solution which you can do it's
relatively complex and more for the
geeks among us I haven't even done that
on my phone but you can and at that
point your tablet and I'm holding a
tablet up to your no that doesn't work
so you got to have a bluetooth device to
be able to it to communicate not that
nice there's some sweet spot that we're
missing there and that's really where
we're kind of at the cusp of an
evolutionary shift or so I think I could
be wrong and if I am of course we'll
look back at history and see that but if
you have a different idea of where
technology's going make sure you let us
know in the comments so let me pull out
my crystal ball and let's see where I
think tablets and smartphones might be
going in the future so smart phones are
three four five inch tablets are 10 inch
what's in the middle 7-inch 7.7 if you
want to go with the the Galaxy Tab 7.7
it's a nice in between size it's smaller
than most of today's tablets bigger than
most of today's smartphones gives you
that extra room that you need to be able
to do productive stuff make this a tool
not just a toy like some tablets kind of
are you know you get it so you can
relax so you can be entertained so you
can head it off to a kid and have them
entertained while you're on a road trip
or in a meeting or you're doing
something grown-up and they're bored
fair enough I am I the only parent who
does that okay seeing hands out there
okay go ahead put your hands down all
right so we've got all this stuff that
tablets should do and they're not really
doing because of the utility factor the
size and the connectivity so here's my
prediction tablets are going to shrink
down in size to be around seven inches
eight inches somewhere they're just
small enough to be portable Karia belen
and able to you know use we're still
going to have the 10 inches out there
don't get me wrong the iPad form factor
is not going away the Zoom not going
away but that's going to be for another
niche people like me maybe people like
you we're going to shrink down we're
going to miniaturize we're going to go
with something that's small enough that
will carry it with us and not be
burdened with it but big enough that we
can actually use it and have it be
productive which then brings us to
connectivity now right now I basically
have my phone set to portable tethering
all the time not cool because that sucks
down battery in my phone and I need my
phone to be a phone so I can get phone
calls on it that's kind of what it's
there for but I have to have that on all
the time so my tablet can be connected
all the time now of course when the
screens off I don't need it on either
device but you get my point sucks my
battery life down and really isn't that
the opposite way to look at things
shouldn't we have our data plans on our
tablets I mean we have Wi-Fi devices or
Wireless bubbles or portable hotspots or
whatever the branding is that
essentially is just a a cellular
connected device at the office we have
some sprint devices that have 3g and 4g
built in t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T have theirs
it's just a puck essentially just a
little square
a rectangle who knows what shape it is
but it has cellular radios in it kind of
like a router built in and can let you
connect to Wi-Fi with up to five devices
to it share that amongst those five
devices so that's great it's another
thing I got to carry with me why not
combine that hot spot technology that
tethering into a tablet which has a
bigger battery so honestly it's going to
last you know quite a bit longer than
even the puck would and longer than
smartphone would using that you know the
tethering why not do that now your
tablet your portable tablet not your 10
inch tablet becomes your wireless access
point but that opens something else up
if I have a data plan that I'm paying
for on my tablet do I need voice well on
the tablet it would be nice but not not
necessary because i still have my phone
with me do i still need a phone if i've
got a tablet that's not portable and if
so then do I just have my voice on the
tablet and use a bluetooth headset to
make and receive my calls you know of
course I could use it a speakerphone if
I wanted to but I just need that device
so then smartphones do smartphones go
away are we going to start seeing a
resurgence of dumb phones of flip phones
maybe we're all they are is voice they
don't need data because you've got your
tablet with you maybe they'll become
just a bluetooth handset for your tablet
that has buttons on it has the you know
the typical phone format but all it does
is connects to your tablet your tablet
is essentially your communication device
and your phone is the thing that you've
talked into sends the signal to the
tablet tablet takes care of all the data
back in is that possible is that in our
future maybe so it kind of makes sense
to me does it make sense to you let me
know in the comments positive negative
whatever and see maybe we're going to
evolve that way what do I think the
catalyst is that would actually get us
that point voice over LTE now we've
talked about that a little bit before
voice over LTE is like voice over IP
except it's over the LTE network how are
they different well primarily voice over
LTE uses LTE as its as its conduit
whereas voice over IP can use any data
connection as its conduit voice over LTE
pushes a lot of features to the back end
pushes it to the carrier's
infrastructure like echo cancellation
noise reduction stuff like that so you
don't have to have extra hardware like
if you wanted to do that with voice over
IP or even traditional cellular
telephony you'd have to have a second
microphone on the device to listen for
background noise and then an algorithm
running with enough processor power to
cancel out that noise from your voice
before it sends it down to the cellular
network it can be done in fact it's
being done but voice over LTE can do it
on the LTE back end rather than the
front end on the device itself so once
we get voice over LTE and your device
has an LTE connection do we need
traditional cellular voice my argument I
say no at that point we'll start seeing
old phones go away yes there's still
some dumb phones out there we'll start
seeing smartphones kind of go away and
maybe even turn back into PDAs that have
some phone like capabilities through
bluetooth to your connected tablet that
tablet then becomes your hotspot it
becomes your portable productivity
device it becomes the conduit through
which you make and receive all of your
phone calls is that what the future is
going to hold I don't know it kind of
looks like it might and really I kind of
hope that it does what do you think how
do you think things are going to go
forward now it's your turn let us know
