today I've got the mytouch 4G i'm
outside in the same location as I've
done my other video camera reviews and
doing basically the same thing you can
see the autumn colors are coming out the
apples are nice and ripe and this is the
720p high-definition setting on the
camera now it defaults just below that
at to 800 x 480 i believe and we're just
doing the traditional walk around here's
our lava rock so we can get in tight and
grab some detail right there really good
will do the same thing over here on the
grass and I'm sorry I don't have any
flowers for you today so you can't blame
me for that but just to show you really
quick what this looks like go up and see
the house against the sky and all that
fun stuff so there you go just really
quick again with with this video like
all the others in the past I'm only
going to record this on the phone and
then upload it directly to YouTube and
let YouTube do its magic I'm not going
to do any pre-processing to the video or
any resizing or anything like that so
this is absolutely as Ra's it can get
right off the camera itself you know
only with YouTube stuff in there so
overall on screen it's looking really
good the colors look nice trying to get
some motion in here so you can see how
it handles that see how it does with the
color differences don't work here we do
have some little flowers I haven't
disappointed you guys look at that there
you go some little itty bitty flowers
there on the ground holding the camera
now basically arm's length so showing
you the high-definition camera
capabilities for the t-mobile mytouch 4G
I'm Joe for pocketnow.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
