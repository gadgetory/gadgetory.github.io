all those Android users who use wireless
charging be jealous no more I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is the
Sims wireless charging flip case for the
iPhone 5 the iPhone 5 is undoubtedly one
of the most popular smartphones around
and while it may not offer over-the-top
specs or blistering clock speeds the
phone easily offers one of the greatest
and most reliable experiences you can
get from just about any phone but
whether you blame apples stubbornness
and refusal to give in to various trends
in the mobile industry or it's slower
product cycles there are some things
that other smart phones have offered for
quite some time that might take a while
to get over to the iPhone like NFC or
expandable storage some of those things
will probably never happen one of the
standards we're seeing more and more of
in smartphones is the Qi standard for
wireless charging phones like the Droid
DNA Lumia 920 and Nexus 4 all have Qi
wireless charging built-in and for those
that don't there are a handful of cases
or aftermarket battery covers they can
be purchased to enable wireless charging
likewise there's one for the iPhone from
Zins it comes in the form of a flipped
case that snaps easily onto the phone's
chassis we have a custom skin on the
back of ours which makes the phone jut
out a tiny bit from the edges of the
case but it still fits pretty snugly and
shows no signs of slipping out snapping
the case on is quite simple at the
bottom there is a flexible lightning
connector slightly bend it back insert
the connector in the Lightning port at
the bottom of the iPhone and snapped a
hard case on to the back of the phone
the outer part of the case is a rubbery
plastic that makes a phone easy to hold
and provides a small amount of
protection from drops and despite the
wireless charging module inside it adds
very little thickness to the phone on
the inside of the flip cover is a suede
like material and with the exception of
the lightning connector at the bottom
you still have easy access to all the
buttons and ports over all the case
which retails around $50 feels
exceptional in fact it's the sort of
case we would shoot for even if it
didn't have wireless charging included
it's that nice it can be used with one
of Zins own wireless charging pads the
single pad which we've been using
retails for around $65 and Zins also
makes a dual charging pad that's a bit
more steep
the charging pad has a designated area
for charging and it's quite simple to
find the sweet spot there's an indicator
light they'll let you know when you're
charging or if you need to readjust the
positioning the best part is that Zins
adheres to the Qi standard meaning if
you have additional qi chargers laying
around it's cases will work with no
problem in our office we have the Nexus
4 wireless charging or sitting on the
desk and we drop the iPhone 5 in the
Zen's case on it and it charged without
a hitch and all the Zins case for the
iPhone 5 is very nice it costs a little
more than your standard flip style case
and it comes with one caveat if you
don't have a wireless charger around and
your iPhone needs some juice you'll need
to take it out of the case to charge it
this could be a nuisance if you only
have one Qi charger between the
workplace and home and you have to end
up taking the case off every day other
than that we couldn't be more happy with
the Zins wireless charging case for the
iPhone 5 that's going to wrap up this
