get detailed ubuntu edge to fund a new
dual boot ubuntu an android smartphone
and no get teases something big to be
launched tomorrow but we're not sure I'm
hi meri beta and before all those that's
what she said jokes begin about nokia
this is parking out daily let's all stay
off with some sort of product
announcements is no kiss teasing
something big to happen tomorrow but
well something big is apparently the
Nokia Lumia 625 which is a 4.7 inch
display smartphone and well the Samsung
at eva's is actually bigger than that so
stay tuned to see what we get apparently
this Lumia 625 is not only not so big
but also not so well SPECT and speaking
of big oddities Sam Singh as being
teased is working on a new 12 point 2
inch android tablet a gigantor tablet as
if the company's not already tired of
building almost every single galaxies
happen you could think of and not
selling many of them still well we the
only have a name and we only have a
screen size we don't have any specs just
yet so stay tuned as the rumors
developed now let's move the spotlight
over to HTC we all remember the HTC t6
code name for the HTC One max which is
planned to be there phablets but
apparently that phone won't be launched
alone there is also a new HTC Zara being
rumored and apparently the zara is going
to be a plastic only device that's
apparently going to be some sort of a
combination with the t6 as well
hopefully I don't see how these
commodities are going to go probably
this is just another version of the
butterfly as well stay tuned as well as
the rumors develop and links down below
for some some specifications being
mentioned now let's talk about Abu to we
were all excited about that new ubuntu
operating system back in january and
then lee kind of forgot about it yeah
it's gonna be launched until next year
it's still being tested but sadly people
are not really caring much about it
apparently the company has this new
campaign where they plan to launch a new
smartphone the tool boots with Android I
do consider that to be a smarter idea
that what would they have right now but
I still don't know if it will be enough
so let's see how it goes and finally for
the hot news of the day Google's new
Nexus 7 is pretty much confirmed
or Wednesday event I mean we've got some
League press renders we've got some more
specifications in the links down below
we've got a 230 dollar price tag for the
16 gig model again links down below for
that and apparently everything is
confirmed new wallpaper android 4.3
we've already been testing android 4.3
by the way and then well we'll keep you
posted on how that goes but anyways we
will be covering this event live on
wednesday at noon eastern standard time
so please join us in our pocket now live
hangout and anyways that leads you to
the question of the day what do you
think about this new nexus 7 what are
your predictions for what's going to
happen for this tablet what do you
expect to see on this tablet in my
particular case this was the best
android tablet last year and this will
be the best android tablet this year
those are my predictions but leave us a
comment down below what do you think

earlier scoop of everything that's
