pocket now calm a 3d web browser has
been released for Windows Phone 7 and in
this video we're going to take a look at
it let's get started are you okay so
let's talk about this 3d web browser and
we're going to talk about why you would
want a 3d web browser in the first place
it is called surf cube it is one dollars
and ninety-nine cents and you can get it
in the Windows Phone 7 marketplace and
let's talk about how it's actually 3d so
a problem that you have in a typical
mobile web browsers that in order to
access settings you have to press
buttons and press the menu button and
things like that it's not very natural
what if you could gesture to do most
things what if you could kind of tilt
down the screen if you want to quickly
jump to a certain link that is how this
browser works so right now you saw that
I've just tilted it down and I'm going
to tilt it back to get right here to
pocketnow.com but it doesn't only tilt
sort of top to bottom you can tilt it
from bottom to top and this is a tab
function that will be coming in a future
future version of surf cube and we can
bring it back so again you're not diving
into settings or a menu to get to your
favorites you're just kind of flipping
your finger we can also swipe the 3d
cube over here to the left to Swift
swivel the cube the other way and get
into the settings and it's not always
the most responsive thing ever but it's
usually pretty good and of course we can
go into landscape to take a look at the
page this is using the IE rendering
engine so pages load fast pinch to zoom
is extremely responsive so there are no
problems there so let's tap on this and
just take another look at how things
look when they load and when pages are
loading you can see sort of the address
bar in the 3d plane but of course you
can pivot all the way down to see it in
its full full glory there so its pivot
again and something interesting to note
about this web browser is that when
you're panning and tilting around this
cube you have to start your finger off
the screen if I tilt down right here it
doesn't actually flip the cube I have to
start above and then I bring it down and
from there you can do you can do the
rest so a pretty cool concept not sure
it's worth a dollar in 99
but at least it gives you a new sort of
wave to control your browsing experience
a little bit more intuitive once you get
to learn the gestures then say the
standard stock browser built into
Windows 17 again it's called surf cube
and it's available in the market for a
dollar ninety-nine cents you like this
video please give it a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
