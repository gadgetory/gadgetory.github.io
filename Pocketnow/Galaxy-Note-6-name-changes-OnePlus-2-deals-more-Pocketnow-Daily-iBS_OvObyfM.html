already talked about a change in name
microsoft announces another set of
layoffs in its windows 10 death spiral
and deals already point to a one plus
three coming soon I'm Hina Rivera and I
don't really understand how people can
live without YouTube in this country but
I'm sure they figure something out
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals those of you
in the market for a very hard smartphone
and a decent price that one plus three
is currently available for $300 the
oneplus X is down to two hundred bucks
these are two great smartphones that
still haven't found software updates but
that doesn't change the fact that they
are hot and it just clearly points that
we are looking into a refresh very soon
it seems that Google hasn't really found
quorum for YouTube right up to the point
where the company is dropping the trial
period again to 99 cents for three
months those of you wanting to try the
availability of watching videos whenever
offline and period content from Google
this is an option that's available to
you now and it doesn't hurt us try it
out for a dollar let's just see what
happens after that now it seems that
today has been the day for foldable
smartphones as a Samsung has just teased
in a video in the links of the
description how its planning to get it
done and then we've got Oppo showing us
that they have built another sort of
technology that they've been working on
for the past nine months which is really
interesting given the fact that Oppo
doesn't really build this place as
Samsung does let's see what we get for
later this year probably a t5 now in the
very set portion of news today we hear
that Microsoft is cutting off more jobs
for its Windows 10 mobile division 1350
jobs in addition to a 950 million dollar
restructuring plan and I hate the word
restructuring because it's clear that
there's a problem with focus when it
comes to Windows 10 mobile not
necessarily because of well products
were terrible definitely this year but
my god Nokia was such an amazing company
I cannot understand how Microsoft could
just completely destroy that let's hope
that they figure it out in the end and
finally the very interesting news is
they have to do with the galaxy note 6
we've covered Leafs with coverage specs
we've covered possible the sign changes
but what's most interesting is that
apparently Samsung is planning to change
the name early we are now getting
galaxy note 7 which makes a lot of sense
for the longest time there's just been
this disparity between the galaxy s line
up in the galaxy note line up it would
make all the sense in the world if they
standardize everything but I hope that's
not the only change that they bring to
the table when it comes to the name I
mean why not just call it Galaxy Note
2015 or 2016 or 2017 depending on
whatever a year but it leads me to the
question of today what expectations do
you have for the Galaxy Note Oh would
you like to see Samson bring to the
market in my case aside from the name
and the specifications I would really
like for Samsung to figure out a way for
us to use the s-pen more in a way that
integrates with the operating system in
a smarter way for you to be able to
provide pen input to everything but hey
I'd love to know what you think in the
comments down below
