does he say and a lot and what do you
mean who thinks Jaime looks a bit
melancholic today I do I mean I saw your
porno the other day man much respect
which one that's right it's that time of
the week I am hi Matt leave Anna this is
pocket now and this is the parking out
daily recap for last week brought to you
by Linda calm so when they asked you
when you prefer the Nexus 6 with a
fingerprint scanner in the dimple at the
back as a motorola CEO came on record to
state that the only reason why the
device didn't bring this feature is
because apple bought the company that
has it or that was going to be able to
enable that we have one in 19 comments
out of which one of them says iphone has
the best fingerprint scanner till date
no company can replace it I'm not going
to say that no kind of a company can't
replace it but I do agree with you on
that then Carly Johnston said it's the
same spot as the one max that didn't
sell squat so I doubt it'll make a
difference here a good point it could be
I don't find it comfortable at the back
but other people don't agree with me are
you and Alex McPherson says the dimple
is too much of an awkward spot at the
back having it of the back basically
restricts you from using your index
finger and rendering it useless when
sitting on a table having a fingerprint
scanner on the front is far more
practical I do agree with you it could
be that it is more practical for
one-handed use it could also be that the
back is also practical but then again
with a device as big as the nexus 6
that's not really an option now on
Tuesday I asked you if you would like a
galaxy s6 with a replaceable back as the
rumors are that Sampson plans to make
them really smart you know connected to
its s health applications and everything
and just make them sort of like the
yotaphone only replaceable we have a 507
comments out of which halo says I was
hoping Sampson would stop focusing on
features nobody cares about I would
rather try it out no company has really
figured it out so why not have samsung
give it a try then Andrew no PSN says
you know there's something wrong about a
phone when you think about changing its
back will make the biggest difference
change your G damn ugly a software
Samsung and focus on design not the back
cover oh yeah could be could be that
that's really not the problem but then
again with all the leaks in the
schematics it's really hard for this to
actually happen by the way then
commoner says I think of all phones
samsung has the ugliest phones and most
boring design around every phone looks
virtually exactly the same anybody agree
with me 47 people like your comment I
don't I actually like the Samsung design
but again it's a matter of opinion then
when they asked you if the rumors are
correct then the Apple watch launches in
April are you getting one we have 652
comments out of which almost every
single one was negative and some of
these set for example a mirror we don't
want another high priced tech from apple
and another featureless one it's not
featureless but it will be high priced
indeed but I'm under Lopez says the
Apple watch is a joke if you take away
the apple from the name and call it the
next Android wear its highs and smart
watch it would have been laughed off the
stage and you know I do agree with you
it is a cool concept and everything but
the fact that you have to charge it
every day just throws everything down
the drain the United States of nerd says
I can't wait for the iWatch to launch
they're going to be so many dbags trying
to explain to me why it's such an
essential piece of hardware and how they
couldn't live without it I will however
continue to be get happily by without
any Smart Watch you know I do agree with
you I will not be an early adopter of
the Apple watch at least not voluntarily
Apple is not famous for doing things
right on the first one but that being
said I do know that a lot of people are
gonna go crazy buying it the first time
and then probably will just stick with
it three years to come as it's happening
with the iPad then on Thursday ask you
if you would buy a galaxy s6 if they
offered you a stripped-down version of
TouchWiz as the rumors are that Samsung
is going to be a bare-bones operating
system and then you can install all the
gimmicks if you want afterwards there
are seven hundred and forty comments out
of which mid-con Williams says wow if
Samsung plays their hands right with
this one they will own 2015 I don't know
if they will but yeah it would be a
smart move and water says if touch which
loses all the features then why should
you go for a samsung anymore you know
that is a very interesting point a lot
of people by Sampson because the
gimmicky things look awesome on an ad or
a video so yeah what would differentiate
samsung smartphones going forward that
is a good point then Kevin Osborne says
everybody speaks badly about TouchWiz
I don't see the lag on my note for when
I had my note 3 everyone seems to want
stock Android I loved the note 4 and the
way it is you know I use the note 3 I
use the note 2 and I do agree with you I
didn't see really any lack problems I
just didn't like the UI the whole aspect
and skeuomorphism but that didn't mean
that I didn't like the note though three
is still one of my favorite smartphones
of all time so yeah i do understand what
you have 103 likes on that one and then
finally on friday i asked you which
company would you want to win a plur
same sing in the battle for world market
share as they are currently tied at 70
4.5 million units sold in a quarter we
have fourteen hundred and 62 comments
thank you very much guys out of which
elecman and this says apple is slowly
asserting its dominance in the
resistance against android yeah why not
they seem to be the money Medina says
not because you sell millions of phones
does that make you good it's like saying
McDonald's has the best burgers because
they sell the most i prefer HTC or moto
you know the Moto X is probably one of
my favorite smartphones of all time I do
agree with you once the marketing hype
it's gone you get to see which phones
actually nail the things that you want
and I think that's the reason why same
thing is not succeeding anymore and then
8-bit says Samsung obviously doesn't
deserve the popularity it has people
still believe samsung phones are the
best android phones out there do the
same sinks aggressive advertisement
phone companies like Sony Oppo LG and
HTC should get more recognition in my
opinion I do agree with you too but I do
feel that these companies having such
great products should invest in
marketing a little more should invest
the distribution because what Samsung
does really good is not just marketing
it's the fact that you can buy a galaxy
note 4 on launch date almost everywhere
in the world and that is something to be
commendable and folks if you want to
