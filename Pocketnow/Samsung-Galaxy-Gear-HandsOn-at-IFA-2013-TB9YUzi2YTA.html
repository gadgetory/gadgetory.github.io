now it used to be that the pebble was
the only SmartWatch of note on the scene
that's not the case anymore we're here
at Berlin 2013 Eva this is the Samsung
Galaxy gear and we're going to check it
out so cuz this is the Samsung Galaxy
gear and one of the first things you'll
notice probably on film first of all
this it might be this glinting stainless
steel which feels really really nice in
person the second thing you might notice
is the thing to kind of wheel noticed is
that it looks kind of big it looks
ungainly it looks heavy it might look a
little clunky to you that's how it
looked to us on this giant screen here
at the event but you wear this thing you
get it on your wrist in person it
actually feels quite nice I don't have
the weight of the top of my head but it
is not much heavier on the wrist and the
pebble is and there's that screen pop
into life there this is a i believe it's
320 x 320 display there's the only
button on the device as a side key there
you use to wake it up you have obviously
the time you can double tap the screen
with two fingers for a more detailed
status with whether bluetooth is on your
battery level things like that update
and you've got these shortcuts here now
one of the cool things will jump into
this is called the not the memo makers
is this called the the memo grapher or
the mammography if you will and it is
just a case a camera built in here it's
capable of shooting 720 video it's
positioned so that you can you know you
have your your wrist here and you're
just point us up now oh cool what's
going on over there if you tap it
adjusts well it's in video mode right
now it'll shoot up to 10 seconds of
video and it will sync to your Galaxy
Note 3 or your other galaxy samsung
galaxy device dump them right to the
right to the device I'm just going to
try and get out of the options here back
is a simple swipe down from the top
bezel sorry guys i'm still learning the
interface here there's a snap you want
to take a silly just tap it focuses and
takes the shot go back you can always
return to the home screen from the side
button here but the rest of the
interface is all gesture-based you can
reach your contacts check out your call
logs all this obviously coming from the
phone or you have a certain amount of
apps third-party applications can be
written for the for the galaxy gear
these are some samples loaded on here as
well you see some familiar titles like
evernote in there as well as obviously
through the more common things like the
dialer Samsung's chat on line you can
redeem yourself you know me to narrator
but quite a few and the exciting thing
being of course that third-party
developers can build more let's go back
and swipe over once more their settings
to control this is obviously links via
bluetooth with your smart device so a
much more feature heavy and feature
centric SmartWatch than others we've
seen on the market this will become
available in October to anyone who would
like to buy one we will have some more
details and possibly a direct comparison
with
pebble at the head and finally one of
the few things that that sets it off or
excuse me one of the other primary
things that sets it up is that you can
make and take calls you don't just
initiate calls you can make n take calls
from the device it's a microphone down
here speaker phone in this unit here you
just bring your hand up to your head
like this and it's just wonderful I
actually don't know that I haven't taken
to call you but it feels wonderful
anyway Michael Fisher with the Samsung
Galaxy gear here at Aoife 2013 in Berlin
Tony behind the camera is a pretty cool
device we're going to check it out some
more stay tuned for more from pocket now
