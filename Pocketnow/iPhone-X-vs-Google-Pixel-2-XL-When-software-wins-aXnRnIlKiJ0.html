considers to be the future of the
smartphone this is the pixel to excel
what Google defines as an answer to
asking more of your phone it's hard to
declare a winner between my two favorite
smartphones of 2017 this is not really
an argument of iOS versus Android
because these phones are about much more
than their operating systems this is
more about which phone does what best
and if I had to pick only one well
prepare to be shocked I'm high metal you
got out with pocket now and this is
iPhone 10 versus Google pixel to excel
side by side it's clear that one company
has more experience building hardware
than the other the iPhone is dubbed a 10
because it celebrates 10 years of
history and this is barely Google's
second attempt at taking smartphones
seriously the result is an iPhone that
looks like nothing else call it the
visual future of you may well the pixel
to excel is more of an iteration of
current designs
it took Apple ten years to figure out
how to make an iPhone that's mostly
display and this serves certain
advantages over the pixel for starters
the 10 nearly kills the bezel with an
insane 83 percent screen to body ratio
compared to 76 this means that even if
both devices have nearly the same screen
size the pixel to excel is 14
millimeters taller 6 millimeters wider
0.2 millimetres thicker and one gram
heavier this is one of the main reasons
why it's really hard for me to leave the
iPhone it has a phablet screen on a
regular smartphone body
the iPhone also implements OLED in a
better way with more accurate colors and
less of a color shift when seen from an
angle it supports the latest standards
like Dolby vision and HDR 10 while we
still have no information from Google on
its claims about the only spot where the
pixel wins is in a bit more resolution
giving it 90 more pixels per inch the
fact that it abides to the 18 by 9
standard versus Apple's on 19.5 by 9 and
that this always-on display is very
handy also in the pixels of the fence
I'll give it points for its
implementation of stereo speakers I mean
yes the iPhone has a very loud solution
but the black bezels on the pixel match
with the front firing speakers have
proven to be more immersive for content
consumption calling a winner and build
quality is a tough one the stainless
steel frame is stronger than the pixels
aluminum the blend of glass on the
iPhone feels great in the hand but break
any portion of the back of the 10 and
you're looking at nearly $500 to get it
replaced only 1/3 of the pixels back is
made of glass the premier coating on the
aluminum contributes to a very nice feel
in the hand I'm gonna add the spec sheet
because I know a lot of you liked it but
these are the two phones where that list
doesn't really matter at all really in
what's most important for consumers the
iPhones hired to your storage option
doubles that of the pixel obviously for
more money only the iPhone has Qi
wireless charging given the glass back
the pixel abides to a more common
standard with a fingerprint scanner at
the back while the iPhones new party
trick is face ID whether you like it or
not and yes both devices are ip67 water
and dust resistant
now for those of you that thought that
the iPhone won the comparison only
through hardware well that's about to
change if the iPhone seemed like more of
the future when it comes to the hardware
and design the future of software
belongs to the pixel to excel now this
is not me calling Android better but
this is me saying that Google is doing a
better job at evolving its origins like
for example the whole purpose of having
a phablet is to be able to do more with
your display given the added screen
real-estate but it seems that Apple
hasn't really gotten that memo Android
Oreo allows the pixel to have picture in
picture mode for content consumption
just like every other Android phone
there's also split window multitasking
it's dense approach to the launcher
gives users flexibility to show whatever
you want wherever you want on the screen
and these Google Earth wallpapers are
simply awesome now in the iPhone tends
the fence I have to admit that this new
gesture approach to the UI feels very
natural swipe up for home just like if
you were throwing the app to the
launcher swipe to the site to quickly
switch between applications swipe down
for reach ability all these gestures
make much more sense in the combination
of home button presses that existed
before I also love how you can set
notifications that only show on the
lockscreen whenever the phone detects
your face like seriously every phone
should do this about the only change
that I don't praise is having
notifications via swipe from the top
left and control center and swipe from
the top right and last but not least the
fact that iOS 11 still looks pretty much
like iOS one where Android has aged very
well with Oreo and when it comes to the
user experience we're gonna continue
adding points in favor of the pixel and
not the only thing where both phones are
comparable is in the fluidness of their
user interfaces since you really won't
see stutter or lag either way it doesn't
really matter if you're playing a game
or if you're moving around apps or
services I'm gonna get phone calls to
the pixel to excel as well sound this
both louder and deeper over the earpiece
though the experience through the
speaker is nearly identical
and speaking of calls one of the major
reasons why it's so
hard for me to leave a pixel this
project phi google's MVNO is extremely
reliable in the US and sid jumps between
the networks of three carriers it's also
invaluable for travel given its
inexpensive approach to roaming first of
all it's now pretty much unlimited for a
lot less money than the cost of
unlimited on other carriers and you know
what I'm also gonna give the battery
life topic to the pixel historically
iPhone tablets have been more efficient
about power management but you can
scratch the iPhone 10 from the list
seriously I can barely reach end of day
on a single charge performing worse than
even the small iPhone 8 pixel on the
other hand is a beast those of you
looking for endurance this is one of
those phones were the last thing you'll
be looking at is the battery icon
throughout the day and then the final
nail in the coffin of the iPhone 10
let's talk about these cameras now this
claimer I'm not saying that the iPhone
10 takes bad photos on the contrary it
takes great photos but you'd have to
compare the results of the pixel to
understand what I mean I used this night
shot to explain the difference to my
friends look at the iPhone shot you can
clearly see that a flash was used and
that there's good detail for a night
shot okay this is that same photo taken
by the pixel to excel no there are no
filters on this photo and notice how on
the pixel you can see the bar behind us
where on the iPhone it's barely
noticeable okay
this is what I mean the pixel to excel
just annihilates every single smartphone
camera of 2017 for the sake of this
comparison both phones do great during
the day with awesome detail and
saturation and the same can be said at
night but the pixel software approach to
photography ensures a delightful and
steady photo every single time to the
iPhones defense I'd call its photos more
accurate to what the eye is currently
seeing the results from the pixel are
more eye pleasing
and I'm sorry iPhone 10 but your
portrait mode is terrible the tricks are
nice but accuracy feels more like an
alpha and not really a beta and all this
with the added depth sensor on the
selfie camera and the secondary lens on
the primary this phone has a hard time
detecting borders and it completely
butchers glass it definitely needs work
by contrast the pixel gets it right most
of the time it's not perfect and it
doesn't have the tricks of the iphone 10
but for a phone that lacks extra
hardware and does everything through
software I have to say I'm extremely
impressed
I'll give points to the iPhone and video
recording given how it does 240 frames
per second at 1080p and 4k recording at
60 frames per second
still video from both devices in normal
conditions is very well implemented
regardless and then finally I'm gonna
call this a tie when it comes to storage
management surely the pixel has an edge
because it does give you free cloud
storage on Google Drive for your photos
but apples adoption of HT b/c
compression makes media consume very
little space on the phone so bottom line
if I had to declare a winner if I was
forced to pick one phone out of the
iPhone 10 and the Google pixel to excel
believe it or not but I would choose the
pixel really the main reason why I stick
to the iPhone centers because I love the
design approach giving me a phablet for
a smaller form factor I'm also a big fan
of the Apple watch series 3 particularly
for fitness which requires an iPhone and
yes applications like snapchat looked
better on the iPhone for reasons I don't
understand along with some other odd
variants as an ecosystem but then again
that's about it and absolutely
everything else it's really hard to live
without the pixel to excel it's less
expensive than the iPhone 10 project
fire has become a need this is seriously
the best smartphone camera in the
industry and the overall delight of a
better implementation of Android is
really hard to look away from it's
seriously amazing how software can make
a less appealing smartphone win a
comparison
even with all the complaints that Google
ended up ironing out over time the pixel
to excel has proven to be a great
companion one that I would highly
recommend is the smarter smartphone
overall but one of those cases where he
just actually have to go out and give it
a try to understand what I mean what
about you which one would you pick out
of these to chime in the comments and
