compare hi I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the Samsung Galaxy
Tab 3 10.1 vs. the Nexus 10 until last
year the tablet industry was still
largely dominated by Apple and while
Apple still leads the market share race
by a significant margin Android tablet
manufacturers are closing the gap
especially Samsung like with its
smartphones it saturated the market with
galaxy brand offering a wide array of
sizes specifications and price points in
fact Samsung offers so many different
tablets it's created some overlap
similar products that are competing
against one another or cannibalization
the company released the first full-size
Nexus tablet in November of last year
the Nexus 10 and just weeks ago it
announced the third-generation Galaxy
Tab 10.1 the two devices have although
the same pricing structure yet offer
quite different specifications but which
one is the better tablet that's what
we're here to find out
externally these two tablets have their
fair share of differences the Nexus 10
is one of the only Samsung devices in
the last several years to deviate from
Samsung's standard design language and
rightfully so it's one of the only
Android powered Samsung tablets that
doesn't bear the galaxy moniker unlike
practically every other Samsung device
the Nexus 10 does not feature the
metallic trim around the bezel features
a classy grippy soft touch coating over
the back and sides of the chassis and it
doesn't feature the Samsung branding on
the front also because it is a nexus it
features on screen navigation buttons
not the custom Samsung button layout a
physical home button with the capacitive
menu and back buttons to the left and
right respectively
the Tab 3 10.1 on the other hand is
unmistakably part of the galaxy brand
despite this larger size that closely
resembles practically every other
Samsung device made in the last two
years with of course the exception of
the Nexus 10 it bears the same branding
button layout and design language as a
Galaxy Note 8.0 galaxy s4 etc with that
said the Nexus 10 isn't entirely unlike
galaxy branded devices in fact there are
certain similarities which are telltale
signs it's a Samsung device that these
two tablets are more related than one
might initially think the power and
volume button placement are similar both
are located on the top left edge the
overall shape isn't terribly different
and the intricate details like the
machined speaker grilles reveal how
closely related these two tablets truly
are
despite the ever so slightly smaller
display the Nexus 10 is larger in all
dimensions as well as heavier the Nexus
10 is two hundred and sixty three point
nine millimeters wide 177 point six
millimeters tall eight point nine
millimeters thick and hits the scales at
603 grams the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is 240
3.1 millimeters wide 176 point one
millimeters tall eight millimeters thick
and 510 grams that's a noticeable twenty
point eight millimeters wider one point
six millimeters taller 0.9 millimeters
thicker and 93 grams heavier
specifications also set these two
tablets apart the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is
practically a Galaxy Tab two 10.1 with a
slightly smaller battery and an Intel
Atom processor it features the 10.1 is
display at 1280 by 800 pixels one
gigabyte of RAM 16 or 32 gigabytes of
fixed storage with a micro SD card slot
3.1 megapixel rear camera 1.3 megapixel
front facing camera a sixty eight
hundred million power battery and a 1.6
gigahertz dual core Intel Atom z20 560
chip the Nexus 10 has a 10.05 5-inch
display at a resolution of 2560 by 1600
pixels
two gigabytes of RAM 16 or 32 gigabytes
of built-in storage a 5 megapixel
primary camera 1.9 megapixel front
camera
9 thousand milliamp power battery and a
1.7 gigahertz dual core Exynos 5250 chip
despite being bigger and heavier if we
were to pick a single winner in the
hardware department the Nexus 10 wins by
a landslide
the Tab 3 10.1 is composed of the very
same hyper glazed finished plastic as
found on the galaxy s4 it's a
fingerprint and scratch magnet and
literally impossible to keep clean and
very little about it feels premium it's
sturdy and the frame doesn't flex or
creak but the button configuration feels
out of place on a 10-inch tablet which
will primarily be used in landscape and
its specifications leave much to be
desired the Nexus 10 however is one of
the more premium feeling Android tablets
and while its Exynos chipset may not be
the most powerful ever it has an
additional gig of ram and much larger
battery and a display that's in an
entirely different league than the tap 3
10.1 s in color reproduction contrast
and viewing angle the Tab 3 10.1 has a
noticeable advantage but the displayed
resolution is a major disadvantage at
virtually the same display size the
Nexus 10 features four times the pixels
2560 by 1600 pixels to the Tab 3 10.1 s
paltry 1280 by 800 pixels in terms of
density the Nexus 10 has double the PPI
300 pixels per inch to the Tab 3 10.1 s
149 PPI there's noticeable pixelation
around the edges of home screen icons
with the tap 3 10.1 and it's largely
reminiscent of tablets from 2011 for a
$400 introductory price we can't help
but feel the display on the Galaxy Tab 3
10.1 is unacceptable especially when you
consider the display resolution on the
Nexus 10 and the fact that many high-end
smartphones bear 1080p resolution hands
down the Nexus 10 is the winner and
hardware the software and lease to
Samsung tablets is quite different as
well while both come with Android
version 4.2.2 the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1
comes with a diluted version of TouchWiz
and the Nexus 10 offers the purest stock
Android experience
switching between the Nexus 10 and the
Tab 3 10.1 is
much like switching between the standard
galaxy s4 and the Google Play edition
galaxy s4
however the tap 3 10.1 takes one of our
longest standing issues with Android and
amplifies it many Android applications
are not optimized for use with tablets
and wastes a ton of display space by not
utilizing paned windows or split views
likewise it feels like Samsung failed to
fully optimize TouchWiz for its latest
10-inch tablet between Ice Cream
Sandwich and jelly bean Google aims to
streamline the different Android
experiences on tablets and smartphones
in 4.2 stock Android tablets received a
quick settings pane to the right while
the notification shade remains a
pulldown menu on the left
it keeps notifications tight and concise
the TouchWiz notification shade on the
tab 3 is full screen not divided between
a quick setting shade and the
notifications and we understand why this
is Samsung incorporates its quick
toggles in the notification shade in
TouchWiz but there's still a button in
the top right corner which is meant to
reveal more quick settings however only
the notifications disappear when you
press the button there are no more
toggles to display or add to the bar and
the version of TouchWiz on the tab 3
feels poorly optimized and rough around
the edges throughout use for example
it's missing some of the most useful
important pieces of TouchWiz there is no
multi window feature though the arguably
useless feature smart stay is included
the Nexus 10 is a definite change of
pace the software on the Nexus tablet
has been perfectly crafted to work well
with the larger display updates are
promised to come directly from Google
shortly after a new firmware version is
announced and of course it features all
the Android 4.2 features the tab 3 is
missing such as multi-user support all
the software talk means very little
without a performance comparison
primarily we're very impressed with the
Intel Atom chipset found on the Galaxy
Tab 3 10.1 it's snappy and in general
was quicker to load applications than
the Exynos chip set in the Nexus 10 the
intelligible aoz for smoother scrolling
it returns home more quickly after you
disable the s4 shortcut and simply put
its a powerful chip even in synthetic
benchmarks the 1.6 gigahertz dual-core
Intel Atom chip has proven to be a more
powerful chip than the 1.7 gigahertz
dual core Exynos in antutu for example
the Tab 3 10.1 consistently scored over
20000 whereas the Nexus 10 struggled to
keep up with a consistent score in the
13
thousand range but if we left it at that
we'd only be grazing the surface the
Nexus 10 has twice the RAM meaning it's
much better suited for multitasking
after opening just a handful of
applications on the tab 3 some
previously opened applications would be
purged from memory and would have to
reload where the Nexus 10 could easily
pick up where we just left minutes
before in the multimedia department the
Nexus 10 has several clear advantages of
the Tab 3 10.1 as well two of those are
display quality and resolution and
front-facing speakers the Tab 3 10.1
speakers are on the left and right edges
toward the top and if you happen to hold
the tablet a certain way it's easy to
cover the speakers up the speakers on
the Nexus 10 spend the majority of the
left and right edges of the face of the
tablet are louder since they're facing
you and are virtually impossible to
cover up on purpose much less
accidentally battery life is difficult
to comment on just yet as we haven't had
a chance to fully put the Galaxy Tab 3
10.1 through a thorough test on paper
the Nexus 10 is a champion with a 9000
milliamp hour battery to the tab 360 800
million power battery but you can't
directly compare salmon or by milliamp
hours the Tab 3 is running an Intel Atom
processor in the Nexus 10 uses Samsung's
own Exynos chip so for the better life
between the two tablet seems comparable
but for more on the Tab 3 10.1 salmon ah
stay tuned for the full review next week
the cameras if you're into that sort of
thing on a tablet are quite different
though the 3.1 megapixel camera on the
tab 3 is therefore technicality purposes
it produces low quality shots that lack
detail and vibrant color the Nexus 10's
camera isn't quite as nice as a modern
flagship smartphones camera but it
certainly performs quite a bit better
than that tab 3s meagre image sensor the
more we use the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 the
more we find ourselves questioning why
Samsung even bothered making the tab 3
in a 10 inch model better yet we're
wondering why Samsung failed to bring it
up to speed so to speak with other
10-inch tablets it's not markedly
cheaper nor does it have impressive
specifications other current generation
10 inch tablets from Samsung negate the
need for the Tab 3 10.1 especially
considering it starts at $400 the like
design Galaxy Note 10.1 is better in
almost every way it has an S Pen a fully
developed version of TouchWiz and a more
than capable processor although it is
$100 more and the Nexus 10 cost the same
and has a much better display more
and software that actually feels like it
was meant for a tablet it's not that the
Tab 3 10.1 is a bad tablet though it's
just that it doesn't make a lot of sense
the only notable difference between it
and the last generation 10 inch Galaxy
Tab is the Intel processor and while
we're happy to see the Intel processors
at play we're almost certain Samsung
could have found a better tablet to put
an Intel chip in this time around the
Nexus 10 wins by a rather wide margin
it's a no brainer that's gonna wrap it
