yours is not far off not funny too much
sarcasm very opinionated and what are
you doing here this is YouTube you
should be in CNN i'ma that was one of
the slowest outros you've ever made I
caught every word and and have to delete
that video and start it all over again
that's right it's that time of the week
I am hi mera mera this is pocket now and
this is our pocket now daily recap for
last week so last Monday I asked you
what would you price the nexus 5 after
all the leak specification info we've
got a ton of leaks almost everything we
need to know about this phone and we
have 966 comments out of which for
example aaron says honestly if they
would allow for expandable memory and
keep it at the same price range neither
apple nor samson can't match it and yes
you have a very solid point but keep in
mind subsidies for example one of the
biggest advantages that companies have
that Google does not want to have a
subsidies and given the price of the
Nexus 5 that makes sense but still the
subsidies are really what lures a lot of
people into getting other phone Stanley
says I price it at 299 for the baseball
and they would just kill competition and
yes 299 would be just an insane price
tag we've got some links of 349 which
really make more sense for me
particularly I think that that's like
the price that they're gonna go for at
least for the base model we've got a lot
of links to back that up still 2 99
would be just amazing and the official
praxis 299 for the 16 gig model no
contract 349 for the 32 gig model no
contract and yes 46 thumbs up because
that would be like the dream price tag
though I would wish that for those fifty
dollars of the extra price that would
just give us more options and you know
what if they would give me a
fifty-dollar option to get expandable
storage like the first comment this
would be the perfect phone then on
Tuesday I asked you if you would buy the
galaxy round we had some links of this
phone that day and then the next day it
got released and it's probably one of
the funniest things I've ever seen so
much so that we have 1152 comments out
of which chris says ridiculous it looks
okay but what's so amazing about it
gimmick from Samsung yes for me this is
like the first part bar gimmick that
I've ever really seen I don't find
point in a round of display and
especially when it's rounded from side
to side a lot of people say that it's
for one-handed usability this phone is
just so big that you still have to
require monster hands like mine for that
to even make sense and Carl says I
prefer 3d over this round prep and no
I'm not gonna agree with you 3d
smartphone displays already existed and
they were terrible they were just so bad
that nobody even bottom cared the phones
were just so thick that it just did not
make sense so I'm sadly not gonna agree
with you and Vanilli says poor rich
Samsung and you know what Samsung is one
of those companies that's actually
setting the bar for R&amp;amp;D they're not just
spending money on it they're also
publishing what they've got and you know
they're doing it because they can but
I'm not gonna debate it because the
Galaxy Note lineup was born out of
something like this and it worked people
like it so if they have the money to
spend and they're willing to throw it
out there then why not I love the fact
that the experiment though some of these
things just don't make sense then on
Wednesday I asked you if you would buy a
device that dual boots Android and
Windows Phone because the news were
about Microsoft actually pushing certain
OEMs to do it you know not necessarily
on their owns here but actually
Microsoft incentivizing for this to
happen and so we have 691 comments out
of which dual OS hmm i wonder if a 16
gigabyte galaxy s4 would have any space
left and yeah that would definitely be a
promise but remember that this is the
other way around this is actually
windows products they want to run
Android and if that were stock Android
that would be amazing that another
commoner says dual boot is useless for
android users it's just the way from
Microsoft to have more users and you
know it's funny that we're actually
talking about this now because so many
years ago this would have been unheard
of Microsoft was so big it was the
dominating company to dominating force
of Technology and now they're actually
looking for ways to get other operating
systems to work on theirs which is just
odd and for those of you that wonder if
you to do it in apple products yes but--
chem has existed for the longest time
and that's one way that Apple try to get
mac user so yeah Microsoft is doing the
same i'm not going to blame and
francisco says dual boot equals nokia
salvation and we've dreamed about this
imagine a Lumia 1020 running
Android I don't have anything against
Windows Phone the problem is really the
fact that the things that i use on it
are not available we use a lot of Google
services here at market now so it's
pretty much useless for me and most the
team but still if we had the option to
run android on that thing it would be
just the perfect phone in my personal
opinion then on Thursday I asked you if
you like what HTC was planning with the
fingerprint scanner of the HTC One next
because back then the phone was not
released yet and the rumors were that
you can launch specific applications
with different fingers which you can
actually do in a very terrible way so we
have 378 comments out of which yeah it's
just the bloated HTC One and it's stupid
and you know sadly that's our opinion as
well there is really no point in such a
big phone and I'm talking about that's
much bigger than the Galaxy Note 3 there
is just no point of a bigger phone if
you really can't do more with that
bigger display except for gaming which
is actually not necessarily bad again
but it's just a bigger HTC One that you
don't really have to put up then another
commoner says how am I supposed to hold
the phone with my thumb on its back and
you know probably one of the things that
Michael Fisher said in his review that
made a lot of sense was that that
fingerprint scanner at the back was
really uncomfortable if you have your
phone on the table and the fingerprint
scanning technology was terrible it
almost never works so it was kind of
pointless and mama doe 25 says if it
works HTC will kill the 5s and sadly no
it did not work and finally on Friday I
asked you if you would buy an iphone 5c
if the price would draw because back
then the rumors were or pretty much the
confirmation that Apple is actually
sharing a lot of phones they're not
meeting their goals and they have a lot
of iphone 5 season stock up to the point
where they're not really ordering more
five seats for manufacturers and just
sticking with the stock that they have
for the holiday season and we've got
1130 comments out of which one of them
says why buy iphone when you can have a
much more advanced device for the same
price and yeah in the case of something
like the nexus for the future Nexus 5
the iphone 5c is just not going to make
sense and Mohammed says I wouldn't buy
the iphone 5c if it were fifty percent
cheaper and if you're talking about a
contract pricey as if it were free on
contract it would make sense but they'll
forget about that price for an unlocked
phone it's just not going to
and then Alexandra says the problem is
not the price but the fact that this is
the same phone over and over again and
you make a very solid point and I'm
actually going to talk about that in
both ways number one it is so close to
the iphone 5s that for an extra hundred
bucks I'd rather buy the higher end
model and then on the other side I mean
think about it you can get an iphone 5
on ebay for a much cheaper price than
the iphone 5c and keep the 5s design so
it really does not make sense for you to
buy the iphone 5c overall even if they
drop the price they would still have to
make a compelling case meaning subsidies
or whatever for that phone to make sense
so great comment there thats it for our
pocket now daily recap thank you very
