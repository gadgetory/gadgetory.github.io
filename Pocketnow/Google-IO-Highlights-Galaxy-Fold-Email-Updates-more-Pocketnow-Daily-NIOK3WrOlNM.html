interesting features for all Android
devices and more information on Android
cue the pixel 3a and 3a Excel have
finally been presented and they seem
very promising and Samsung uh sent an
email to galaxy fold customers with
options to cancel their purchase
I'm hi meadow Iveta reporting from
Google i/o 2019 probably one of the
coolest events I've ever covered this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals those of you in
the market for smart home speakers
tablets Amazon currently has a ton of
deals where the original echo is
currently just 20 bucks in addition to
other options depending on what you're
looking for you can find more in the
description now let's talk about Samsung
and their recent email to Galaxy Feld
owners where they're like yeah you know
the fact that you pre-ordered your
device doesn't guarantee your pre-order
and you have to confirm by May 31st or
it's going to get cancelled and there's
no confirmation on when you're getting
the fold but it's yeah I know it drives
a lot of insecurities over what the
future of this is going to be they're
saying that it's still gonna launch
obviously we're looking forward to it
and we'll be reporting as soon as we
find out more now let's talk about
Google i/o probably one of the most
interesting ways to start the
presentation is we put the whole revamp
of nest the fact that Google home pretty
much doesn't exist anymore now it's all
going to be nest everything under that
brand and during that process we saw the
new Google no wait it's the nest hub max
which is pretty much a home hub only on
steroids and that's actually called the
nest cub now I'm really looking forward
to this product the price point 2:29
you'll learn more in the description
about that as well and obviously one of
the major highlights of the events was
the pixel 3 a pixel 3 a excel I have my
unit here we have a full hands-on video
of all the coverage definitely I was not
expecting to be so impressed by this
phone mainly because it is definitely a
mid-range err but once you see how it
performs you really can't tell the
difference between this in a pixel
obviously it leads us to question what
will be the future of the regular pixels
obviously we can get the same experience
for a lessor price tag there are major
differences let us know in the comments
of you like a comparison between this
and the regular pixel so far I have to
say
I really like this fellow you learn more
about it in our hands on and finally the
hottest news today definitely was
everything else that was announced at
Google i/o particularly the changes that
are coming to the Google assistance oh
my god like the fact that now you
require a lot less data to use it the
fact that you can interact with it
dynamically we saw maps AR which for
everybody that's ever used walking
directions in New York City you'll
understand how important this is
we saw major changes in our mented
reality so many things in today's
question let us know what did you like
the most about everything that we saw
today at Google i/o if you haven't seen
the keynote I highly recommend that you
do for me honestly it was all the
changes in accessibility features for
people that can't read or write being
able to use google lens for example
those things really moved me about this
presentation I liked it a lot that's
just me leave us a comment down below we
looked in your case friends again if you
