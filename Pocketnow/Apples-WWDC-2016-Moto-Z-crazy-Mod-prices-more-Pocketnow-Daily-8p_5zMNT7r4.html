major updates to software Microsoft has
just acquired linkedin for a very
significant sum of money and if you're
going crazy over the motorola moto mods
think again I'm hi Mary vera and I trust
me I tried recording this with
sunglasses and I just hate the fact that
the lights just reflect over all of them
so let's just get the news over with
this is pocket out daily
as we try every day the official news
begin with deals as those of you in the
market for the HTC 10 there is an extra
added bonus to sweeten the pot well
there are actually three but the two
cool ones are the fifty dollars off the
you a health box which is probably one
of my favorite products this year and if
not the Jabra studio pro headphones are
also available that's a hundred dollars
pretty much so you can learn more on the
link in the description other official
news have to do with Microsoft a company
stock is currently down and it could
probably be because they just announced
that it acquired LinkedIn for 26.2
billion dollars now for those of you
that are not fans of length in which
includes me that's probably because you
get a ton of spam email over who view
your profile or how many companies are
already hiring etc etc there's not
necessarily something wrong at least the
social network serves a purpose but it
makes us wonder exactly what Microsoft
is planning as a it is pretty much a
social network it's a tool but a social
network after those of you that got all
hyped up over the modularity of the Moto
Z and the moto mods and everything oh
wow we've got some trusted sources
claiming that Verizon internals are
claiming the price tags and listen to
this if you're buying the projector that
thing's going to cost you 300 bucks as
if it's even as good enough as a
projector but yeah 300 bucks and then in
addition to that you'll pay a hundred
dollars for the battery pack and some of
these backs are up to eighty dollars in
the case with designer ones that is a
crazy amount of money but hey I guess
lenovo motorola and verizon know
something we don't you know what I take
it back i think that motorola doesn't
really know how to satisfy customers
with the recent news that the Moto 360
first generation is not receiving
Android wear two point oh so Android
wear 2 point 0 is the new update that we
heard at Google i/o and the first
generation model of the 360 is not
getting it I assume because of the old
and clunky hardware but it's just funny
a few days ago I said that this was
still one of my favorite smartwatches
now I understand why there was such a
major discount
and finally the very hot news today was
apple's WWDC 2016 believe it or not
there was no hardware announced that
this event but still hey we've got some
major news when it comes to software
particularly because Apple made it a big
deal it's for platforms starting with
watch os3 iOS 10 TV OS and now Mac OS
because it's no longer being called OS
10 a lot of communication between these
applications the announcement is so
major that I really didn't even want to
spend time in this video because there's
a separate video that deals with it
specifically so I'm just gonna go
straight to the question of the day and
ask you if you are disappointed that
Apple did not announce any hardware this
event in my case I'm actually not I
wanted an Apple watch now I don't
because apparently watch os3 is going to
fix it and the pay it's great that you
spent 350 dollars more than a year ago
and that still worth something today but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends you know
the way it goes if you want to get these
news earlier before the videos filmed
