pocketnow.com
if you have a Windows mobile device but
you really like the way that the the
iPhone icons allow you to scroll from
pain to pain and then you can tap and
hold to move them around on the screen
then there's an interface out there by
veto technology that you may like a lot
it's called winter face and I'm gonna
show it to you now okay right now I'm
running winter face on an HTC touch pro
but this should work on any Q VGA or VGA
windows mobile device haven't tested it
yet with a device like the Touch HD
though it should work so we turn it on
and we get a slide to unlock screen so
we just slide our finger across and here
we get a screen that just like the
iPhone has a row of icons and we can
flip to the right and see on the bottom
where we are along with the icons now
the skin that you see here is actually a
skin that I downloaded from
xda-developers and I'll post a link on
how to get that for free if I go up to
menu and options we can change the skin
to something else and let me show you
what bite looks like this is what light
looks like so much larger icons don't
like it as much so I'm gonna switch it
back to the other one that we had on the
screen unfortunately it's really just a
an application launcher it's really
nothing more than that it doesn't go
deeper than that except for the contacts
as far as I could find so far if I click
on the name of somebody I've added as a
contact you get their contact
information here and in within the same
interface which is kind of nice and you
can you know have people's pictures on a
screen if you want to have the first
panel all filled up with people that you
call a lot with their pictures you can
do that too now to move around icons you
tap and hold and just like on the iPhone
the the icons will jiggle and you can
tap and hold another icon to drag it
around on the screen or if you get it
just right you can slide it to the panel
on the right although it's not working
for me right now let me try that this
way yeah so goes to the first panel you
can drop it you tap on the d-pad to stop
them
from jiggling now something else that
this does is it lets you do access the
winter face interface quite easily if
you're within a program so you do a
gesture the gesture is a upside-down V
like so let me try it see it goes right
into winter face so that's a really good
addition I think so that you can get
back into the program launcher if you're
in a program in addition the winter face
program has a second gesture that allows
you to close programs with a regular
write your regular V so just like that
and the application will close so just a
little bit of enhancement I think to
help with some basic windows mobile
functions so overall I think winter face
is a good program launcher and by the
way it works in landscape which is good
that said it costs $20 which i think is
kind of high for something that simply
launches programs I think a good price
for this would be ten dollars and then
it would be worth it but at 20 dollars I
think it's a little too expensive to to
be to be worth the price so that is
winter face version 1.3 that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
