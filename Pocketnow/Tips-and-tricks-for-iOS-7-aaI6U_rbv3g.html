official iOS 7 software but you're still
trying to find your way around I'm
Taylor Martin this is pocket now and
these are some Iowa 7 tips and tricks so
iOS 7 is finally officially here the
update was just released to the public
into anyone who is using it for the very
first time the interface will look and
feel radically different from before
it's the first major UI overhaul since
iOS was first released in 2007 along
with all the visual changes though there
are several new helpful features that
are immediately visible or a parent so
we've created a short list of helpful
tips and tricks for iOS 7 on both the
lock screen and home screen if you tilt
your phone around you will notice the
wallpaper shifts below the icons this
gives a home and lock screens a depth
effect which Apple calls the parallax
effect it's neat for a while but after
some time it becomes something that
fades into the background and you
eventually forget about it fortunately
you can disable this feature with
minimal effort no jailbreak required
open the settings application open the
general submenu accessibility reduce
motion and toggle the switch to the on
position this will effectively kill the
parallax animation until you want to
show it off again have you ever had
someone who simply would not stop
calling or messaging you well if you do
rest assured iOS has your back within
both the phone and messaging settings
submenus there is a setting called
blocked within it you can add blocked
contacts that you will no longer receive
text messages I messages calls or
FaceTime requests from to unblock simply
slide the blocked contact to the left
and hit the unlock button app updates
can become a chore to keep up with if
you have a ton of applications installed
on your iOS device I usually forget to
check often and end up having to update
dozens of apps at a time in iOS 7 you
can set music apps and updates to
download automatically go to the iTunes
and App Store sub menu and settings and
toggle the ones you want to the on
position if you find you're using too
much data on app updates it may be wise
to leave the use cellular data button
beneath in the off position
when Notification Center and banner
notifications were added to iOS there
was no ideal way to dismiss banners okay
well there was but we're not even sure
it was intentional flicking the banner
to the sides what do anything but you
could pull down on the notification and
flick it back up to dismiss now you can
simply flick notifications upwards to
dismiss them it's quick and it works
most of the time unfortunately it
doesn't feel all that natural the
greatest part of iOS 7 is the
accessibility of certain aspects
Notification Center and control center
are accessible from virtually anywhere
in iOS 7 even the lock screen while
that's great if you're wanting to keep
prying eyes out of your notifications
and their fingers off your device
controls you may want to adjust your
control center and Notification Center
access in their respective sub menus in
the Settings app you can toggle which
views are available for notification
center today or notifications views or
control center from the lock screen you
can also disable control center access
from within apps but we're not sure why
you would want to do that task switching
has never been a high point of iOS it's
clunky and fairly useful in iOS 7 things
are a little bit better at the very
least it looks a lot better and you
don't have to tap the miniature x
buttons to close out of all of the open
apps simply double press the home button
to open the task switcher and flick up
like in webos to dismiss and force close
an open application looking for the time
you sent or received a particular
message you may notice the time stamp is
no longer shown in the default view like
it used to be an iMessage on iOS 6 but
revealing that information is extremely
simple pull any message bubble to the
left and all the time stamps will be
shown this keeps the message view a lot
cleaner without making it too difficult
to find out when a particular message
was sent tired of the old Siri voice I
found 15 sushi restaurants in Charlotte
if so head over to the series settings
within the general submenu in the
Settings app from there you can change
the gender of series standard female
voice to male up to 75 degrees
Fahrenheit both are still quite robotic
though
finally as of June this year there were
over 900,000 applications and games
available in Apple's App Store that's a
ton of applications and it's not
unrealistic to want more apps than you
can afford in the latest version of the
app store you can save apps to a wish
list for purchasing later navigate to
the application you want hit the share
button that's the square with an arrow
pointing through the top and hit save to
wish list that's going to do it for this
time but inevitably there going to be
more hidden software features discovered
in the future if you have your own tips
