is the best smartphone camera on one
corner we have the huawei mate 20 pro
the contender with the most amount of
hardware and smartphone photography on
the other corner we have the Google
pixel 3 excel the contender claimed to
be the best at software and obviously
the camera needs a phone to power the
show so it's time for yet another tough
comparison I'm hey metal you got on with
pocket now and this is wall we made 20
Pro versus Google pixel 3xl you know
they say that smart phones are getting
boring
that they're just the same see of flat
slabs with zero innovation and looks at
least two devices defy that premise to a
certain degree but only one wins the
beauty contest and I'm actually gonna
give that one to the huawei mate 20 Pro
it's as if Huawei took more time to
refine its design from the metal trim to
the curves in the front and the back so
even the arrangement of the minor bezels
on the screen the pixel isn't as pretty
but I do feel more comfortable holding
it because of the matte finish in the
glass and also because even if the pixel
is one millimeter tolerant for
millimeters wider the mate 20 pro is
nearly a millimeter thicker and 5 grams
heavier so you will notice a difference
while holding the pixel it just feels
lighter yes both devices have an OLED
display both are capable of quad HD plus
resolution and both come with a notch
sadly the one on the pixel is seriously
offensive once you match the chin try
watching anything in 18 by 9 and you'll
get my point the display is also
significantly dimmer on the pixel making
it less ideal for direct sunlight really
the only spot where I give it points is
in the dual firing speakers yes the mate
20 pro includes a great display it is
curved and it does include a pair of
dual firing speakers but it doesn't
stand a chance against the quality of
the pixel when it comes to audio
internals are also wall waste territory
yes both have powerful processors but
the main 20 Pro has more RAM start
setting more store
has a larger battery and then adds
extras like including faster charging in
the box has reversible wireless charging
is dual SIM plus expandable storage if
we can find the right chip and even
includes an IR blaster which is so hard
to find today yes both have fingerprint
scanners I'd call the pixels faster and
the tad more reliable but the mate Tony
Pro is more futuristic with newer
technology on the display I give extra
points the facial recognition of the
main 20 Pro because I also rarely use
the fingerprint scanner by that time the
phone is already unlocked and it's not
like if I'm trying to justify the knotch
yes facial recognition is convenient but
I do find the wide-angle selfie camera
on the pixel to be my favorite option
you think that by now the comparison is
already won by the may 20 pro but we're
about to talk about software this is a
territory that belongs to the pixel and
I am no Android purist I just find the
pixel launcher to be more thought-out
and useful I also prefer it visually
given its fonts widget selection and
live wallpaper options it's really
stunning now neither of these phones has
my choice for gestural controls and I
would say that I am quite annoyed by the
pixel pill but I do love the fact that I
could squeeze this phone to get the
Google assistant something that's kind
of a thing to fumble with on the May 20
Pro I'm not saying the always gestures
are bad it's just that they're sometimes
a tad confusing and it's just that these
are harder to manipulate when you have a
curved screen
honestly software is a matter of taste I
know people who actually prefer EMU eyes
resemblance to iOS and especially if
they just switch from an iPhone I just
feel that the pixel has less gimmicks
and less of a learning curve than
everything else also keep in mind of the
pixel 3 excel will receive the latest
version of Android first though I'm
hoping that the main 20 pro will do just
as good as it launched pretty much very
close to the pixel already with Android
Pi now one particular area where I won't
really complain about either devices in
the experience of using them surely that
made 20 Pro has better internals but you
won't really notice much of a difference
even if the UI on the main 20 Pro is
Spartan animations you really won't be
able to say that the pixel is any slower
games on either phone and these will
perform great as well it's not really
until you test battery life that you
notice a significant difference this one
is won by the May 20 pro the battery
life from Huawei is simply not normal
you can end the day and then some
without a problem where in the case of
the pixel you will end the day and
that's about it but I'm not gonna praise
Huawei and everything the amount of
bloat in the May 20 Pro is crazy and I'm
not talking about carrier bloat I'm
talking about Huawei applications that
compete with Google services for reasons
that I don't understand it's got its own
Fitness app wellness application app
gallery I don't really find the benefit
in these well in the case of Google
there are some perks like free full
resolution google photos on your pixel
so right about now it is time to start
the comparison that everybody was
waiting for when it comes to the camera
which device wins if you look at the
spec sheets you claim that Huawei just
demolishes Google based on hardware
there are scenarios where that is true
since you really can't be physics but
then there are cases where even with
physics the pixel is just amazing during
the day both cameras are champs great
color detail and saturation I drift more
towards the may 20 Pro because its
results are more leica where even grain
is a feature where some pixel photos
tend to look too good to be true I also
prefer the May 20 Pro and zooming it's
best for street photography and full
digital zoom the added megapixels will
not disappoint you in detail where in
the case of the pixel it does have
software features to help zooming but
again you just can't beat physics night
sight on the pixel is great I've been
able to pull detail from the sky that
even my standard camera would require a
tripod to capture but man night boat on
the May 20 Pro is just fantastic I also
find the May 20 pros option better in
its level of detail but I do have to
admit there are cases where certain
photos look cartoony in certain
scenarios where the pixel might be a bit
more true to life
you'd also assume that the pixel wins in
portraits because of its fame they I but
that's a matter of taste the pixel is
more aggressive and to a certain degree
even thick looking about bouquet not the
made twenty pro and this one I do prefer
more natural results and the made twenty
pro is just really hard to beat now when
it comes to selfies the pixel is king
sure that made twenty pro has more
resolution but the pixel is more
versatile thanks to its additional
wide-angle camera I find it to be just
more useful and I love its selfie
portraits I seriously think that there
are issues with my mate Tony Pro because
selfie portraits don't really seem to
work and that's been ever since my
review period last but not least I'd
call video recording the Achilles heel
of both devices they're not bad but
they're not the best added stabilization
is fine colors are good but depending on
the amount of light both results are a
tad either over sharpened or sometimes
overexposed and both have mediocre audio
for various reasons and the same can be
said about selfie video where the
results were okay but not fantastic at
all to conclude you guys know that this
was a tough comparison I mean there are
elements of each device that make me
like them both and there are also
elements that I don't like about them
the only card left in favor of the pixel
really was Google Phi which I rely on
heavily but now it's also available on
the may 20 pro officially even if
certain VPN services do not work on the
make 20 pro as they do fully on the
pixel let me put it to you this way if
I'm on a trip and I need to review any
device that's not one of these two you
can bet that either of these is in my
backpack they are both the cameras that
I trust in case I need photography
obviously I do have to pick a winner and
in this case I'm giving it to the may 20
Pro it is better looking it is more
versatile it is more powerful and sure I
know that the pixel would be more
future-proof when it comes to software
but when you're buying a smartphone guys
software isn't everything what about you
