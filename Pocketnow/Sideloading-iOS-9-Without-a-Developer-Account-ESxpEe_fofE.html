while all of your developer friends are
living it up then why not just install
it yourself I'm high out to Houston with
pocket now and let's take a look at how
to install the iOS 9 Developer Preview
without a developer account the very
first step you're going to want to take
in stirring this whole process is going
to I mg/dl com which stands for I mods
own downloads and this is where we're
going to get all the different files
that we need to do these side loading
including the iOS 9 beta as well as
registering our udid we'll touch on that
in just a second so first things first
you just want to go to download iOS 9
beta just go ahead and click on that and
then you're going to want to find the
correct download for your specific
device so if you got an iphone 6 you're
going to click on here if you have the
ipad mini and so on so forth so i have
the ipad made to the a14 89 and we're
going to go ahead and choose one of
these options you can either download
the file as a torrent which is what i'm
going to do or you can get it as a
direct download i'm going to go with the
torrent because they're typically faster
in my experience so we're just going to
click on that and here it'll just in
just a second is going to auto download
there it goes now if you choose to
download with a torrent then you are
gonna have to have a torrenting
application like transmission on here I
like transmission a lot just because
it's got a clean interface and seems to
work well for me but you know you can
use whatever you want to and it
downloads pretty quickly in my
experience this one it's a 2.25 gigabyte
file and here you can see it went from a
couple of weeks and now it just keeps
going down and down and we're just gonna
go ahead and speed past that alright so
it took about five minutes but the file
is downloaded now so we're just going to
go in close out of transmission and the
next step here is to just open up that
folder and we're going to unzip the file
that just says iOS 9 beta and now inside
that folder we've got the ipsw file and
if you've ever dealt with any kind of
iOS updates before with flashing them
manually you're probably already
familiar with ipsw files this is
basically just the firmware its cell
so the next step would be to open up
itunes we need to do one quick thing
before we do that so go ahead and go
back to I'm on zone downloads you're
going to want to click on udid
registration and basically what we're
doing here is anytime you're wanting to
flash a Developer Preview onto your iPad
or iPhone you need a developer account
which costs a hundred dollars through
apple and we're trying to avoid paying
that much now this does still cost a
little bit it's coming about eight US
dollars but what they're doing here is
essentially registering our device onto
apple systems as a developer certified
device so here it's going to ask for the
udid and it says that you can find that
by tapping the get my udid / imei button
on the bottom of their main page so we
need to navigate to the website on our
iOS device we're going to go ahead and
pick up the ipad mini and do that right
now so again that's just I mg/dl calm
and here we are so go ahead and just
click show my udid right here and now
pull up in just a second here we go now
it's going to ask you to install this
profile you're just going to hit install
right up there and install again wants
to ask you to verify and a third time
install you definitely want to do that
otherwise you're not gonna be able to
get the information you need so once
that loads here we go we've got our udid
so if you tapped on register my udid on
the last page it takes you to the same
page we were just looking at on the
desktop and where it gives us a little
options right here we just come when I
go ahead and just tap udid registration
there's no need to go for these
certificates unless you really feel that
it's necessary we're also going to go in
unto tech i mod care save ourselves
another two dollars this is where it's
going to ask for your billing info so
you can go ahead and pay that to eight
dollars and we're going to go ahead and
fill that out and be right back so we
went ahead and filled all that info out
we placed our order and you can see up
at the top of got a email from from a
from I mg/dl we've already gotten that
that's awesome now this is just saying
that again the device is now udid
registered and so what we can do now is
go ahead and open up itunes on the
computer and go ahead and start the next
step in the process so once we're in I
to
this is the only step that's actually
going to differ depending on if you're
running on Mac or Windows if you're on
Mac what you're gonna want to do is
click on check for update but make sure
you're holding option while you do it
the only part where it differs here is
on Windows you're going to hit shift
instead now before you do any of this
you do want to make sure you back up the
device because this does have the
potential of wiping off all of your
files and you definitely want to make
sure that doesn't happen so go ahead and
back up everything first and once you're
ready again hit ctrl or shift depending
on your platform and while you're
holding that button just go ahead and
hit check for update that's going to
pull up the manual search for an ipsw
file so you're going to want to go ahead
and navigate back to that folder and
once you have found the file go ahead
and just hit open and it's kind of say
iTunes will open will update your ipad
iOS 9 and we'll verify the update with
Apple go ahead and hit update and now
because you already registered your
device with its udid it's going to go
ahead and verify that it is okay to
flash in the Developer Preview basically
it's just telling you that it is a
developer certified device and here in
just a second the iPad should start to a
go to an apple screen and here we go
we've got the the hello start screen on
here we're going to go ahead and just a
swipe over and you can see update
completed your iPad was successfully
updated and a couple more steps to
follow then you're done create a
passcode I really don't want to so I'm
just going to type 1 2 3 4 i'll disable
that later and finally welcome to ipad
get started and this should be there we
go everything we already had on here now
you can see factually as soon as i swipe
over here this is the new Siri or not
Syria the new spotlight screen this is a
lot like Google now both in function and
in location which is kind of nice
there's a lot to do on here if we double
tap the home button you can see we've
got the new card style UI which I'm
still not entirely sure how I feel about
but you know there's a lot of stuff to
play with an iOS 9 we're having some fun
with that and then now you can too so I
hope you guys enjoyed this vid
you if you did be sure to give a thumbs
up and subscribe to the channel and
thanks for watching guys it's been high
outside Houston pocket now and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
