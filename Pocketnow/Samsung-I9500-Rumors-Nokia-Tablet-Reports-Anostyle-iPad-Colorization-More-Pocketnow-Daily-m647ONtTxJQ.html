emerged Nokia's Windows 8 tablet comes
back for more reports and we show you
just how to get color on your iPad or
iPhone I'm hi Mary venom and no this is
not your typical spa service for tanning
your devices this is pocket out daily
now the only problem of having the
samsung I 9500 or i9505 hit rumor mill
is the fact that you don't really know
which device it belongs to just yet so
far rumors have it that apparently it is
a Samsung's first jab at the Tizen
platform or tizon whatever you want to
call it which is what's left of me go
after Nokia and Intel dump it sadly it's
too early to know which device that
belongs to again it could be the Tizen
device it could be something else but
we'll keep you posted now speaking of
Sami new rumors have the company working
on a new galaxy s3 variant for t-mobile
but what's interesting here is the fact
that well the company then released just
one galaxy s3 for tmobile when they did
they release one device for each carrier
which was a really good launch it could
be that this is just the tip of the
iceberg and we'll be getting a new
galaxy s3 for all carriers but other
rumors have it apparently this device
will be sporting LTE and we know that
the t-mobile Varian didn't have LTE and
neither does tmobile anyway so could
this be the t-mobile is getting LTE soon
now the new kid on the block when it
comes to rumors is nokia HTC building
their first windows RT tablets and
apparently what makes this nokia windows
RT tablets special is the fact that i'll
be sporting hdmi out according to new
reports it'll also have cellular radio
along with the fact that you could
actually charge the device with a
keyboard dock take that Microsoft
Surface RT and well we don't have any
dates as to when we could expect this
device but hopefully CES 2013 now just
when the iphone 5 ground itself king of
smartphone sales for the period apple's
new patent filing has the company
working on new technologies to curved
glass for displays and apparently the
question here is what do they plan to do
with that i mean steps have already
tried that with the Galaxy Nexus and
also with the Nexus S and it didn't go
beyond the gimmick stage I mean acker
class doesn't really fit better on your
face so whatever Apple plans maybe we'll
probably see that
the next coming years I mean they fatten
a lot of things that we don't get to see
until years later so we'll keep you
posted and finally for the interesting
news of the day Brandon just got his
ipad mini back from nano style and for
those of you don't know this company
specializes in analyzation procedures
for aluminum in the same way that Apple
Color treats their current ipod lineup
that's made of aluminum now this
procedure is really cool kind of pricey
but still cool don't take my word for it
follow links to watch Brandon's video
and that leads me to the question of the
day I mean would you prefer for Apple to
have color options for the iphone and
ipad or are you happy with black or
white i'm currently happy with the white
iphone and white ipad but leave us a
comment down below what do you prefer
and if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on Parker now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi Mary better thanks
for watching see you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
