video called Michael Fischer's top 5
Windows Phone apps and at the end of
that video I asked you to provide some
feedbacks and AB suggestions of your own
and you sure did we received so many
submissions thank you for those by the
way that we thought it makes sense to
whip up another video showcasing your
most referenced Windows Phone
applications so here it is I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and these are
your top 5 most referenced Windows Phone
apps so one of the apps I called out in
my first video was called connectivity
shortcuts a simple array of Start screen
toggles for Bluetooth Wi-Fi and so on
well in a testament to just how much the
Windows Phone user base wants and uses
these features the commenters responded
with loud praise for not one but two
alternatives to connectivity shortcuts
called quick settings and insider Pro
both offer the same basic functionality
as connectivity shortcuts but with much
cleaner iconography and a few extra
features like flashlights and music
muting in the case of quick settings now
insider Pro is the more impressive
example with a much broader feature set
it offers the same toggle based approach
as all the rest but it places them
smartly in a vertical dock along the
left side of the app leaving room for
some useful enhancements these include a
detailed battery and system info screen
showing charge time remaining available
storage and network status a quick
shortcut to Bing's image of the day and
a curious but pretty phone database
showing all windows phones currently
available from every manufacturer as
well as their specifications now between
insider and quick settings I tend to
like quick settings badge indicators
better but as an all-in-one kind of
title insider Pro definitely offers more
which is no surprise considering it's a
dollar 29 for the paid version but it's
definitely worth it Windows Phone users
certainly are starved for system info by
the Metro UIs Spartan layout so maybe
it's no surprise that our third most
often recommended title is another
system utility the simply named battery
it's free to download but you can make
an in-app donation to the developer if
you want the annoying banner ads gone
now on its surface
this may just seem like a way to get a
power percentage on your home screen and
it works pretty well for that but
battery also brings some more detailed
power consumption figures like estimated
time till shutdown discharge speed and
time off charger plus some pretty
awesome graphs and charts if you're more
a visual learner than our numbers geek
not to be left behind in the switch's
game of course there's also that
familiar ribbon of system toggles along
the bottom of the screen making this app
a lot like insider but the extra battery
info makes it worth a separate download
if you're trying to troubleshoot power
loss or if you've just got storage to
burn thankfully the life of a Windows
Phone user isn't all system utilities
and the last two apps in our pile are
decidedly more fun the first my tube is
a 99-cent YouTube client that many of
you told me was better even than my
preferred Metro tube I tried it out this
week and in a lot of ways you're right
my tube is a slick title with a sliding
panel interface that lets you surf
comments and related titles while the
video still plays underneath in the
background the comments don't always
load consistently which is kind of
annoying but when it works it works
beautifully plus my two brings the
ability to save videos for later viewing
as well as a great feature for music
fans or listeners of podcasts like the
pocket now weekly podcasts that's the
end of this shameless plug you can set
videos to continue playing when the app
is in the background so the audio
continues coming through while you do
something else and it can even play the
audio from behind the lock screen which
is awesome that alone is probably worth
the dollar to most folks but the slick
interface and the responsive build
really seals the deal you guys were
right my tube rocks
we've saved the most involved title for
last when I told you in last week's
video to try out fotor I thought that
was an elaborate photo editing
application and it is but elaborate
doesn't come close to describing
Fantasia painter there is a free version
available but I went ahead and paid the
buck 99 to unlock the full bevy of
features and it is a bevy now yes you
can doodle and paint on a blank canvas
with your fingers and there's a lot of
options for that but I don't know I've
never found that particularly compelling
on a stylus free device so my favorite
thing to do in Fantasia painter is to
edit photos there are so many options
you're gonna want to sit out and learn
this app like you might learn a new
gadget
it's that complex but it's laid out
intelligently you just need to get used
to it the array of effects options never
seems to stop allowing you to apply
layers shift colors and even manually
manipulate or distort images so you can
transform a pretty photo like this into
a horror show like this or you know do
something actually worthwhile like make
a portrait better like balance colors
like remove redeye apply HDR and like I
said it never stops it's amazing some of
Phantasia painters deluxe features might
actually make you feel like you need a
degree in photography to understand at
first but it's also really nice to know
that whatever you might need to do to a
photo you can do and given enough time
it can look good
this is one title that Lumia 1020 and
1520 owners especially with their
outstanding cameras should seriously
consider trying out
if you missed that earlier Windows Phone
app video folks go and check it out it's
still up in our channel page and
subscribe so you don't miss future
videos from pockets now if you want
additional Windows Phone coverage we
just reviewed the Lumia 1520 the monster
phablet out of Nokia go check that out
if you haven't already and be sure to
follow us on our social media networks
where we talk entirely too much I'm sure
in the meantime this has been michael
fisher with PocketNow thank you again
for watching and we'll see you soon
