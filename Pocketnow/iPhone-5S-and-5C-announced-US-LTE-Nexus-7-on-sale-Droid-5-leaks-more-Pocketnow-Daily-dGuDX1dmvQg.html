and iOS 7 availability rules LT nexus 7
finally becomes available in the US and
if you thought that the hardware
keyboard was dead well think again I'm
hina Rivera and probably the only golden
thing that I look for when I buy a phone
is a discount certificate this is pocket
now daily let's say off with the non
apple related news those of you waiting
for the LT variant of the nexus 7 can
finally pick it up in the United States
on the Google Play Store retails for 350
dollars which is kind of steep but but
will actually in sweetens the pot by
offering a free month of t mobile data
which is really good you also get free
shipping as well so make sure you order
that thing before it sells out now
speaking of google motorola has just
sent this new device into the FCC which
is kind of interesting because it's got
all the specifications of a smartphone
but it's just being dubbed the touch
computer you see LTE bands you see
pretty much everything that makes a
phone a phone and still it's not being
called a smartphone there is actually no
product name that hints to any
particular motorola phone this is
actually just a touch computer so if x
to wonder what Motorola has under their
sleeve or pretty much Google using the
company so stay tuned probably a new
product category and speaking of
Motorola if you thought that the curated
keyboard was dead well think again as
we've got the first league photographs
of the droid 5 and yes you get the
slide-out curity keyboard as you did
before it's actually identical to the
previous one that we saw on the photon
phone that was available for sprint from
Motorola as well though interesting it
does not have the same specifications of
the current droid ultra lineup so it's
kind of a mid-tier phone but anyways
leave us a comment down below as
security keyboard still interesting to
you alright alright let's begin with the
apple news as Apple has just announced
the availability of iOS 7 you can
download it on your compatible device as
of September 18 and yeah iOS 7 is one of
those polarizing topics a lot of people
either like it or they hate it but a lot
of people wanted for Apple to revamp the
OS and that's exactly what they did but
aside from all the typography changes on
the colors you aren't getting some new
enhancements in the UI they're kind of
compelling and since you will have to
upgrade anyways just stay tuned it's
free and finally for the hot news of the
day yes we finally get two new iPhones
at the same time we
iphone 5s in the iphone 5c this is
pretty much everything we saw in the
rumors in the case of the 5c for example
this is an iphone 5 with a different
chassis it is everything that we knew in
the iphone 5 only with a plastic
colorful back with a lot of cases that
you can match it or not match the phone
it's kind of interesting and again a
hundred dollars after two-year contract
for the 16 gig model 200 for the 32 gig
but in the case of the iphone 5s this is
interesting I mean this is exactly the
same design of the iphone 5 but in this
case you get an a7 processor you get new
optics on the camera that don't
necessarily bring optical image
stabilization you get you know bigger
pixels or a bigger sensor but actually
it doesn't bring any enhancement
cassette for the flash probably the only
cool thing is the fingerprint scanner
because now you won't have to be
unlocking your phone and Apple kind of
figured it out from the hands-on videos
that we've seen it seems that Apple did
figure this out but anyways that leads
you to the question of the day are you
interested in any of these two iPhones
either the 5s or the 5c in my case
obviously I want the flagship I want the
5s and most probably in one of the three
colors being the grey black variant
that's out there which is not
necessarily the black bearing that we
knew before but I know people like
Michael Fisher want the plastic colorful
variant of the iphone 5c so leave us a
comment down below which are you
interested in friends is always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and south
