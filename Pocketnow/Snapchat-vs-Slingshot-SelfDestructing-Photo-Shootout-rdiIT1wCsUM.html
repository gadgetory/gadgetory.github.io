said Facebook has copied snapchat but
how did it do this time I'm Taylor
Martin this is now and this is
slingshot versus snapchat last week
facebook launched a new mobile app for
sharing self-destructing photos and
short videos to friends of course that
sounds a lot like another popular mobile
app snapchat and many have called
slingshot a snapchat home this isn't the
first AB from facebook called a snapchat
clone facebook launched poke last year
and finally killed the dud service in
May the question many are asking though
is what's the difference between
snapchat and slingshot at the surface
slingshot seems like a direct shameless
copy of snapchat especially if you read
no deeper than last week's headlines
however just reading the first lines of
the respective descriptions tells you
that they're not identical / the google
play description slingshot lets you
quickly share moments little and big
with lots of people at once snapchats
description reads enjoy fast and fun
mobile conversation snap a photo or
video add a caption and send it to a
friend and that's where the first
difference is your audience you can post
a snap to your story for all to see but
it doesn't push your snap to everyone
it's simply there for people to see once
they open the app otherwise you have to
select who you send snaps to one by one
in slingshot there's a button many have
requested for snapchat select all hit
that and hits in and you will bomb all
your friends with a self-destructing
photo or video on the other hand there
is no story feature in slingshot instead
the developers feel like it's more of a
news feed for your friends activities
than a messaging app speaking of
snapping a photo the viewfinders in both
apps are pretty similar choose the front
or rear camera toggle flash add text and
draw in snapchat however you get a few
additional features like filters
textiles and the ability to save a photo
though that is accessible in slingshot
in the settings
the interfaces are also a bit different
in snapchat you slide from left to right
between your chat feed the capture mode
and your list of friends and their
stories in slingshot you simply have the
capture mode and you pull down to reveal
your name the settings menu and the
ability to add people still none of
these differences are quite as important
as the sole reason slingshot isn't a
ripoff of snapchat the one feature that
makes slingshot more like a chore than a
friendly messaging client you must give
before you can receive if someone sends
you a shot you must send them something
in return before you can unlock the
message an act that gets increasingly
annoying as you continue to use the app
sometimes you just want to see someone
shot without having to send something
first what you do unlike a shot however
you can tap it to react or take a quick
shot in response or simply send a short
text response in snapchat if you get
tired of sending dozens of pictures of
your face from different angles you can
hop on over to the text chat and if both
users are in the chat view at the same
time you can both hold the live video
button for a quick video chat in short
snapchat is a very friendly way to
communicate beyond the standard text
message it takes the friction out of
sending pictures and videos back and
forth to have a more intimate
conversation while slingshot has a more
visually polished appearance it creates
a very rocky disjointed experience that
makes you jump through hoops to message
your friends or pay to play although the
idea behind it forcing people to create
content rather than just llort is Noble
it's an idea we don't feel many will be
so eager to get behind we'll stick with
snapchat for now
