the fiercest competitive markets ever in
the quest to stand out from the pack
some companies make bold moves and
succeed brilliantly others are more meek
and fade into the unexceptional
background still others fill the space
between innovating once and then
endlessly iterating over and over again
then there are those that just screw it
all up
thanks to choices that are either too
bold too meek or just plain old
absolutely insane these are the products
that fall flat on their face they're not
to be mocked but the lessons they teach
should certainly be remembered and
that's why we're here
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is episode 3 of worst gadgets ever
featuring the LG intuition aka the
optimist view we usually don't do worst
ever episodes on devices still offered
for sale but we made an exception in
this case not to bash LG but more so to
show how far it's come in such a short
time we are no stranger to the optimist
view our own Brandon minimun unboxed its
Verizon variant the LG intuition and
rendered his first impressions six
months ago it started like this whoa
this thing is huge
this thing is monstrous is this really a
phone this is a joke and things never
really got better from there here's the
deal with the optimist view it was the
first attempt by a mainstream
manufacturer to compete with Samsung's
Galaxy Note series of smartphone tablet
hybrids but where Samsung maintained the
classic dimensions of a smart phone when
scaling up LG didn't with its four to
three aspect ratio the optimist view
looks a lot more like a roof shingle or
a coaster than a smartphone awkward is
the word of the day when it comes to the
view it's awkward to hold it's awkward
to talk on it's awkward to adjust the
screen ratio every time you open an app
it's even awkward to charge because of
the top mounted and recessed USB port
the thing is just too weird to use
properly the view probably would have
done better if it had been marketed as a
Minh
tablet using the view in public we were
struck by how many double takes we
didn't get because this thing actually
looks like a tablet in the hand because
you're obscuring the bottom half of it
with your palms and as a tablet it's
hardware really isn't too bad the wide
5-inch screen allows for a spacious
software keyboard and it's IPS LCD panel
actually looks quite nice the wide body
also gives you more icon room in the
dock and the bonus of having both a
multitasking button and a menu button in
the capacitive route down below but
these slight advantages aren't enough to
overcome the sheer clumsiness of a
device shaped more like a cocktail
napkin than a phone that's our first
take away from the optimist view and
it's a familiar one bold choices are
good but being different just for the
sake of being different just doesn't
work we know LG can build solid phablet
hardware we see it in the Optimus G pro
then we're glad to see the company's
more conventional efforts in fact that's
what the view should have been in the
future when pants are designed
differently you might be able to fit
this in your pockets later but you can't
comfortably fit it in your pocket now
unfortunately it doesn't get much better
on the software side while we enjoy LG's
custom skin on other devices like the
Optimus G we primarily enjoy it on those
phones because it's responsive that's
not the case on the intuition we've got
here
despite the normally speedy dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 the interface
lags sometimes badly closing any app
usually means we're waiting sometimes
awhile for the home screen to reload
once in a while that's not too bad but
it happens quite often on the intuition
and we're not sure why there's also the
question of the stylus features LG has
built in a hardware button so you can
jump right into quick memo that's a
feature that's much easier to use with a
stylus than with a fingertip and LG has
included one in the box but it's a
capacitive stylus it reminds us of the
Samsung C pen which we hated but we
might have been able to live with that
if it had somewhere to live on the
device sadly it doesn't there's no silo
on the optimist view so you need to
carry the stylus separate
that's ridiculous and it brings us to
our second takeaway don't integrate
half-baked features if you're going to
provide stylus support make sure it's
more than just a capacitive pen and make
sure it can slot neatly into the device
and while we're talking takeaways in
software let's jump right into number
three support your phone's properly
after release we've only seen one
software update for the intuition so far
not to bring jellybean or anything good
like that but primarily to rearrange the
bloatware you didn't want on the phone
in the first place and that update
hasn't exactly been getting the best
reviews from users with some reporting
that the update trashed their camera
calendar and email apps nice we could
talk about the awful raspy speaker phone
or the subpar battery life but let's
stop there the view and the intuition
aren't entirely worthless there are some
folks out there who obviously really
value this device usually due to tablet
centric features like ear eating or web
browsing both of which the phone does
quite nicely but it hasn't been marketed
or positioned properly by LG and it's
been practically ignored by Verizon for
the duration of the time it's been
offered it feels like this was a hobby
project inside LG someone thought how
can we differentiate ourselves and the
company decided to do it via form factor
but then somebody else had a better idea
in the Optimus G and Optimus G pro and
the view view - and intuition were
relegated to the redheaded stepchild
status that maybe they always deserved
this phone like any device has its small
following of hardcore fans and as a mini
tablet once again it does ok
but despite the bones we try to throw it
on the hole we think it's a bold
experiment that ultimately failed an
experiment that the rest of the industry
can hopefully learn from in which LG
already looks to be correcting we're
much more excited about the company's
future products than its past ones that
is as long as there's no view 3 on the
horizon
