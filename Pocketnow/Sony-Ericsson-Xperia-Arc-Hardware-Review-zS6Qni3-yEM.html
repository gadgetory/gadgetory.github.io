now calm and this is the hardware review
of the sony ericsson xperia arc and this
particular version that we have here is
the international version which may vary
when it comes to the state's into other
countries so let's get to it
so some preliminary specs to the Xperia
Arc it's running at one gigahertz
processing speed thanks to the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 8255 processor we also have
512 megabytes of wrong of which 300
about 300 megabytes are accessible to
install applications and whatnot we also
have 512 megabytes of RAM so if we start
at the top we have our light sensor
along with our proximity sensor we have
our headset speaker here a little sony
ericsson emblem we also have a 4.2 inch
glass capacitive multi-touch screen
which is running at FWVGA resolution so
that's 480 across x 854 and height on
the bottom we have our back button these
are non capacitive buttons well serve
our home button and our menu button any
little Xperia emblem down at the bottom
there are two little LEDs in between
these three buttons which help
distinguish in low-light situations
which button you're pushing on the top
of the device we have our power standby
button and we also have our micro HDMI
port unfortunately this device didn't
come with a cable so I'll either have to
order one on ebay or something to test
it out we also have on this side we have
an LED notification light that turns on
when you have a message or you're
charging we have our micro USB port we
have our volume rocker and we also have
a dedicated camera button on the bottom
of the device we have our primary
microphone we also have an attachment
area that you can attach a lanyard to
which we don't see too often on phones
anymore we also have a tab to remove the
battery cover on this of the device we
don't have really much of anything
except for the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack on the back of the device we have
an 8 megapixel camera that's also
capable of recording at 720p video
resolution we have our LED for the
camera and we also have another
microphone for the noise cancellation
speakerphone we have the Xperia emblem
here and a little tiny sony ericsson
decal underneath that we have our
speaker for our audio playback let's
take off the battery cover here it's a
plastic battery cover and as you can see
the design is kind of
dang it goes from a darker metallic to a
more silver metallic so we'll just pop
this off and it's a little bit tricky
amuse my fingernail here okay so there
we go we have our standard sim slot we
also have our micro SD card which is
expandable up to 32 gigabytes and it
does come with an 8 gigabyte micro-sd
card pre-installed the battery is a 1500
mill and our lithium polymer battery
which sony ericsson claims is able to
give up to 7 hours of talktime and
around 400 hours of standby time so just
close that up so the dimensions of the
Xperia Arc is 63 millimeters across by
125 milliliters in height and eight
point seven millimeters at the thickest
points which is at the top and the
bottom of course we do have this concave
design and it is a little bit thinner in
the center that's where we get the
Xperia Arc name the radio is powering
everything is we have an FM radio in
which you can use the included headset
as the antenna we also have Wi-Fi b/g/n
Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR and we also have
quad-band GSM along with this is the
international version so long with 920
100 megahertz UMTS bands when it comes
to the states we should have 3g bands in
the 850 900 and 2100 it also has
assisted gps an accelerometer and a
digital compass so this has been the
hardware review of the sony ericsson
xperia arc and if you like our videos

leave some comments down below if you
