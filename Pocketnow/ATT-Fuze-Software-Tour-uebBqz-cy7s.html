we're going to look at a software tour
of the HTC fuze on ATT first up just
pick up stylus and what's going on and
what we have here is a customized
version of HTC's touchflo 3d you can see
it's light gray in the background with
an ATT logo the cloth is a little
different than what you've seen on the
touch pro and diamond but we have a
similar icons down here and now you can
just tap on the selected one and grad
crafts to switch to different panels and
let's go free so here we have people
put this way and that way to flip
through this one is email pretty much
the same you see the light background
kind of doesn't give you much contrast
between the email icon here text
messages is black text on a light
background you can flick through by
going up and down that way next one is
an 18-2 logo this sometimes you might
confuse this with the globe logo here
because they both look very similar now
a circle would line up the one that's an
18 p logo has ATT applications and
application folders so this one goes to
our 18th email type applications and
it's hard to know what they are because
they're not really familiar icons and
there's nothing we win them so you just
have to get
okay next icon is internet this will
open opera you get some pre populated
favorites here all right next one is the
music very similar except we have a
light background here now so we're
playing some music with the audio is not
on
ok and as your volume control and I can
go to the library for the artist i say i
want to search for somebody i would
really like to be able to open the
keyboard and type in the name and artist
that I'd want to search for but oh my
library is gone and there's no way to
stop the music from plane either no
options there music huh so I have to fly
the keyboard back up back up again
and then stopping so that's kind of a
pain with the landscape version of
touchflo 3 next grab weather and again
light background there's not much
differentiation here so if it's cloudy
all you see use light gray clouds on a
light gray background this one is
programs and adult is also pre populated
but you can add some more here and you
can edit them photos very very much the
same as touch diamond and then we have
settings at the end now you may have
noticed the order is different than the
touch diamond and touch pro we have
settings all the way the end now your
most important ones are at the beginning
and end so apparently ATT thought the
settings were more important so sees
easy to just flick all the way to the
end and even off the edge to get to that
settings page all right now let's look
at the landscape version again much more
plain email messages bookmarks web
search calendar tasks notes contact you
see we don't have a notes or task
capability on home the portrait version
which is weird
those just print up in the regular
windows mobile applications and that's
pretty much it for here luckily the
keyboard has a start mini axis and ok
button but there's no soft key hardware
buttons here so in order to access menus
you have to touch screen here which is
annoying okay there's our photo album
and it's very similar to touch down
exactly now let's go into programs this
is look scrolling capable and ATT
decided to remove most of these most of
the programs in the listing and put them
into subfolders so you see the messaging
doesn't open the messaging application
right away it gives you another sub
folder of icons
Sam look music
games you get a lot of trial where some
full games backup program mobile backup
and world card mobile for scanning
business cards and doing optical
character recognition
messaging we already looked at you'll
notice the instant messenger is the type
that uses text messages
GPS you can download the AT&amp;amp;T Navigator
tools most of our office stuff is in
here we have an acrobat reader Java
supported we have Jet Set print so you
can print to wireless printers
work practice that's a really good
future quick gps full version sprite
backup remote desktop lots of great
business related tools here cellular
video goes to a web page slogan opera
here and you can play some streaming
video here pretty nice and we also have
push the top support
so that's it for the HTC fuze software
