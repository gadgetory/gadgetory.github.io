pocketnow.com and this is the software
toward the AT&amp;amp;T pantech matrix pro also
known as the successor to the old
pantech duo and as i use this device
more and more I'm beginning to like it
and and this is why yes it has a very
thick design but the rounded edges and
the very smooth surfaces makes for a
really comfortable in hand experience
when you take it out of your phone it
looks good when you rest it on the table
once you get past the thickness it looks
really nice very Sheen it's a nice break
from kind of the harder edges that you
find on devices like the HTC touch pro
and that sort of thing also the slider
mechanism has a function whereas on the
old pantech duo of slider did nothing
for example it does two things really
you can answer calls and end calls by
opening the slider which is very
convenient because it extends the phone
and it makes it more comfortable in hand
and number two it will actually unlock
the keypad and it will lock the keypad
so if you slide the slider up after
you're done using it after the screen
turns off the device will automatically
lock and this is really great so that
you don't accidentally call people while
the phones in your pocket but when you
want to quickly use it you take it out
you slide it either way and you will get
the screen to unlock now something I
want to mention before I get into any of
this is screen rotation speed because
that's very important you don't want to
rotate your screen and the screen is
still stuck in the portrait orientation
so let's take a look at how it compares
to the original pantech duo and then
we'll talk about how it compares to
other devices so here we are on the same
screen and let's give it a try ok so the
matrix pro is a little faster although
it is a little faster than the pantech
duo it's still a little bit slow and
it's not as fast as a device like the
HTC touch pro or even the htcs 743 and
that's a bit of a problem that said they
didn't create the processor speed on
this new unit and as you'll see
throughout this demonstration screens
come up pretty fast
it's got really fast performance which
is pretty refreshing ok so the matrix
pro is several home screens to choose
from and what we have here is the
standard windows mobile 6.1 sliding
panel interface and we have a little
spring background here we've seen this
many times before you can see your next
appointment you can quickly add a new
appointment you can go to your text
messages in your email it's a really
nice interface but let me show you what
else you can load on to the home screen
so I'm going to start and then I'm going
to go into settings and home screen and
let's change it to the launcher ok this
is what the launcher looks like and it's
kind of a new style design I don't like
it very much what you do is you press
the down arrow and then you can filter
through your messages you can filter
through your email calendar so it's kind
of like the same concept as a sliding
panel so you have everything in one
place but it's it's slow it's chunky
doesn't look that good you can't really
customize it and so I i revert back to
the sliding panel interface ok and this
is the default sliding panel interface
and it actually has a little bit of AT&amp;amp;T
branded stuff which is why I turned it
off so we go down to a TNT Express Mail
you can start express mail and then
that's pretty much the only added part
to the default interface so let's go
into the start menu and see what kind of
programs we have on the device and I'm
going to go into all programs and let's
go landscape for the demonstration so
here we have the standard stuff
messaging calendar contacts that sort of
thing we have a lot of AT&amp;amp;T branded
stuff like cellular video media net
medium all really a bunch of junk that
that is is really annoying to have on
here if we go to my stuff it's a file
explorer this comes with a really good
messenger program it so z messenger and
it lets you access aim and yahoo and
live messenger which is great click the
back button and to the right of that
we've mobitv and for those of you that
don't know mobitv actually lets you
watch live TV on your device it's great
but the
trouble with it is that it costs I think
it's five dollars a month or maybe even
a little bit more than that but right
now i'm running a demo and let me show
you it your trial is expired so i can't
even use it i spent you know about two
minutes watching TV and it's already
expired it costs ten dollars to buy the
unlimited and we can kind of get in
there and see the interface so it's a
really nice-looking way to browse
through channels and they have a lot of
good channels and by the way most AT&amp;amp;T
devices come with this by now so this
isn't unique to the matrix pro and i
can't do anything because my trials
expired so let's go back okay so we have
AT&amp;amp;T gps although you can use google
maps mobile or windows live search if
you want to use a location-based service
which i recommend you do we have the
full suite of office mobile applications
which is great if we go over to
organizer we have a standard alarm
calculator notepad world-time voice
notes so that you can record some notes
that you have along the way so really
basic tools that they include we have
games and there's several games added
but every one of them except for bubble
breaker and solitaire is java based
trial where and that's a big sticking
point that i have with AT&amp;amp;T devices they
come with a lot of trial where stuff
that you can't use unless you pay for it
and that's really annoying i mean you
spend the money to buy the device you
would think they would include some nice
games with it but unfortunately that's
not the case going down we have a
another button for applications and here
we have the camera and actually the
camera interface is quite good and we'll
talk about photo quality coming up in
the review i'll show you why the camera
interface is quite good so right now
it's black because i'm sitting on a desk
but if i go to options and i go to
settings this is how i change the
settings it's really easy and it's it's
really easy to use the icons to see what
you're changing and you can just go up
and down to change to normal quality or
high quality change the resolution
unfortunately the camera doesn't have
auto focus or a flash which may impede
photo quality again we're going to talk
about that in the review coming up on
pocketnow.com we have filed explorer
java a way to view pdfs we have system
info which will tell you you know the
cpu speed and things like that speed
dial more
programs voice commander which will let
you speak to your device without having
to train it and let's go back to the
previous screen we have settings nothing
terribly interesting in there you have
the ability to shut off the setting for
answering a call when you slide open the
keypad you also have a setting for
turning on and off the device lock when
you slide on an open and close the
keypad going down skyfire is something
that I've added we have Bluetooth
explorer and then we've remote desktop
which is kind of surprising that this
device comes with remote desktop because
the screen is so small and so rate low
resolution you'd probably wonder is it
even usable on a device like this again
right now I'm logged into my windows
vista machine with remote desktop and
it's somewhat usable you have a cursor
that you can move around on the screen
and you get a little box in the corner
that shows you where you are in relation
to the whole screen so if I click on
start the Start menu will work so this
may be useful for doing very very light
tasks like retrieving a document or
finding the phone number that you have
listed on your device but but I wouldn't
expect to use it for typing documents or
checking email but it's good that they
include it on on the pantech matrix pro
anyway so overall I think the pantech
matrix pro is a really good messaging
device probably not for the professional
who wants the best of the best with
really good email and messaging features
it's a very basic device but it does
well at what it sets out to do which is
to be a good communicator with a nice
sense of style and two ways to enter in
text the slider and the party keyboard
if you're on AT&amp;amp;T right now I think the
fuse would be a better choice if you're
a professional when you want something
more robust that said we've got the full
review coming up on pocket now calm and
we're going to talk about battery life
and talk about all the kinds of the
devices and come out with a conclusion
at the end so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
