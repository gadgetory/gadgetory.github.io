calm and we have another samsung galaxy
s series smartphone to a box here so
this one is the t-mobile version so
let's get to our war there we are so
really nice looking Fox you see avatar
on the screen there so you can guess
that it comes with avatar the movie and
we got nice some varnish on the side you
see a lot of branding here t-mobile
samsung vibrant galaxy s phone and we
have on the back powerful features 4
inch high resolution Super AMOLED
touchscreen 1 gigahertz processor 16 gig
memory a 5 megapixel camera with video
recorder app zoo and we have avatar we
have Amazon Kindle software sims 3 and
mobitv there's a pretty nice bundle so
let's get it opened here and there it is
I've already seen this at the galaxy s
launch event in New York and we see it's
a black slab pretty much like every
other smartphone on the market right now
and let's just put it here for now nice
black holder there
and this is some documentation warranty
start guide yes there's a manual in
there to head here and we have micro USB
cable headphones so this was interesting
we have some little rubber gels and you
have different sizes that's good you can
pick your size headphones have just in
answer button no volume control that's
too bad and we have a micro SD card
adapter or real rsd and we have a
recycle bag and there's our charger with
a USB plug Samson and that's it so let's
take a look at how this device compares
with some other devices let's get our
bag down
very black and we have a cover let's
look nice nice silver polish edge+
buttons on the back we have put a little
dot pattern let me see that and a galaxy
s logo feels very thin so let's compare
first up the hd2 very similar size the
hd2 has a bigger screen
pretty close
let's go for the regular HD
see that
and how about the zune HD obviously
that's lot smaller and thinner and I
always like to go with the old touch
diamond a small smartphone around
so there we go let me just see if it
will turn on see what we got for our
startup
Byron Sampson
screen is looking pretty good
it's rainin already somebody's calling
me oh maybe not that was a cool
animation just vibrated a little bit
preparing internal mass storage
preparing external SD card media scanner
running all right oh there we are and we
will take a look more in depth hardware
as well as the software in upcoming
videos so stay tuned that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
