pocket now calm and this is part three
of the video review of the 18 Tito out
of the box the tilt has a today's screen
that's pretty cluttered it's got a lot
of advertisements for programs that you
have to buy if you want to use them
beyond 30 days and it's pretty cluttered
so this HTC home plug-in which is
actually a free download i'll post a
link does a much better job at keeping
things clean if you have the HTC Titan 2
or the HTC touch you probably recognize
it on this first tab here we have a big
retro LED style read out with the time
you can also access your text messages
your recently used messaging application
and missed calls so that's pretty good
to the right of that you can access your
favorite people so if there is a picture
associated to a contact they will show
up here also what's great is you can tap
and hold on a contact and text message
them from that screen or call another
number that they have that you have
stored on your device to the right of
that is whether you can get a four day
weather forecast not sure why they went
with four days instead of five but
that's convenient to the right of that
is a program launcher and to the right
of that is a media player or a music
player I should say looking down on my
today's screen you may notice this
search bar here this is actually called
ultimate search by company called gx5
it's about twelve dollars and I'd say
it's well worth the price what it lets
you do is search a variety of search
engines such as Wikipedia YouTube Google
movies right from your today's screen so
that you don't have to launch pocket
Internet Explorer it automatically
launches when you type in a query so
that's pretty helpful in the upper right
corner of the tilt is the HTC task
manager and this comes on the Titan too
and it gives you a list of your
currently running programs and you can
choose to close them individually let's
go into options here I like this it
gives you the the amount of program
memory that's currently being used for
each program and if you click on the
button tab you can specify what the ok
button does in the upper right corner so
you can have it close the program
permanently instead of hibernate or you
can have it only close the program
permanently when you tap and hold on the
button that's how I have it set
there are some programs like pocket
internet explorer that I like to have
stored in program memory indefinitely so
that it comes up faster so that's a
really good feature the HDC task manager
let's go to settings and see if there's
anything interesting there pretty
standard we can choose a keyboard
sliding sound should you enjoy that kind
of thing I always found it to be
annoying over at the system tab we have
Windows Update that's included on all
windows mobile 6 devices though I've
never actually had any updates show up
when I have it search for updates so
that's probably for future use nothing
else terribly interesting here they will
remind you to turn off ever reporting it
actually slows down your device a little
bit and it's not necessary over on the
connections tab if you click on wireless
modem you can use this as a wireless
modem for a portable device or even your
desktop computer you can use it via USB
or Bluetooth and this wizard is very
intuitive and it's very helpful in
getting a connection setup so that is
part three of the video review of the 18
