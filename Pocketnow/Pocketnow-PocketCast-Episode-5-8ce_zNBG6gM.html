pocket nail podcast episode 5 today we
have with us Evan Blass our managing
editor say hi Evan hey guys hey Brenner
and senior editor Tony also known as
Anton d Nagi say hi anthem hey guys hey
Brendon Haven alright so again we are
excited about this podcast because it's
it's everywhere it's on YouTube it's on
iTunes it's on zune so you have so many
options to listen to this because I know
a lot of people want to have a lot of
choices and how they get it on their
device or whatnot and of course we're
going to look into a way to get this on
Android also in the near future and in
this episode we're going to do things a
little bit differently towards the end
we're going to take some Twitter
questions just about an hour ago I asked
people on Twitter you have any questions
for us for our pocket casted we got a
big handful of questions so we're gonna
we're going to do that so as we always
like to do we're going to start off with
something that made the news this week
and we're going to go from there so
starting off we're going to talk about
the amazon appstore on 20 februari which
was it's a day of the week was that
Sunday so a week from a week ago
yesterday or today it's today's Sunday
we record on Sunday and posted on Monday
got some news from amazon explaining how
their app store which we still don't
really understand why they're doing this
is going to tie into amazon.com so
they're going to have recommendations
when you're viewing one app it'll say
you know other customers bought this
check it out when you search for say
other pieces of software maybe for your
mac or for your pc you'll get results
for android apps but what's still
totally unclear is why amazon wants to
do an app store they think they can do
it better now amazon has quite a history
of you know they're the best at putting
together a product page and you know
putting everything pertinent on on one
page and they think they can do that for
abs too apparently but it's I i agree i
mean they've got so much experiencing
summers and recommendations but like me
as an Android consumer I want to use the
android market because it's got so much
choice so they're at a huge disadvantage
because they're starting from zero here
and you know the google app marketplace
is at 150,000 so they're going to have
to have some really compelling features
to to developers and consumers what if
they offer developers a better cut I
mean that alone could you know what I
mean that that's attractive that's true
better term so they could they could
presumably start a war in in the app
stores you know all the developers right
now get seventy percent on windows phone
on iTunes and in the android market and
if i were amazon were to undercut all of
them go to fifteen percent um yeah well
though i guess i mean most of the the
ecosystems are locked down you know you
couldn't have an alternate app store
unless you are catering to jailbroken
devices and i think the same is true on
on Windows Phone so you're saying that
you couldn't install a and a new app
store on to your you know AT&amp;amp;T android
phone no no you could with Android but I
don't think it would be possible with
other platforms you know all right thing
right there's an iPod or what with iOS
or with Windows Phone you know those are
pretty much locked down to the native
bat markets that's true another point of
differentiation here is that Amazon's
going to vet every app whereas in the
android market you know today if you
wanted to come up with a new live
wallpaper you could have it up by the
end of the day but amazon's going to
filter every app kind of like Apple does
potentially fixing a problem of the
Android app store which is that there's
just so much crap in there still there's
so many half kind of half-assed
applications to be honest I'm trying to
look at these things from two different
perspectives the first one is from the
developer's point of view
I mean let's say we are developers
working on a software that would mean
that we should first of all subscribe to
both app stores pay the fee the initial
fee and then submit our software to both
of the application stores if we take a
look at this from the consumer user
point of view is let's say you want to
buy or download an application you would
have to search in both places let's say
amazon has a better price because it has
a lower fat you download the application
you buy it what happens with the updates
will I be able to update my software
purchase from amazon using google market
or vice versa i mean i don't know how
these two will be able to work together
as a one from the users point of view
it's it's very confusing for the user to
be able to have to go through to app
stores i mean eventually if this apster
becomes big consumers will pledge their
allegiance to one of them and stick with
it probably because most people don't
want to fuss with through app stores
isn't it interesting though because i'm
sorry when you say something no no se SI
SE devon um because it you know several
years ago before before apples and and
the ipods and iphone made their app
store so big there was a bunch of
different app stores you know third
party like handango and and pocket gear
and whatever and and and none of those
were were nearly as successful as when
when Apple brought it all together under
one roof and so it almost seems like
consumers don't want choice in this in
this scenario they'd rather have
convenience as opposed to the other
verticals where you know you wouldn't
just want to have Walmart selling
everything and have no other place to go
for for your electron to your clothes or
anything yeah that was a very
inconvenient in the days of windows
mobile when you could get your apps from
like five different places and then
Microsoft did the windows is so long
windows windows phone marketplace for
mobile that was the official name
windows mobile 6.5 App Store which to
this day has like a thousand apps maybe
more by now but they came in way too
late and everything
was way too fragmented I've never spent
a dollar in that store yeah neither did
I I mean that the apps there were you
know yet spb mobile shell in like 30
bucks it was insane it's good software
but I mean the pricing just wasn't
wasn't right there amazon i think could
pull this off if they are starting to
address from the very beginning all the
let's say flaws of the google market for
instance in-app purchasing there was a
news bit this week i think it was
towards the weekend when google removed
an application exactly because it
referred to some in-app purchasing now
i'm not going to develop on that but if
amazon would allow in-app purchasing or
would give access to all of these things
which google doesn't permit on their own
market maybe they could have a big
winner here but again i think it will be
first of all contributing very much to
fragmentation and second very very
confusing for the consumer i mean that's
my point of view as a user on the other
hand Tony just to take the opposite side
of the coin Amazon's got a lot of things
going for it obviously number one there
amazon number two as we already talked
about they have a lot of experience in
commerce number three they have the
advantage of hindsight they can see what
makes the google market great and what
makes it not so great as you imply
in-app upgrades is a mess at times you
app recommendations aren't great with in
the market there's a lot of crap in
there so I mean amazon if anyone out
there has an opportunity to do something
better perhaps amazon is the company to
do it and perhaps they see that and
they've seen that and they're finally
going to execute on it and who knows
maybe a year from now we'll be using the
Amazon App Store's our primary means of
getting android apps and then won the
Best Buy App Store than a walnut all
rights and everything less I think this
is sort of opening a Pandora's box I'm
not sure I want to go here and like I
said before it was never really that
successful until Apple centralized
everything into into just one market
that was easily accessible from the
device
yeah in that respect it's definitely an
uphill battle although I guess we
shouldn't tell people about the pocket
now appstore coming miss July didn't
hear it from us so 11 more thought on
this Amazon thing will this them be a
premium version of the Google market
with only certain applications from the
Google market being doubled in the
Amazon market I've had an interesting
discussion with the with somebody from
from the makers of the Tegra 2 chipset
at the Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona and we've discussed about
Nvidia's app store and they told me that
certain applications those which would
be developed especially for high-end
Android devices will be features it will
be featured in the nvidia app store but
all purchasing will be done through the
google market maybe amazon will be a
stripped-down premium version of the
google market with only certain
applications which made certain demands
or certain and no standards it's just a
bunch of thoughts in my head I cannot
think about it straight at this moment
that's true i mean it could be for
higher tier applications getting away
from 99 cents and two bucks in epping
going back to ten fifteen dollar apps
premium games you know tuned perfectly
for tegra two chips maybe even a you
know magazine subscriptions that act as
apps something better quality than just
you know live wallpaper apps and you
know the like that you get cool well
let's move on from here definitely
interesting with the hope that amazon
brings something to the table that's
better than what we have now because
we're always for that all right so let's
talk about this Windows Phone 7 update
that occurred this week and then it was
pulled back because it was breaking
certain devices like the Samsung Focus
so this update isn't the big update to
get ie9 and to get multitasking with
fast app switching it's not the update
to get copy and paste
it's the update to allow those other
things to happen um so it does really
nothing to the user experience and yet
it's something that you must get in
order to get the other features coming
down the road which what we're used to
that on the desktop aren't when you
receive like a hundred different you
know mine are updates from one goes
before you get service pack 1 or service
pack 2 or whatever yeah but that's I
think that's a little bit more seamless
because you can set it to automatically
update whereas on Windows Phone 7 you
get a pop-up notification you plug into
zune you download it granted it's only
10 minute process but still it's it's 10
minutes I think they sort of want to
call it out you know like finally here
we are doing over-the-air updates after
having a capability for you know five or
ten years so you know they could do it
in the background I think they sort of
want people to know that that they are
you know right on the ball with these
these upgrades well this isn't really
not great but update at least well
except they're they're not on the ball
you know they were talking about this
update for copy and paste I think the
first rumour coming from Microsoft was
January and now it's going to be
probably two weeks from now in early
March which brings an interesting
question uh back in the days of Windows
Mobile legacy windows mobile and pocket
now used to be a site just for windows
mobile over-the-air updates just work
possible they built the mechanism in i
think in windows mobile 6.5 but it was
never used because there were so many
levels of sort of requirements to get
through to the phone so there was the
OEM there was the carrier and then
there's of course Microsoft all of which
had to work in tandem to produce an
update and it you know updates for
Windows Mobile didn't come as frequently
as we get on Android and on iOS for
example but with Windows Phone 7
Microsoft sort of had this new promise
all the hardware is going to be very
similar
the requirements are very much the same
so that we can more easily push through
updates and the question I guess is you
know is its Microsoft making good on its
promise to bring forth these updates in
a more easy way in a more timely way
well it all depends as you implied
earlier with Windows Phone 7 it's the
same situation I mean there are also
carriers involved so mainly carriers
involved and there are certain things
even I don't perfectly get I mean
Microsoft is sending out clearly the
message that you will receive the update
notification if you are using a sim card
or if you are on an operator which is a
partner to Windows Phone 7 now Adam
filmed the video of demonstrating the
update process and he clearly stated
that the device which he used had no sim
card at all so and my guess is that
somewhere at some point the phone
regardless if it uses Wi-Fi Wi-Fi or
data connection sends a pole at a
certain interval or receives a
notification from a Microsoft server
saying that hey there's an update
available it's just that I don't know
why and I personally haven't received
the update notification yet why certain
regions certain devices do receive the
update and why certain devices do not
this is the first thing and the second
thing I want to say is Microsoft is
emphasizing so hard and writing it out
in bold letters that this is a huge
thing for them I mean yes it is it's a
big project for pushing out updates to I
don't know how many devices but to all
the devices which is something which
they didn't do in the best and I think
that we can take a look at this first
update before the first updates from two
perspectives we can look at it a like a
prerequisite update doing something on
the phone which we don't know about but
preparing the phone for the nodes you
know though update or two we can look at
it as a test just to see just for
Microsoft to see that okay the system is
working and we can we can do it and if
there will be
problems let them be now so we can
address them before the big update so
not really sure sowww ad what would
Apple do or what would google do I mean
it's just maybe I'm not giving Microsoft
enough credit but I just think it's a
little bit haphazard too after the fact
after millions of devices are in the
hands of consumers say oh we don't know
if this is actually going if your second
scenario is true Tony we're not sure if
this is going to work so we are going to
inconvenience every one of our users
with this update that does nothing what
Apple do something like that I mean they
would ensure that before the consumer
got the the phone in their hand the
update process worked same with Google
you know there is one thing with Windows
Phone 7 updates carriers have the
opportunity to skip one update so if a
carrier says I I want to skip this
update he skips it but he has to deliver
at the second update so there cannot be
more than two updates left out by the
carrier and if this update actually does
something to the phone carriers cannot
skip it but I've heard that some of the
carriers might be able to skip it which
then takes me back to the web where I
started it doesn't actually do anything
it's just a simple test so again mixed
thoughts do you know how this works
toady I mean does Microsoft have a file
and then they send the file to a rep at
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile and vodafone or
whatever and just and say hey can you
guys look at this and deploy it on march
first or do they just send it out
without you know consulting the carriers
well this sooner so far here's what I
know I know of two things first of all
that the update will come from Microsoft
and you only receive the notification
from your carrier if we are to listen to
what Microsoft is saying that you will
need a sim on a partner carrier second
thing I know is from microsoft itself
which they published on their blog that
yes these updates will needs to be
tested by carriers so let's say
Microsoft
sends out the update to carriers then
the field tested for a couple of days
they give the okay and then the actual
updates rollout process begins so it's
somewhat like you imply Brendan so it's
always the implication here then that
that HD 2's that have shoehorned windows
phone 7 on them are not going to be able
to get this update I don't know to be
quite honest I don't know and I don't
think that there will be a mechanism to
stop the update because from what I've
heard and from what I've read on these
HD 2's running Windows Phone 7 they are
actually emulating legacy windows phone
7 device I think it's the hd7 so the
system the carrier everything sees the
device as it was an actual windows phone
7 device so my best guess my biggest
guess is that yes they will receive some
updates but I haven't heard of any
reports yet that's interesting very
interesting indeed ah I guess the the
update process is as cumbersome if we
even want to call this cumbersome
compared to android so you know the I
mean we've seen this and this is a topic
of conversation thing the epic 4g the
captivate finally are getting froyo but
google released the froyo source code a
long time ago back last year and yet
it's taken this long but you know I
think the carriers and Samsung
especially needed to do things to get
this update finally pushed out yeah I
mean it's a it's a pretty big deal to to
deploy a completely new operating system
to thousands and and in some cases
hundreds of thousands of devices um I
mean when you when you look in a lot of
these databases like like Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth and you know even divx
certification often times they will
separate the same device with the two
operating system version so you know say
they'll have the d700 which is the epic
4g they'll have one version of it which
is which is Eclair and then one version
of a
which is 2.2 froyo so you know there's
there's such a significant difference
there that that they almost look at them
is two different pieces of hardware ah
I'm not sure you guys remember sorry
Brendan all right I'm not sure sure if
you guys remember this I remember it
because I covered it it was a story back
at the i think it was mid january and it
came from android police and somebody
allegedly close to the situation has
reported that these actual froyo updates
for us carrier brands of the galaxy s
are being held back because let's say of
conspiracy among carriers and the guy
broke down the updates in two to three
caleb categories first one it was the
critical updates which results in
critical bugs and these usually are sent
out for free from samsung to the carrier
there were the maintenance updates which
fixed some of the bugs which users
reported but towards the carrier and
these have certain costs died and there
were some feature updates which which
caused the most and the android 2.2
froyo was in this category now samsung i
think it was two or three days after the
story came public and said no samsung is
not requesting any fees for the froyo
updates we are giving them out for free
promise and this this was half of the
quotes i can look up the whole world so
i think there might be something
involved some some truth here because
yeah first of all the devices hardware
wise are the same but there are a lot of
carrier customizations blot where which
we know we call them lot where they have
to tested at a certain device level on a
certain number of test devices this kid
let's say take two three four five weeks
to months but come on we are six seven
months how long are we after the froyo
launch one here a long time that's
assuming that
that everything goes smoothly in the
testing I mean you know you look at a
phone like the fascinate they're there
they're taking out all the the Google
stuff and putting in bing you know
besides all the whatever changes that
that come along with you know the
versioning update so so i think that
there there is quite a bit involved here
and and i'm not i'm not so sure that
there's there's a conspiracy of any sort
going on among the carriers i'm i'm not
sure what that would you know with that
what they would really gain from that
you know pushing people into new
hardware maybe but you know in general
and i think that they see that it's
beneficial to get these these updates
out quickly and and they really are
trying to because they see that that
people are you know there's quite a you
know there's quite an uproar now that
it's been so long alright well let's
move on from here a final a final
thought and then we'll move on I feel
like the team's responsible for issuing
these updates are relatively small and I
say that because shortly after the
release of the source code of a new
version of Android you can go to a site
like XD developers or android central
forums and get he get the new version of
the software working almost perfectly
within like two days because all of the
developers are pulling the resources
together and getting it done I just feel
like these companies like Samsung I'm
not going to say HTC that their teams of
four upgrades are just not as well
equipped as they should be to quickly
get these updates out but you also
remember their standards are higher you
know if they have to have these things
like you know rock solid or or what they
consider rock solid while on XDA people
will take something that's you know
ninety five percent working it's a good
thing to remember I guess they're trying
to keep people from not calling customer
service lines and returning their phones
and if something is off then it's not
fair game alright so next up on the list
last week sami from the Jersey Shore
went back to the
House wrong podcast ha jeez no I don't
watch Jersey Shore except every week um
anyway I was gonna say the worst part is
you could keep talking about that you
didn't have a set out there oh well uh
what are your thoughts on I'm just
kidding okay let's move on um more stuff
about the htc inspire 4G not doing great
with speed benchmarks we talk about this
every week it seems because i'm frankly
bitter about it that the Atrix 4G and
the inspire 4G which are the hspa+
phones on AT&amp;amp;T network in most cases and
i'm saying most because I've read lots
of reviews out there can't do 4G yet
because there is no 4G and what's worse
is that it doesn't support specifically
the inspire 4G doesn't support hsupa
which is the technology that allows the
device to upload almost as fast as it
can download and no one really knows why
and it's just so unfortunate because
we've got a phone that's supposed to be
faster when it's in fact slower if you
root the phone you can enable hsupa but
it's just it's just ridiculous at this
point I mean there's a rumor out there
that March first is the day when a lot
of people are going to see this hspa+
and that is about three days away I have
a feeling that's not true I mean did
they disable this from the software
level 0 or is it disabled from the deep
radio level inside the ROM sounds like
the software because it seems relatively
easy to turn back on yeah and you've
said that that that it's possible to
enable it on a lot of Android phones for
ATT gape is our resident genius side
note yeah and so presumably they
disabled hsupa because they expect the
phone to run on hspa+ which sort of
takes care of both uploads and downloads
but maybe the deployment
the hspa+ it's just not happening as
fast but they should tell us about that
send out a press release saying you know
we understand customers aren't receiving
4G speeds well here's when they will I
feel like a mt sort of they got caught
you know holding the bag in in some
cases like not holding the bag
necessarily but they started feeling
left behind you know verizon was moving
forward with LTE spring already had
wimax going I think that the gamble had
been at AT&amp;amp;T that people weren't buying
t-mobile's whole you know where 4G with
our with our hspa+ and and then and that
gamble was wrong people were buying it
and yep and all of a sudden apmt started
to look like slowest network out there
and so they had to come out with that
report that said hey we're actually the
fastest you know on average over you
know over the entire population it was
you know very specific case scenario
where they were the fastest and and and
now i think that there's a lot of
pressure on them to to start deploying
these 4g devices even before the the 4g
network is is completely ready yep
that's that sounds right to me yeah
exactly on the same note as Evans said
the 4g network is ready AT&amp;amp;T is saying
that it's ready the phone hardware is
ready for the speeds it's just disabled
from the software point of view now we
have to think about it like this was it
an omission or was it premeditated
because if it wasn't a mission we can
see a small update coming up shortly but
if it was premeditated then I think AT&amp;amp;T
is not really ready for these devices
getting on the network from the network
logistics point of view yeah I mean I
think ATT log you it's the same as
someone you know in the middle of
America buying a verizon LTE device
they're not going to
LTE service right away yeah but the
difference is that verizon will gladly
show you an LTE map and say here's where
you can get it in here's where you can
wear as AT&amp;amp;T is using very generic
terminology saying you'll get it if you
have enhanced backhaul in your area
whatever that means and wherever that is
right I agree that that they should be a
little bit more transparent uh-huh great
minds think alike yeah uh okay great
well hopefully there will be some good
news about this soon because inspire 4G
Atrix 4G are some hot devices but I
think a lot of people have their eye on
but I'm sure they want to make sure
they're making the right choice about
whether they do these faster data speeds
so let us move on um just a brief note
this week samsung finally pushed out the
froyo update for the epic 4g in the
captivate people have been waiting so
long for that to happen and so you know
we just want to say congratulations if
you have a captivate or an epic 4g
you're now living on the bleeding edge
of froyo just wait wait for gingerbread
yeah gingerbreads the one to watch yum
you won't be able to ever get it but if
you root your phone you can I thought
ice cream is the one we're waiting for
now ah yeah well we don't know what ice
cream will bring so maybe it'll be a
step backwards which isn't likely anyway
and speaking of that what do you guys
think what do you think Jay is gonna be
jello it can't be jello so I Anakin's
not gonna be jelly donut so I'm thinking
it's gotta be jelly beans why can't it
be jello is jealous trademarks oh snap I
think jelly bean sounds good to me how
many thoughts nope nothing keep thinking
but hey Tony have you ever had those
jellybeans that taste like cotton candy
nope Wow what about you Evan I think I
have your fantastic did you ever eat ice
cream with mustard and pepperoni what
haha joke no I did and I have the
picture to prove it okay is it is it
good is it one of those weird things
that happens tastes good no you actually
want to brush your teeth n times five
minutes after you eat it so I don't know
was this when you were really
intoxicated were where you know it's it
was part from another part of my life
and I just had the opportunity and I
couldn't pass I say okay I'm not gonna
die tomorrow without eating a mustard
and pepperoni ice cream Wow don't ever
try that guy's really seriously all
right well won't judge you too much on
that sounds like it's something I did
when you were young a younger Tony yeah
so let's move on the HTC arrived which
is really the same thing as the seven
pro has landed on sprint and i think it
was in early january when the HTC
arrived trademark hit the US trademark
and patent office we were sort of
thinking it may be a new version of the
sense interface we didn't expect them to
call the seven pro the arrived but but
here we are it's got the same specs it's
got the one gigahertz snapdragon cpu 576
megabytes of ram wvga screen we reviewed
the seven pro european version and you
can see it right now on the site but
this is basically this is basically the
same thing except they can't do
simultaneous voice and data and its own
sprint and it can't do long walks right
can't do wimax which is actually kind of
surprising how do you guys think this
will stack up in terms of other current
sprint high-end smartphones although
without the 4g it's questionably not
their highest well i'm not looking at
this from this point of view i'm looking
at this from the following two points of
view first of all we we've got cdma
support for windows phone 7 which was
promised at the launch and yay five
months after now we finally have it
so this is the first one and the second
one I mean the arrived and the seven pro
are the same it's not that much about
hardware but it will open up some new
markets to Microsoft Excel windows phone
7 and Windows Phone 7 hardware through
carriers to another segment of the
market then hopefully this will a little
bit boost their sales I think that's
what they're what they're hoping for you
know exposing a whole new realm of
people to Windows Phone 7 and sort of
continuing the momentum of the platform
which is uh it's good for windows phone
7 I mean the device is great I've played
with it at the Mobile World Congress and
I think many many people which are not
open you bro always hurts when I talk
about it haha but those who held back
for the dell venue pro or that they can
buy it because it sits on AT&amp;amp;T I mean
it's it's a great qwerty device now
Microsoft only needs to sort out the
landscape thing which you guys talked
about they think two weeks ago with Adam
but else it's it's a great device
indeedy well there's not much else to
say about the the HTC arrived available
three days ago so uh go at available and
now sorry i don't think it's available
until those we're on pre-order and it
will start shipping I don't know exactly
when but I know that it's available on
pre-order yeah there you go pre-order
think it's the 20th edit ships the
twentieth of march i believe so when i
talked about your dollar it has to be
after de novo updates roll out true true
because it ships with a copy and paste
right exactly alright moving on februari
24th we were talking about yet another
another delay of the HTC Thunderbolt
this thing was supposed to launch so
many different times and it's so funny
because you the dates we were talking
about for the launch were like februari
24th have
28th and we're complaining about six
days well when you're when you're
waiting for not your dream phone but the
one after that according to HR uh-huh
you gotta you gotta you know keep the
calendar crossed off when when you're
getting close to the release Allison
violated what's that I said well played
Grandin oh thanks I was at best buy on
Friday looking at the zoom and they had
an empty lonely sad kiosk for the HTC
Thunderbolt with no phone attached so
but they had it uh you said yeah do you
think they had an inventory um no not
now because I mean if the problems with
the battery no one's gonna have them you
know because they still need to flash
them with the new firmware do you think
that they ever run into a situation and
maybe this is one where HTC a verizon
says Oh grab every single every single
HTC Thunderbolt that has been produced
needs a new rom before it goes out and
some some guys in a warehouse somewhere
sit there with thousands and thousands
of Thunderbolts reflashing them I don't
I think it's all automated but yeah I
think that does happen I think it can't
happen because they go through a field
testing process both of the manufactured
and at the carrier level so I think it's
pretty not possible but this is just me
it would seem like I mean it would be so
expensive to do and time-consuming and
even if they do have an automated
process someone's gotta plug the phone
in you know take it out of the box and
if there's 100,000 phones in a warehouse
then someone's going to be really really
upset about that but if it turns out
that it's one of the carrier
customization applications or some
carrier customization bit eating the
battery then that says no no another
story yeah that's true and and don't
forget that they could just push in an
OTA update so that when people turn on
the Thunderbolt it says hey you need to
update your software now or your battery
lives can be bad yeah that's not real
great for the user experience though is
it oh no right I'm sorry Emma but let's
remember here that I
I don't think that they actually
announced a date I mean they these are
not delays for it's not like verizon
said like it's coming out on this day
and then it has had to backtrack that
these are sort of these are all rumored
releases and then the rumored release is
kept getting pushed corrector well
sometimes we construe rumors as the
truth or at least I do personally so hi
I'm said well the latest news anyways is
that it's not even March for but i think
it's March 10 now nah we better move on
someone's gonna stop listening because
they're so upset uh okay well let us
move on let's talk a little bit about
iOS so on March second which is going to
be wednesday they're going to talk about
babying Apple the new iPad but they
might also be talking about iOS 4.3
which brings you know if you hear a
sound there's a printer in this room
being used iOS 4.3 brings these new
gestures to the table where you can sort
of pinch with five fingers or four
fingers to get back to the home screen
you can swipe right and left with four
fingers and the idea is that 4.3 will be
talked about or perhaps even released
but but probably not until you know
there's new hardware yeah saying this I
think we talked about this two weeks ago
when I said that it will be pretty
difficult you have three or more finger
gestures on the iPhones 3.5 inch screen
but now in this contest at the context
of maybe new hardware with maybe bigger
screen maybe three or four finger
gestures could be possible that would be
great n and with a rumored larger
four-point inch screen does a
four-pointed for a screen edge-to-edge
display I mean then these gestures makes
so much more sense when you've got a
bigger screen to work with right that
would be
awesome hey I think it's pretty likely
that we'll see a bigger screen on the
next iPhone ever the question is will
they keep the altar dimension is the
same and only make the screen bigger or
will the iphone 5 being physically
bigger than the iphone 4 I suspect that
the resolution will stay this oh you're
just talking about the dimensions the
phone not the rest yeah screen I think
the dimensions will be slightly bigger
but that but some of it will be taken up
by the screen moving closer to the edges
that seems like apple style ok I'm going
to do a test here I'm going to measure
the width of a 4-inch screen and then
put it up next to the iphones 3.5 inch
screen and see if it fits within the
fits within the confines of the the
width and actually it does if they do a
true edge to edge screen they would be
able to fit let me get the other
dimension here they would be able to fit
a 4-inch screen of the current hardware
now this is a personal question of mine
Kenny also measured the that's all pneus
and the because we had some rumors that
maybe Apple would be ditching the home
button could these could a new bigger
4-inch screen fit between the speaker
and the home button in case apple can
ditch the home button ok so it just so
happens that a 4-inch screen is as tall
as a credit card so if you hold up a
credit card to your iPhone you'll see
that they wouldn't have to remove the
button they'd have to move the speaker
up probably two millimeters they may
have to move the the button down a
millimeter but it could work now this
also depend somewhat on aspect ratio
right you can have a four-inch screen
that you know a 16 by 9 or you can have
a four-inch stats you know 4 by 3 mm-hmm
true well they're they're likely to
maintain the same aspect ratio the
iphone 4 which is I'm not gonna good
enough at math to figure that out
very good so maybe some cool stuff to
come out for iphone peeps on run for
what on March second sir seems no no
well then you would be a sheep in it
that's fine that you know what that now
that I own an iphone i can i can make
fun even more huh yeah it's a good phone
even better if they allowed you to do
things on the home screen that you can
do on Andrew yeah I just hope they will
implement the noise than those gestures
oh yeah the nose gestures well I've got
a big nose so that would be very
functional alright so let's move on one
more topic then we're going to take a
couple questions on Twitter so there is
a android 2.3 point 3 update for the
Nexus S which people are saying makes
the phone look like it has jaundice
which of course is yellow tinted um but
then Google saying that it's not a
mistake we wanted to warm up the screen
a little bit i use the Nexus S or
previously use the nexus s for weeks and
weeks at a time and definitely compared
to other screens it's cold the whites
are so white it almost has a blue feel
to it but I kind of like it it's very
like high-techy few pictures that the
colors are kind of off but what do you
guys prefer a cooler screen or a warmer
screen I'm with you after your email
actually I was playing around with the
colors on on several of my screens and I
had one screen that that looked a lot
more cool i thought it was it was wider
than the other ones but then I adjusted
my center screen somewhat and and I was
able to make that have even crisper
whites and that made when I previously
looked wider looks somewhat warm so I
found that I prefer prefer colds a more
natural light it seems that code
provides better contrast hmm I'd say
well okay let me say that I don't like
mo
super amoled or super amoled blaaah
screams and here's why because I don't
find the colors to be matching the ones
you can see in reality I mean yeah the
whites are either bluish or yellowish
read this too vibrant text is Jackie but
yeah they they offer great contrast and
getting back to this color temperature
thing i think if i remember well that
there was an application or it was some
kind of a hack back in the days of nexus
one which allowed you to actually adjust
the color temperature of your Android
smartphone and I think I'm gonna give
you the link Brandon to post it so that
people can take a look at it sure that'd
be great yeah I mean people have their
preferences there's there are trade-offs
with every screen super amoled amoled
and super amoled plus all have
ridiculously rich blacks and that's at a
trade-off of color quality in some cases
that pictures kind of look a little bit
artificial um tell you what though HTC's
super LCD I think is the perfect sweet
spot it's it's on the inspire 4G on the
desire HD and a lot of other HTC phones
but the blacks are really black they're
not as good as Super AMOLED the colors
are really really rich much richer than
I've seen on any LCD and and it just the
screens evenly lit it looks it looks
awesome what what screen do you prefer
Evan and you're probably going to say
retina aren't you yeah I mean I I think
that the the retina display is just
about the best that I've seen I mean if
you ever have it haven't you know
sitting on a table when it's on like an
angle you know you still have an almost
perfect viewing angle so yeah I think
it's it's definitely one of the best and
but that may be more of apples
manufacturing then then actually the
quality of the screen just because they
were able to get it so close to the
glass on top other as you imply there
are so many different characteristics of
a screen like
viewing angle and contrast and power
consumption and color reproduction and
resolution of course so there's a lot of
different variables the manufacturers
have to work with and yeah the retina
display is is quite nice although if you
put it next to like a super amoled the
blacks look almost gray on a retina
display or kind of a darkish gray I'll
have two straight from the back here and
say that the for me the best display is
LG's Nova display on the optimus black
hi it has very very rich colors it has a
high brightness level and also deep
contrast so I had the occasion to see it
in Barcelona compared to apple's iphone
4 display and also compared to my
devices displays and it really is great
seems that the Nova display is almost a
cross between AMOLED and LCD would you
say that something like that yeah mm-hmm
very good alright so that ends this
segment let's uh let's take it to
Twitter we've got a handful of questions
here none of which I've actually seen
before so let's just let's go to this
one from the kid 1990 would bata ever
become the next palm OS where do you
think palm has their game under control
because of joining HP well that is to
say that bada hmm what bada ever become
the next palm OS where do you think palm
has the game under control cause of
joining yeah what does that mean it it
becoming the next Paulo s means that you
sort of fade into the sunset yeah I
think that's what I think he's asking if
if bada is is going the way of palm and
it needs to be acquired by a major OEM
uh oh no samsung knew exactly what it
was doing with bada and and I think so
far it it's quite pleased with the
results yeah yeah and Samsung has the
power to maintain and sustain ba de ya
say I mean they're there now probably
almost as as formidable as HTC
in terms of volume of phones if not if
not better so they have they have great
management that that that know what
they're doing and we have yet to really
see much of bada here in the US it's
mostly a European thing but I me bada is
relatively solid for an OS that is
running only on two phones out there
let's see next question from I Safari
sounds like an Apple user do you think
HTC will make a phone that will be a
true successor to the evo 4g dual-core
betty better video better screen well
well certainly HTC is always going to
make a phone better than their last
generation and if you listen to our last
pocket cast we were talking about sort
of how disappointed we were an HTC from
Mobile World Congress that said there is
still a glimmer of hope that at ctia a
device like the HTC pyramid will be
announced which will bring a dual-core
snapdragon processor with a 960 x 540
display so so to answer your question of
course they will make a true successor
to the evo 4g are there any other
contenders guys for the next super
high-end HTC phone besides the pyramid I
can't think of any because whatever we
have on the market is single core and
now okay android is not fully supporting
dual-core at the moment but it's where
the future is it's where everybody is
going to so I think the pyramid is the
next big thing we might see in maybe 11
month oh sure sounds about right what do
you think having anything a better or
equivalent to what could be the pyramid
coming out from HTC better than a
pyramid yeah um yeah of course um the
HTC is always going to have some some
high-end phones coming out and I imagine
that will see some at ctia next month
but specifically we don't we haven't
seen spy shots or specs or anything
besides
pyramid so the specific follow-ups of
the evo 4g I you know meaning something
on sprint you know why max power device
I I just don't know sure sure so how can
I turn there wasn't use but this weekend
which came from and gadget and it was
talking about some HTC droid incredible
2 yes well appearing on verizon systems
now we had the Incredible S which was
launched at the Mobile World Congress
and they were all speculating about this
being maybe a u.s. Bryant how about this
new device would be actually the pyramid
hmm I feel like yet you're talking about
the incredible too yeah I feel like
that's going to be like The Incredible S
so you so that you know well we'll have
to see but it it seems that it's it's
not going to be there super high-end
phone that we're all going to lust after
very good let's move on to we've got two
more questions that I want to cover so
we keep this around 60 minutes from
Joker Chris 2000 do you think the new
smartphones and tablets are worth
they're very expensive pricing they cost
as much as a cheap pc well you know
Joker christian octave must been must
not have been around you know a dozen
years ago when when a cheap pcs were a
thousand bucks yeah yeah and don't
forget that high-end smartphones have
always been extremely expensive
unsubsidized right when they come out
and if you look at like the HTC
universal when it came out I think maybe
2004 it was a thousand bucks and today
we're seeing pricing on the new HTC
phones around a thousand bucks and it's
it's always going to be that way um and
you know uh yeah that's I think you have
to look at it from this perspective
smartphones and tablet these days are x
two computers in small size and
everything which is produced in
miniature packed into this I don't know
100 and something meters per 50
something millimeters is a miniature of
something which you are running on your
computer because you have some dual-core
processors right now which which were in
the PCH some ten ten years ago or
something we're talking about one
gigabytes of RAM and I think yeah you
actually hold your your computer in your
hand and for that you have to pay the
price exactly but the thing that kind of
is annoying for the consumer is that
consumers of the future will have a
smartphone a tablet a laptop and maybe a
desktop so it's not like we can buy a
smartphone and it replaces all these
things there's just you know there's a
price for being mobile yeah exactly
absolutely um the next question I need
to do a second of research on a question
is from Mad Max HD what happened to the
AT&amp;amp;T nexus s I want one on AT&amp;amp;T 3g and
on negri electronics either on pre-order
but there is no date I'm trying to see
after how many months from the t-mobile
nexus one the 18 exes one was real it's
definitely still coming we've seen it in
quite a few um agency databases already
oh I think it would be within the next
month yeah and again I don't you know
it's not going to be sold subsidized
through 320d probably yeah it's going to
be same price you know 529 maybe but we
can bring that in a little bit so let's
see it looks like go I'm going what's
gonna say C January see genuine 27 I
think they were all right yeah it came
out January 27 that the t-mobile nexus
one and then federer tree March April
looks like a about three months after we
saw the 18 tiver ssion so if you look at
the Nexus S applying the same general
idea it was released in mid-february
about
year later to be exact so it looks like
if there's going to be a nexus one for
for eighteen t it would happen early May
maybe in April who knows maybe even in
March so it is probably most likely
coming as Evan said by just a matter of
waiting a little bit and let's not
forget that it had already passed FCC
yeah it's I think the the model number
is GT i 9020 or something like that yeah
9020 a yeah right 9020 a very good so
that is coming so thank you guys that
have asked questions on Twitter and
thank you evan and Tony for joining the
the pocket cast here and I don't think
there are any final thoughts anything
happening this week of note besides a
potential bit of news about iOS 4.3 that
you can think of mm maybe maybe we can
have a surprise lunch for the
Thunderbolt yeah that's probably the
only possibility out there maybe the is
the HTC merge potentially coming out
this week mm I don't think so it's close
though it's and Verizon systems now it's
taking pictures on picasa it's showing
up and you know it's gotten all
certifications that's another another
block I mean know what I'm wondering
those is um where are these samsung
phones that we saw at CES the the 4g LTE
on verizon and then infuse on ATT well I
asked around that the verizon booth and
they just kept on telling me that it
will come but no timeframe was was soon
is the is the verizon 4g samsung phone
at 4.5 inch screen no no let's confuse
what's interesting is that it's unclear
what the model number of this verizon
phone is um everyone thinks it's the i
five 20 but i was looking at pictures
the other day and that that engadget
took in their hands on and on about
screen the phone itself reports being
the i 510
and we know that there are two phones
out there on I 5 10 and and I 520 and
presume you know both those model
numbers would seem to make them you know
right for a verizon so I'm thinking that
that perhaps the the 4g LTE is the 510
and then maybe the 520 is the is going
to be the follow-up to the fascinate so
you know whatever verizon's version of
the galaxy s2 is good detective work
absolutely very good stuff all right
guys well that concludes the pocket cast
number five thanks for listening thanks
ron is burnin sure our invitation bye
