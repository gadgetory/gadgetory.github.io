number we've already gone hands-on with
the LG g4 in a dedicated first
impressions video now it's time to see
how much has really changed from third
generation to fourth I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow and this is a quick
comparison LG g4 versus LG g3 as always
the first difference you come across is
hardware so let's get physical the g4
comes with more casing options than its
predecessors simple and easily scratched
hairline metallic finish on the new
phone you get the option of ceramic
coated plastic standard plastic or a
natural vegetable tanned leather with
many colors available across finishes
the back is still removable on the g4
and the battery beneath is the same size
as on the 4runner
3000 milliamp hours though our unit is a
little smaller that's weird you do have
to deal with a slight increase in mass
and maximum thickness on the newer phone
but it's not anything drastic in the
hand the g4 feels softer and more comfy
relative to the g3 in part thanks to the
leather and partly thanks to the very
slight curve of the slim mark
construction LG also says that curves
should result in a 20% increase in
damage resistance from drops versus the
g3 acclaim it also made for the G flex
to finally LG's distinctive rear key
remains for volume and power controls
it's basically unchanged from last year
up front the displays are the same size
in the same resolution 5 and 1/2 inch
quad-hd but the chief 4 brings the new
IPS quantum display which LG says offers
20% greater color reproduction and 50%
more contrast and it's also 25 percent
brighter good news considering how
frustrating the g3 s dim panel could be
in sunlight the camera has also seen
significant improvements in the
generation jump the newer phone brings a
bump from 13 to 16 megapixels and
dramatically ups the aperture size from
F 2.4 2f 1.8 stabilization has been
improved to with OAS 2.0 offering two
degrees and three axes of Correction
rather than just 1 &amp;amp; 2 respectively and
the sensor size has been increased as
well
the viewfinder gets an overhaul with a
newer faster launch shortcut using the
rear key new manual controls raw image
support and a spectrum sensor that
should lead to more accurate color
reproduction finally the front-facing
camera has been boosted from 2.1 to 8
megapixels finally you've seen hints of
it
LG's user interface has gotten something
of a paint job on the g4 which is
running android 5.1 underneath more
colorful icons with rounded corners and
a move toward more translucent elements
set the newer phone apart from its
blander sibling and LG has built on some
of its standout features smart notice
gives you more google now like
information event pocket offers a
unified calendar and Google office is
pre-installed with 100 gigs of free
drive storage when you buy the chief for
the whole thing is powered by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 808 rather than the g3 s
Snapdragon 801 or 805 remember that
these improvements while significant are
also all theoretical
we're just relating the spec sheets with
this comparison folks it'll fall to a
full comparison and a full review to put
LG's claims to the test both are coming
soon for now it's safe to say that if
these upgrades are as significant as
they seem LG will be well positioned to
compete with the likes of Samsung and
Apple this summer be sure to check out
our dedicated hands on of the LG g4 here
