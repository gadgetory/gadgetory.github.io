gestures first ubuntu phones to reach
stores in the fall and here comes more
facebook phone rumors I'm hi Nevada
waiting for the real players like Skype
to bring out a phone and this is parking
out daily you know we had some quality
time of the 12 booths back at CES 2013
and no it meant we were quite impressed
with the operating system the only
question left was when the device or the
device is running a bun 2 will be
launched and they said 2014 nor much
have apparently that they will be
launching these devices by the fall of
2013 probably as early as october so
stay tuned because honestly the
operating system does look quite cool
the LG optimus G is not really new we
already saw how it was released back in
Japan a couple of weeks ago but the
interesting part is that apparently it
will be a new device coming to our
shores of different variants and this
device looks exactly like the Galaxy
Note 2 in every single detail I wonder
if they even bring the S Pen but the
point being is apparently we will be
getting this device soon and probably
mwc 2013 could be the date so stay tuned
though I'm still wondering about that
stylus nokia also makes the news with
their new leaks of a Lumia 520 720 and
get this 1000 does the first time the
nokia actually brings a four-digit
number to their future lumen devices and
even though we know that the 520 and 720
will be mid-tier low devices the
question is what can we expect for the
Lumia 1900 numbers available so could
this be that the 1000 will be a phablet
stay tuned we'll probably see that at
mwc as well for those of you that don't
remember the HTC chacha what we don't
blame you I mean it was a terrible
collaboration between HTC and Facebook
to bring a facebook phone and new rumors
have an HTC missed out there and
apparently this will be the new facebook
phone and the question is am I going to
recommend it to you without being
sarcastic out no but the specs do look
interesting so stay tuned and finally
for the interesting news of the day new
rumors have samsung bringing floating
gestures to the galaxy s4 we know that
the Galaxy Note 2 the support floating
gestures from the S Pen and we also know
that smart state does use the camera and
some sort so the
will be our floating gestures the future
for the galaxy s4 is the new feature now
easier to the question of the day do you
consider that floating gestures would be
cooler just to gimmick in my particular
case I consider them a gimmick but leave
