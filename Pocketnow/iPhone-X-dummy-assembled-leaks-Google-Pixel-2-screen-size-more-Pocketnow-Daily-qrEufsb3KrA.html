on video but we're not fully trusting
them we get the possible screen sizes
and information for the future google
pixels and there are some crazy deals
for some of the best LG devices out
there I'm hanging out me that and my
trainer decided she hated me today so
now I can't feel my arms anyways happy
Monday this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for new smartphone
LG's recent black ships are actually
devices we highly recommend and well
eBay's got the g6 for just 420 bucks the
b-24 370 and if you want to go for last
year's g5 which i don't really recommend
much you can get that for 230 bucks
which makes it's crazy compelling you
can learn more description now let's
talk about iOS 11 if you have been
meaning to give it a try and there are a
ton of reasons why you should we have a
full video on it it is currently
available for public beta meaning you
don't have to go through the crazy
hurdles that some of us have to go
through with a developer account and
everything to be able to try it out
obviously you have to remember this is a
beta there will be bugs and you have the
option on reporting on them but so far
so good actually like iOS 11 a lot you
learn more in the description as well
and yes I have received at least three
or four tweets asking about that
rose-pink
Samsung Galaxy S 8 plus for those of you
that want one it is available as of
today the only problem is it's only
available in Taiwan why Taiwan I had no
clue I don't understand what the reasons
for that is but the cool thing is that
the phone is available it should reach
other countries very soon and for those
of you wondering exactly what we should
expect from the next Google pixel
devices today we've got some trusted
sources claiming that in the case of the
regular size we'll pixel we will stick
to five inches on that display diagonal
which is again what we had last year and
apparently that larger Google pixel xl2
will go all the way to six inches which
makes all the rumors of LG handling this
phone and the 16 orbs we should say 18
point 5 by 9 aspect ratio being part of
this whole design
which I cannot wait to see that pixel
Excel to particularly we'll keep you
posted as soon as we learn more and
finally the very interesting news they
have to do with the iPhone 8 and some
leaked images that have emerged and even
a video of a fully working dummy and the
reason I use the quote on quote is
because I don't think it's real first of
all if you notice that front it's
clearly just a cutout from the iPad pro
box and they fit it into the current
display that was already leaked and you
can actually buy on eBay and then they
just fitted it to the back which you can
actually also find on eBay so clearly
somebody is just trying to show off what
it would look like for this iPhone if it
were real sadly that camera hump at the
back looks terrible but it wouldn't be
the first case where we see leaks of the
iPhone they look terrible in the dummies
and then the final unit looks great
so it leads me to the question of the
day assuming that this would be that
final iPhone X or iPhone 8 what do you
think do you like it do you think that
it holds water because in my case
obviously I don't like the dummy at all
I don't like that vertical camera
especially the hump but paint leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get to this earlier
