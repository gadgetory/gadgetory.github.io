your HTC one with the Google Play
edition software I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and here are 5 reasons why
you should HTC Samsung and Google
finally delivered what many have been
asking for for ages recent flagship
shipping with official pure stock
Android it's something that should have
been done a long time ago as now there
are some caveats to making the jump to
stock Android from the custom interfaces
such as since 5 or TouchWiz no longer
are these interfaces just skins but
deep-rooted custom builds have Android
with a handful of useful features for
example with the galaxy s4 Google Play
edition you don't get all the gestures
smart features or even multi window and
with the HTC One you lose Zoe the
animated gallery up with highlights and
infrared but there are plenty of good
reasons to make the switch and flash the
Google Play edition software to your HTC
one first and foremost it will be
running the very latest version of
Android version 4.2.2 that means you get
all the features the original HTC one
was missing on 4.1 daydream quick
settings in the notification shade lock
screen widgets wireless display support
and access to those applications that
require Android 4.2 and above for
example we fell in love with the app
called - clock widget which serves as a
daydream mode lockscreen widget and home
screen widget with a vast selection of
third-party extensions for all sorts of
at-a-glance information 4.2 is exactly
what the HTC One was missing out of the
gate and the Google Play edition
software is the answer to just that
further the Google Play edition software
will be updated much more rapidly than
since ever will be shortly after updates
are announced the updates to the Google
Play HTC One will be handled and
distributed by HTC unfortunately if you
do not have an official HTC One Google
Play edition the updates will not come
automatically you'll have to flash them
manually but that's a small price to pay
for always having the latest version of
Android on arguably the best piece of
Android hardware available
when flashing the google play edition
rom to the HTC one you do lose several
features that are specific to the one
like the ultra pixel camera software zoe
blinkfeed
and much more one thing you do not lose
however is boomsound we were afraid the
google play edition HTC one would not
support Beats Audio and trust us that
would have been devastating
if you've toggled Beats Audio off on the
original HTC One you know just how big
of a part the software toggle plays in
the boom zone we've come to love
fortunately Beats Audio is still present
the icon doesn't appear in the status
bar when audio is playing but it's
definitely there tucked away in the
sound submenu in the Settings app and we
couldn't be more thankful the biggest
problem with sense is how overbearing it
can be especially for power users it
tends to stand in the way of what we
want to see at every turn the power
saver notification for example gets in
the way of Auto expanding notifications
we can't help but feel blinkfeed would
be more useful as a dedicated app or a
lockscreen widget than a home screen and
the app drawer is cumbersome and a major
waste of display real estate stock
Android fixes all of that it removes the
Beats Audio icon in the status bar as
well as the hideous NFC logo and it gets
all the clutter out of the way there's
no bloatware nothing forced on you and
it simply looks more cleaned and simple
if you've made it this far and haven't
decided trying the Google Play edition
software is a lost cause and you're
willing to give it a go do it because
you can because it's what we've been
begging for all along it takes just a
few minutes to install and try out and
provided you make a backup of your
original sense rom if you decide you
don't like it and it's not worth losing
most of HTC's optimizations it's just as
simple to return your phone to normal
this software isn't for everyone but
it's definitely worth checking out if
you find sense to be over-the-top and
overbearing click the thumbs up button
