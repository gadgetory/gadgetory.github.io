today's topic isn't really android
related at all it's something that you
can apply to virtually any kind of
modern technology its storage SD storage
to be precise those removable cards that
give you more space on your phone or
your tablet or your laptop pc camcorder
or even camera what do you need to know
about it what different technologies are
available out there and what are some
things that you need to look out for
that's what we're going to talk about in
today's episode of the android guy
weekly ok to lay the foundation we're
talking about removable storage and
removable storage comes in all kinds of
different formats and flavors and
specifications and there's just lots of
them today we're going to limit our
discussion to the SD card format but we
are going to talk about one other format
because it's kind of interchangeable
with SD so let's get right to that first
so before we had SD cards we had these
guys this is an MMC card or a multimedia
card this one is 128 megabytes no not
gigabytes megabytes now MMC is kind of
like a naked SD card it's thinner it has
the same contacts on it and it doesn't
have that little write-protect switch on
the side that's about it as far as
external stuff goes an MMC card is going
to work in almost any SD card device the
slots the same what's different is where
you get into something that you need to
have the SD or the encryption the secure
part which ironically we hardly ever use
kind of funny huh now today these guys
get all the way up to 128 gigabytes in
capacity there's lots of different
formats that you can get in an MMC card
that are different than the evolutionary
track that the SD cards took so let's
switch gears and talk about that so
let's talk SD cards
this one is a 512 megabyte or a half a
gigabyte card from Kingston it's one of
my original ones and you know it does
its job and that's about it it's got
this nice little right protect tab on
the side it's got the same pin out and
it's a little bit chunkier it's thicker
it's like an MMC card that has a plastic
shell around it instead of just kind of
a covering so SD comes in various
different sizes we have the original SD
card that we talked about already and
then we've got this nice little mini SD
card now there are different sizes
obviously but they have the same pins on
them not the same pin out but the same
pins in fact they're so similar you can
even get these little adapter trays plug
them in just like that and now I've just
turned this mini SD card into a standard
SD card just by doing that now that
means that you've got to have all these
little interconnections that are working
properly there's one extra point of
potential failure so after mini SD came
micro SD to compare them right there you
can see very very small pin outs are a
little bit different but they have
essentially the same contacts on there
you can even take your microsd and get a
little carrier there and plug it in and
now I've got a standard size SD card
using just that micro SD chip now I
don't have the the lock tab on the micro
but i do on the the full-size so just
something interesting to note it's also
kind of a naked chip where it doesn't
have that hard plastic outer shell to it
it just has kind of the covering to it
in fact you can see that just a little
bit if we can get the camp court focus
can see how it's just kind of laminated
is all it's not really encased but
that's what it is so we've talked about
our full size our mini size and our
micro size SD cards now let's talk about
capacities and different formats whether
it's mini micro or standard they
all have the same type of capacity
limitations as any of the others they're
essentially just the same type of card
in a different package so when I talk
about SD and SDHC and SDXC know that
they apply to any one of the flavors
whether that's the standard the mini or
the micro cards so if we take a look at
this guy this is a sandisk one gig micro
SD card and I know it's not focusing on
that too well but there's no speed
indicator on that it's just kind of a
generic card or what's called a class
zero doesn't really have any class some
people call that a class one as it was
the first one out there next up we have
of course class two then class for don't
know why we didn't have a three then we
went up to six then aight aight you
didn't see any eights and then ten so
here's what it looks like and they've
got this neat little symbol it's a sea
with a number inside it so this is a
class 6 card will switch back over here
to this guy this is a micro SD HC and
right above my fingernail don't know if
you can see that it's a little ten
inside that so that's a class 10 now
that's as fast as you can get in the
class denominations for a micro SD card
or really any kind of SD card so what
about them why do we have the different
classes different things that you might
do with your device may require
different amounts of speed for example
listening to an mp3 doesn't take that
much speed it's a relatively low bit
rate however shooting full HD video that
gobbles up an awful lot of space and
you've got to be able to write that very
very quickly otherwise you're going to
start losing frames that's never a good
thing so they came up with this class
measurement so that different cards
could be rated according to how fast
they were if you were just using basic
storage go ahead a class nothing or a
class two would be just fine class for
you might want if you take a lot of
pictures and do it relatively quickly
whether that's on your smartphone your
tablet or even your dedicated camera a
class 6 well class 6 was getting into
the more professional level
if you are going to be shooting a lot of
camera shots and fast succession or if
you are going to be doing basic HD video
recording you know basic HD being 720p
you'd probably want to jump up to a
class 6 if you were doing full HD
however you wanted to go all the way to
a class 10 card now that was going to
help you so that you didn't have the
dropped frames so the card itself
wouldn't be the bottleneck and you'd be
able to write the data out as quickly as
you needed to to match the incoming
source now of course that meant that
your device had to be able to take
advantage of that too right at that full
speed but the nice thing was my class 10
card works just fine in a much much
slower much much older device that
wasn't wasn't built when they had
classes defined there is another class
of speed out there it's called UHS or
ultra high speed instead of a little see
with a number in it it's a you sometimes
with the number in it now why do I say
sometimes it's so new that they don't
have anything beyond one so you might
see that you with the number one in it
and they're usually just for these new
SDXC cards SDXC you're going to see in
slrs you're going to see in higher level
video cameras you know more prosumer I
don't even know if they've made it down
to the prosumer level or if they're
still in the pro level that's how new
and how high-end they are you probably
don't need them but you need to know
about them and know what they are and
what they do so wrapping things up what
card do you need so how do you decide
what you need now there's a difference
there between want and need because of
course you want a two terabyte SDXC with
the UHS 12 doesn't exist but you want it
trust me you do I do but then there's
what you actually need ok so if I've got
a camcorder that accepts SD X C cards
but my laptop doesn't I may go with an
SD HC because I can still get up to 32
gig capaz
on it and I can still get class 10 if
I'm shooting full HD so that I'll do
what I need it to do even though I may
want to do something better than that if
I've got an old device that only reads
standard SD all I might want to take
that into consideration as well but it's
a safe bet sdh can't even say it there's
too many acronyms sdhc high-capacity
that's the one that's your safe bet
that's the one that you want to get now
get it in as bigger sizes you can get
keeping something in mind the faster you
go the more expensive it's going to be
so if you only need an eight gig card
but you want a 16 gig card or you may
one a 32 gig card but you need say a
class 6 or your camcorder is not going
to be able to record at full HD you may
want to scale back the size from 32 to
16 or maybe even 28 so that you can go
from a class four to a classics or a
class 10 card just look at your options
in way out which one is going to give
you the best bang for your buck and then
see how much of the next step up from
that's going to be so for example if you
are looking at say it a 16 gig card you
want a 32 but you want class 10 class 10
if it weighs out you may settle for the
16 gig and save that money if it's only
20 bucks to upgrade to a 32 gig in a
class 10 by all means go for it if it's
you know about twice the cost of the
card you may want to consider getting to
16 gig class tens again it's up to you
and your use for me I'll spend the extra
money I'll get the biggest capacity that
I can and the fastest speed that I can
but I'm different from you you might
have different needs so save money where
you can invest money wisely where you
need to that's all I've got for today
now i'm sure there was a lot of stuff in
there that brought out even more
questions so please head over to the
article at pocketnow.com i will have a
hyperlink to that down underneath where
you can just click it'll be easy to get
over there and we'll kind of keep the
conversation over at pocketnow.com so we
can aggregate everything there too
that's where I'm going to be answering
the questions I know I've answered a lot
before on the YouTube comments but I'm
going to be heading over there so much
easier because it puts us all in one
place so go ahead and do that if you
don't mind if you like learning cool
stuff not just about Android but about
technology give the video a big thumbs
up of course subscribe to our video
channel if you haven't done so already
so you don't miss out on future episodes

other stuff there's a really cool new
one that I think you're going to like
called after the buzz Michael Fisher
it's really awesome so subscribe so we
make sure that you don't miss out on
that 4-pocket now showing off SD its
