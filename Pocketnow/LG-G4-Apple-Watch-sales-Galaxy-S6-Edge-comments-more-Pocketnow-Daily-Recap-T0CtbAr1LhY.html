getting really annoying and I think
there's a reason why your common was
marked as spam the technical
difficulties have anything to do with
alcohol Shh LOL hey man waking up and
smelling the coffee is your favorite
phrase trust me that's just one of them
that's right it's that time of the week
I am hi Mary that up this is pocket now
and this is the pocket now daily recap
for last week someone they asked you if
you would be getting an iphone 6 see if
it would ever happen as the rumors are
that that iphone mini that's in the
works it's actually just the revamp of
the iphone 5c we have 115 comments out
of which n says apple why we want an
effing metal iphone 6s mini yeah and I
kind of agreed not necessarily because
of the materials but mainly because the
iphone 5c was a pretty much rehash of
the terrible phone then enter an IT SEZ
insert butthurt apple fanboy in
parentheses galaxy s6 edge jealous
common here and yes you bet that was the
way the comments went and polygon says
everyone I know has a 5c and dude you'd
be the first one I know that actually
says that everybody else hates the phone
mainly because it was really a ripoff
for what you were getting that on
Tuesday asks you what do you think about
the new microsoft surface as Microsoft
has just launched the surface 3 and it's
a far better tablet than any of its
predecessors and really a good
competitor to even the surface pro 3 in
a way we have 4 min 72 comments out of
which one of them says i love the
surface 3 it's the best tablet outside
the surface pro 3 and you are right
you're looking for productivity tablet
this is really the way to go insane
koolaid says i would buy it if it's
amazing as a drawing tablet because i
would definitely buy one instead of a
Sintek which costs fifteen hundred
dollars and yes this is definitely a
good alternative and flame says it seems
like an interesting concept but like
Microsoft's past surface models i will
be buying one i prefer to keep my tablet
and my laptop separate i use my tablet
for entertainment and my laptop for
productivity and yes i do agree that's a
very good way to do it but i only use
this ipad for the daily recap for
everything else i really have no use for
so that's probably your usage scenario I
really the case for many people and
that's probably the reason why tablets
are not selling anymore then on
Wednesday asked you if you believe that
Apple is capable of selling so many
apple watch units as a the back then
analysts were predicting that the
company was going to outsell anything
and well launch day was a at the time of
this recording and yeah they were right
but back then we had 323 comments out of
which michael jimenez says apple fans
will buy an apple broom if they make it
official Apple has had its share flop so
I don't really agree with that but the I
do believe that people will want to give
the first one to try at least when
Hassan Ali says the first apple watch
will sell just because it's apple and
people want to look cool among their
friends but after knowing how bad it is
there won't be much buyers for the next
year you have a very good point
reviewers have really trashed the Apple
watch and therefore we do believe that
that could happen but then imagine Apple
coming later this year with the Apple
watch to and fixing everything that the
Apple watch one can't to up so it's
really hard to predict another commoner
says I think the apple watch will sell a
lot but I think this product will help
Apple lose its credibility and
credibility is what makes apple apple
and dude this probably the best comment
of the week you're right i mean again
reviews are trashing the apple watch
mainly because it's not really as great
as apple says it is so yeah the hype
will live up Apple will sell like crazy
but then when people start using it
that's really the usage scenario that's
going to make things difficult it could
be that Apple does lose credibility and
that's where marketing is really a
double-edged sword and ones they ask you
which galaxy s unit that you get the s6
edge or the s6 as s6 edge users were
complaining of swirls on display and
scratches and odd stuff like that we
have 667 comments out of which Abdul
says is it just me or does the s6 edge
look better than the s6 but it's not
just you it does look better I just
don't feel that it performs better for
the extra cash another commoner says i
bought the 128 gig 6 edge and i'm scared
of the hell when it comes with it
scratches this is
f'ing iphone 5 issues again oh yeah
people with the iphone hot 5 had these
problems but again we have to confirm so
let us know in the comments whenever it
happens then Colin says I'm sure the s6
is a good phone but once you go note you
never go back can't wait for the note 5
and dude I have to agree with you ever
since i've been using the Galaxy Note
lineup since the note 2 even though I
never use the S Pen I find it hard to go
back to the galaxy mainly because uh wow
I think it's battery life among other
things in the s6 is not famous for its
battery life and finally on Friday I
asked you if you buy extended warranties
for your gadgets as we had rumors of
applecare+ for the Apple watch again
back then it wasn't launched at the time
of the recording of this video we have
391 comments head of which liam smith
says I never bothered with extended
warranties I nearly never drop or damage
any of my phones or tablets so what's
the point if it breaks I'll just get a
new one and dude you're lucky I baby my
phones like crazy and I still smash the
Galaxy Nexus and have to pay for it so
you never know but in the case of Apple
Apple Care Plus offers more benefits
than just that you get it wet you'll
replace your wires they'll give you an
extra year there are some benefits if
you keep the phone for more than a year
then another commoner says I use
extended warranties but i didn't get one
thing if the person pays ten thousand
dollars for gold Apple watch then he
should get applecare for free with three
year warranty swipe a again dude you're
right apple the Apple watch is just too
overpriced when it comes to the addition
that's just too crazy of a price for a
product that's not even fully gold and I
mean I'm talking about the bracelets
because we do know that the gold alloy
for 18 carats is really just to make it
more solid but it's still gold but yeah
it's just the crazy price finally
another commoner says but if you keep
your phones for over a year i do
recommend an extended warranty of some
kind you may be careful with your phones
but there are things that can happen
that are out of your control you know
extended warranties and specifically in
the case of applecare+ has been a
benefit for me particularly because i
resell my Apple products sometimes and
yeah for me it's easy to just go into an
apple store
and swap my product and pay for the
extended warranty price of a swap which
is like eighty dollars and then I sell
my product like new I pretty much sell
it new so there are some benefits other
people use it for other things but yeah
I've had cases where my kids drop bones
that's out of my control and I use the
extended warranty so again you have a
good point even if you baby your
products you cannot control what'll
happen out of an accident of other
people that's it for a out daily
