Park geun-hye calm and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get started this application is called
advanced task killer and it is free on
the android market it allows you to
remove a certain tasks that are running
on your device so let's say I wanted to
free up some onboard memory so all I
have to do is select the task that I'd
like to stop and kill the select apps so
now it will stop the running process on
those applications so if I go back in
here you can see now that I only have
three applications that are running and
get auto start show notification on the
top of the screen here if I like
technology select that and get a few
more option this game is called air
control and it's a very addicting puzzle
game so there are two versions on the
android market a lite version which is
free and a paid version which is about
three dollars and seventeen cents the
paid version has a few more maps so if i
start the game i can show you the object
so the object of the game is to move
their aircrafts to their designated
points of arrival so let's say i wanted
to move this aircraft here all i have to
do is skim it down onto that landing pad
and i'm trying to avoid crash as i can
also speed it up by hitting here so if i
want to move my aircrafts around i have
to move them so they don't hit one
another this application is called
google listen and it is free on the
android market it allows you to search
through hundreds of thousands of
podcasts on the internet so if i want i
can play this one that i've already
started downloading and we can listen to
this on the audio quality is pretty good
and if I like I can search for anything
on the internet so let's say I wanted to
search for wall street journal I can
click on here and it will begin at
searching through all the podcasts on
the internet for Wall Street Journal
this game is called the moron test and
there are two versions available on the
android market a free version and a paid
version which is 99 cents and unlocks
all the rest of the levels so i can
click here and start and it's pretty
simple to play all you have to do is
follow the instructions but be careful
because if you pick the wrong
you will be sent back to the beginning
so where are we right now we're right

left to right and the game continues
like this and once you've failed you
