plus 60 follow a link in the description
below to learn more our experience so
far has been very positive expect our
review very soon
Samson plans to bring new pressure
sensitivity features to their new phones
in the future your newer iPhones also
may seem to be getting performance
through our link features with the new
update and according to a very trusted
source LG is unveiling their foldable
smartphone at CES I'm Jaime Rivera
definitely welcome to November which I
am hoping does not turn into tech member
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for either a Spotify family
plan or a Google home Mini and I know
that these are not related but they
actually are as a Spotify has a deal
where you get a free Google home Mini if
you have a family plan you can bet that
the moment I read this on pocketnow.com
I immediately made my order and then I
came to film the video so look at the
description it's a limited time offer
now let's talk about whatsapp as for
those of you that remember there were
news months ago where the company's CEO
well Facebook CEO was forcing the
whatsapp executive team to figure out a
way to monetize the service and it's
something that the company has been
reluctant to do ever since its beginning
but now apparently they figured it out
and those statuses for whatsapp that are
pretty much like Instagram stories aka
like snaps yeah parently there will be
advertisement there I'm just glad I
actually stay away from that cuz I have
enough with Instagram stories but stay
tuned
let's move the spotlight over to LG as
we've got famous tipster and buddy of
mine Evan blast confirming that there
will be a foldable tell it being
announced at CES LG usually use a CES
for a lot of their announcements but we
haven't really seen anything substantial
when it comes to mobile lately so I'm
really looking forward to this as a they
could beat competitors to the punch but
there's only really one way to find out
now let's move the spotlight over to
iPhones and I'm talking about last
year's iPhones iphone 10 iPhone 8 iPhone
8 plus you probably noticed that there
is a new software update in 12.1
that brings the whole throttling concept
of a old battery to this batch of new
phones and that's rather interesting I
mean there I know they're a year old and
I get it but yeah for those of you that
can still buy an iPhone 8 an A+ right
now it's kind of an irony that you
already get throttling options like
seriously so just buyers beware and
finally the most interesting news today
have to do with Samsung patents and the
probable future of galaxies as we've
seen the company pen a ton of things and
then launching these patents on the
galaxy a lineup and now we have some new
patents where we see pressure
sensitivity on Galaxy phones bear in
mind this is not new we've seen it on
HTC phones we've seen it on the pixel
phones and we also have it on Sony
phones now so yeah apparently this
feature will come to Galaxy phones and
just for you to know I mean ever since
the galaxy s7 edge there has been the
capability to test this but Samsung
never really launched the product so
yeah pressure sensitivity being able to
squeeze your phone and getting more
features in the comments down below let
us know what you think is this something
that you like or that you don't like
because in my case I honestly rarely use
it but it's always great to have an
extra button to a certain degree leave
us a comment down below we love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow us on
