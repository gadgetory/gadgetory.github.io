include an unbreakable display Motorola
X phone specs and possible image render
surface an HTC is no longer quietly
brilliant or so they say I am hi Mary
better and if this video looks better
it's because i'm not using HDR this is
parking out daily let's start today
talking about hcc as the company has
just confirmed that they're switching
their old quietly brilliant tagline you
remember in the past that was called HTC
innovation back in the diamond days and
they swapped it for quietly brilliant
but according to their marketing vp
they're preparing a new bold campaign
that obviously requires a new name and
the question is what would this name be
could it be called brilliance in design
or beauty in design or something like
that I think I'll patent that now let's
talk about some more Motorola X phone
rumors some people think that it's going
to be a next line of phones other people
are now talking about just one device
and apparently this device already has
an image render and we're calling it
fake but it looks kind of cool just kind
of impossibly beautiful as well but it's
also being rumored to have the
snapdragon 800 processor as we've talked
about before but interesting apparently
and won't have a 1080p display it'll be
stuck at 720p with a 4.7 inch display
and the questions why so stay tuned now
let's talk about some more Google than
the works as apparently their Nexus 5
will be a smaller device when compared
to the Nexus 4 apparently this device
will sport a 4.5 inch display and only
720p like that Motorola X phone we just
talked about and not 1080p s is the
current market standard we're really not
complaining about getting a smaller
phone at times when bone zilla complex
is pretty much everywhere but it next to
wonder why 720p and not 1080p as well
but also got some specs woman so make
sure you hit the links in the
description for full details now let's
continue talking about Samsung and this
time about the galaxy s4 mini as a
device looks pretty much identical to
its bigger brother and interesting
enough it's got this new Exynos 5210
processor in the screenshots instead of
the whatever processor that the galaxy
s4 is going to bring because nobody
actually knows that yet but interesting
enough this device will obviously bring
a new processor but the question is what
type of processor will it be and I'm
slee given the fact that the galaxy s3
mini was not treated well when it came
to software updates we still don't
recommend the phone but stay tuned this
processor could change things and
finally for the interesting news of the
day rumours have samsung working on an
indestructible display for their galaxy
note 3 which is most likely to be
launched at Aoife in berlin and the
question is what a Samsung planning to
do to bring this indestructible display
could it be sapphire glass well rumors
still continue on a 5.9 inch display
device with 1080p resolution but that
leads you to the question of the day
have you ever smashed the phone broken a
phone or done whatever has to do with
Smashing of the Vice out of the blue in
my particular case this is my old Galaxy
Nexus sadly with a big smash at the edge
it was actually just after one fall so
