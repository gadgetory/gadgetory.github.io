most users with like we get a ton of
details of Samsung's project or bezoar
irae and Microsoft details all of the
windows 10 editions that it will launch
I'm hi Mary vetta and for all of you
today I've mother need fans I am really
sorry this day has come this is pocket
out daily the official news that I have
to do with huawei as the company has
barely spent a few weeks after it
announced the p8 which we recently
reviewed and it seems that the company
is out for more they just sent out
presentations for an event to happen on
jun 2nd in the united states and we are
just begging to confirm what exactly are
we getting here we'll keep you posted at
the event other official news have
microsoft making its editions of Windows
10 public or at least the names we've
got six editions of Windows 10 that will
be launched blin the summer or after the
summer we're not sure of all the dishes
will be launched at once but we've got
windows 10 home windows 10 professional
we've got windows 10 mobile that's the
way we're going to start calling Windows
Phone now Windows 10 for mobile in
addition to an enterprise variant the
student barians and other names emeritus
a ton of details over exactly what you
are getting on each of these additions
like free versions of office for example
depending on which Edition you get links
is different for exactly what you're
getting and we are not really sure how
the upgrades will apply as well we'll
keep you posted as we learn more and
after the launch of the Apple watch it
was only logical for Google to do
something about Android wear to make it
better there's new version of Android
we're already out there at least for
watch urbane others should get it soon
and we're also getting updates to
services like Google fit for example
once the update reaches your phone's
what you're getting is a revamp design
and revamped options like for example
you get a new widget with your details
and your progress and you also get a new
watch face for Android wear that
provides you with all your fitness data
sort of what you get on the Apple watch
as well but again cool things that are
coming and have you noticed we're still
in official news we've got other news
from the Samsung gear a
not necessarily not official because the
company has just made its sdk available
to developers today for the gear lineup
and it pretty much spills everything we
should expect from project orbis or the
gear a like for example the fact that we
get a 1.18 display with 360 2 360
resolution the fact that it's going to
be a full metal enclosure and that the
rotating bezel will help you navigate
everything sort of like what you could
currently do with the Apple watch's
digital crown and we also get all
specifications like for example the fact
that this will be an LTE SmartWatch or
at least a cellular enabled SmartWatch
and all the sensors that we're getting
and pretty much everything let's just
see how cool it is a tifa and finally
for the very concerning news of the day
we have a very detailed analysis over
how secure the Apple watch is and it
turns out that it's not as opposed to
the iPad or the iphone where there is
activation lock which was along the
United States and in certain countries
where unless you know somebody's iCloud
password even if you wipe the phone or
tablet you really can't activate it for
somebody else the problem of the Apple
watch is you don't have this option even
though you still can add a password to
your watch the problem is that there is
a way to bypass that and reset the watch
and just pair it with another iphone so
yeah anybody could steal your Apple
watch and make it theirs and that is
really a big problem because that for
iPhones has gone down dramatically after
activation lock was enabled but then
again the problem is that with wearables
that's not the case and it leads me to
the question of the day do you feel that
the companies should enable activation
lock for wearables because by the way
this applies to Android wear as well you
get three pair and Android wear
SmartWatch with anything if you want
it's the same case with the pebble and
everything else do you feel that this
should happen activation lock leave us a
comment down below because I do believe
it should friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video was filming sure you follow
what I'm out comment subscribe
to our YouTube channel as well you
follow me on twitter hein underscored
