brought to you by B brain just when I
thought I was done with big phones
Samsung drags me back in from my first
time holding it to the first day playing
with it to now this design continues to
impress it's a hardware aesthetic which
remains visually appealing and these
symmetrical curved sides playfully
confuse your fingertips into thinking
this phone is thinner than it really is
you've all heard me say this before that
this is a stunning look which should be
admired under museum lighting but I
still can't shake my personal feelings
on glass back devices beautiful to look
at but not my favorite to hold and while
I would prefer to use my phone's naked
the phone's naked not me naked the SI
plus sort of mandates a caesura skin
it's an age-old debate in our comments
case or no case and the SI plus doesn't
help at all and moving the needle on
those opposing viewpoints for such a
large phone it fits in the hand
terrifically well and this is the
easiest time my stumpy thumb has had
with lateral swipes on a phablet but
sliding the phone up to unlock then down
for navigation controls then up for a
notification shade then holding the
phone like a camera this thing always
feels like it's balanced on the least
amount of fingertip surface I can
comfortably utilize I just can't shake a
small concern about drop performance
Gorilla Glass 5 has proven to be a
durable performer but these edges
provide more surface area to wreck your
day with a fairly common life style
issue like dropping your phone that ip68
water resistance is always appreciated
though Samsung was ahead of the curve
there and it's still kind of amazing to
see open ports on a phone which handily
survives being completely submerged the
tech on board is well documented by this
point it's about as cutting-edge a
collection of specs as we should expect
for 2017 disappointing only the RAM
junkies in our audience North American
owners will see the Qualcomm 835 while
the rest of the world will receive the
Exynos processor we were hoping to see
more parity this year but from early
benchmarking Exynos continues to deliver
a consistent bump in performance even
for that disparity the 835 at least
catches Qualcomm up to the
horsepower we've been enjoying for a
while now in the fall a mate 9 and p10 a
small hardware gripe the galaxy's home
button has a vibration sensor to mimic
the tactile response of hardware but it
doesn't pulse consistently sometimes I
press longer expecting that haptic feel
and launched my Google assistance
instead one area I wish Samsung had been
a bit more inspired by the response on
the iPhone 7 the fingerprint sensor home
button is gone of course moving that
biometric security feature clumsily to
the rear of the phone using the SI plus
for a week now I still smudge my camera
on the regular but my early teething
pains and unlocking have mostly been
ironed out mostly hilarious that Samsung
has a camera pop-up warning you not to
smudge your lens not that they couldn't
have helped us out there with a better
sensor location and I do need to deliver
a small retraction from my first
impressions video that I was
disappointed and not having a
notification shade gesture on the sensor
which of course that is included it's
still not as convenient is what I got
used to on my mate 9 but I'm happy to
have this organ amah consideration the
counter-argument to this fingerprint
sensor is to train the iris scanners on
the front face so you don't have to
smudge your camera the performance is
incredibly fast unlocked in all but
backlit conditions but it's a much more
deliberate action I'd prefer the phone
be unlocked before I hold it up to my
face and so pairing over Bluetooth with
my car and a SmartWatch for smart unlock
has pretty much eliminated when I might
use that iris scanner speaking of
bringing the phone up to your face that
brings us to this new AMOLED display a
6.2 inch wqhd plus LMNOP 18 point 5 by 9
aspect ratio monster which just slightly
bests the 5.9 inch mate 9 for overall
area and makes a mockery of the forehead
and chin bezels on an iphone plus if
you've got HDR content to stream do it
because this screen will handle it
beautifully a small concern though on
the galaxy s7 switching the display to
basic mode used to deliver one of the
most color accurate screens on any phone
we tested the s8 color processing is
downright ruddy by comparison and users
should probably stay in some kind of
adaptive mode until Samsung can push
a software fix another small concern the
phone pops out of the box using a lower
than native resolution ostensibly for
better performance of power management
which we'll talk about later in this
review there's nothing wrong with this
in theory but I would have preferred
some kind of disclosure or an option to
change this during the initial setup why
pay for all these pixels if users aren't
aware that they're not going to use them
all moving over to software the spirit
of TouchWiz lives on in that nearly
every aspect of this phone has been
touched skinned or tweaked some of these
changes are comically unnecessary like
sliding up to get the app drawer then
laterally to get app pages is that a
huge deal
nope you'll get used to it but why
change directions like that at all it's
just different for the sake of being
different a menus settings UI elements
they all have that special Samsung twist
to them though switching to a dark theme
I still couldn't find a way to change
the notification shade someone please
drop me a comment if you know how the
screen gets plenty dim for night use I'm
still not a fan of that bright white
notification slide for all this
customizing Samsung still hasn't quite
answered the question of why we need
this taller screen more area is great
but what do we really get for it games
and videos will likely be cut off at the
corners the camera app is a sea of
wasted space and we're reaching farther
for corner mounted UI elements the area
is improved you will see more content in
your browser and Samy does feature some
of the best split-screen multitasking
available easily shifting the size of
apps on your display but it's not so
much better than an LG g6 that we would
call that a purchasing recommendation
Samsung's answer for productivity is one
we've seen since the s6 days the edge
screen panel now slightly more evolved
for customizing at a glance content and
shortcuts and using a ton of other
phones I keep forgetting it's there but
people using the s8 as a permanent daily
driver will probably better enjoy quick
access to these shortcuts Game Center
also returns as a handy way to capture
gameplay but with recent improvements to
YouTube gaming and Google Play games we
probably recommend the Google apps over
Samsung's cost
Ellucian I should probably stream some
future fight when I get a chance at
least from here I can customize
performance and screen options
unfortunately we can't comment much on
Vic speed it's not done yet we have to
ding Samsung here the same way we dinged
HTC for the you ultras missing AI this
is such an important feature that
there's a dedicated button for it but it
wasn't ready for launch
so our review remains incomplete if
using Bixby vision is any early
indication we're not entirely impressed
with Samsung's digital assistant
strategy as it stands I've already
disabled the Bixby homepage which just
lags the phone in one of the most
important areas for smooth performance
just like Flipboard for previous
generations of galaxies last for
software I was a bit disappointed to see
the s8 ships with Android 7.0 as more
phones are arriving with 7.1 sitting on
an e team T s7 which is still stuck on
marshmallow this hasn't given me a lot
of hope that Samsung can leverage
carrier relationships for more timely
update we'll just have to be ok with
devices skinned this heavily lagging
behind leaner builds of Android a closer
look at performance and it's good it's
about par for a Samsung phone sure this
is bleeding edge hardware but Samsung
has a lot running on this device even
using an unlocked phone without carrier
bloat the general UI and app performance
is snappy but phones with less powerful
hardware and less customization often
feel comparable or even a touch quicker
now this hardware is overkill for the
communications basics and firing up a
poorly optimized for Android game like
Marvel's future fight this is the
smoothest we've seen it run on Qualcomm
hardware but getting into busy gameplay
moments we think Huawei still has the
edge a quick note on this game
specifically we use it because it's
poorly optimized it's a test of brute
force performance a better optimized
games will obviously run a lot smoother
LCE connections around town were
generally excellent on 18t regularly
best in the LGG 6 using androids
built-in reception gage that was also
mirrored and faster download speeds
running some speed tests Wi-Fi
performance though was nearly identical
when testing from the edges of my condo
if anything I saw a slight bump to the
g6 but one so minor it could easily be
within the margin of error for this app
we've already produced our real camera
review for the s8 and it's the most
in-depth examination of photo and video
performance available on the Internet
we'd highly recommend watching that if
you're curious about what this 12
megapixel camera can really do
especially the conclusion to that video
but as a brief summation here if you
don't like the Samsung aesthetic of
popping saturation and sharpening the s8
won't do much to change your mind
otherwise we've got a terrific
all-rounder with excellent auto focus
performance though it only stands as a
minor improvement over the s7 which came
before it
like the g6 one of my favorite
improvements has little to do with the
actual output of the camera but more the
fact that this camera module is now
completely flush with the rear housing
an impressive feat which another
manufacturer will hopefully learn from
likewise we also have a real audio
review available and a separate review
of the included earbuds which are not
made by a kg but prominently feature the
branding which Samsung acquired in their
acquisition of harman happily this whole
system represents a noticeable step up
in speaker and headphone quality over
the s7 and we've got those reviews
linked below this video for folks who
want to take a deeper dive one thing we
didn't cover in depth oh Samsung's EQ
tweaking is a convenient way to tailor
fit playback for those folks who are
into that kind of thing it's really easy
to use so if you're not quite impressed
with audio out of the box this should
help you dial in the color you prefer
now our usual pairing of battery tests
the s8 plus pulled very normal numbers
for draining and recharging this was a
fairly conservative year for Samsung in
terms of battery tech and caution was
probably the right play the si+ had very
few issues lasting a day with moderate
to heavy use light users should easily
able to hyper mild two days out of this
battery and while it's not the fastest
phone we've ever recharged a short stint
on a charger should give you a healthy
top off when you need it still we wanted
to take a closer look at the display
resolution and how that might affect run
time pushing our video streaming tests
to 1 hour for each resolution we really
only saw significant gains when dropping
resolution down to 720p the difference
between 1080 and 1440 was nearly
identical anecdotally we also didn't see
much performance difference so we're not
quite sure why this was such a priority
for Samsung to deliver resolution
reduced out of the box and why there was
no disclosure so let's wrap this up
where's that leave us with the Galaxy s8
plus well folks we're looking at what is
sure to be one of the best selling
phones of 2017 I may will be tackling a
separate review of the smaller essay but
in early sale data it looks like the
plus has a slight lead probably a
combination of the thinner width and the
people who were left in the lurch by the
note sevens absence this is a stunning
example of design but it leaves us with
a few philosophical questions what does
this screen deliver that can't be done
on a smaller display sure we all hate
bezels I guess but isn't this kind of
worse in a way and including more
powerful hardware is awesome but right
now all manufacturers and not just
Samsung would benefit greatly from
better software optimization the
experiments we've been playing with from
Huawei oneplus and the pixel point to
the true lifestyle improvements we
should expect from better hardware
software synergy one of the concerning
elements of this phone it feels like
there's a lot of untapped potential here
and as a general rule I tend to avoid
making technology purchasing
recommendations based on potential but
instead based on what that gadget can do
at the exact moment you buy it because
sometimes the potential is realized and
that feels like getting a bonus for your
cash but when potential is left
unfulfilled that often feels like a
financial loss are you really getting
your money's worth it's a precious
question to ask as phones start climbing
north of $800 the Galaxy s8
certainly delivers a spec sheet arguing
for that price tag no question there's a
lot packed into this gadget but only you
and your wallet can determine if you're
really going to get the full return on
this investment hey folks if you're
looking to protect the glass on your
Galaxy s8 give it a little bit more grip
or prevent all of those gnarly
fingerprint smudges you should just wash
your hand head on over to D brand or
they've got a whole collection of really
awesome skins for you to customize the
look and feel of your Galaxy smartphone
