Daniel Webster here Sparky now calm and
today I'm gonna show you a cool free
application that allows you to use t9
text on your windows mobile device so a
refresh of mine recently inquired about
the Omni and was asking if the device
had t9 text because she's used to just
texting on a regular standard mobile
phone and I said well I'm not
particularly sure about that phone but
some windows mobile devices allow you to
use it but I found a program that
incorporates t9 text as a keyboard and
it's called foam type so to activate the
t9 text you just select this little
button right here otherwise it's just
standard text like you can just push the
button numerous times to select words
and I'll show you that in just a second
but if I want to type hey how you doing
I can just go and type and it can select
different words and you can also add new
words I'll show you that in a second too
and it works pretty well it's pretty
fast and as you can see it typed
perfectly and suggested the exact same
words I wanted to look for so if I
wanted to add a new word let's just
clear this real fast okay let's say I
wanted to add PocketNow or something
like that so I can just so if I wanted
to add a new word I just type in here
and now you have to type in standard so
P oh oops see ke T and you have to type
it numerous times just like on regular
keyboards for regular texting
and there it is it typed it with a
period okay so that's perfect and
another thing you can add is if you
wanted to add more words you can just
click a letter and hit right here and it
will say new word and you can also add a
new word there and just type it whatever
you want to do so another cool feature
about this program is that it allows for
an entire symbols list so if I wanted to
type like $200 I can go here and hit to
0-0 and it works perfect and you have to
hold it down just like on regular
standard mobile devices okay so I'll
just delete this and if you've recently
seen the post by Anton Deane Agee it
shows you how to increase the
sensitivity of your Windows Mobile touch
screen and it works really well for all
programs but this one in particular so I
can just type hey how are you doing
again so let's like select t9 so
and it works really well so I'm Daniel
Webster with packing.com and I'll post a
link after I'm done with this video
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
