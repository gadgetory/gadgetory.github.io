android guy for pocketnow.com but you
might not know I'm also a professional
web developer now what's a web developer
well he's the guy or the gal that takes
really nice designs from people with
degrees in in fine arts and turns them
into standards-compliant code that you
eventually see in your web browser so
that's what this video is going to be
about it's about Android it's about
browsers but it's about the stock
browser that comes with most
android-powered devices which is really
just google chrome and mozilla firefox
which is right now in beta on android
but you probably know it from your
desktop let's go take a look at why
that's important and more important
which one's faster okay before we get to
speed test a little bit of background
first and foremost what our web
standards why are they important where
do they come from now this is something
i could write books about but i've only
got a little bit of time in this video
so let's just sum up really fast web
standards are what we have now it's a
specification for writing web pages now
those pages have to follow certain rules
for CSS for HTML for all that stuff that
you guys don't need to know about but it
came about really because way back in
the day we had netscape navigator and we
had a newcomer internet explorer and
eventually the internet explorer became
so dominant it crushed Netscape
Navigator but before they died they
rolled their code out their source code
there rendering engine really what it is
that displays the web pages well they've
rolled that out to open source the
Mozilla Foundation was born and they
grew firefox firefox on the desktop was
great it was an alternative for internet
explorer you see internet explorer for
that was revolutionary internet explorer
5 it was progress 55 that was a nice
stable browser internet explorer 6 well
that's the one
the nail in the coffin netscape and
really there wasn't any progress after
that it's stagnated Microsoft rested on
their laurels and they just didn't do
anything then Firefox came around and
all of a sudden it was a brand new game
well we know now that Microsoft has been
trying and trying and trying to catch up
and release a web standards compliant
browser you see chrome uses webkit
Safari uses webkit Mozilla uses Mozilla
Firefox uses Mozilla opera uses some
weird amalgamation of WebKit we just
want to talk about opera but they're all
basically just web browsers that are
trying to present web pages the way that
the developer and the designer intended
now that's easier said than done
Microsoft has been trick playing
catch-up internet explorer 7 on the
desktop was atrocious Internet Explorer
8 which is what most of you have it
comes a long way from seven but it's
still not standards compliant it doesn't
support css3 I mean that's insane ok and
then internet explorer 9 it's a lot
better but still not great windows phone
still doesn't have a standards-compliant
web browser in it and i'm sorry you guys
I know that's going to offend some of
you but it doesn't there will be an
update that will bring that up to
Internet Explorer 9 Lite if you want to
call it that they'll come out later
because well internet explorer 9 for
desktop hasn't come out yet okay so
enough about standards let's move on
because that's way longer than I wanted
to go so we've got browsers now browsers
do things differently internet explorer
built into Windows everybody has it
except the Europeans who get a choice
you guys are lucky over here we have to
try and educate our consumers and say
hey try chrome try opera try firefox try
anything but what came with your machine
firefox and chrome do things better and
faster than internet explorer any
version ridiculously faster so when we
take that to a mobile device that's
where
it's really kind of a game changer
because you know we have a small device
with limited resources limited amount of
RAM limited processor and really a
limited pipe to get data we'll come back
to that may be a little bit later but
with all these limitations you need to
be super fast not only do you have to
render the page but you also have to
scale it to fit that smaller screen if
there's not a you know a native app
version like pocketnow.com you go to
pocketnow.com on your android you're
going to get a mobile-friendly version
of the site well not every site has done
that so the browser has to figure out
what it should look like on your little
screen and then scale up and down it is
really quite complex on Android the only
choice that you've had really has been
browser the one that comes with it now
we've talked about skyfire we've talked
about some others dolphin and whatnot
and they're great browsers but they're
still kind of Fringe browsers like opera
they're just kind of a fridge they
appeal to a certain set of people they
have some benefits they have some
disadvantages but now we've got major
muscle come into the game and that's
Mozilla Mozilla for handhelds used to be
called fennec that was the code name and
they decided to rename it to just
Firefox that makes sense the desktop
versions popular why not have the same
version on your mobile so there's all
the background you need we just had a
new beta come out for firefox i believe
is 4.5 beta and that's really what we
want to see so there's all of your big
long introduction if you didn't want to
hear it I assume you skipped it up until
this point so what we're going to do now
is I've got a nexus one running
cyanogenmod 7 Gingerbread and I've got a
g2 running cyanogenmod gingerbread
they're both clocked basically the same
speed gigahertz 2 gigahertz they're both
connected to the same Wi-Fi network so
we should have pretty much the same
speed rendering pretty much the same
speed network wise and we're going to go
through and run not only some
compatibility tests but we're also going
to run some speed tests so let's go
ahead and get right to that all right
using setcpu for root users I'm gone
ahead and set these so they're clocked
the same minimum speed is going to be
245 megahertz maximum speed is going to
be just over 1 gigahertz so they're
running at the same core speed so we're
looking at the app drawer right now on
one side we've got a TW and launched on
the other side we've got launcherpro not
really that important we're going to go
ahead and fire up browser on this side
and firefox on this side just so you can
see how fast each one of them opens now
I've gone ahead and rebooted both of the
phones right now so neither one of them
has anything recently loaded there's
nothing pre cached so you're going to
see how long it takes to do the initial
load and I'll see if I can do this at
the same time so we open that up now you
notice right here immediately it
launches the browser it goes to google
over here we have to load and load and
load until finally we get that so first
load obviously goes over to Google's
browser and Firefox comes in a
disappointing second place the web
standards project has put together lots
of different tests to make sure your
browser is rendering stuff correctly and
all this is a web page that has a bunch
of stuff on it a bunch of HTML code CSS
JavaScript and whatnot and it has a
reference rendering how it should render
and then it lets your your phone or your
computer render it so let's go ahead and
run this and see how they do so over
here this came up hello world really
fast and for some reason browser is not
running it for some reason which is
really interesting so the next test run
of course is acid 3 let's go ahead and
run that now acid 3 acid three and over
here says the browser is 93 out of a
hundred so I'm not bad over here took a
little bit more time to complete but we
got 90
seven out of one hundred percent so very
good over here a little bit better on
the Firefox side than on the browser
side of things and a lot better of
course over here on the the Firefox side
compared to browser in the acid to test
next up we've got html5 test com what
this website does is it checks your
browser for html5 compatibility now
recently html5 was renamed just HTML but
i think the html5 moniker is going to
stick around for a little while so let's
go ahead and go on both of these much
faster over here on the browser side of
things a little bit slower on the
firefox side but you can see obviously
176 out of 300 points with one bonus
point 207 with nine bonus points out of
it 300 so much better html5 support on
firefox than on browser this next test
is a vulnerability test it's by B check
dot scan it dot B II and what we've done
here is we've loaded up and we said we
want to run all available tests it's
noted that the browser name version and
platform for both of these so I was
incorrect this is version 4.0 beta 5 i
think i mentioned that incorrectly
earlier in the video let's go ahead and
start the test for all available tests
now this is going to try and crash the
browser and that's what that message
just said opens up a new tab which over
here it's showing you kind of a modal
window and it says please don't close
this window while the browser test is
running it's being used by the test so
we're going to go ahead and let that run
now this takes a little bit of time so
what i'm going to do is go ahead and
pause let the test run and then i'll
report back with the results okay now
with that last test neither browser
crashed the
both of them came up with unable to
display page on numerous occasions which
is really a good thing it can't display
pages that might be potentially harmful
to to the device so all in all they tied
in that test next test up is SunSpider
SunSpider is a JavaScript benchmarking
utility to see how fast the browser runs
java script so the latest version is 0.9
point 1 let's go ahead and start
SunSpider now a little bit faster over
here off the up the start on browser
Firefox still looks like it's trying to
think about it and this is kind of
boring what it's doing is it's running
through all these different JavaScript
functions some people call them methods
but they're really functions in
JavaScript to do stuff like string dot
catenate math dot round math dot floor
just all of these things that it's
running through and running the tests to
see how fast it can do all these things
and it's got a little timer down here
i'll see if i can zoom in a little bit
to show you that so far so good i mean
it's cranking through this it's not all
that exciting because it's just running
through those functions behind the
scenes and updating the screen with what
it's running and how long it took to
complete now over here on Firefox this
is the same test and it hasn't even
started apparently so I don't know if
this version of firefox mobile is
incompatible with SunSpider which would
be a shame that doesn't bode well or if
there's just some other problem but
let's go ahead and let things run and
see how browser does and see if firefox
catches up and starts to run it now even
though it didn't show anything on the
screen Firefox actually came through and
completed in approximately two thousand
seven hundred and seventy nine
milliseconds with a margin
error on that of plus or minus 3.6
percent over here on browser however it
showed us what it was doing but it only
took quite a bit longer at 4710
milliseconds with a margin of error plus
or minus seven point nine now to compare
that over on my desktop machine running
the latest version of Chrome it's a dual
core machine with two gig of ram I was
able to complete the test in 627
milliseconds plus or minus one percent
margin of error so significantly faster
over there most likely due to the dual
core but over here you can see big
difference about twice as long over on
browser as it was over on Firefox now
that might have been because this was
doing screen updates over on the browser
browser whereas this wasn't doing any
browser any screen updates in the
Firefox browser so that might have had
something to do with it so there's a
whole bunch of tests whether you like
benchmarks or not they're what they are
and you can kind of see whether each one
of them ranks now you're probably not
going to go out and do this on your own
so let's get into to just wrap this up
some real-world sites let's go to the
same site on both of the browsers and
see which comes up faster so you can get
a feel of which one actually is going to
look like it performs faster to the end
user all right so we're going to try and
go to apple.com over here in browser
it's up immediately just like that over
here on Firefox nothing now this is not
because Firefox can't display the apple
website or even the pocket now website
this is a bug with the beta version of
the software where sometimes it will
resolve the page and it won't display
anything at all and then what you need
to do is exit the browser and restart it
so let me go ahead and do that and let's
rerun this test and see what we can get
now instead of closing the browser and
reopening it what I did was I swiped
over to the side and I had a few tabs
open and when I say a few
mean there were a total of three and
apparently that was too much for the
browser to handle so Firefox choked on
that and it wasn't able to display the
page so let's go ahead and refresh this
over here and just so you can see how
fast it loads we'll go ahead and go on
that to see how fast that one loads as
well not at the same time obviously but
they both come up and they both render
the page pretty much the same now in all
fairness let's go ahead and look at
another website similar to apple and see
how they do so let's go ahead and try
and go to microsoft com Firefox got a
little bit of a head start on that
button push over here it says that
mobile microsoft com wants my location
do I want to share that or not it also
says the same thing over here in browser
so I'm going to share my location with
that just because we can now if you
notice the pages are fully loaded they
look a lot different over here in
browser it seems to look a little bit
better than over in Firefox if we zoom
and try and get this to resize now it's
not looking all that great so they
loaded about the same time but
definitely browser looks a little bit
better if you compare that to browser on
the other hand this is on the phone
already the total including data and
application is 2.0 of 7 megabytes so
quite a difference there on the factor
of about seven times bigger for Firefox
than for browser and then the cash to do
exactly the same thing was only 4.5 two
megabytes versus over here was quite a
bit more than that so which one should
you use it's up to you i would recommend
a browser because it seems faster on
both of these phones but if you want to
go for raw speed again go with firefox
because it's more standards-compliant at
least in this iteration and because it's
an option it's an alternative it's got
some neat you I things that browser
doesn't have which we didn't go into
because this video was about speed
and compatibility so go ahead and try
firefox out if you haven't let me know
what you think that's what the comments
are for down at the bottom so make sure
you leave us feedback what do you think
about browser versus Firefox is there a
test that we should have run that we
didn't is there something you'd like to
see or is there another browser that you
run other than these two that is faster
or better and why let us know in the
comments down below of course if you
like seeing these kind of speed
comparisons and compatibility comparison
videos give us a thumbs up so we know
that you want us to keep shooting them
head on over to pocketnow.com so you can
see the write-up on this particular
article and I'll have links to those
tests so if you want to run them on your
own mobile phone or even on your desktop
computer you'll be able to do that as
well be advised that now one test the
vulnerability test it tries to crash
your computer and if your browser isn't
up to date and if your antivirus
software isn't up to date it probably
will so I'm just going to put that out
there right now so a whole bunch of
information I hope you liked it of
course if you've got any feedback at all
leave those in the comment as in the
comments section as well and for pocket
now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
