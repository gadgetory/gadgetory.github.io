Apple watch customers aren't in luck we
get pricing for the Samsung gear s2 and
it's not that bad we also get more leaks
of the android-powered blackberry Venice
I'm high in Marietta and even though my
team doesn't always win at least it
doesn't lose this is pocket out daily if
it's only said I start with LG as the
company has already begun sending
teasers for the super premium foam that
we hope to see on September 21st and yet
the back does look metallic in addition
to the fact that we do here LG class at
the bottom of this teaser so we wonder
exactly what does that mean and how this
super premium phone will be better than
what's already out there other sort of
official news have the Samsung gear s2
price points for the United States we
hear that in the case of the gear s2
it'll be costing three hundred fifty
dollars and in the case of the gear s2
plastic we're talking about four hundred
dollars which is really not bad price
points for a watch that is apparently
better than Android we're not
necessarily better than the Apple watch
but a significantly better Christ if
that will be the case they tuned as we
should learn more soon now other news
from sony are rather confusing we heard
the Xperia z5 premium had a 4k display
we demoed it at Aoife in Berlin but Sony
officials are claiming that even though
you do have 4k video capabilities the
display will be actually working at
1080p for everything else in a way to
make everything optimum medium if you're
watching a video that's for cake capable
you'll be able to watch 4k resolution on
your display the pixels are there but
it'll handle everything else in 1080p in
order to save on battery life very
interesting we can't wait to get this
product for review and confirm that
house will the spotlight over apple
those of you waiting for iOS 9 the
update is now available for everyone and
yes you can expect the servers to go
crazy right now make sure you download
your update with time but those of you
waiting for watch OS to you will be
waiting because apparently Apple has
detected a major bug in the operating
system and you will have to wait to get
your update now for those of you that
have ever updated to watch OS to beta
you'll know that this is
pretty much like pulling teeth it's
horrible procedure so I don't blame
apple for wanting to do things right
here and finally for the very
interesting leaks of the day the
blackberry Venice shows up again in
photos is the blackberry powered
smartphone that actually looks gorgeous
it looks thin it's got your curity
keyboard apparently it'll have a very
interesting version of Android
apparently when you boot the phone
you'll see the android logo but it'll
have a lock around it because this will
be a more secure version of android
according to them but yeah the design
looks gorgeous in every way apparently
blackberry has found ways to make the
google now launch innovative etc etc but
hey it leads me to the question of the
day with all the hot smartphones that
you've seen already this year would you
be looking forward to this Blackberry
Android smartphone because in my case I
was a die-hard blackberry fendt yes I
would really want one but leave us a
comment down below it's your case
