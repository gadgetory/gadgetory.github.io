pocketnow.com
and this is a look at the built-in
applications on the Google Nexus One
some of what you're about to see is
unique to the Nexus One while some stuff
you'll find on newer Android devices
Android 2.0 and above in particular so
let's turn on the device and we'll do a
slide to unlock and get a little bit
closer to the screen so you can see it
okay so let's jump right into the
application tray just pick out a few
things here to show so we'll start off
in the calendar quite simply and we're
going to tap on the Menu button and zoom
out to the month view very nice looking
calendar of course built at the Android
can flick up to go to the next month and
so on and so forth and we can tap on a
particular day to sort of drill into the
day and see what's going on we can swipe
to the right and swipe to the left and
you can also get a nice agenda view for
that particular day which is especially
useful and seeing what you're where you
need to be and when and then we can go
to the week view which is nice
especially when you have a lot going on
it helps you to sort of visualize the
activities that you have planned in that
day and then we can also go back to the
day view which is what we started off
with okay so let's go back to the
application tray and go further
we're not talked about photo quality
soon we're going to do some demo videos
and some demo photos the car kit is
quite nice it features real navigation
although a lot of people say the
navigation is not as good as you would
get on a Garmin device or a TomTom
device so we can tap on navigation we
can get turn-by-turn voice guided
directions which is quite helpful and
it's nice to have on your phone without
having having to pay for it beyond the
data plan that uses it used to download
the the maps okay so we can go into into
contacts and this is the contacts
application and there's a big problem
with this and I haven't figured out how
to quickly get to a contact without
having to scroll through a massive list
and perhaps I haven't spent enough time
with this device but it doesn't have
quick dial like you would find in you
know windows mobile device so if I'm
trying to dial John in Windows Mobile I
would do J o n well in this case you get
six-six and nothing more you can also go
to the call log and back to contacts and
then you can see favourites and it
organizes by the most frequently cod
which is quite useful to have ok let's
go to email email is implemented quite
well and of course you can do a lot of
actions on particular emails by doing
checkboxes over here on the left and you
can add a star mark as unread or delete
right now it hooked up to my Microsoft
Exchange account and it works it works
very well we can tap on a message and we
can click show picture it will download
the picture you know usual stuff that is
quite nice ok let's go into clock here
and quite simply this is sort of a plot
that you could put on your desk to sort
of show you the weather and the time you
can turn off the screen brightness as
well and it may be difficult to see in
the video but the screen is actually
still visible so maybe a nice way to
sort of leave this out on your desk
especially if you get a dock for it
let's turn the screen brightness back on
we can go into the alarm clock function
we can go into the photo slideshow mode
it's a really scary looking picture of
my dog music playing and then we can go
sort of back home from that screen so
let's continue down the line we have
Facebook an excellent Facebook
application is included now we can go
into gallery which is pretty unique for
this device so what you can do and it
took me a while to figure this out is
that you can have this actually
organized into stacks on the stack of
pictures and I go over here to this
upper right corner it actually will
organize it by date and you can organize
it by other ways to what it will
actually do is try to pull up the
location so what actually geo tags the
pictures so you can say okay I want to
look at all the pictures taken in media
Pennsylvania and then you tap on that
and here they are organized by that
particular area you can go back into the
stacks view or the gallery view and a
very nice way to view lots and lots of
pictures you have this little scroller
along the bottom and of course
simultaneously this will work in
landscape it's a really quick way to
flick through a lot of pictures I don't
have many on this device but if you
didn't have a lot of pictures you'd have
a easy time organizing them so let's go
back and go down the list again let's
quickly go into the market you've seen
the Android Marketplace before it's been
evolved a lot since our
your versions of Android it's really
fantastic we should be over Wi-Fi right
now so of course you get a little bit of
a preview area up here that shows you
some recommended applications then you
have some more featured apps and down
along here there are about 10,000
applications in the Android store right
now definitely not as robust as you'll
find for the iPhone and iPod Touch what
but it's getting there
so we go to all applications and then we
can drill down by top free and top paid
and it works quite quickly and of course
you get the the ranking and you get a
little note whether it's installed or
not and tapping on here will allow you
to see the downloads and all the
applications that you've downloaded one
of the greatest things about the Android
Marketplace is that it integrates with
the phone actually the notification tray
so if we go to a free application say
like let's do let's do backgrounds it's
actually a pretty cool application you
click install and it shows you all of
the sort of system resources that it
will use you'll get a notification in
the top bar here and wait a second for
it to show up there it goes and if you
pull down the window shade which of
course is androids way of showing you
all the system notifications it gives
you an update on the download progress
of that application so you can tap on
here and open up the application which
works quite well of course this isn't
unique to the Google Nexus One but just
wanted to show you sort of how far we've
come with the Android Marketplace it
really has evolved a lot since earlier
versions of Android so let's get out of
this and continue our way we talked
about Google Goggles which is an a free
application available in the Android
Marketplace they'll actually take a
picture of an object and it actually
tries to recognize what that object is
most of the time it works quite well
Google Maps is nice though I wish there
was multi-touch here's something cool
let's go into messaging into a text
message and there's really good voice
recognition built right into the
operating system we showed this on the
first video from the home screen you can
search using your voice but you can also
skip the keyboard and press this little
microphone button so let's give it a
test hello this is a test of the voice
recognition on the Google Nexus One
period hello this is a test of the voice
recognition on the Google Nexus One
period works perfectly let's try it one
more time
this
moment it this time I want to talk for a
long time the Google Nexus one features
a Qualcomm one gigahertz processor and
it was released in January ok
almost perfect quite nice not to have to
type every time you want to send a
message and as you can see it works in
pretty long stretches without having to
stop and let it recognize and then
having to record again a very nice
feature of the Google Nexus One indeed
ok and we're back and I downloaded a few
of these programs like Fandango and
gallery as you saw give the Amazon mp3
store which is always nice to have we've
the music application I haven't put any
multimedia on here yet or at least I
didn't think I did but maybe this is
some stocked soundtracks we can go to
artists and drill down by artists we can
go to albums and of course this all
works very well in landscape too we can
tap on something to get it started and
there are a lot of backgrounds that will
actually synchronize with a particular
with a particular song so let's go
straight to the songs and play it ok and
so we can track so a nice way to listen
to music on your Google Nexus 1 let's
continue down here we've Google Talk
built right in which we're not going to
talk about Google Voice which I haven't
experimented much with obviously it
integrates very low of Google Voice does
Google Voice can provide the voice mail
service for your phone replacing with
the service you get from your mobile
mobile carrier Google Voice you can play
and view transcripts of your messages on
your phone and computer you can also
vary your voice mail by caller and take
advantage with low-cost international
Congress so pretty cool if you use
Google Voice integrates quite well out
of the box with the Nexus One and of
course there's a link to voice search on
voice dialer you can do a lot with voice
you don't even have to interact with the
device very much if you're trying to do
something quick like talk a text message
or tell the device who to call let's go
into the YouTube application real quick
and let's see some videos and just get a
sense for how the quality is this
it was kind of weak over Wi-Fi so it may
not stream so quickly here I broke my
nexus one let's take a look at that here
it goes
so there's the video it's very smooth
and it came through pretty quickly too
so we'll go back here and that's the
YouTube application and it works in
landscape just like most other screens
though oddly the home screen does not
work in landscape you can't really get
it to jump and so that was a look at the
built-in applications on the Google
Nexus One a lot of really good offerings
here and and something I actually want
to mention real quick because I didn't
cover this in the previous video where
we talked about the home screens is that
you can jump from screen to screen on
the home screen by tapping and holding
on this button here or on that button
you get a little card view here so this
kind of solves the problem of having
five home screens and not being able to
get all the way to the right without you
know swiping your finger a million times
this way you can just tap and hold and
jump from home screen to home screen so
pretty cool a pretty cool feature that
that is new to Android 2.1 so hope you
enjoyed the look at the applications on
the Google Nexus One coming up soon
we're going to go through all of the
settings that can be found on the Google
Nexus One there are a lot of things that
you can change in this device that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
