include a waterproof chassis the Galaxy
s7 hints claimed that we might see the
return of expandable storage and this
might be the right time to get yourself
a new Nexus smartphone or tablet I'm
high Meadow Nevada and you believe I was
just called racist on the recap because
I hate mondays this is Park it out daily
the official news today begin with HTC
or should I say cyber deals as a Black
Friday and Cyber Monday are the thing
and the company has just started
announcing its feel starting with a 240
dollar price tag for the google nexus 9
which is a great price tag for a tablet
but in addition to that you also get the
option for the one m9 for as little as
three hundred 90 bucks now there are a
lot of cool options out there and will
actually have two separate videos on
that very soon but so far the steel is
actually rather nice and speaking of
Nexus devices we know that a lot of you
went crazy over the google nexus 6p and
so did we we actually love that in our
review and even though a lot of you were
struggling to get the phone because they
ran out of stock really quickly seems
that the company has just figured it out
at least for europe and there are rumors
that they're also figuring out within
the next few days for the United States
and it makes sense again with black
friday and cyber monday so stay tuned
for that I do know that some of you are
in the market for the new Lumias and
right now you can only get the Lumia 950
but for those of you interested in
getting it at a microsoft store that
apparently is going to have it on
november 26 so stay tuned for that but
if you want to get windows 10 mobile on
other devices that are not Lumias it
seems that that show me me for is
actually going to get its own build of
windows 10 mobile in the next few days
probably a week or so but the rumors are
rather strongly to the scripture for
full details as yeah this is probably
another option even though well the rest
of the older Lumia should be getting it
as well and yes the iphone 7 rumors
continue particularly with its build
we've got analysts already predicting
that since the iphone success was proven
to be to a certain degree waterproof
paneling the iphone 7 will use this
that's one of its major selling points
apparently it is going waterproof in a
full deal when it comes to its chassis
design but in addition to that
apparently
will be variances with a plus variant
this time as Apple will apparently stick
the two gigs of RAM for the iphone 7 and
then the iphone 7 plus is apparently
going to have three gigs of ram with
some added extra features that we should
be reporting on as we learn about more
rumors and finally the very hot news
today have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
s7 we are expecting this lineup a phone
to happen early next year and number one
well we hear that expandable storage is
making a comeback finally apparently the
company got the memo that yeah even
though their phones were cool the design
was cool people didn't really like the
battery life nor the lack of expandable
storage yet in addition to that it seems
that the edge variant is actually going
to be curvier not exactly sure how curvy
or what they mean with that we're not
sure if it's going to be flexible as for
the rumors that we talked about earlier
but it leads me to the question of the
day what expandable storage be important
to you on the Galaxy s7 or did it pull
you away from the galaxy s6 in my case
I'll be honest it's the reason I stayed
away from the galaxy s6 but surely I
would love the Galaxy s7 with expandable
storage I am struggling with the note 5
because of that but leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know what you
think friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the news
