launching budget-friendly iPhones as
soon as this year we get more
interesting color options for the huawei
p20 in addition to renders ahead of its
release and the LGB 30s gets a release
date along with its prices in certain
markets I'm hey Matt Rivera and I know
the face after a whole night of not
sleeping get in that s9 plus review
which I would love it if you would watch
it's time for the news this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
product launches and insane price tags I
mean we still don't understand the
purpose for the LGB 30s Plus think you
but and I got the name right but if
you're wondering exactly what it'll
launch to set your calendars for March
9th pretty much tomorrow most
interesting the price tags in certain
markets 975 bucks for the entry-level
128 gigabyte variant 1024 the 256
gigabyte model I know I don't even know
what to say about that let us know in
the comments let us know what you think
now let's talk about Sony and the
companies and launch of the xperia x z2
compact and the regular XZ 2 these
products already begun pre-orders and
certain markets in Europe and the the
launch will happen in April kind of far
but hey price tags 599 euro for the
compact $7.99 for the XZ and this is
ahead of whenever we get a premium
variant which should come later this
year I don't know if I should call these
overpriced
I do believe smartphones in general or
just going crazy with the prices but
yeah if you're looking for Sony and you
want to you know go chubby then here
goes
now let's talk about the vivo apex
that's my phone that we really couldn't
find that MWC that's all displayed 91%
screen to body ratio and in addition to
figuring that out it has the selfie
camera that you can tuck in and tuck out
if you thought that this was a prototype
just as we did it turns out that but the
company is already working on you know
starting to manufacture the product
apparently production will be
soon and we should expect the launch
later this year the question is would
you be willing to buy this phone and I
wonder if it's going to reach other
markets that are not China as well now
let's talk about Huawei we are a couple
of weeks away from the company's a
launch of the Huawei P 20 P 20 light P
20 Pro Evan blasts obviously always
helps us with some great leaks we want
to see color options and design it seems
that we're going for blue a lighter tone
of blue and black the design looks
gorgeous from the back from the front
obviously it looks like another phone I
just feel that this design actually
looks better than that other phone that
I'm not even gonna mention yeah I like
the color options let's see what the
price tag says and finally the very
interesting news today I have to do with
Apple and some trusted sources that are
claiming that the company is working
hard on dropping the price tag of new
products to come bear in mind Apple has
never been famous for expensive devices
but then again I think that this launch
of the iPhone tended a crazy thousand
dollars which proved to Apple that
people won't necessarily pay everything
for their brand the source claims that
we're gonna get a budget-friendly iPhone
which I assumed to be the iPhone se 2
but it seems that company is also
working on a lineup
we know that the iPad iPad just the
regular iPad is affordable but
apparently the company wants to go even
more affordable but we also hear of a
more affordable MacBook in addition to a
refresh of the home pod
that doesn't kill the price tag I think
this is great I feel that Apple's
numbers are good but the company is
acknowledging that the market in the
economy is not getting any better over
time so and today's question let us know
would you change your mind let's just
say you're an Apple hater you don't like
their products when you consider buying
Apple products if they were more
affordable because in my case it all
depends I mean if Apple is going to drop
the prices on everything sure but if
it's just going to launch a watered-down
product line and then have its expensive
product line on the side being these the
aspirational ones not necessarily but
that's my opinion let us know yours in
the comments
