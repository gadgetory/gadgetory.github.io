pocketnow.com i just received the m WG
zinc two windows mobile professional 6.1
device to review it was created by the
mobile wireless group in singapore
makers of the atom in ubiquitous series
of windows mobile smartphone the zinc
two sports a speedy samsung 500
megahertz processor quad band gsm for
world action tribe and 3g HSPA which
supports the 850 nineteen hundred and
twenty one hundred megahertz band which
means unfortunately it will only work
with AT&amp;amp;T in the US 256 megabytes of rom
64 megabytes of ram a 2.8 qvg a
touchscreen a 2 megapixel camera Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and a surf star three GPS
which I can't wait to try out let's take
a look at what is inside this
well-constructed box will pull the unit
out first and put it aside so we can
take a look at the accessories that are
included in this compartment we have a
what looks to be a power adapter with
world plugs looks like New Zealand
Australia us plug UK and continental
Europe and then we have the 110 240
power supply with a mini USB connector
in this box we have the stylus battery
headset and mini USB cable let's open it
up we find the standard USB to mini-usb
cable a lithium polymer battery which is
rated at three point seven volts 1503
milli amps which is a pretty good size
we have a run-of-the-mill dime-store
headset which has a mini USB plug on the
end of it and we have the spare stylus
the next box contains documentation and
software we have a software CD without
look 2002 and activesync 4.5 it's too
bad the outlook is two versions back
from the current one in a manual with
warranty information let's take a look
at the unit itself we'll pull it out of
the bag and peel off the protective
cover this is a 2.8 inch qvga screen
with a d-pad call and n buttons on the
front the unit feels solid and is made
of high quality plastic the keyboard
slides out to the left it's quite
interesting because it has no raised
keys it's a membrane type keyboard with
raised edges to delineate the keys it'll
be quite interesting to see how well
that works let's look at the comparative
size with some other devices first up
the iphone it has obviously a smaller
screen than the iphone and with the
keyboard it is definitely thicker than
the iphone it's about the same size as
the HTC kaiser AT&amp;amp;T tilt maybe a little
thinner but overall I would say it's
equivalent equivalent size
now with the samsung i760 it's clearly a
thinner than the samsung and a little
shorter I'll now put in the battery to
charge the zinc to overnight so I can
check this baby out for this video
