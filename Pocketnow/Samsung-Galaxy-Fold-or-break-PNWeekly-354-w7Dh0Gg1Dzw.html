slash now hello everybody and welcome to
the weekly brought to you by pocket now
and xda-developers on this day thee I
never have it written down 19th of April
2019 we are back in our studios yes
we're still using hangouts even though
last week I swore it off but you know
what I'm still learning how to get this
whole live streaming thing going so we
were able to make Hangouts work today as
you will see with our two guests our
fellow hosts first off I do want to
introduce you all know him and love him
Jaime Rivera how's it going I'm a with a
lovely cock so I apologize if I may at
the microphone just out of the blue
that's me okay okay as I mentioned a
little bit right before the podcast
started so for anyone watching the
YouTube version I did tease a little bit
for our live viewers that one of us in
this group has the device in question
and that would behind me so I mean is
very unfolding up there you go that
looked that looked like a chore no so I
love geralyn's video where she just kept
doing this on the microphone no good oh
and there we go we went ahead and
introduced sure Lynn why don't you go
ahead and introduce yourself to our
viewers this is your first time on the
pocket our weekly by the way very first
time on this podcast with you guys that
is awesome
I can't believe oh thank you guys well
we're so happy to have you on
sure Lynn is one of the prominent
figures over ads and gadget and has had
some time with the galaxy
yeah I mean that's how I view you I mean
all your you you're not only one of my
favorite people but also like you and
Chris Velasco you're like my like I
whenever I come to New York what do we
do it's always a dream us even thing
that's really only really recently I
this is just so off topic but I just
want to clear that there that don't you
do you fall do you know what golden duck
is trilling no okay the salted egg chips
and fish skin snack
yeah dude dude Ervin's is better I have
anyway we will have we will have that
mmm
there was too much enthusiasm on that
Josh get on a plane I want to bring it
over but this is the reason I wanted to
bring it up surely tonight whenever I
come to New York it's either me her and
Chris Velasco or the three of us we
always eat at this place called mala
hotpot which is like dry hotpot right
this company that makes these snacks
they made a version of it that is mala
hotpot flavored oh my god there you go
you're bringing it I have to go we have
to go to Singapore that's where they're
based ok I'm going back home I'm going
back home soon I'll break in the it's in
the Changi Airport so they have we
should all we should all go to Singapore
actually by the way fun fact that's
where Josh and I met yet of all places
we ended up meeting in Singapore strange
I'm from Singapore I'm going back soon
after Computex are you guys going to
Computex I'm doing my best to get there
I'm trying so hard yeah saying I don't
want to but I have to compute X is one
of the ones that it's one of the few
ones I actually want to go to so bad
though I've never been and I and I
really want to go I just I just looked
at my travel schedule and it's scary
no no you're threatening me in some of
those trips Josh so that's there is a
there is a crazy amount of stuff
happening even just in a couple of days
or already going to be on planes this
upcoming wait a second winner what are
you flying out Josh Monday in the oh my
god okay flying on Monday on the
afternoon that's the reason why I had to
go get my passport renewed and I have to
go pick it up right after the show which
means LA traffic because I live on the
very other side of where
the passport control places on the west
side of course color yeah it's it's not
gonna be a fun day in any case this part
will be fun because we're actually going
to talk about the Samsung Galaxy fold
here on this podcast but before we get
to that there was other news this week I
get that the Samsung Galaxy fold and the
gun I want to call it the galaxy break
but now here's the reason why like we're
gonna get to in a little bit but of the
three people that are here I have had no
time with the phone and sound it's not a
bad thing it just happens Samsung had a
very a very tightening group of people
actually get their hands on these
devices and in most cases would be able
to come away with them I was not part of
that group but the other two people here
on the cast were either privy to it you
know they have it and I'm his case or in
your case role and you're just not
reviewing it right I have it I had to
give it hand it off to Chris Velasco
because he's reviewing it for us I did
give him a huge warning to be like do
not break this phone because it's not a
Sony protector it's well yeah do not
screw this phone up because like they're
really they're really really precious
about their to review units this time
even more so than usual well I mean it's
a very expensive piece of kit right so
that's that's that's very that's very uh
very understandable that you have to be
very careful with them but before we get
into that I just want to be sure like
not all the time do we get to have like
really good feel-good stories and in
tech and I feel like we've got one or
two this past week one of them might
even know about and so we got into the
call but apparently apple and qualcomm
finally squash their beef wavering there
are there are going to be a few other
details when it comes to this but the
main takeaway here is that a blown
Qualcomm have dropped lawsuits that they
had pending between one another which
opens up a whole lot of speculation and
I wanted to get you guys's thought on
this qualcomm obviously the the bearer
of 5g we hear about it all the time I
mean I have been to so many different
events by now where we just hear 5 g 5 g
5g obviously apple with their iphone one
of the most prolific smartphones in the
market today
Qualcomm 5g modems making it into
iPhones doesn't that mean that 5g
finally got a huge push that it was
needing
I mean yeah so um so where do you guys
this takes on this and also Jaime you
brought up that there was another
feel-good story that yeah Amazon have
started to sort of Cohen coalesce I
guess is the term I'm looking for yeah
yeah but Charlaine please ladies first
haha I'll start with Apple versus
Qualcomm I think that you know our take
on it is that they kind of hats you
because Intel was like well we're gonna
give up making 5g modems for smartphones
so sorry guys and Apple was dependent on
Intel and so when that was announced
Apple had to like give into Qualcomm's
once but did you notice the timing so
first it was the press release from
Qualcomm and Apple saying we're gonna
get along then it's a second press
release that says Apple is going to
invest I don't know how much money in
Qualcomm chips and then 30 seconds later
probably a minute
there's the Intel announcement that
they're exiting the 5g mobile space I
didn't realize that was the order I
thought it was until first and then
Apple and Qualcomm okay so so then
that's nice so Apple wasn't actually
backed into a corner and then had to
give in because that was my take on this
story okay I guess that's nice set for
Intel sorry guys but you know nice it
for 5g like like Josh you're saying it
will make it mean a lot more to the much
more mainstream audio that's for sure I
know and in my case it's it's not that
we have a soft spot for Qualcomm or
anything it's just ever since the iPhone
7 I've realized just how bad until
modems are period like the iPhone 7 for
me was the worst iPhone ever from a
connectivity standpoint had so many
issues and so iPhone 7 happened and then
an iPhone 8 there was a disparity of
which one had which one didn't and then
they made the full move into Intel
modems oh my god like the iPhone 10 was
trashed when it came to data speeds
compared to anything that was Qualcomm
and so in the end as a consumer I don't
really care where the chip comes from I
just have you tell me that that thing
has LTE I want it to actually give me LT
oh yeah absolutely I also think you know
and on the on the topic of Intel versus
Qualcomm
obviously qualcomm has such a huge
foothold in the smartphone market and
even even beyond that there's trying to
get in with the always connected pcs for
example but Intel like every time I
think about this dichotomy between a
call coming in so I keep thinking Intel
shouldn't you be better at this like
shit
shouldn't you be better making these
chips like it's it's it you have I'm
using a PC right now that has some of
the best like specs inside of it and
that's because of Intel why is it so
hard for them to like shrink it down and
actually like make that like adapt it to
a smartphone yeah but think about think
about just how behind Intel is right now
there's still a 14 nanometer process for
their processors whereas right now a
TSMC just announced the six nanometer
for the chips of 2020 like ARM chips are
significantly beyond and obviously you
know I do understand that RISC
processors are more powerful in
yadda-yadda-yadda
but it's just how behind Intel is and
this is just proof they're modems were
inferior their processors are not
inferior but they're staggering behind
when it comes to efficiency in so many
ways and you know I wouldn't be
surprised like apparently there are
rumors of so many changes coming to iOS
focused on iPads I wouldn't be surprised
that even Apple would consider just
moving certain things from the Mac
ecosystem to arm just because of how
slow Intel's being which is the same
story that happened with power pcs back
in the day and Apple moving to Intel now
okay I'm good
any thoughts on that sure than any hot
takes on the Intel I mean I just feel
like Qualcomm has to lead a little bit
because but by the nature of the devices
they're powering they were smaller they
were you know they had smaller batteries
it was always a PC phone divided from
from what I understand and so they had
to become smaller they had to innovate
they had to you know crack down on power
efficiencies and stuff like that whereas
in Telus really resting on his laurels
and really focusing on delivering more
performance over other important things
and connectivity was never really one of
their priorities it didn't seem like to
me so I'm not surprised I agree with
what you're saying in terms of
evaluation but I'm not surprised that
they kind of like got really lazy about
like advancing on those fronts I really
wish that we could get a phone that how
cool it
like pick up a phone and say yeah this
has a coffee lake or a whiskey lake like
back when Intel Atom tripower phones was
bounced god I can't even know that's not
even go there Josh like you know what
told me everything I need to know about
Intel back when they were like really
trying to get into the smartphone biz
was that their main their main partner
for smartphones was HP that's right I
just looking at that remember I remember
way back in the day looking at an HP
phone and I just thought this is not
going to last this is just not gonna
last so there was another story that you
brought up after I was talking about
Apple and Qualcomm before apparently
Google and Amazon I didn't know about
this I need someone to kind of fill me
in on this whole Google Amazon thing no
this was just announced this was just
announced this morning the fact early
yesterday yesterday afternoon I reported
on the daily that now you know the past
there was this whole thing where if he
had an an Amazon fire stick or anything
you could not cast to it or Google
services like YouTube would not work on
them this this is a restriction that
exists that's that's existed for a while
I just I don't know I don't know who
started it I don't know if it's Google
that wasn't allowing Amazon stuff or
Amazon not allowing Google but they you
know both services wouldn't work like
Prime TV or prime video would not work
on Google cast so he had this and you
wanted to cast it on your TV through
chromecast you couldn't so now they
decided to start getting along and we
you have to wait for a software update
it's not immediate but eventually these
services will be able to work together
now oh okay that's cool yeah this makes
me super happy super happy because I
love I would love to watch more prime
video by can't cast it to my chromecast
I have an amazon firetv stick that I
refuse to use because it won't cause my
chrome tabs so this is great okay good
yeah I have a little bit of integration
between them like how much do you
actually use all of the Amazon stuff
though like Prime gets you a lot and I
feel like a lot of people sleep on it
like music prime video yeah but it's
just it's it's just I don't know I I
feel that the cool thing is companies
are now we're in a convergence right now
we're net
flix has their own original content
Amazon has their own original content so
it's no longer a competition of
streaming services but it's a Content
competition between these companies
these companies are becoming pretty much
like studios now if not more than that
and so you know you know Google can't
just be like oh your stuff can't be
streamed on on my content you know
people will simply choose not to buy
their hardware it's not like if it were
crazy expensive or like if you're crazy
locked in because of the low price point
that both these companies have so the
better thing was to just get along yeah
fair enough
I think that's kind of that should be
the takeaway for all the companies in
tech these day just get along guys
what's what's the problem unless you're
buying a two thousand dollar galaxy fold
and that is exactly what are you getting
into I don't have an I don't have a mid
role a mid ad for this particular
episode but I do want to take a small
break between our topics I do have a
recurring segment here I mean we know
what your answer is to this question but
you can always answer differently once I
get to you sure Lin you can pick
whatever you want to answer this
question it's something that I spring on
everybody it doesn't even have to
necessarily be what I'm about to say but
what is in your pocket now pick a daily
thing a daily thing that you have okay
doesn't really actually have to be in my
pocket right now all right
it does not okay good cuz nevermind um I
don't usually have pockets so let's just
say purse what's in my purse
one item you said yeah any one thing you
want to share that like you use on the
daily it could be anything it could even
be a notebook I said that early I said
that last week and Jaime I was like you
okay yeah why not
um at the risk of showing anything too
private here let's see yeah hey I have
my reporters notebook um which I use for
I just find it easier something I always
have to just lip balm because I have
chapped lips I'm trying to think of
something like unique um god it's always
just like five phones chilling out in my
purse which one which one would you why
would you like to highlight last week
Jaime will highlight at the p30 Pro for
makes total sense I would have
highlighted the p30 Pro I am going I
think highlight that I still can't leave
behind my pixel three is weird yeah I
say you know I have the Galaxy S 10 in
my purse as well but I find myself going
to that so much less than I go to the
pixel three it's just a it just a
stunning photo so I can't help it okay I
really wanted to live the pixel 300 yeah
that's there's a question try the long
launch the camera app it's just it's
undeniably slow which it's not supposed
to be I mean if it were $200 phone fine
you've got the poco phone which you know
it's just one of those things where it's
like you know the poco phone and oneplus
make companies be like eh come on man
come on this like that that's that
seriously it sets the bar oh and by the
way again live chat make sure you get
into our Chad get some questions ready
for for the fold and for all of that but
also I noticed that in the last couple
of weeks no one's really been asking
about these suppose it like speaking of
the pixel the pixel 3 a apparently is
supposed to be a thing and the reason
we're not talking about on the show yet
is because nothing is actually fully
confirmed like everything is either a
leak or a mistake by Google it's
basically confirmed but we don't want to
get anyone in so it's actually like a
thing like an absolute thing that we can
that we can hold but in that case hi Mae
I'm gonna ask everyone every single week
if there's something that you want to
give us what is in your pocket now
you're gonna laugh at the disparity of
the two products that I'm carrying first
one obviously the Galaxy fold because
you know yeah it comes with its it comes
with a Kevlar case and this thing is
slurry AF AF I wish I can even say the
whole world with words so use the case
snap it on I have no idea how much it'll
cost to repair any of these screens
because there are a few so I decided to
put on the case it just it keeps falling
or slipping or whatever like the other
day I was recording the daily and
there's actually a bluebird
where I had to you know the the idea the
daily was that I was gonna show it off I
haven't broken it yada yada yada in the
moment that I record that segment I
could just hear a thunk on the floor and
it was the hall
at least it didn't I'll talk about that
later actually when it comes my turn
okay that's and then the second thing
believe it or not air pods
oh okay why don't you tell why don't you
tell our viewers and listeners the
little hack that you asked me about uh I
have been so reluctant to grab air pods
because they fall off my ear
and so Josh yeah I've seen the silicone
you know the wings that you can buy and
so I had bought them for ear pods a
while ago and then Josh showed me that
there was a ver version for air pods and
so I reached out to him I'm like alright
dude I have to do a video on air pod so
I have to go pick him up what's what are
the wings that you were using and so he
sent me a link but within I found this
option where it's you can barely see
this you just can't but it's a small
little silicon tip and it actually fits
in the case and you can close it that
way you have like a textured material so
it ya hold a little bit better it's and
it's what hold on let me look for the
box here we go it's a box full of them
for eight bucks on Amazon okay that's
cool are they different sizes oh yeah no
they're the same size only some of them
you've got four pairs with wings four
pairs for that wings and you choose what
you want so if you want to go to the gym
you're not gonna put them in the case
then you can use the one with wings and
go to the gym yeah oh yeah there yeah so
different scenarios right awesome air
pod still they still strike me as like
the most convenient Bluetooth earbuds so
so here so here's the thing because
because Apple had to like dynamically
boost the audio on those things just
because of how bad they fit they sound
well without the tips but once you put
the tips on I have to be lowering the
volume on these things fair enough you
know because you have a snug fit now
they actually sound even better even
better yeah
true yeah okay cool so in my case I do
have a I do have a bit of a story I was
I was working with I was working with an
honour device I am working on a video
for the view 20 and it's nice to visit
the view 20 again and I everybody try to
try not to forget about this phone
because it is still the only phone that
not only has the Sony IMX forty eight
megapixel sensor but it's also the only
one that tries to do some extra stuff
with it so that AI ultra clarity mode
see there it is Jaime has it that's the
most Chino red Moschino most Chino I
have no idea it is still a nice device
to use and it's beautiful phone it's a
yeah it looks beautiful and I didn't
even focus on the design in the video
which will be coming out hopefully
either today or tomorrow but what the
reason why I'm delayed on it is because
I was at LACMA if anyone out there who
knows about la the lacrima lights it's
all those lights that are in front of
the museum it's very instagram-worthy
and like influencers are always there so
I was among good company there I was
taking pictures with it and there was a
bag that was strapped to my chest it it
undid itself somehow like it just uh it
started falling off my chest and I felt
him even though I grabbed the bag as it
was falling it it knocked the honor out
of my hand and it broke the screen so
it's been a long time since I've done a
drop test that was not how I wanted to
come back so I was really upset not only
because I late traffic like makes me
rage but yeah that was I was pretty
bummed out about that but shouts out to
a homie TKB thank you for letting me
borrow yours I had to drive all the way
out to the homie de to get the phone
from him so that was what was in my
pocket until it fell out broke in your
pocket then because my plug in the floor
now the other thing I kind of want to
highlight is this is not this doesn't
fit in my pocket it has nothing to do
with my pocket I just wanted to put
putting this out you guys ever tried
mber the this is the Ember ceramic self
heating mug ooh
link link yeah I all send it to you it's
not it's not it's not the greatest thing
but basically if you have like hot tea
as you all know I
all the time this keeps it at a
temperature that you set on your
smartphone so in this case I'll set to
140 so it'll never go below 140 dude
send me a link because I'm a prom I like
to take my time with my coffee there you
go about me too actually I always have
to drink tea that ends up going cold so
hang on what what do you mean by selfie
do you mean it's like battery powered
yes there's a battery charging
that's right I'm sorry what is that it's
all heating that's not like weird type
that's just like battery-powered
warm yeah okay that's true yeah so
feeding is a little bit it's a misnomer
well yeah there's like an entire thing
here the light obviously shows when the
light is solid that means it is at the
temperature that you said that
and yeah so T right here I've been able
to use this I actually smart up my
teacup can you believe that am I gonna
say that's I got a that's gonna be the
punchline whenever I cuz this has been
out for a little while but I finally
came into one Marie if you're watching
this thank you so much for sending it to
me I'm still waiting for a link I made
the patient
I gotta make that up so make that
affiliate link give me a give me a give
me a little bit I'm gonna delete your
like affiliate coat from the end of it
and then just go oh that's Savage oh
okay so by the way I kind of want to
know how to do that because sometimes
when I watch youtube videos and oh no no
that's too savage I should be support
your creators everybody a penny man
exactly support them yeah in any case
what we're gonna go ahead and get out of
that recurring segment and get into the
galaxy fold okay so I do I don't know
how to sort of tackle this Jaime you're
the one who has it in hand but I
actually want to hear a rundown of this
phone from sure lip so let's start off
with that what was your experience with
it and I guess my main question for you
is now that you don't have it on you
anymore I missed some showing it off for
sure I think that this is a device that
you know break us a mold that the
industry has been stuck in for a little
bit so that part of it I think is
fascinating I I'm trying to start a
challenge and maybe you guys on this
stream can help me let's do
hashtag one hand Galaxy fold so like you
use one hand and try to close the thing
and open it I may have you can try to
try to do it on your own now it's not
it's not easy at the start yeah there
you go oh look at that you have to hook
your thumb right yeah hook your thumb
and then bring it over you can however
you do it it's not easy when you first
get the phone it's rigid the hinge is
rigid at the start but then after some
time having unfolded and folded the
phone it loosens up or becomes a little
I guess more pliant and and it gets
easier to do the reason I think this is
interesting is because like you know
four people commute a lot the one-handed
like being able to use this phone
one-handed is important and you can't in
that widescreen really use it with the
one hand but then the that 4.6 inch
screen on the front when you close the
phone to me it's just not great right
yeah I really do not like it I don't
think it's meant for you to use for a
long period of time it's so much smaller
than I'm used to nowadays the resolution
is low it's kind of like slightly above
720p is like 8:40 by 11 something in the
53 I think and the text becomes so small
I was trying to use it to take photos
with and I just could not switch lenses
because the icons are so small so I had
to do the the pinch zoom which is fine
you can work around that I just don't
like I don't like that and I I think a
lot of people that have talked to you
who have the phone agree with me that
this 4.6 inch screen is one of the
biggest drawbacks of the galaxy fold so
far the kree's is like okay sure there's
a crease we can live with it but that
that small screen might be an even
bigger problem but I don't know Jaime
what do you think hold on a bomb that's
trying to join sometime giving
instructions I'm because of E is gonna
come in I'm worried that I won't hear
them so if I can't hear them I don't
know why hangout hates me like let me
just put that out quick a quick question
- sure and while we're all Jaime's
working with a over there
so I'm trying to remember who was asking
me this question
if I can't remember and you're watching
I'm so
it's one of our tech friends - which is
the primary screen in your usage like is
the iStent is the outside screen your
primary and then you open it up
sometimes or is it the other way around
no it should be the big screen that is
the primary but that's that's a whole
conundrum right is that there's not
really a screen that's meant for you to
use all the time and that is the problem
to me and I don't know I think I may was
trying to answer - so I think I think
dieter bone for those of you that
haven't watched the the review from the
verge I highly recommend that I love
Deiters videos and in his review he's
like you know I love the idea of having
the secondary display because I find
myself using my phone less because it's
become so cumbersome to you know to
interact with that outer display I don't
end up in Instagram when I don't have to
if I'm commuting if I'm going from point
A to point B I just use it for quick
responses quick it's he's like this is
like my over claw read notification
screen that's what he called it and he
is go for it so like the palm phone like
the palm sidekick lamb exactly it's
literally like that and so listen I I
hate the outer display but I also have
to agree with his assessment because I
have found myself doing that I have
found myself just quick response it's
something practical a quick map to go
from point A to point B but then when
I'm on the train and I actually have
time to use the product I have this like
huge display and so that is what makes
it really cool to me that's a - to
actually can you have tomorrow you have
to make the decision because yeah like
typing on such a large display is not
necessarily easy and so it's it's not
necessarily the most convenient device
to use because it's literally like
trying to thumb type on your tablet and
even if you tried it on an iPad Mini
it's not easy and then you have the
problem then oh so you're gonna feel
right at home Josh because the screen
since the screen is a 4 by 3 it uses the
aspect ratio of like if you're using a
blackberry key - and so like if you're
on Instagram if you're on it's the
ground
for example not all Instagram controls
work does everyone hear that light shade
that was in his way you deserve it
though this is gonna be great
Michael Fisher yeah no so so the four by
three aspect ratio is not necessarily
the most ideal for certain things like
Instagram even Instagram stories if you
watch they haven't Cogan's recent
stories they appear cropped up because
he's using the fold for them and so they
haven't done a lot of story to it they
crop in in between different that's
right ratios nowadays it's weird it's an
Instagram story bug well not a bug but
like they have a thought how to fix it
not fully because when you take a
picture it's always at a certain aspect
ratio but then you have to crop it like
well yeah like you have to take your
original photo then crop it to 9 by 16
or our stories yeah or 9 by 18 once you
crop it you're you're you're actually
giving Instagram stories this is so
beside the point I just want put this
out there you put you you put it you
give it to Instagram stories and it
already has a cropped photo so it
doesn't have to crop it more so like
that way you also get more that way you
also get more detail out of it I don't
know one from Sam Scheffer shout out to
you Sam anyway um ya know the so I think
that if anybody is gonna be coming in
I'm gonna be asking him about the gaming
experience did you two do any gaming on
the phone cuz I'm not really big screen
that's when everyone goes to first is
media and content and gaming not so
absolutely
maybe media consumption how did you guys
feel about it sherilyn
I mean I did not Netflix but I did look
at like the end got the website watch
out some of our YouTube videos it's nice
when you like get in zoom in a little
bit on the screen or you know you have
that much more room to look at it's
great for reading your like ebooks and
whatever but it's you know the the thing
about the kree's and I think I'm a maybe
you agree with me is that it's so easy
to ignore it right but then if you're
like a perfectionist who is like I paid
$2,000 for this thing man why is there
at creig's you know then it's like gonna
bug you
make your like favorite storybooks even
oh I hate you hangouts okay so you two
are gonna have to like anchor the whole
way you can't hear any bond I can't hear
anybody now hates me are you not allowed
back in it wouldn't know because I'm
hosting them no no you can you can die
out and drive back in no it would have
to be it would have to be in a bond who
would have to leave and come back work I
don't know I don't think he'll be I
don't think it will fix this problem
because it's crying bye guys is the prob
I but guys once you guys continue
talking
if come back Wow alright alright so let
me let me um see here's the thing my
favorite form factor for a tablet of the
iPad Mini I have wanted to have an iPad
Mini with an Apple pencil for the
longest time but I just wish it weren't
the Chum that they just launched right
now but I really love the iPad Mini and
so this is literally almost the size of
an iPad Mini
it's nearly there this is 7.3 the iPad
Mini is 7.9 surely you've got weird
bezel you've got this like weird
I'm trying any buddy understand what
else is in there for that huge knotch to
be there they did say and I forget now
but they did say something like
proximity sensors and that sort of stuff
our own unfolded for a call so there is
no speaker here by the way so you have
to close if you get a phone call you
have to close it to take the call oh man
ok you have to close it to take the call
there's no other way there's just so
much that's up with this thing that is
imperfect it's a first gen product oh
hey you're back can you give me a sec I
cannot but I'm gonna do a couple of
things stay stick around keep talking
though okay I will say though that I am
actually more excited for the huawei
mate X because I know that if false
outwards and people are like that's
gonna be destroyed in a second but
I still feel like they make that primary
screen on the outside work more like
that
method just works better okay the thing
about it is the you you held the main
extra land you know that if you close
that that thing is a little thicker than
the galaxy note 9 yes
it's very thin actually it's very thin
and if you extend that it's like a
kindle oasis so for me from a design
standpoint I feel that Huawei did it
better yeah you know it's not the most
durable solution now but then you know
right now you've got to protect the
screen that's breaking on certain people
so I don't know what's worse may I try
made first for a second there I forget
your common things I want to state first
of all why the fuck does the verge have
a review today I don't think I mean
there's a lot of things in this industry
that pissed me off this week I get it
the fold has some issues but I also get
it some people peel things off where
there was miscommunication from Samsung
or not either way that can be solved
that's solvable some some people had
defected displays okay how many 200
units distributed yeah so two defective
okay that's not bad but the verge
dropped of you review today and I felt
very I felt very offended
I'm not media I'm not more press I'm an
influencer I'll put it that way but I
felt was very disingenuous because you
had a bald you had replacement device
and you spent two days and give me a
review I don't know how much time
necessarily that they've had with the
fold I will say that overriding gadget
we also just decided we would take our
time to spend more time with it and our
review is not going to be up until you
know we are not going to give a
definitive statement on whether you
should buy this phone until we spend
more time with it and it is thanks right
thank you all right sorry sorry to be a
debbie downer coming in I apologize
people but I just wanted people to know
that with most of the vices I mean I
check out all your reviews I check yours
out sure yes even you Sharon Lee I do
check your stuff out as well and I check
your stuff out Jaime of course you know
that but it's it's the most bad time
with the devices you can you can hear
the nuances you know Jaime and I were
having drinks and Jaime it's like did
you know if you did this on the device
it does this I was like oh I didn't know
that that's what happens when you spend
time right the little things whether
it's things that I know you're fake so
that aspect of device of the review
process I just felt very offended
because I'm getting feedback from people
going over the verge said this on my
videos and I'm going well I'm sorry and
I'm gonna calling out the idiots
for dropping the review they don't pay
me and I don't anybody there so I really
don't care by the color minutes be
reviewers I apologize for some reason
Josh is trying to fix whatever issues
yes and somehow the cameras stuck
between cherylin and I and Anna bong is
not visible
no hangouts is actually doing you a
favor you don't have to put up with his
face more directly but yeah for some
reason that's really bad you know yeah
I'm not gonna comment over I I'm gonna
say this guys don't have to you guys
have outlets I'm an influencer I don't
know I know care two shits my job to
make noise it's like certain points the
dealer made in his review the first one
is just the design paradigm how it
changes over he's like you know the
screen on the outside is completely
unusable but it's helped me stop using
my phone and be lured into social media
like Instagram or stuff because it's so
difficult to use this outer screen than
I end up just interacting with it for
the basics and that's a good point that
is a really good point
and you know the I guess the point that
I want to make is and you're gonna
follow follow me on that one II after
our conversation is I've I don't I
didn't think I would love to use this
thing so much I did not I knew I knew
this was a device for me I'm a I'm a
sci-fi geek I've been waiting for
foldables longer than most people even
knew what smartphones were so for me
this having way
for this for the longest time the fact
that I can do that one of the things
that I enjoyed with this device so I
went we went to the briefing we had on
Wednesday
hi may you and I we can't talk about it
but as soon as I walked in there
somebody so much me swinging the galaxy
fold and the way we stopped the fold I'm
like yeah oh yeah everybody went
everywhere I go and they see the fold
everybody knows so I walked into the
Apple store the other day to pick up
these air pods
I had the whole Genius Bar like making a
line like oh can I hold it oh can I see
it like it is cool you cannot deny that
it is cool yeah exactly
no it is and it does have its its
first-gen quirks and it's the first trim
device note no one is saying that you
should go run out and buy if you want to
buy sure I think that's way it is I
think it's a device that for what first
gens used to be this is more polished
than what I'm used to because we all
know how the very first surface was even
the very first iPhone it was the same
way or for Samsung the first Galaxy Note
if you remember that one that was rough
around the edges you know so I think I
think they have something here that yet
they definitely need to do a lot of
polishing on and you know if you're an
adopter you're one of those people who
likes to jump in and experience I think
you will see what the experience is like
you can go to the stores and try it out
see how it is and see how that actually
works for you
I think one of the things that I got
from a lot of people is because of all I
happened this week was people were like
oh that's a Samsung device this is a
display fragile I'm like no it's not
here hold it yeah that would and that's
what that's why I come come nuff annoyed
because we had the storm from influences
and I'm sorry people who didn't touch
the device we never used it
whoo and I'm gonna put it out there and
people hate me who were jealous didn't
have it and wanted to be haters and yeah
look it's just what happened I'm like
okay look once you try it out you can
see it yeah if it has device issues
yes let's let's work through that that's
all Samsung you failed how many times
but we know that it's only two failures
out of 100 and the other five were
people peeling stuff off that Samsung
didn't inform them properly
to be nice so I'm gonna ask you guys a
question
David Cogan made an awesome point in his
recent video over the battery test he's
like this product costs $60 right now
financed $60 you know if you see it as a
monthly thing it doesn't make two
thousand dollars look that bad so if you
know it's $60 you've already like
sherrilyn and you already had the
opportunity to play with it would you go
into an installment plan and face 60
bucks a month for that thing no no I
think that yes it makes you you know
shut off more from from being on
Instagram too much because of the
primary display and when you do want to
you open it up I'd still think that this
is an I like to in a bonus point this is
a first gen device I'm not gonna go in
on the first gen I'm gonna go in maybe
on the third Genet to keep making these
because then it would be much better but
for now I still think that it's so limit
and again this is this is me talking
from my hands-on experience and one day
with the phone right like we are we I
think the review might have a different
more clear stand I just think that it's
not as useful and functional as my
smartphone right now that has just the
one screen I can do enough on it I don't
want to spend more money than I need to
on this sort of a device but hey maybe
there's people who really really want to
I just don't see the average consumer
and maybe the average consumer not the
person that's watching this dream right
now right it's like my mom or my dad or
my cousin that's sort of a person
they're not gonna spend $60 a month on
this come on they're gonna get maybe a
blackberry you know yeah I want to chime
in real quick from the from the from the
producer side I still can't hear and
among which is why I'm being silent over
here I don't want to like mess up the
flow here you guys are doing a great job
talking through this and after all I'm
the only one who hasn't even held a fold
so it's cool
okay um I do have a couple of thoughts
though $60 a month between the gamers me
and an among that is a game a month
we're not going to waste our money on
something like that when we are gamers
and we're gonna pay a game a month but I
will say this I almost tweeted this this
morning the moment I woke up because I
started seeing a lot of people on
Twitter saying like they're frustrated
with tech reviewers and tech pundits and
tech people in general who are saying
stuff like why would you buy this
particular device oh there you go why
would you buy this particular device
it's first gen it's not worth the 2,000
blah blah blah and people are asking me
like how I felt about it especially
since I haven't held it yet let me tell
you this I'm not going to pay a $2,000
for the Galaxy fold not because of what
it is not because it's a form factor or
not because it's a first gen I'm not
gonna pay $2,000 because I'm poor okay
that is let me tell you right now it's
not that I'm skeptical about the form
factor if anything I'm the guy who loves
the new stuff like tech is amazing okay
that's the reason I we're all in this
industry so take the cynicism away from
all of this and just remember that you
know I wish that I got a review unit
even then the review and it probably is
not gonna be mine forever because this
is an expensive piece for Samsung to
give to a lot of people but at the same
time like 2,000 bucks you're asking me I
just paid I when they when the pre-order
was happening I was doing my taxes what
did you expect me to say I think I don't
have the money for that I just don't and
I prefer self-preservation alright so
this right now wait a second so we've
got a TK right now TK thank you for
joining the the light of chat buddy
he's like people pay forty four dollars
for an s10 plus a month see and you know
Kogut and I had this argument when the
iPhone 10 came out over its price but
then if you think about it it was just
six dollars more a month when compared
to the iPhone 8 if you looked at the
installment plans and so right now if
you're told that it's it's literally
what if you're paying 44 what is it 44
bucks come on 16 dollars more and you
get a fold
but the sm+ feels like to me a much
better phone than the phone it's a more
mature product definitely know that
yes I mean I mean it is a better product
I think I think the problem with this
calculation is this I think the biggest
problem we face with the fold is I'm
sorry to say there were too many salty
people at the beginning with the price
thinking that this is justification no
one says you should buy it that's the
first thing but the thing is that we
need this device I'm sorry the future is
foldable the reason why is that
I don't want to carry a tablet and on
the Android side all the tablets are
shitty they downright terrible we know
that so there is no tablet I'm not an
iOS user so there's no tablet option for
me this is the closest thing I have
number two it is more productive when
I'm taking those flights to the west
coast I can do more work I can much work
more video I can gain more I've been
gaming more not because I like mobile
gaming just because I do have the real
estate and I'm like man like I can
actually see everything there in table G
you know like that's why I like it not
saying that I still will buy it it's a
lot of money but I just want people to
know that if you're gonna buy it let's
hope it does well so that Gen 2 comes
and Gen 2 is 1,500 instead of us having
that $1500 Galaxy S 10 which isn't worth
it in my mind and then and then we get
this as the Galaxy Note pro where you
get a regular Galaxy Note and then the
Galaxy Note pro opens up with a pen I'm
all happy for it at like $1500 it's cool
if they need the pen but um and I also
say that I think any bond you're being a
little prophetic here I think that
indeed Samsung's plan must be to market
this as a no Pro at some point because
oh that would that would be like for me
that's what it's missing it's missing it
exactly this is missing an S Pen I
honestly feel like having the s-pen
would make it so much better but I I
want to kind of double back really quick
on what you just sort of started talking
about there Jaime you said you saw Cogan
do a battery test I haven't I don't know
the details of our battery test yet but
what were the results because I was very
skeptical 42 he ended at 1:00 a.m. with
like 14 percent battery life which has
been my case I don't understand what is
special about
fold that the s10 plus does not have but
my battery life on the SN plus is not as
good as on the fold it's got a large
display that's it well it's it is a
thinner display it's a thinner display
it's more passive it's not as bright
doesn't push as much as the s10 plus
display and the other display outside is
720p so mmm you know you're not going to
be draining as much on there now I'm
reading I'm reading the live chat Lauren
who who is it that I can't stand and I
bar nobody can stand this guy it's true
no all right guys if I could chime in
real quick again I'm pleased I'm
basically produced the producer and
mediator right now because you're right
okay so on our live on our actual
YouTube feed you can see in abang but it
doesn't focus on him so that's so now
when e is talking and I see him talking
but I can't hear him I'm clicking on his
face that way you can see oh yeah
so I'm actually I'm playing this weird
game of telephone right now while being
mediator on the digital side so I
actually want to just point one more
topic your guys's way so you guys can
finish this off for our last 10 to 15
minutes obviously we have competitors
obviously there are a lot of people in
the live chat I have been reading your
live chat a lot of people talking about
the made X but also talking about the
way that Xiaomi is making their foldable
so I'm wanting to get some some some
some hot takes from everybody
regarding the competition the Galaxy
fold is the first one to market how do
we feel about the the other devices when
they're going to come out the way that
they handle the fault the way that they
handle this new form factor sherlyn you
held the minute X right I looked at it
up close I didn't get it hold it yet
because they started let me people touch
after I left which was like really
annoying I know what about you touch it
I did not know I'm the only guy that
touched it but I mean even having only
seen that thing and from you know like
that that amount of time I spent in that
closed room with a huawei guy it already
seems like so much better of a phone you
know I mean like it's even though they
sell me one which I'm looking at now
it's it also sort of folds outward
so I don't know that folding in words is
going to edge out the competition over
time see I disagree I think folding in
words is because I unless I don't think
I don't know how you protect that bottom
display without in shattering within
seconds I really don't
yeah which takes out the usability phone
fact like with this even this idea of
the external you know like case room
it's so easy to open up I think the
biggest issue is just the front display
so annoyingly small yeah but but the the
way the idea is this there's this case
that makes it more phone and the cases
as thin as this Kevlar protector and
because that main X is thinner than the
Galaxy fold you really like it's
literally like putting a regular phone
in your pocket and so you use it as a
standard Huawei phone for everything and
then whenever you're on the subway and
you want a full display you pull it out
of the case and you open it so it's just
like a sliding case pretty much it is it
is like a holster case pretty easy yeah
I find that to be genius so the idea is
not for you to unfold it you don't need
to because the outer screen is
completely usable it is literally the
same it's a six point one inch display
and it's a full-blown 18 by 9 aspect
ratio the only thing you don't have is a
selfie camera because that's on the back
because you you flip it around but then
in the back you will be able para
leaders this like little window on the
case and you can see yourself you can
still take a okay so you can see that
yeah okay you know and so I if you asked
me I don't I don't think that there I
don't think like for example you were
complaining about the Verge's review I
could complain about the fact that they
rated the review because how are you
gonna compare this to anything and I
just I don't feel that it's adequate to
rate this against anything I don't think
it's adequate to rate them mate X
against anything because we're in the
experimentation field that made us the
geeks that you know created our channels
or that work in this industry and things
had gone really crazy boring for the
past couple
years and then we get this and I can't
people for being bold and giving it a
try
I can't bash this it's it's I'm sorry
but this is what makes the future is it
the present not necessarily but this is
the future so you know the thing that
the fold reminds me of a device I wanted
so much from Microsoft they never
delivered oh but you're the courier here
yeah the courier is and to me my
suggestion to Samsung is even if you
switch designs because rumor is they
have multiple designs out there and
they're pitching some of that so we may
see different designs come up in the
future but if they keep the full design
you know what even just running with
Windows not try gonna call it a day man
like I would know no I'm serious I am
serious because you still have your 850
processor can go in there or even the AC
X can go in there and if you're going to
do anything funky on Windows then all
like you're just a general messaging
apps in the front here like just
notifications and things like that and
then you're always gonna open it and
have a full-fledged computer done I'm
gonna say that I don't think we're that
far away from affordable laptops and I
think that you're onto something and a
bong and I'd like to point out that in
in the PC space there has been a lot
more innovation right like if you look
at the Lenovo yoga book it's sort of
like a double screen device right Asus
project Precog is supposed to come out
soon which is again a dual screen laptop
but there's a lot of innovation there
but when we talk about competitions for
the Samsung Galaxy phone to your point
Josh that you were trying to steer us
towards there's the sell me one there's
the Huawei one TCL let's not forget
let's not forget TCL says it's working
on a bunch of different ones that is
patented the designs friend they look
interesting it's alright motorola dragon
hinge is amazing
motorola has said it's it's going to be
doing something too so we have a lot to
look forward to in terms of scoring a
review this early in the game definitely
seems seems a little premature to me but
that's not to say we won't be doing it
or just
be careful and take a long time before
we put up a score you know what I find
funny I think it would be hilarious if
because this is the only foldable out
right now just an automatic 10 like what
are we compared to I would just be like
75 that's kind of an easy base to start
building around but but yeah I just want
to say like it's it's has its flaws the
Galaxy fold or it's like all we're
saying is that it's exciting and it's a
portent of great things to come right
yeah yeah and I feel like for example
you try to remind me what were you
asking Josh about the I just wanted a
couple of I wanted to see how you felt
about the competition you didn't you did
definitely like touch upon the maytag's
yeah I I think the main X is this I feel
it that it's a more useful design I feel
but then again there are the durability
like if they tell me that the made X is
gonna cost cost twenty three hundred
bucks but then they give me an unlimited
warranty for a certain period of time
where it's like if I break the screen
they'll just give me a new one and it's
part of the price you're I'm down mmm
I'm totally down and I I feel that
companies like Samsung should consider I
you know I have to admit I love services
like Apple Care Plus I am willing to pay
extra for them because I love just
walking into an Apple store this thing
broke or I spilled coffee on my keyboard
have it give me another one goodbye and
when you have a product that that's this
experimental and you know because you
know my background is engineering moving
parts there are so many moving parts in
this product the opportunities for
failure on this product are significant
and so you know I you know it's funny
that is actually a phrase that Jaime
gave me for life that is actually advice
he gave me the more parts the more
moving parts you have in your life the
more opportunity there is for failure
and there you go he's holding a device
that actually fits in with his life
philosophy know and so we see it as we
see it in laptops how did the modern
laptop came to be they decided to just
come up with the unibody and that and
everything connects to it so there's
less moving parts less screws that's
everything right now this is in the
experimental phase
I wish they didn't price it so high I
again if I'm not gonna justify the price
I'm just figure out some snacks I'm
sorry I disagree let's stop being
foolish the problem here is this we
price regular cellphones way too high
that's it it's a brand new piece of tech
what the hell do you want let's just be
honest some of the facts going on no now
why don't we do it outside okay skip
skip you when this be honest what and
cell phone shouldn't cost a thousand
bucks the iPhone the Galaxy S 10 the
note may be a little bit more expensive
short because you have an S Pen and the
it's because of what you get true yeah
but what college be just a whack pad is
crazy expensive yeah exactly so when you
have something that's foldable and
there's nothing even else to compare it
literally you can price it any way you
want but as we've seen with some of the
tear downs this thing is compact there's
a lot of stuff in there there's many
things that make it expensive yes it
will get cheaper over time so the
argument of price that people say mm
expensive I'm going like what were you
expecting and you turn it all foldable
phone you must be daft I'm sorry I know
I'm sounding very aggressive in this you
have been yes but that's what you're
like a woman a bond the problem in the
bond isn't that I wish I heard that the
problem in a bond is not white so why do
I feel that there's a problem with the
price and I you have a good point that
phones are being overpriced right now
iPhones at the price of a full-blown
computer it's just the question is how
much you pay for what you get why why is
this priced at the same price of a
premium either gaming or powerful
computer see what you do this none of
them no no no no no for that a loan
forget it
for that alone none of them can do this
nobody else when the wire comes no no
they don't
yeah but it's not the same it doesn't
matter where you have to or not it's
what you're offering and they are
offering this
right
okay so right now we're still in a
debate of whether this product is useful
or not I I feel I find that the foreign
factor is growing on me but this is like
the stage where I move from blackberry
keyboard to an iPhone it took me two
weeks to get used to that iPhone
keyboard because I was so used to the
multilingual no need for multilingual
on my hardware keyboard and it took
years for companies to figure out
multilingual on software keyboards and
so for me it was a nightmare to make the
shift so right now this product is
growing on me
but it's you know there are still things
where I'm like crap let me just crap I
didn't bring another phone this is all
I'm carrying so I have to make it work
and so I'm going through that stage
right now so the question is how is a
foldable better it gives you a more
augmented experience but right now that
external screen is the crutch that's
like standing in between this and being
an ideal product and the fact that it's
like tufa own stack together so it
doesn't fit in your pocket it does fit
yeah I'm just saying though like the
ability for me to go in there I can jump
into the jet it's just that it's the
simplicity of functionality and I can
still close it up and jump in and watch
it in the very front screen whenever
that's the same yeah whenever they give
me an S Pen on this thing I have no
arguments against it like right there no
I'm not disagree with you I think this
is my problem is that we are jumping
already a lot of techies are jumping
because they'd like it but they're like
oh why isn't it this I'm like yeah they
could have given you I remember I talked
to somebody at Google once and they said
we can give you Google glass that looks
like your spectacles are you ready to
pay for it simple and that's the thing
is that we're jumping when the the
market isn't there it's not like
everyone can afford it remember you work
in your you have an engineering
background you have that background of
you know of pricing it comes down it
takes people to buy to come down and you
have to introduce at a point so we keep
forgetting that fact because we are
eager to see it be our Star Trek even
Star Trek or have stuff like that but
you know sci-fi show it opens and it
just works
it takes a while look at the surface how
long did it take you took the third one
for everyone to say oh this is what
Microsoft was trying to do and then at
surface pro 4 5 6 you're like ok alright
fine every company is using that form
factor and that ended up being a success
that's it I mean this is something that
um it was terrible you're right this is
something that Juan says all the time it
takes three years for a product to
actually get to realization in market
then another threefold but you become
standard iPhone this example
best-selling iPhone success so people
tend to forget about these things
because we because the cell phone market
is the most mature technology market
there is right now so you expect the
next thing that shows up should be Oh
magic Aladdin it's here well it's the
technology just wasn't there so I think
we just need to be patient and wait for
for competition which we always bring in
Johnny is bringing razor the good thing
is that we're gonna see at least four
foldables this year and by that time for
Samsung themselves they'll go oh ok ok
we need to do something better you know
and we also need to drop price or these
give different ranges guess what product
is shipping to me by the way right now
is it NDA or no it's well they didn't
say it's NDA so I'm just gonna say the
new Bo hey I love the experimentation
man I you know I my email has an nd8 day
and time at the bottom but go for it
[Laughter]
before we get too far with that I'm
gonna go ahead and call it on this ass
[Laughter]
all right I actually you know I've been
watching the YouTube feed and despite
the technical difficulties that I've
been having not being able to hear
thunder over there this has been one of
the most high-quality episodes that
we've had in terms of just like video
they raid and like audio and all that
and so it's awesome I'm more than happy
to take a back seat this is what I'm
supposed to do as a host and figure out
a way to make this look as good as
possible so I hope everybody has been
enjoying the show
I do want to make sure that everyone has
a chance to kind of plug anything that
they're doing right now also it's a plug
their social media and whatnot so in
order to make it a little bit easier on
me I'm gonna start with and along says I
can't hear him and then sure Lynne and
then Jaime and then after that I will
notice it are often too cool
my name is fun de and a bong from bored
at work you can find me a bored at work
on Facebook YouTube Twitter Instagram
and also we have a website called bored
at work and I will be doing more content
on this bad boy over the weekend there's
no review my reviews usually thirty days
I will give my thoughts after week so
you guys can least get an update on that
so stay tuned and thank you for having
me again this week and that kind of just
jumped in but thanks mm-hmm alright um I
am sure Lindo reviews editor at Engadget
you can follow me on twitter at sure Lin
lo my Instagram is on there in my bio
and just an easter egg because it's a
special request go pigeons yeah
our review will be up sooner than you
know all right sorry about that I was
coughing on Twitter hey leave it on
Instagram I'm gonna take my time default
because the more I use it the more I
like it and I feel that it deserves a
shot I feel that companies like Samsung
companies like Huawei have won my
admiration over the last two three years
given the amount of effort they've put
in the amount of R&amp;amp;D that they're
bringing in so I'm gonna take my time
and I have nothing bad to say about this
product right now even if there are some
quirks or it's just it's not necessarily
that there's something wrong with it
it's just my paradigm is shifting
towards it and that takes time that's
just the way it is all right cool I have
no idea when my perspectives on the fold
will be coming out hopefully I'll be
able to meet up with any one of the
people who might get one maybe next week
won't mean this oh yeah but
true but you know aside from actually
like reviews and whatnot I can probably
give some perspective so as far as a
review is concerned I don't know let me
let me let me work on my student loans
for a bit and then I can get the phone
but then from there you know where to
find me I am J VTech t on Twitter and
Instagram you know me I am JV I love
Tekken I love to drink me some tea
sometimes out of a tech mug like the
Umbra mug like I was talking about
earlier in any case why don't we go
ahead and get into our outro here one
thing I do want to say just for the
background don't stop your recordings
yet everyone who's inside of this chat
right now we're gonna try to finish the
recordings at the exact same time I'll
do a countdown after this call is over
that way I can lined it up because
thunder you came in a little bit later
on in any case pocket now is that pocket
now on twitter facebook instagram and
youtube in english in espanol where you
can find more news on the pocket out
daily and pocket on now add audio every
weekday catch up on what the weekly is
talking about at pocketnow.com slash
podcasts also make sure you make your
voices heard by emailing us podcast at
ign.com we'd certainly appreciate your
feedback the reviews and ratings on
Google Apple Spotify overcast or
wherever you might be streaming us
because without you we wouldn't have
been able to make this show for your
eyes and yours for over 350 episodes
straight we're gonna see you next week
as Jaime said we're gonna see each other
next week so you might actually be
getting a live a live episode like a
life recorded episode rather than a
hangout swan and then I swear to you I
am going to get away from here now it's
laughter I want to get into like an OBS
like like actual YouTube streaming
format of this rather than we're lying
on something like hangouts on air but in
any case that is another story for
another time thank you so much for
watching and for listening if you are on
your podcast application and we will see
you in our next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
