praise as the best smartphones of the
year a new huawei 7p hints to a possible
nexus collaboration or it doesn't and
google just decided to take charge in
building its own cases I'm hi Mary vera
and if you understand what's on the
t-shirt you and I are getting old my
friend this is parking out daily for
those of you that set a goal for 2016 to
start a diet like me and haven't been
able to start it the official news that
I have to do with Google as the company
has just updated its google calendar
application with new service called
goals the whole idea is one that you set
a goal of something you want to do and
to that the application will be smart
enough to tell you when is the smartest
time to do whatever it is you want to do
to complete that goal it doesn't have to
be do yoga or go to the gym this is a
rather cool feature I'm testing it out
I'll let you know later if it's actually
worth it and speaking of Google the
company has just decided to launch its
own set of live cases and by cases were
talking about cases for the Nexus 6p and
Nexus 5x and they are rather unique
because well you pay thirty-five dollars
and it's sort of like motomaker you go
into a website you choose whatever photo
you want or you choose to take a
snapshot of a specific map of a city or
something and then you can color code it
however you want it is really cool we
can wait to test it out now some very
interesting rumors have hit the Apple
spectrum we don't really cover OS 10
that much but we just noticed in one of
apple's own websites that it's either a
typo or apple just called OS 10 mac OS
but you know like the camel case they
currently see with iOS and watch OS and
TV OS seems that Apple wants to
standardize everything into whatever the
vice and operating system it's sad
because a lot of people still want
eyepatch to run OS 10 so do I for
example but hey it seems that that's
probably a change coming to WWDC another
interesting change is coming to huawei
we assume we just notice that the
company trademark the huawei 7p the only
other device that Huawei has it starts
with a number and ends with a P is the
nexus
XP so it's got everybody scrambling over
is this the future Nexus since we heard
that HTC was going to do them we just
reviewed the HTC 10 and wow we kind of
really like what they did there but
still could it be that it's the future
Nexus 6p or could it just be that Huawei
is going to do the future nexus 7 that
actually needs an upgrade really fast
I'll see and finally the hot news today
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy s7
and galaxy s7 edge as more and more
publications continue to praise these
devices as the best smartphones in the
world and disclaimer in our review i
gave the s7 edge a 9.5 which is actually
the best number rating we've ever given
to a smartphone mainly because it is
that good it is really a very good
product but then again that's objective
that's in my opinion we would love to
know in the comments down below we
already saw a review of the HTC 10 if
you haven't I highly suggest you do
we've got the g5 review up as well what
do you think which is your favorite
smartphone of this year oh my god don't
even ask me cuz i have all three like
looking at me right now and i like them

good year for smartphones leave us a
