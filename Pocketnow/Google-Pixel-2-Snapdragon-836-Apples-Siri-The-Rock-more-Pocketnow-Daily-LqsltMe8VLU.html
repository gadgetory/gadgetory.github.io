being the first for the new Snapdragon
processor Apple is reportedly working on
dropping its need for Samsung and
building iPhones we get the first
credible leaks on the Samsung Galaxy S a
active I'm hi Matt leave it and we're
going to try something crazy we want to
see if we're able to publish this video
every day at 9 p.m. Eastern this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
have to do with the beauty of
advertisement mainly because Apple came
up with this commercial of Siri and the
rock and well it's currently taken over
the internet up to the point where it's
completely drowned a buzz of Bixby voice
in addition to Amazon's Alexa and also
the Google assistant it just proves the
beauty of marketing and how certain
companies just don't do it right
but anyways I'm not going to say that
this ad is great or not you can watch it
in the description and let us know what
you think in the comments other official
news have to do with YouTube TV I am a
major fan of the service and it
currently extends to 10 more markets
including Houston Miami Dallas among
other cities that you can learn more in
the description is it worth 35 bucks I
would say it is mainly because of all
that DVR that you get but anyways let us
know if you use the services well in the
comments and how about if we talk about
the galaxy s 8 active previously all we
saw from this phone was a gigantic slab
which pretty much didn't show anything
but adds up to date there is a video in
the description that also shows us how
this film looks from the back the fact
that it doesn't have curves on the
display and that apparently the display
is no longer including that
polycarbonate coating that was very
scratch friendly so yeah let's wait and
see when we're getting this active
smartphone I personally can't wait
and speaking of Samsung some interesting
reports from trusted sources claim that
Apple wants to do a couple of crazy
things going forward apparently the
company is noticing that it depends too
much on Samson particularly with OLED
displays apparently it's going to need a
ton of these for the current generation
iPhone that's coming so it seems that
Apple wants to actually build its own
OLED factory and we know that Fox comm
acquired sharp the whole purpose was to
build OLED display so it makes all the
sense for this to be a collaboration
between
is given how many iPhones are made by
Foxconn so yeah let's see how that goes
and finally the very interesting news
that they have to do with the Google
pixel - or Google pixel XL - we're not
exactly sure what the final names are
what we do here again from other trusted
sources is that this phone might bring
the new snapdragon 836 processor now
bear in mind as of before today we had
never heard of this processor we were
already talking about the snapdragon 845
for next year so 836 apparently it is
10% faster than the current 835 that
could be great but it leads me to the
question today I mean with this new
processor make you buy the next cool
pixel mainly because you're gonna have
to pony up for a smartphone that's not
subsidized in my case I don't know I
would not really care if it's 10% faster
I would really love the word 10% more
efficient on the battery but leave us a
comment down below is up to know your
opinion friends again we're going to try
to have this video live every day at 9
p.m. so follow us on social media and
also subscribe to our channel for more
videos like this one in also follow me
on Twitter Hind underscore to get on
Instagram and finally that please give

you saw I am hi netiquette I think so
much for watching we will see you
