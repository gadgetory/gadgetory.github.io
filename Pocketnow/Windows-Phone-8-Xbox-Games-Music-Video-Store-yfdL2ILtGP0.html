packing.com I'm going to show you
something new about Windows Phone 8
let's check it out in this video we're
going to take a look at the new Xbox
games hub the music and video hub and
the new Windows Phone 8 store so first
off here's the tiles I expand them and
we can add the full width tiles let's go
to games and see this is as a new design
and we see the collection there is no
search if you have a ton of games here
and they don't show up in the programs
listing search so that's might be an
issue we can see the Xbox extras is
still a separate download so that'll go
launch a new app for changing the avatar
but we have some new animations for our
avatar here and that's you've got a
message that's kind of old one but if we
shake them there we go now oh you broke
the glass if you shake them hard enough
you might fall down and I was going to
the prop here we have the next panel and
there's an Xbox SmartGlass button that's
quick access to that again it's a app
that you have to download separately
there's your friends there's your game
store and here's a nice new feature the
notifications bar panel rather we see
the friends who are sending messages or
inviting you to games or maybe it's your
turn or there's a message or here's a
beacon notification they all show up
here now which is really nice and
there's your spotlight just the usual
stuff and back to collection now let me
show you how quickly one of these
programs opens there's done brothers and
if you use this on Windows Phone 7.5 you
may remember it takes a very long time
to launch
but you just saw that happened really
quickly next up let's look at the Xbox
music and videos hub so here's my tile
tap that and we have the music
collection
there's your history and here's new and
I was kind of surprised to see all this
stuff show up in the music and videos
hub just by signing into my Microsoft
account I didn't connect it to computer
or anything they just started appearing
there and the reason for that is we have
a cloud collection now so let's look at
songs and up here at the top I can
filter by what's on the phone or what's
in my cloud collection so let's see now
you see the lot little tiny icon there
the little dot would be weaves around it
that means this is going to have to
stream in order to play it so all these
songs here are things that I bought on
soon over the past couple years or so
and I can just tap it and it will start
playing over the internet so there's our
music player looks pretty much the same
but we have a new menu here there's more
in store you can download it I can save
it as a playlist and I can share it and
there's NFC so I can share that song via
NFC make sure of your messaging and
here's Xbox if I hit that it will start
playing on the Xbox over there
of course there's music and here's one
that I've been looking for social
networks so say I want to share this
song I can there's a link to it I can
type a message with it I can choose
which social networks I wanted to go to
LinkedIn Twitter and Facebook and I can
even choose who is going to be able to
view it on Facebook now if I go back we
see the background changed based on what
artists I'm listening to so while song
is plain if I go to my tile look at this
cool animation I got the artists going
on in background I got text flying over
it
it's pretty cool however if I stop the
music it goes back to this really boring
green icon that's different from
previous Windows Phone music tiles that
used to keep the artists image there
which is kind of unfortunate because it
looks really bad this way now let's go
back to the music library and here's
playlists now this is a playlist that I
saved on the Xbox 360 using Xbox music
and it did sync the playlists but it
didn't think any of the songs in the
playlist so I think that's a bug of
course you still have videos and
podcasts here videos do not sync with my
cloud collection so anything that I
bought on Zune or Xbox video does not
automatically show up here which is
unfortunate and here's the store so we
can choose apps games music and podcasts
notably missing is videos I was kind of
hoping for that but no you don't get
videos so there's all the different
panels now let's go to apps and there's
something new here we have kind of tile
shapes for the categories and here's a
new one picks for you this is going to
use kind of your usage that keeps track
of and you know what other apps you
download and it tells you the reason why
it thinks you might like this app so
here's one that says a bunch of my
friends really liked this fuse app it
tells me the names of them and so maybe
I should try that too and we see others
that say you know you downloaded the
Microsoft Store app maybe like this so
that's pretty neat feature
and as your categories and spotlight now
that picks for you is also in the games
store there it is so maybe it'll suggest
some games that I might like and it
tells me which my friends really like
these programs those are friends on
Facebook and now to the music store
oddly there is no picks for you button
now that picks feature kind of urgent
the Zune which allowed you to know find
music that you might like based on what
music you listen to
unfortunately it did not make it to
Windows Phone 8 and podcast does not
have a panoramic thing but of course
they're there and you can subscribe to
them so that's a look at the new Xbox
games hub the Xbox music and video hub
and the new Windows Phone 8 store be
sure to give this video a thumbs up and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
