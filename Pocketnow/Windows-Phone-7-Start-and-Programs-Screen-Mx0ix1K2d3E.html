com next up we're going to look at the
lock screen the start screen and the
program's menu on windows phone 7 so
here's lock screen and it shows a nice
big clock and the day and your next
appointment as well as some new messages
down here those little icons represent
different email accounts or text
messaging or missed calls so those are
show up right there and that's really
useful because all I have to do is turn
your phone on to see this type of
information ok if you tap it it gives
you a little animation indicating that
you can slide this up in order to unlock
it also happens if you press the start
key see bounces so that's your
indication that you guys slide this and
here we are with the Start screen you
probably already know all these tiles
you can move them around you can
customize them so I'll have to do is tap
and hold and then you can drag them
okay if you want to unpin it you just
hit this one right there
so the tabot hold there we go okay and
then you tap off the side to apply that
so you can rearrange all this according
to what you like what you want most of
the top and now over here you got your
programs menu so you can see you can
slide it just like that or you can tap
this era and this is where all your
programs live except for the games which
live in the game's hub and you can see
it's really smooth scrolling there and
let's go into settings so this is where
you can change I'll sort the source of
things there's a ringtones unfortunately
you can't add custom ringtones there's
no it's just what's been pre-populated
it seems ATT has been able to add
something but we don't know how to do it
manually yet so you got all these
options new text message new voicemail
new email playsound lock and unlock I'll
shut that off and shut off the tee press
two
theme you can change your colors dark to
light happens right there accent color
happens right there airplane mode will
turn off all your radios Wi-Fi Bluetooth
here you can set up your email accounts
so your login wallpaper so we can change
our wallpaper let's go with that one
alright
location services on sure automatic
brightness you can change your keyboard
elite language oh my god i don't have
english though
because your region information speech
options phone update no updates and
found find my phone I'm going to say yes
share the location for better mapping
here's the about information so it's the
HTC surround and feedback
if you swipe to the side you get
application settings so these are the
same settings you might get to from
those applications okay you can change
your office username
you press that
alright we don't have any games out of
the burqa connect xbox live yes
not a whole lot of options for each
application here's a good one people
this is new you can show all facebook
friends or only add facebook info to
existing contacts
it's your picture options auto upload
the sky drives on attached location info
to upload pictures and here you can
change your quick upload account so if
you want it to automatically up to
upload to Facebook instead you just let
that and then whenever you take a
picture it's going to go up on Facebook
so be careful with that there's your
radio options and search use location
yes so that's it for the settings next
we will take a look at some of the hubs
and what happened it's a frappe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
