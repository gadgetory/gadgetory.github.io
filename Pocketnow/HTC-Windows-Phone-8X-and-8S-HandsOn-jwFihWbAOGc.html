Microsoft about these devices okay so
this is the Windows Phone v-necks on the
right hand side comes in four different
color skews this is probably my favorite
this is the lime light yellow also comes
in a flame red this is the windows phone
8 s my HTC size of the screen on the so
you got a 4 inch screen on the 8's
orange yeah and 4.3 on the 8x full 720p
resolution on the 8x and then 480 x 800
on the 8's come some of the unique
things about these devices hardware wise
is external to the screen the 8x or it's
grilled last two also the
second-generation super LCD which is
very exciting so nice vibrant display
both of these devices the camera on
these devices really nice so they
mentioned it out there but you've got an
8 megapixel camera on the rear f20
aperture 28 millimeter wide angle lens
but really where the magic happens is up
in the front so the front facing camera
we brought that same episode auto
aperture to the front we also increased
the angle of the lens now we're going
out to 88 degrees can we take a look
yeah so
Raeleen Ranger
so we're going to the iphone as a before
hear of a narrow end
alright
the iphone yeah
much better in terms of the wide angle
you can see JV over here and you can't
say
in this case so that's that's a really
wide angle so pretty exciting in 88
degrees on the back we besides just the
hardware we've got some pretty cool new
innovations across the device in general
we've got in an amplifier so beats audio
in both devices but in the Windows Phone
8x we've actually put dedicated
amplifiers inside yeah so you've got one
that powers the rear speaker and you've
got one that actually powers the headset
jack so 2.5 5 volt headset jack
amplifier so that's just going to mean
that everything you listen to is going
to sound better with Beats Audio really
really really amazing experience there
and we hear the audio from the stamp
lafai speaker oh yes it is kind of loud
out there
so really really great feeling in the
can kind of this book
it's hard to hear on camera but that's
actually got a tiny little bit of his
basement amazing sure
fantastic and everything on the back was
your thoughts right yeah so the cameras
are flushed down here speaker grills you
can actually feel camera buttons are
almost flush with the edges all the way
around yeah absolutely this is the
yellow color yeah Center to limelight
you know really great ours are hearing
with people so inside it's built like a
pyramid what's the purpose for that it
is so it allows us to maintain this
really cool shape so what they're
actually done is taken the battery and
put it back up behind the screen and
then actually stack of the components on
top side allowing us to keep it really
thin so when you put in your hand
because it feel then it feels like it's
like you're too interesting because it's
instance right around 10 millimeters
yeah but it's hard to tell because these
curved edges feels familiar it's amazing
it feels like it's a seven millimeter if
it does that's really nice and the same
kind of shape and form factor on the 8's
as well just in a smaller form the 8's
always has the sort of dipped color look
um it does yes there's four different
color combinations one has two shades of
blue the Domino black and white there's
our there's a another red combination
that is red and orange color at the
bottom I'm so very excitingly got
processors and so both have these half
dry can s4 you've got a 1 gigahertz
through the poor in this one and then a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core in this one full
gig of ram here in 512 and the 8's
you're going to get a creative fun audio
thing I really exciting listening to
these mini headphones come well to make
my power to be island
shower looks quite thank you Mary the
iphone
and you get really good one-handed good
one-handed usability on the 8's oh yeah
I find that I don't hunt for buttons on
this one as well really crisp and clear
screen you can get really close up on
see the screen was wvga on the it is on
the small when yes Rama has had these
bats are protected yeah so Microsoft's
got a bunch of really exciting features
that will be announcing later on okay so
there are more and more furious mean
much more to come that's very
interesting great thank you all got a
clock on the front the big clock I don't
see the big pocket my blog games aren't
a real louder and it's drop resistant
terribly this is the end that's a nice
clock is every sizable it is resizable
and that's one of the unique things
about Windows Phone 8 is that the tiles
can be resized the three different sizes
you know nowadays information comes from
everywhere it's constantly flowing so
with the tiles you can resize them
multiple daenerys and really design your
home screen with all the information
that's important to use you're
constantly getting the updates in real
time okay shoes he added any other
software that you want to tell us about
really the hub is one of the main things
so you've got the light nice large HTC
clock on the top and you're familiar
with the hub that we've had on Windows
Phone in the past you're going to have
your weather stocks and news all inside
of the hub pretty nice little experience
that the most I think exciting thing for
us is to have the large clock on front
allows you to get to the impact that
very quickly and also the weather
and you've got some tempered glass here
around the edges yeah so it is it's a
girl last two and it does it kind of
flows over the edges you can you really
can't tell where the glass ends and the
polycarbonate I get 1x kind of actually
exactly as a nice design feature great
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
