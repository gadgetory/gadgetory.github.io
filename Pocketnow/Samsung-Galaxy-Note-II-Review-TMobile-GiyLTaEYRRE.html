pocket now calm and this is our full
review of the t-mobile Galaxy Note 2
let's get to it
the Galaxy Note 2 is a big device but
you already knew that it feels more
comfortable in the hand than did the
first galaxy note which felt more like
an experiment than it did a refined and
final product the note 2 looks and feels
like a big galaxy s3 let's take a closer
look at the hardware like the galaxy s3
the note 2 has a minimal bezel
surrounding the display at five point
five five inches that displays closer to
being five point six inches then it is
5.5 inches it is big and it's got the
same resolution than the smaller galaxy
s3 at 1280 pixels down by 720 pixels
across making for a still crisp dpi of
264 the display is a Super AMOLED HD
with an RGB sub pixel configuration
which means that close-up icons look
smoother than they did on the galaxy s3
which had a pentile screen up on the top
B of the same speaker that is found on
the galaxy s3 plus some sensors an LED
notification light that disappears when
it's not blinking and a 1.9 megapixel
front-facing camera on the back we have
a symmetrical home button flanked by the
menu and back buttons that like the LED
light are invisible when not turned on
flipping over to the back we can see the
nice-looking graphite grey color of our
test unit the camera is the same as the
galaxy s3 which is a good thing at 8
megapixels and like the galaxy s3 the
back cover is removable but it's plastic
and picks up fingerprints way too easily
removing the back battery cover we find
a memory expansion slot a micro SIM Bay
and the huge 3100 milliamp hour battery
more on battery life later
let's talk specs the t-mobile version
like all US variants has the powerful
Exynos quad-core CPU clocking it up to
1.6 gigahertz per core it also has a
plentiful 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of storage it ships with
Android 4.1.1 jelly bean which is great
to see at the box
because this is the t-mobile variant
there is no LTE onboard but there is
support for t-mobile fastest 42 megabits
per second data speeds over HSPA+ in
hand the Galaxy Note tube fill is very
similar to the galaxy s3 just a whole
lot bigger so you'll experience the same
smooth textures and rounded edges and
you might also think that the build
quality is cheap because of the heavy
use of plastic but because the note 2 is
heavier than the galaxy s3 it feels more
substantial and thus higher quality the
note tube is quite thin at just nine
point four millimeters in depth don't
expect to adequately use the note 2 with
one hand though with the inclusion of
the stylists Samsung wasn't trying to
build a one hand friendly device because
anytime you use the s-pen you need two
hands
speaking of the stylus let's talk about
the s-pen it's thicker than the s-pen of
the original note but feels light and
plasticky not high quality like a desk
pen also Samsung claims to have
increased the level of friction of the
tip of the pen but we found writing on
the smooth surface of the Note 2 to feel
like well writing on a smooth screen the
note 2 doesn't successfully replicate
the feeling of writing on paper so if
you plan on replacing your memo pad with
the note 2 you might find handwriting on
the device to feel unnatural but it's
kind of fun to just use the end pen to
navigate the note 2 instead of your
finger flipping through the app tray
scrolling through a webpage and even
drawing on the keyboard feels more
precise when you're using a stylus and
it reminds us a bit of the days of
Windows Mobile where a stylus input was
the usual and then there's a ton you can
do with the s-pen we covered these
features in detail in a previous video
but let's review some of the coolest
ones now you can now write directly into
an email and the software will convert
it to an image while this won't exactly
make you more productive it's a lot of
fun you can also now write directly into
your calendar but only if you're using s
planner and you're in portrait
orientation pressing the S Pen button
and double tapping on the screen will
bring up pop-up note which is a great
way to quickly jot down a note while
having it hover above whatever screen
you're on if you're hoping that the note
2 does a good job at handwriting
recognition you're likely to be
disappointed unless you have nice
handwriting
you can call it the handwriting
recognition input method anywhere that
the keyboard is called up then there's a
couple of really interesting software
editions that would only work with the
large display of the note 2 for example
pop-up browser has been added as a way
to look at a webpage without leaving the
app you're currently running this is
super helpful when using Twitter and
Facebook and you want to view web links
without having to leave the app another
super cool feature of the note 2 which
is only available in a software update
that is yet to be pushed to our review
unit is a split screen multiview that
lets you run two apps at once side by
side and while Samsung claims that the S
Pen is over 1,000 levels of pressure we
didn't really notice that level of
sensitivity while there are definitely
varying degrees of sensitivity it would
seem that there only are about ten of
them if you try to draw a line and apply
varying degrees of thickness let's talk
more about the software running on
android jelly bean the note 2 feels a
lot like the Galaxy s3 because it uses
pretty much the same software TouchWiz
on the home screen allows for easy
management of multiple panels something
that we tremendously dislike about
TouchWiz is that you still cannot make a
new folder by moving one app to overlap
on another like you can an Ice Cream
Sandwich instead you must press on the
menu button and tap a new folder unlike
the International note 2 the t-mobile
Note 2 has a fair amount of t-mobile
bloatware apps and widgets these aren't
a problem if you just ignore them but
unfortunately they cannot be removed
overall device performance was pretty
impressive moving in and out of apps
flipping through the app tray and
browsing the web we're all very smooth
with the exception of the occasional
hiccup when flipping through widgets
when browsing a particularly image-heavy
webpage games also looked quite
impressive with great frame rates and
detailed textures though we wish there
were some Exynos specific games that
could really show off the power of
Samsung's quad-core CPU for full
benchmark results check out our full
review but as a preview the note 2
scores impressively in Quadrant with
results around 6000 we wish the note 2
at a kickstand because as a movie player
the note 2 can't be beat thanks to its
massive screen streaming HD Netflix
video content was an absolute joy though
a bit tiring
if you don't prop the device so that you
don't have to hold it web browsing was
also more desktop-like than we've ever
experienced on a smartphone but because
of the display is still 1280 by 720 you
don't see more content than on smaller
devices with the same resolution
everything is just bigger now for some
test notes our t-mobile tester unit came
with a graphite gray case it acts as a
new battery cover and provides a book
like form factor the case which will
retail for about 40 dollars makes the
Note 2 even more awkward to hold as you
must wrap the front cover around to the
back to be able to type with two hands
battery life on the note 2 is far above
average thanks to its huge 3100 milliamp
hour battery with heavy use you'll get
through a day and a half in terms of
network performance we were disappointed
the note 2 on t-mobile doesn't have LTE
because t-mobile is still using the UMTS
based HSPA+ standard our best speed
tests clocked in at around 12 megabits
per second which is on the low end of
what you would get on LTE with a note 2
on Verizon AT&amp;amp;T or Sprint
not only that but we dropped down to
edge and even the rare 56k like GPRS
data speeds at times which was just
unacceptable
call quality was solid we experienced no
dropped calls even though we were often
making calls with half the number of
bars than we'd show on other devices
running on other networks in the same
spot in terms of camera performance we
found the camera on the note 2 to be as
good as it is on the galaxy s3 putting
it on par with the iPhone for us but not
quite as good as the iPhone 5 low-light
shots were reasonably good macros were
crisp and outdoor shots were well
balanced I went into this review hoping
that Samsung had increased the utility
of the s-pen enough to the point where I
would be more productive on the note 2
then I would be on any other smartphone
was this the case well no I sure did
have a lot of fun with the note 2 as
using the s-pen to write into an email
to take notes and to see a preview of my
emails just by hovering on a message was
a unique in Weld
experience but because writing on the
screen of the note2 feels so unnatural
coupled with its inadequate handwriting
recognition
I found myself spending more time
feeling frustrated than being productive
but for what it is the note2 is a
brilliant device that does nearly
everything well and those that don't
mind its size will find it to be highly
capable smartphone here's what we like
and what we don't like about the
t-mobile Galaxy Note 2 we like that it's
fast
we like that the display brings movies
and games to life like no other phone
can and we like that Samsung has
included software features to take
advantage of the big screen we don't
like that t-mobile still doesn't have
LTE and that their network performance
is still not up to par with the other
carriers we don't like that the already
cumbersome to hold Note 2 has the
slippery and fingerprint prone casing
found on the galaxy s3 and we don't like
that we're still left questioning the
utility of the s-pen which is the core
feature of the note 2 it's just not good
enough to be a game-changer yet
so in conclusion we're going to give the
t-mobile Galaxy Note 2 an 8 out of 10
now the reason we're not giving it a
full nine out of 10 like we gave the
International Galaxy Note 2 is because
of t-mobile with t-mobile you don't get
LTE data speeds you get speeds that are
as high as 15 megabits per second and
optimum conditions which is good but
nowhere near something the LTE speeds
we're seeing on the other three carriers
also with t-mobile on the note 2 i ran
into edge data speed sometimes and even
GPRS speeds which just was not
acceptable so the Galaxy Note 2 is an
awesome phone in and of itself but
t-mobile still has some of its problems
unless you live in a coverage area with
optimum t-mobile performance so if you
liked this video please give us a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now
