the wild we got the first photos of the
probable Samsung Galaxy gear and these
are just one the 4k video wars on if
only just wondering why I'm high
metairie better and really OEMs instead
of fighting this 4k war why don't you
give me a limited battery life this is
PocketNow daily let's start today off
with some official and kind of weird
news as acer has just announced a couple
of products before fifa first of all a
tablet which is there a three that is
just a 10.1 inch tablet this is
description for details but probably
even more interesting as a six inch
liquid s2 smartphone that can record 4k
video yeah we finally get the world's
first 4k video smartphone that will
probably not have enough battery life to
last anyway and which you won't be able
to watch on a TV because none of us can
actually afford it anyways but hey it's
out in the blue we'll probably see it in
the next couple of months links to the
description for full specs and speaking
of unexpected products we all remember
those rumors of nvidia probably working
on tablets to support their new Tegra 5
processor and we were expecting that to
be in 2014 but we've now got some leaks
that it set the NCC in Taiwan which is
like the United States FCC and well even
though we don't have many specifications
yet it could be that we could be seeing
this product in the fall into the
description for details and for those of
you wondering what to expect about these
special 7e camera lenses that'll be too
expensive to even light but that will
attach to a smartphone use it as a
viewfinder but that are also independent
well licks in the description will show
you a full gallery of what to expect
about this product but even more
interesting within the leaks and rumors
are that apparently you won't need a
sony smartphone to use this thing and
yeah we know it's a dependent but
apparently it will also work on an
iphone another android phone so anyways
let's see how that goes and even though
we haven't really seen any leak trust
renders of the Samsung Galaxy gear don't
know what's taking them so long so far
as it turns out we have the first league
photograph of the SmartWatch and I am
trying very hard not to call this one a
fake I mean if you look at it it looks
kind of cheesy and it looks like the
watches that I used to learn as a kid in
the 80s I don't see any futuristic thing
about this watch but well let's see what
we get in the
interesting no hardware buttons either
links to the description for more
details though again the event is in the
next two days so let's see what we get
and finally for the interesting news of
the day we've got some leaked
photographs of the packaging and the
manuals of the iphone 5c n they look
like the packaging and manuals of the
ipod touch so some of us are wondering
of Apple is actually planning to ditch
the ipod touch and use this phone as
they're cheap entry-level phone that
replaces the ipod touch as a next
generation and when you think about it
because of the price of the fifth
generation ipod touch it kind of makes
sense but that leads you to the question
of the day what would be the perfect
price range that you would require for
that iphone 5c to be attracted to you
would you consider it two hundred
dollars three hundred dollars you know
judging by the price of the current
generation ipod touch i would say that
with the nexus 4 costing just two
hundred dollars right now apple better
price that thing that low but again
leave us a comment down below what do
you expect friends is always fern
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tap or
mushy follow us on parker now comment
