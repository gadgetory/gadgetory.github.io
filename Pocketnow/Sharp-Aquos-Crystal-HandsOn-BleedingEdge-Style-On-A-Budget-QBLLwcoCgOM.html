range in the US smartphone market and
while you will find great value you
probably won't find industrial design
that's pushing any boundaries at least
not at a competitive price point that's
a status quo that Sprint and sharp aim
to shake up with the Aqua Crystal
announced just today in New York City
I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow and I
just went hands-on with the Aqua crystal
so join me for a quick look the Aqua
crystal is well-named
well at least when it comes to the
crystal part its 5-inch display isn't
anything crazy at 720p but it runs right
to the edges of the phone coming closer
to fulfilling the promise of the bezel
less smart phone than any other handheld
we've tested that sounds like it make
the phone tough to handle but in
practice at least for the few minutes we
played with it
it really doesn't there's a small
chamfer on the edge of the display
protection which further enhances the
phone's futuristic appeal helping to
make up for the fact that it's just
plastic the components you'd usually
expect to see at the top of the phone
have been moved or redesigned the
front-facing camera is mounted low on
the chin alongside the microphone and
the earpiece has been replaced with a
direct wave receiver that vibrates the
display to transmit sound about the only
place the aqua crystal disappoints for
me is around back where the black or
white plastic around its 8 megapixel
camera bears a dull dimpling and generic
feel the phone is powered by a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processor almost
certainly a Snapdragon 400 with 16 gigs
of storage expandable up to 128
additional gigs using microSD the juice
to run it comes from a small 2040
milliamp hour battery and the software
is close to stock Android 4.4.2 though
there are some sharp value-adds like the
swipe to screenshot gesture also Sprint
has bundled the same clarify and live
stage sound enhancements as found in its
HTC One m8 Harman Kardon it
which won't be too useful on the rear
firing speakerphone but will come in
handy when listening to discounted
Spotify music over headphones which by
the way won't be included in the box no
matter who you buy the phone from
considering the eye-catching nature of
the smartphone maybe some of its
shortcomings are surprising but the
price brings everything into focus when
it launches the oculus will retail for
two $39.99 with no contract post paid
$149 on prepaid boost or virgin or zero
down and ten bucks a month on a sprint
postpaid plan which also includes new
incentives like bulk data discounts for
families and a new subscription service
called app Pass which offers premium
content and special incentives and
things like that it all adds up to some
surprising value especially considering
just how bold the design of this nearly
edgeless device really is I'm really
looking forward to reviewing the Aqua
crystal once sprint offers up a review
unit and we'll keep you posted on
availability information as we get it in
the meantime we'll just say that for the
budget minded consumer Sprint and it's
prepaid subsidiaries just got a bit more
attractive
thanks to sharp for more brand new
device coverage delivered to your tubes
