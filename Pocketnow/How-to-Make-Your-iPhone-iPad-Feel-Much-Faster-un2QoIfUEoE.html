pocketnow.com I've done something to my
iPhone to make it feel significantly
faster it's free and it's easy to do it
in this video I'm going to show you
exactly what I did let's get to it so
this is a really big deal for me because
something that I've always hated about
iOS is how there is an animation to do
literally everything you go into an app
you go into the settings you bounce
around there's an animation they're
sliding there's moving there's so much
movement it is so inefficient that I
just want to kill all of the animations
fortunately if your jailbroken you can
kill the animations with a three program
called accelerate and it makes a
dramatic difference now I should start
off by saying that if you jailbreak your
iPhone you can always unjailbroken go
back to factory firmware so that in case
you have to go to an Apple Store it's
not that big of a deal we'll put a link
up on the video here so that you can go
back jailbreak your phone you got to do
it iOS is boring until you do some cool
stuff like accelerate so watch this let
me show you again how slow things are
without accelerate now I'm gonna turn it
on and watch boom boom go into YouTube
boom I mean this is unbelievably
unbelievably fast it's cutting down on
every animation it's it's it's so
incredibly fast and if you go back into
the settings going from screen to screen
is now faster going back to the home
screen faster opening up multitask is
faster it has no bugs I found no bugs
and it has settings that makes it even
faster than what I'm showing you now I
feel like I had a lot of caffeine when I
use this so what you can do here is you
can turn off some of the animations
because for example if you if you leave
everything animated more quickly watch
what happens now that just looks really
weird doesn't it so you go to the
science you can turn off specific areas
of animation and you can make it even
faster there's this one setting called
warp speed I think is too fast sometimes
the app has not been loaded into Ram yet
but look at that it's basically instant
I mean it's unbelievably fast I really
like cheetah so this is called
accelerate again it's free if you
jailbreak your iPhone this has literally
changed the way that I use the iPhone it
feels like it
any different device and I've tested it
on a 4s and a four and it works equally
as well as it's working here on the
iPhone 5 I actually really liked that
warp speed so I know if you liked this
video please give us a thumbs up and
thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
