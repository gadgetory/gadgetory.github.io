all according to rumors coming from one
of the most famous sources
it looks like the LGV 40 might bring a
total of five cameras in an arch because
why not and the FCC has just approved
the Samsung Galaxy Note nine so we
expect it very soon I'm high memory that
I tried to make the bet as much as I
could say hello from Frankfurt there's a
lot of coverage coming but you know pre
recording dailies is crazy this is a
pocket out daily the official news today
began with deals I know the Ascend phone
5 is not necessarily the newest phone in
the market it's almost 2 years old but
here's the thing snapdragon 6 2 5 4 gigs
of ram and right now this phone is being
sold for 150 bucks so if you have a
phone that you need to buy for a kid or
for your little brother or whatever this
is probably a good way to start you can
learn more in the description now let's
talk about the standalone oculus go I'm
not necessarily the biggest fan of VR
but I know that a lot of people love it
an oculus is doing an amazing job with
the go
it's pricing it aggressively and right
now it's extending to other markets so
up to 300 stores including Amazon you
can get it starting at $199,000 you
liked it but again it's VR that's up to
you now let's move the spotlight over to
the samsung galaxy note 9 I am really
looking forward to this phone and yes it
is just being approved of the FCC that
means that we should expect it very soon
how soon we're hearing the first week of
august i'm already setting my calendars
and everything stay tuned we hear that a
lot of the rumors of what we seen in
renders is pretty much what we're
getting now let's move the spotlight
over to LG as we hear some crazy rumors
of the company really wants to go out
with the v40 finally i hope they do the
same for marketing we hear five cameras
with the notch and the reason why we
have a notch is because there are two
cameras at the front with a stereoscopic
sensor I hope I got that right for 3d
sensing and unlocking the phone and then
three cameras at the back where it's the
regular the wide-angle and we're still
not sure what the third camera is gonna
do but I mean come on LG fine let's see
what your end up bringing
and finally the hottest news today have
to do I'm not exactly sure if the iPhone
10 2018 or the fact that min Chico's
back we know we can trust these rumors
as we hear that there might not
necessarily be delays with the iPhone 10
2018 in the case of the LCD variant but
there are issues in production of the
LCD so apparently even if we get the
phones and now at the same time we'll
probably have to wait for the LCD iPhone
until later now the question is if this
is the entry-level phone why would you
wait for it it seems that the price tag
is gonna be insane it's gonna start at
550 bucks and I'm not exactly sure which
variant will extend up to 800 but that's
that okay that's crazy that is one plus
territory 550 bucks so let us know in
the comments when you buy an iPhone if
it were priced that way particularly
when you've got the vices like the
oneplus six of the market performing
great in my case that's definitely a
crazy price tag we've never really seen
from Apple at this stage so leave us a
comment down below I'm really curious to
read your opinions friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow us
on pluggin out I'd come and scruff to
our channel by hitting this button up
here you're gonna watch yesterday's
bargain out daily up here and our
thoughts on the camera of the wall way
p20 Pro down here you'll also follow me

instagram at how you leave it I please
