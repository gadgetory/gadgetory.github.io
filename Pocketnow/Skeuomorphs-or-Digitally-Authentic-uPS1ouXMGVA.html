packing.com and we're wondering do you
like skeuomorph or digital authenticity
first let's talk about what skeuomorph
seeeeee are its new buzzword used to
describe design elements that have no
purpose in their current form but I used
to give a familiarity to something from
the past skeuomorph design elements are
extremely prevalent in apple's software
designs in iPhoto for iOS you'll see
your photo albums represented as books
sitting on shelves with pictures on them
you'll see pictures of paintbrushes and
pencils to represent editing tools the
iBooks and newsstand apps show your
books and subscriptions on wooden
shelves buns have bells and shadows and
fake light refraction the dock at the
bottom of the home screen has fake icon
reflections the game center has textures
straight out of a casino on the other
hand there's Microsoft with Windows
Phone 7 Microsoft has gone in a
completely different direction they're
taking user interface design into a
future without the useless yet familiar
skeuomorph the interface actually feels
like something from a science-fiction
movie Square and rectangular tiles are
neatly arranged in solid colored pixel
forms while floating over a bear area of
negative space on the star screen
there's nothing to fake here though
icons do represent simplified forms of
objects from pass like the telephone
receiver still we have buttons that
aren't pretending to be something else
text is text pictures or pictures there
aren't any extraneous decorations fake
reflections or unnecessary textures here
Microsoft's designers seem to be going
by the quote from antoine de saint
xperia perfection is achieved not when
there's nothing left to add but when
there's nothing left to take away
whereas apple's designers seem to add
all sorts of unnecessary graphics which
Clive Thompson of Wired says are
hobbling innovation and lashing
designers to metaphors of the past let
us know what you think in the comments
are you fan of pixels pretending to be
they're bound textures and spiral-bound
notebooks or to prefer your pixels to be
more digitally authentic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
