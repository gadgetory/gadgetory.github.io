ago we have a video series called
launcher Wars which showed off some of
our favorite third-party launchers for
android android unlike other os's lets
you replace all kinds of stuff you don't
like the way your launcher looks and
replace it don't like your app drawer
that's part of the launcher replace it
really neat one of our favorites is
called ADW launcher and for a while they
just kind of rested on their laurels I
mean they were cool and all but there
weren't that many improvements or
changes until recently and we thought it
was worth going back looking at all of
the improvements ADW launcher ii x let's
get right to it this is ADW launcher ii
x the e axe version i don't know exactly
what it stands for but i'm going to say
it stands for extra you see this is the
paid version of the launcher you can get
a free version that just doesn't have
all the bells and whistles if you decide
to try it out definitely try a TWA
launcher that's where you're going to
find it in the app store or that the
place or rather it's written by on der
web so there you go you can look it up
it's just a few bucks to get up to the e
x version and it includes bells and
whistles and really neat things try
before you buy with the 90 x version and
then upgrade if you want to get all the
bells and whistles so first and foremost
this is my galaxy nexus it's the GSM
variety and it's running Android
jellybean 4.2 completely stock there's
no routing there's no superuser
permissions nothing this is stock
Android all I've done is installed ADW
launcher ii x on top of it now you might
be thinking hey Joe that's cool but I
don't have android 4.2 so I can't do any
of this cool stuff why am I wasting my
time watching this video this will work
on Android version 1.6 and up so you can
get all of this cool stuff all the way
back on your g1
think about that really really cool so
let's dig in and get started first of
all you'll notice we've got basically
the same thing we've got our search bar
complete with microphone for voice input
and this interesting little square e
thing up at the top that's actually your
app drawer you can get into it really
fast that way and then quick access over
here to get into settings where you can
create a new group of icons you may not
have well let's just say you might have
bloatware these apps you don't want to
see because they came preloaded with
your device no problem create a new
group for them put all your bloatware in
that you only have to look at one icon
saves a lot of time when you're looking
for whatever to run in your app drawer
you can remove the group's set up the
group manage all the apps in here and
jump into a TW settings which we'll get
into in just a minute here so we've got
next underneath this is your regular
screen you can actually resize the
screen if you want a little bit more
margin or a little less margin around it
really cool feature notice at the bottom
you can scroll across it's really quick
and you've got your page indicator just
like you'd expect you can also get into
your apt or the traditional way by
hitting the apt or button if you want to
change icons in your dock it's pretty
simple you long hold and you drag down
to the plus sign and it just spreads
them out over here so let's go ahead and
move a couple of these down here just
like that and we'll just go in and we'll
put people over here as well so now when
I scroll around I've got my app drawer
all organized down there it's going to
stay there really really nice so lots of
settings and settings are really what's
all about first and foremost let's
create a new folder for these guys tap
and hold drag and drop there you go I've
got a new folder just like you'd expect
with a modern version of Android older
versions of Android didn't really have
this or didn't have it in the same ease
of use again this works all the way back
to 1.6 so now you can you can open that
up and it's paginate it you can change
the order that it sorts in the just lots
of cool things you can
even change the style if you don't like
the way that that preview looks so let's
go ahead and look at that come back in
here into settings and go into a TW
settings now there's so much stuff in
here I'm not going to be able to cover
it all so don't think that I'm leaving
out your favorite part there's just so
much we can't cover it entirely let's
look at a few of the cool things for
example let's go into screen we can
change our action bar design that's the
one up at the top I've got it set to
light right now we can disable it
entirely free of that space we can make
it transparent or based on the theme yes
this is a theme abou launcher so you can
change it based on themes that people
publish and put out there in the Play
Store we can change it to a dark theme
or a frame and we'll go ahead and set it
to frame just for right now and see what
that looks like it does take a minute
once you make changes to go back in and
and look at that but you can see there's
the nice-looking frame now a little bit
more traditional with what you'd expect
with ice cream sandwich and jellybean
back into a TW settings now app drawer
you can come in and change the app
drawer style one of the cool things that
I like is this role I'll show you to
roll unball so we'll do that go back
home now again it's taking that time to
apply all of the changes which this if
you want to call it lag that's the only
place you're going to really find it is
applying these settings in the launcher
so go ahead and open that up now and if
you look when we scroll now I've got a
roll of icons that will flatten back out
when I take my finger off the screen so
very cool very fast too if you thought
that was cool let's go in and show you
something even cooler in our app drawer
again let's change the style to ball and
yes think you know where I'm going with
this there's our grid but when we tap
and drag it changes into a sphere that
we can then flip around and cool
functional i I don't know probably not
but very very cool icons we can change
the icon size you want to bigger you I'm
smaller whatever let's make them
seventy percent 75 that'll be good we
can change the text size let's make that
a little bit bigger just going to look
really awkward so I'm not recommending
you do this change the text color to
whatever you want let's say I'm a droid
fan so let's go ahead and choose red
shadow color we can come in let's make
that a little bit of a red as well label
color I don't know let's make that a
darker grey over here something I guess
that works fancy background if you want
to enclose the icons inside of a fancy
colored background you can like a tile
or whatever I don't like it I like them
just like that so we'll apply that home
twice and you can see all of my icons
are now smaller and my text is bigger so
I can cram a whole bunch of more stuff
on the screen so I've made these changes
again I don't like how this looks this
is just for illustration purposes you're
probably not going to do this but if you
want to you could I've thrown a couple
of these small icons back out onto the
screen again I can change the icon size
to pretty much whatever I want this is
seventy percent of normal with bigger
text than normal so now I've changed the
transition on the screens to random just
to kind of show you really what I think
is the coolest part about this and
that's that the transition effect
between the screen so okay Joe shut up
and just show us okay okay will so we're
going to drag it over actually that was
a long press another drag and you can
see that's just a normal one there's a
fade there's a tumble it's kind of a
cube but all of these different things
and the animation is so fluid and fast
and again this is random so each one of
these is a completely random selection
you can pick which one you like best and
and implement that across your entire
and your entire experience I'm at a loss
for words because come on this this is
just cool it's ADW launcher ii x it's
available in the Google Play Store you
can get the free version or you can get
the full ax version with all of the
extras
which is what i'm showing you right here
es has a few of these extra transitions
and whatnot you can read about the
differences there I like it a lot it's a
huge improvement over what we had in the
past I'm glad to see on der web starting
to do new stuff and bring all this out
again I have not even touched the half
of what you can do with this so make
sure you go and explore and let us know
what your favorite feature is down in
the comments below showing off really
cool launchers that you can use even on
your really really old android-powered
devices for pocket now I'm Joe Levi
