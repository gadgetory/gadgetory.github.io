calm and we have the tmobile mytouch 4g
slide here or a nun box in a minute this
is supposed to be the smart phone with
the best camera so best camera phone I'm
pretty excited about that cuz I'm a
photographer but I'm also a little
skeptical since I've also got the note
kna so we will have fun looking at that
but right now we're going to do the
unboxing so first after we have our box
it's very similar to a lot of the other
t-mobile smartphone boxes that's what
tape here to open that that one's
already done okay I don't have to cut it
and here we go there's the device we
have a little android robot in the box
there and this will come out I suppose
come on and here's the device sliding
keyboard we will check that out later
that's what we got in here
so we have shiny little icons you can
see those looks like the mostly camera
related things and your little android
robot and we have our documentation is
in kind of a lot right there start good
warranty that's it that's all you get
all right and well so we have just a
micro USB cable and a USB charger that's
all we get no headphones or cases or
anything like that probably should have
read the box first so what does this
device have 4g dual-core 1.2 gigahertz
processor HD video recording at 1080p
which is brigid front-facing camera
genius button for voice commands a
megapixel camera the dual LED flash
autofocus all this camera stuff low
shutter lag face detection that's pretty
cool this is micro SD memory card but
doesn't say how much so there we are
okay we're going to take a closer look
at this later but let's just do some
little size comparisons so there's the
nokia n8
the mytouch 4g slide is of course can be
a thicker than other phones that don't
have a keyboard here's another android
device on t-mobile this is the samsung
galaxy s 4g you can see a difference in
the screen there this one's a lot black
art and of course thickness and here's
an eighteen t device when the newest
ones this is the infuse 4g with a
humongous screen but it's also very thin
and how about the dell venue pro this
one also has a slideout keyboard so we
have a pretty similar thickness there
alright so that's it for our unboxing
stay tuned for more we're going to take
a look at this camera and that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
