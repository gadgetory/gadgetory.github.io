Pacquiao calm and we have the t-mobile
mytouch 4G slide here we're gonna unbox
in a minute this is supposed to be the
smartphone with the best camera so best
camera phone I'm pretty excited about
that cuz I'm a photographer but I'm also
a little skeptical since I've also got
the Nokia n8
so we will have fun looking at that but
right now we're gonna do the unboxing so
first after we have our unbox it's very
similar to a lot of the other t-mobile
smartphone boxes well that's with tape
here to open that that one's already
done ok I don't have to cut it and here
we go there's the device we have a
little Android robot in the box there
and this will come out I suppose
come on and here's the device sliding
keyboard we will check that out later
that's what we got here
so if shine
little icons can see those it looks like
mostly camera related things and your
little Android robot and we have our
documentation isn't kind of a lot right
there start good warranty that's it
that's all you get all right and well so
we have just a micro USB cable and a USB
charger that's all we can no headphones
or cases or anything like that probably
should have read the Box first so what
does this device have 4G dual-core 1.2
gigahertz processor HD video recording
at 1080p which is brigid front-facing
camera a genius button for voice
commands a megapixel camera the dual LED
flash autofocus all this camera stuff
low shutter lag face detection that's
pretty cool this is micro SD memory card
but it doesn't say how much so there we
are okay we're going to take a closer
look at this later but let's just do
some little concise comparisons there's
the Nokia n8
the mytouch 4G slide is of course can be
a thicker than other phones that don't
have a keyboard
here's another Android device on
t-mobile this is the Samsung Galaxy S 4G
you can see a difference in the screen
there this one's a lot blacker and of
course thickness and here's an 18 t
device one of the newest ones this is
the Infuse 4G with a humongous screen
but it's also very thin and how about
the Dell Venue Pro this one also has a
slide-out keyboard so we have a pretty
similar thickness there
all right so that's it for our unboxing
stay tuned for more we're going to take
a look at this camera and that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
