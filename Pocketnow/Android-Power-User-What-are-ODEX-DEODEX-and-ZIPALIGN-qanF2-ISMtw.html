we hear quite a bit when we're talking
about custom roms some argue that one is
better than the other while others argue
the opposite what are they well they
mean why do we have them and which one
really is better that's what we're going
to find out on today's episode of the
Android power user Android apps are
essentially stored in dot apk files and
most of the time we consider those just
standalone files and a lot of times they
are sometimes they're not some people
also think that a dot apk is an
installer file a little confusing there
isn't it
but for the purpose of this video a PK's
are essentially android packages plain
and simple okay so let's move right
along we talked about how android apps
are not precompiled they're not really
raw code there's some other bits to it
but they're not compiled in the
traditional sense of the word and not
all of it for example some of the app
the most common bits and pieces to the
app are pre optimized not necessarily
compiled but optimized and I'll give you
a hint that's where the Oh from ode X
comes into play okay so what we do is we
go through and we we pre optimize our
apps so that they can be run and by we I
mean developers and and the system
itself end-users don't worry all this is
done for you you don't have to worry
about it
but it's pre optimized for you so that
the bits and pieces that you're going to
be using are already there they're
already super fast and while they're
running the rest of the stuff compiles
and executes in the background lots and
lots of advantages again go back to
those last couple episodes so you can
see what they are now if we didn't do
this pre optimization things might be a
little bit slow they're not and I'll
tell you why because there's other
things that account for that but what we
do is we optimize these files and that's
what an ode X is so dot ode X is a file
extension
it stands for optimized dalvik
executable and this is it's a compressed
file it's very much like an exe in
Windows except it's not truly
precompiled like an exe and windows is
it's just pre optimized now if you try
and open up an ode X file you're not
going to be able to read much because
the optimization renders it looking
something very executable like or
compiled like so the advantage to it is
it saves space okay it's it's optimized
it's compressed and it occupies less
disk space that's great means you can
fit more apps on there it's also pretty
optimized so that it runs faster it has
all the bits that are needed to
bootstrap that application and get it up
and running while that's doing its thing
then other things that you need can be
pre-loaded as you need them or just
before you need them which is an
intelligence thing inside Android itself
or inside the dalvik itself so the
downside to Oh Dex files it's a separate
file it's physically separate from the
dot apk and the bits are not in the apk
if they're in the Oh Dex why do we care
well if you want to go in and make a
change say you've got a file an app that
checks to see what phone you're using to
make sure it's on the compatible list
and it does that inside the apk itself
or inside the app itself if you've got a
do Dex or excuse me if you've got a an o
Dex file that setting is probably held
inside that o Dex and you can't get at
it you can't get to it so you need to be
able to do Dex that file D optimize it
so that you can get at that setting so
you can change it to just ignore it I
know it works on my phone and
everything's fine or if you want to swap
out images inside the app say you want
to theme it you want a dark theme you
want a green theme you want a pink theme
you want to be able to theme that app
and switch out images switching images
is relatively easy but not if they're
stored inside and Oh Dex okay so let's
talk about do Dex most of the time when
you hear the term
Oh Dex it's in the context of a custom
ROM and robbers all over the place will
say mine's a do Dex ROM yeah okay that's
just fancy talk and say good that means
I can do whatever I want with it and
it's a custom ROM so I should I should
be able to do that custom roms should be
do text plain and simple if they're not
no big worry but generally speaking
custom ROM do Dex one implies the other
so we've talked a Dex we've talked do
Dex what about zip align does it have
anything to do with this no not really
oh you want to know what it is anyway
all right we can go ahead and do that so
let me review straight from
developer.android.com
is bear with me just a minute
so zip aligning make sure that all of an
app's
uncompressed data starts at a particular
alignment relative to the start of the
file all right I had to go back and read
that because this is like the third take
I'm trying to get that just right
essentially there's a lot of technical
reasoning behind why they do this it
basically puts everything that needs to
be aligned in a certain order in a
certain place it has to do with arrays
and M maps and all kinds of stuff I'll
let you go out and read the article
about it at developer.android.com there
is a link in this article so make sure
you head over to pocketnow.com and watch
this you'll have the link right there to
that article so you can read all about
it
essentially what ziplining does is it
allows the app to take up less space in
memory by putting everything all nice
together in alignment it has to do with
memory architecture and and bit
alignment and all kinds of stuff that
we're just not going to get into but
before you release a custom app
developers I'm talking to you make sure
you zip align it so that it takes up
less space and it runs more efficiently
and just works better with all its
neighbors okay for all of you end users
don't really worry about it now you know
kind of what it is and what it does and
if you want to sound smart you can
always
ask that guy who's writing an app via
zip-lined that and if he comes back oh
yeah absolutely done that soon great
it'll make you sound smart fair enough
do Dex Oh Dex ziplining there are all
things that help Android apps work
better faster and do all kinds of cool
stuff and now you know a little bit more
about how and why they do that if you
like learning about this stuff and you
like the Android power user make sure
you give the video a big thumbs up by
clicking the thumbs up button down below
that helps share the video with your
friends if you haven't yet subscribed
make sure you do that we'll have a link
at the end of the video that way you'll
get the next episodes that are coming
along with the other cool stuff that
we're talking about at pocketnow.com if
you want to go back and watch the other
stuff in the android power user series
I'll have a link for you there as well
last but not least please any comments
that you have any discussion that you
want to add clarifications real-world
examples if you're not watching this
video at pocketnow.com already please do
that head over to would there's the link
the article at PocketNow leave the
comments over there that's where we're
going to try and keep the conversation
so we don't have a conversation there
and at YouTube as well that makes sense
it'd be great I'd appreciate it thanks
so much so you're a little bit smarter
today congratulations we'll be working
on getting that Android power user
diploma out to you by the end of the
week we don't have those but if we did
we would for pocket now the Android
power user I'm Joe Levi thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
