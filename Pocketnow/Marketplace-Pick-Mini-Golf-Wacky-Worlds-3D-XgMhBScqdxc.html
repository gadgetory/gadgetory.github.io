Pocono calm and today I'm going to show
you new game called mini golf wacky
world's 3d okay so the first thing we'll
actually do is to go into our profile
and now we can either go into our Pro
Shop characters or achievements I'm
going to go into characters and it gives
you a couple of characters and after you
unlock certain levels as you can see i
have four hundred ten points up here
after playing a little bit so after you
have a certain number of points let's
say 2500 here you can actually unlock
these other characters so i'm just going
to pick chip and select and i'm just
going to go back back again and now we
can start a new game so this is just a
disclaimer saying that my previous game
will be lost I'm hit yes okay so now i
can pick from three different playing
styles so if i want t up i can choose
here timed golf or go for golf so i'm
just going to pick tee off and now i
have three separate worlds i can choose
right now I only have Tiki links that's
unlocked so I'm going to go to that one
okay so when i get to the level it will
actually show me a little video about
the geography of the specific hole so as
you can see will go through the hole and
we can navigate through the each putting
course and at any time I can hit pause
and I can go back if I want to review it
or I can go fast forward and just play
it and here's where i can select how I
want my player to be positioned so I can
either move him right or left and if I
have selected the correct position I
like him I can hit this check mark and
now I can either move him to the right
or left again and now i can select my
strength meter so if i wanted to hit it
very hard i can do that can also go to a
video I'll show you that in just a
second so we're and hit this ball
okay so that was pretty good i'm going
to turn down the strength a little bit
he looks pretty dead set on there so
when hit the club again and holland to
so not too bad actually got a birdie on
that level so it will just continue on
so once again it will actually show me
the level that i'm going to go through
and i'm just going to pause this and
fast-forward i can click here and it
will actually show me this little gopher
guy and he's going to help me change the
position of the camera he says there are
four positions so i can also change the
positions of the camera by clicking on
the camera so i hope i want to see more
upper view i can do that or more of a
close view I can also do that so I'm
just going to click the checkmark here
and increase my strength up so that one
went out of bounds okay I'm just going
to pause the game so now if I have
earned a certain number of points I can
actually go to the Pro Shop and choose
different putters unfortunately i only
have 440 points so i can't pick any of
these other putters on here as you can
see most the most expensive one it looks
as though it's 5,000 points so we'll go
back i can also go into some of the
settings i can either turn the sound or
on or sound off I can get help
information which this little gopher guy
will also give you help information
throughout the game as you first play so
I can go to help if I like so I can
lucky controls rules points and about
information and this is another
marketplace pick review and the game is
called mini golf wacky worlds and you
can find that on windows mobile
marketplace for six dollars and
ninety-nine cents thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
