draw is a free game built on the Android
Market that will test your reaction time
by using your accelerometer on your
Android device to go through these
various holes and these levels so as you
can see we burn stars by bouncing
through two or more holes at one time so
there I just earned a whole bunch of
stars and beep and the game becomes
increasingly more and more challenging
as you progress and the levels start to
go a little bit faster and there I've
ended up going too slow and then I go to
my final Scorpio reader is a free
application available in the Android
Market what this app does is it reads to
you historical places when you travel on
a trip so you just plug your phone in of
course to a car charger and hit start
trip and when you reach one of these
destinations it will reach you what it

places I can click on here and view more
information of Showtime's it's a free

mark the artist begins to eat all these
other fish that are smaller than us
while avoiding the fish that are
currently in a red state so as you can
see they're currently heavy at red aura
around them so I want to avoid those
until the red turns off and then we want
to eat them as well so you're going
and eat them if we're large enough so we
want to collect all these coins and
we've collected enough coins and
increased our size we can go past this
levels and now we can go on to the next
level
paper camera is a paper application
available on android market allows you
to turn your photos into a sort of
graphic style so here you can create a
new photo by just taking a picture of
this right here it'll begin rendering
into a photographic and we can change
the contrast if you like render other
things like clicking down here and
choose one of our other photos that
we've already captured and it turns this
photo into a sketch and we can just move
across here to change it to some other
effect so I kind of like that one so I
can just click on the Save button and
we'll see so this has been another
episode of the Android application
