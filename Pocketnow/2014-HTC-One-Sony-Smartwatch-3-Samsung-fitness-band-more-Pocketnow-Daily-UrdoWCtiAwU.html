though not the real thing sunny seems to
want to give another step at
smartwatches for the third time and
Samsung is also looking into making
their own Fitness band yeah I'm hi Mary
betta and don't mommy what I did for
Christmas cos all want to do is go back
this is out daily as expected a
day after Christmas it's a very slow day
in the news department that there are a
ton of rumors first of all remember all
that talk about Samson working on pro
devices and light devices well as it
turns out their first device will
apparently be listen to this the samsung
galaxy note 12.2 pro which apparently we
are getting at CES even though i don't
know how the CEO is going to pronounce
that full name without forgetting it
that's going to be their next future
note device we just don't know exactly
what's going to make this tablet app
rode the bike so stay tuned we'll be at
CES covering everything now another
launch that we're waiting for CES 2014
is Samsung's first fitness band because
apparently they didn't have enough with
the galaxy gear in their own heart rate
monitor probably the company is also
working on building their own band we
just don't know exactly what to expect
from it with the Nike FuelBand already
being in the market and almost every
other company also doing the same thing
and charging crazy amounts of money for
me one hundred fifty dollars for a Nike
Fuel band is stupid when I could pay the
same amount of money for a pebble but
let's see what Samson plans to bring to
the table hopefully they do something
good about it though I don't expect it
to and yeah we're going to talk a little
more about Samson but I promise that
it'll be over here so we forgot some
more reports on Tizen and these are
really interesting as we still don't
know what to expect from this platform
we don't know that Samsung is planning
to ditch android / Tizen but as it turns
out we've got some reports from the FCC
that the device that will run ties in
first there's a 720p resolution display
on a 4.7 25 inch display which doesn't
really sound like a high-end phone to us
when we're expecting 2k displays on the
galaxy s5 so it does seem that tyson is
going to be a side project the question
is what for and speaking of the FCC
another device that just landed there a
Sony's third SmartWatch and yeah they do
have two other smartwatches before the
problem next one that's coming even
though they haven't been really famous
and yeah they even own the name Sony
SmartWatch but we don't really know what
to expect other than the fact that it's
got bluetooth capabilities duh and the
fact that it's got enough scene which we
also got on the second smartwatch and it
didn't make a dent sadly so we don't
know how Sony's planning to
differentiate this product and we'll
probably see it at mwc we'll keep you
posted and finally for the hot news of
the day we get the first official leak
of the HTC One 2014 or two or whatever
they're going to call that thing but
this is really interesting because by
this time last year we had so many
leagues of the HTC One that we knew what
to expect and the year before we had so
many leaks of the HTC One X that we knew
what to expect so all we get right now
is actually a 3d print mock-up of what
to expect on the design and we don't
really know what to expect either than
the fact that it looks almost identical
to the current HTC One I would actually
call the old or actual HTC One a better
looking phone than what I'm seeing in
this market but anyways that leads me to
the question of the day what would be
your wish list to come in this future
HTC One what would you want because in
my particular case if HTC told me that
they're keeping the current design of
the HTC One and just giving me a better
camera and a Snapdragon 800 processor I
would want that phone immediately leave
us a comment down below what would you
prefer and friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video's filmer tree follow us on
 out comment subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well you can also
