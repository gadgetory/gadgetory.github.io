line and it screams iPad all over it
Apple's iPad three to launch in just a
couple of weeks and Apple will now
require your permission for apps taxes
your address book
finally all the some more coming up
right now hello everyone I'm hi metadata
and welcome to the pocket narrow I
review the show we go through all the
sweets cool and the not so cool these
have the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off with a cool
okay so our biggest focus is not the Mac
and neither is it Mac OS 10 but hey
Apple's recent announcement of O's 10
Mountain whines screams iPad an iPhone
with iOS 5 all over it you get
notification center Game Center you get
iMessage you get reminders you get just
about everything that Apple brought to
the table with iOS 5 and well it seems
that Apple is out to make the Mac's look
like the iPad in a way well we currently
have an iPad and you need to have some
hardcore computing well you can just buy
a Mac and have the same user interface
you're already used to kind of mech
makes sense now if you think about it
iMessage alone as compelling enough I
mean you can pretty much text your
buddies and their iPhones from your Mac
from your full keyboard so it's
currently on a beta you get downloaded
from the Apple website and well if
you're a developer you get the full Mac
os10 mountain lion to test that's a beta
and well see what you think about it and
while speaking of the iPad we recently
got some more leaks of what the device
might look like it looks exactly like
the iPad 2 but apparently internals will
change definitely first of all the
camera seems to be a little moved
you also notice that the casing is a
little thicker and well apparently it
has more space for a battery so what
could you need more battery a movement
of the camera and the thicker casing it
could probably be just an LTE iPad or
probably just more resolution on the
screen hopefully lots of things are
coming for the next generation iPad and
well we just hope that that makes our
table soon can't wait
speaking of the iPad 3 we got two
additional rumors first of all one is
when the device will be released rumors
have it that it'll probably happen
within the first week of March or the
second March 4 or March 7 or 6 somewhere
around there last year it happened on
March 2nd and before that it happened by
the end of January so rumors do hold
water now what can we expect by this
netting generation iPad rumors have it
as we mentioned earlier that we will be
getting LTE and hopefully we will be
getting a high-resolution display though
I'm not really sure what to make of it
because remember LT is not really that
big yet and it's not really doing well
with battery life so imagine if we do
get that quad-core processor that other
people have been talking about more
resolution and LTE I don't think the
battery life will ever make it to 10
hours but let's see what Apple brings to
the table now other rumors have it that
Apple will probably bring a seven-inch
iPad but I won't hold my breath for that
one
iOS 5.1 pre gold master Candidate
apparently got leaked recently and well
we've got well let's call it like two
different probably significant news here
first of all you currently have to
double tap the home button on your
iPhone and you get the camera icon to be
able to take a picture from the
lockscreen now the difference now will
be that instead of hitting the button
you can just swipe up and it'll unlock
the phone and give you the camera Wow
and while the second one out there
apparently seems to be that Siri will
now speak Japanese and I'm still waiting
for it to speak espa√±ol I mean whatever
that could happen but still Japanese is
coming and then what's happening next I
mean are we going by population X would
be shy what Chinese
okay so that does it for the coolest
continue on with the not so cool if you
remember there's been a recent scandal
about the fact that well applications
have been able to not only pull your
address book from your phone but also
store it and do whatever they want with
it pretty much not really sure what
they're doing but Apple apparently is
now gonna make changes finally to ask
you whether you want to share your
address book or not wonder what took
them so long and well other rumors have
it that even Google is being able to
track certain things that you do with
your browser not really cool what's
happening with privacy let's hope that
Apple takes that seriously whenever they
come out with the next iOS 5.1 and just
make the changes because well I don't
really like my address book to be shared
mm hey after so many class-action
lawsuits over antenna gates guess what
the lawsuits wand
Apple is entitled to pay you owners of
iPhone fours apparently either fifteen
bucks or give you a bumper
if you don't didn't already get one last
year and that was pretty much it that
was a change
you only get either a bumper or 15 bucks
there's even a website out there that's
WWWF own for settlement com that's
supposed to go live for you to claim
your bumper or your 15 bucks but it's
kind of lame I mean a lot of people even
me had a lot of problems with dropped
calls with the iPhone 4 and hey we were
expecting probably something else in
just fifteen bucks that's it for today's
show thank you very much for watching
I'm home every veteran were to give us a
thumbs up if you like what you saw
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
