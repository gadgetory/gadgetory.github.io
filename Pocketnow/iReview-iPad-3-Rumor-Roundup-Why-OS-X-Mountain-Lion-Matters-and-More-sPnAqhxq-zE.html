line and it screams iPad all over it
apple's ipad 32 launched in just a
couple of weeks and I but will now
require your permission for apps to
access your address book finally all the
sim more coming up right now hello
everyone I'm hi Mary that I and welcome
to the pocket narrow I review the show
we go through all the sweet school and
the not so cold inside the world of
Apple's iOS devices let's start this
week off with a cool ok so our biggest
focus is not the mac and neither is it
Mac OS 10 but hey apples recent
announcement of those 10 mountain line
screams ipad and iphone with iOS 5 all
over it you get notification center game
center you get i message you get
reminders you get just about everything
that Apple brought to the table with iOS
5 and well it seems that Apple's out to
make the max look like the iPad in a way
well you currently have an iPad and you
need to have some hardcore computing
well you can just buy a mac and have the
same user interface you're already used
to kind of make makes sense now if you
think about it I message a loan as
compelling enough I mean you can pretty
much text your buddies and their iPhones
from your Mac from your full keyboard so
it's currently on a beta you get
downloaded from the apple website and
well if you're a developer you get the
full Mac os10 mountain lion to test
that's a beta and well see what you
think about it and while speaking of the
iPad we recently got some more leaks of
what the device might look like it looks
exactly like the ipad 2 but apparently
internals will change definitely first
of all the camera seems to be a little
moved you also notice that the casing is
a little thicker and well apparently it
has more space for a battery so what do
you need more battery a movement of the
camera and the thicker casing it could
probably be just an LTE iPad or probably
just more resolution on the screen
hopefully lots of things are coming for
the next generation iPad and well we
just hope that that makes our table soon
can't wait
speaking of the ipad 3 we got two
additional rumors first of all one is
when the device will be released rumors
have it that it will probably happen
within the first week of March or the
second March for or march seven or six
somewhere around there last year it
happened on March second and before that
it happened by the end of january so
rumors do hold water now what can we
expect by this netting generation iPad
rumors have it as we mentioned earlier
that we will be getting LTE and
hopefully we will be getting a high
resolution display though I'm not really
sure what to make of it because remember
LT is not really that big yet and it's
not really doing well with battery life
so imagine if we do get that quad core
processor that other people have been
talking about more resolution and LTE I
don't think the battery life will ever
make it a 10 hours but let's see what
Apple bring to the table now other
rumors have it that apple will probably
bring a 7 inch iPad but I won't hold my
breath for that one Iowa's 5.13 gold
master candidate apparently got leaked
recently and well we've got well let's
call it like two different probably
significant news here first of all you
currently have to double tap the home
button on your iPhone and you get the
camera icon to be able to take a picture
from the lock screen now the difference
now will be that instead of hitting the
button you can just swipe up and it'll
unlock the phone and give you the camera
Wow and while the second one out there
apparently seems to be that Siri will
now speak Japanese and I'm still waiting
for it to speak espanol I mean whatever
that could happen but still Japanese is
coming and then what's happening next I
mean are we going by population x would
be shy what Chinese
okay so that does it for the coolest
continue on with the not so cool if you
remember there's been a recent scandal
about the fact that well applications
have been able to not only pull your
address book from your phone but also
store it and do whatever they want with
it pretty much not really sure what
they're doing but Apple apparently is
now going to make changes finally to ask
you whether you want to share your
address book or not wonder what took
them so long and well the rumors have it
that even Google's being able to track
certain things that you do with your
browser I'm really cool what's happening
with privacy let's hope that Apple takes
that seriously whenever they come out
with the next iOS 5.1 and just make the
changes because well I don't really like
my address book to be shared and hey
after so many class-action lawsuits over
antennagate guess what the lawsuits wand
Apple is entitled to pay you owners of
iphone fours apparently either 15 bucks
or give you a bumper if you don't didn't
already get one last year and that was
pretty much it that was the change you
only get either a bumper or 15 bucks
there's even a website out there that's
ww iphone for settlement com that's
supposed to go live for you to claim
your bumper or your 15 bucks but it's
kind of lame I mean a lot of people even
me had a lot of problems with dropped
calls with the iphone 4 and hey we were
expecting probably something else in
just 15 bucks that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm
home every veteran were to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
