dag yo I just need a bigger phone no not
like iPhone or pixel big nope v20 or
mate nine big just isn't big enough
I need something proper large well
Lenovo might just have the right device
for you
okay we're messing around a little we
all know the fab 2 Pro is being released
as a first generation platform to show
off Google's tango augmented reality but
this phone exists and if you were to
spend $500 to pick one up what kind of
experience would you be in store for
first up for you specs junkies pause the
video now to see what this beast is
packin and with that out of the way this
is the biggest phone I've ever been
tasked with reviewing there's a
hypothesis that mini tablet sales have
been negatively affected by the rise of
larger screen phones the fab 2 would
support that idea as I never want to
haul around this phone and a tablet this
is a substantial gadget no pretense here
no pretending that thinness matters it's
big and it embraces that size and
thickness having played with numerous
yoga tablets and convertibles the fab
definitely has that Lenovo vibe it's a
straight forward look clean professional
lines chamfered edges make an attempt at
delivering some style but largely the
form of this phone closely follows the
function the six point four inch display
is crisp and detailed thanks to that
quad HD resolution though we do wish it
were brighter our battery test is run at
190 lux and this phone seems to top out
somewhere around 350 some of these AR
apps could definitely benefit from an
easier to read screen while outside the
fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate
enough but even in our weeks of using it
the placement on this phone still feels
low that you really need to bend that
finger to unlock the phone and where
your digit would normally land is
exactly where a camera sensor lives we'd
also be remiss if we didn't mention the
lack of NFC no tap in pair no tap and
pay certainly a frustrating omission for
any phone especially at this price point
moving over to software we're happy
lenovo has recently found something of a
balance between customizing the UI for
china and appealing to a more Western
audience this phone now much more
closely resembles stock Android and
organizational elements like
the AppStore have returned there's
almost no bloat here with only a few
lenovo services pre-installed the fab
comes with a mid-range processor
specifically the Qualcomm 650 - we
wouldn't be too concerned about this
chipset it still runs a touch on the
warm side but manages to deliver better
performance benchmarking than last
year's flagship processors and lenovo
seems to have optimized this hardware
well it posts numbers just nipping at
the heels of some phones using more
powerful hardware we have been a little
concerned with a handful of software
gremlins though some apps forced closing
and the odd Android service barking but
they've thankfully been minor
inconveniences and hopefully Lenovo can
patch them in a future update this
company doesn't have much of a
relationship with phone consumers in
North America so it's an opportunity to
show us what they can do with updates
and support Wi-Fi reception is adequate
but the fab falls behind many other
metal backed phones like the mayn't 9 in
the V 20 likewise cellular reception
often landed a couple decibels behind
those speed tests in my neighborhood on
AT&amp;amp;T were about average for downloading
surprisingly the fam was a bit faster at
uploading over LTE than many of our
recently reviewed devices listening to
speaker and headphone output for all
this space speaker performance is about
average for a bottom firing mono speaker
it's not bad it's not great it'll get
the job done for most folks likewise the
headphone situation is mostly functional
lenovo is partnered with Dolby to
provide processing tweaks we can't find
a way to properly disable that so all
audio has at least a little EQ adjusting
going on quality numbers land this phone
near the bottom of our review pack right
alongside the LG g5 in the huawei mate 9
but thankfully lenovo included a
slightly beefier amp just barely edging
out the galaxy s7 for volume moving to
the camera this shooter is also
no-frills you get respectable 16
megapixel images with the requisite HDR
mode and a handful of seeing modes
though HDR shots take a while to capture
and even in reasonably lit indoor
situations it can be a challenge to pull
off a crisp shot for you motion blur
video is capped at 1080p and
frustratingly there doesn't seem to be
any way to control focus the fab shoots
truly full-auto it's pretty clear this
phone
wasn't built around the notion of
multimedia creation and this is the main
feature we'd be worried might be a deal
breaker for folks in our audience now a
4050 milliamp hour battery sounded
impressive until we played with another
phone that also packed a 4000 milliamp
hour capacity in a smaller overall
footprint the extra battery here largely
compensates for the additional screen
size running our media tests streaming
30 minutes of HD video over Wi-Fi at 190
Lux the fab drained 5 percent which is
upper mid pack runtime for a modern
Android handset when used primarily as a
phone we get great daily use easily
lasting past dinner time but that
actually wasn't very common a tango
hardware and apps will drain that
battery a lot quicker recharge rates are
very good considering the battery size
30 minutes on the included charger
resulted in a 44 percent recharge you'll
get plenty of runtime after a quick top
off and lastly we should probably talk
about tango augmented reality has the
potential to affect nearly every service
we might run from our phones the initial
batch of apps we've played with are all
very promising but we're still in early
days yet what's nice about a r / virtual
reality it's a lot easier to share the
experience with other people where
daydream needs to be experienced one
person at a time wearing something on
your face that blocks out the rest of
the world
tango can be viewed side by side showing
someone this Domino app letting them
play only requires me to pass the phone
over and I can still guide or share in
that experience as they play it's still
incredibly raw think the early days of
cardboard but the fact that we're
already seeing productivity solutions
and not just games is encouraging we
were asked by numerous folks in our
hands-on video how accurate this
hardware was at measuring distance and
we're happy to report it's pretty close
usually within a 1/2 inch of a proper
tape measure we wouldn't rely on it just
yet to do precision work but it's
significantly faster at getting the
general proportions of a room right to
drop-in furniture on a personal note it
was a funny realization though that I
didn't have to hold still while scanning
we're just so used to that sensitivity
or shooting panorama photos you can walk
around drop markers get up close
tango does the gig well and in a much
more casual way than previous solutions
so let's wrap this up where's
that leave us with the Lenovo fab 2 pro
when judged on the merits of being a
mini tablet phone
Lenovo's offering delivers a reasonable
bang for buck in the United States what
would we compare it against we can't
imagine the market is huge but if you
want a 6 inch plus screen in a device
which feels like a premium handset
you're not going to be satisfied by
pixels and iPhone pluses a $500 is an
impulse by territory but the screen size
alone somewhat warrants the higher cost
over the various terrific $400 phones be
reviewed this year though it's a shame
that it's lacking NFC and that the
camera game is so weak it's not an
exciting phone at $500 but there's
enough here to justify the cost as it
stands most people would be safer
considering this a companion device like
a mini tablet to another phone then you
add tango to the mix and the story
shifts a little bit now at $500 you're
buying something unique literally no
other phone has this it's rare that we
find something truly new in the mobile
market augmented reality is rad but to
be fair it always makes us a bit nervous
recommending a phone built around one
specific feature you are also buying
into the promise of future services to
come and that's the cost of doing
business on the bleeding edge Google
might walk away from this tomorrow but
we don't think they will at least we
hope they don't as always thanks so much
