pocket now calm the iphone 5 is here and
in this video we're going to unbox it
then I'm going to give you some first
impressions let's go ok let's get
started here I haven't opened this yet
as you can see kind of wanted to capture
some some first impressions on cameras
we like to do with unboxings i think i'm
boxing's are still pretty cool
don't you alright so here it is bigger
box than before with the iPhone 4s
obviously because it's taller in fact
the amount of tallness here is probably
in proportion to how much taller the
screen is on the iPhone 5 about 0.5
inches all right so let's take the razor
blade but be gentle here iPhone 5 and
technically this is the sixth iPhone
right because there was the original
iPhone then the 3G 3GS four for us this
is the sixth iPhone but they're calling
it the iPhone 5 because there wasn't an
iPhone 5 before it ok let's take a look
so a lot of the review so far on the
internet have been up the black one and
this is the white one and it's different
it doesn't have the sort of darkened
metal texture so let me take this out of
the box here oh my goodness it is
extremely light it's not as thin as I
thought it was going to be it's
carefully remove these things it it
feels Hollow it truly feels hollow
inside and I really want to take a close
look at this metal here because I was
hoping that it would deter fingerprints
and I'm going to try to fingerprint it
up and it's resisting it very very well
this is a beautiful beautiful device
look at how the edges kind of shine very
nice I can't believe there's an iPhone
in here and I really mean that this
thing is so incredibly light it's
ridiculous and let's see if my thumb can
reach the upper corner of the screen
yeah I mean what's going to happen is
with one-handed usability you're going
to hold this a little higher up versus
the iPhone 4s where you're kind of at
the bottom near the home button
you could go up there with the iPhone 5
you're going to kind of shimmy up a
little bit just because you're going to
want to weight it evenly in your hand
anyhow let's put that aside I'll take a
look at these earpods Apple kind of
doing something different sort of dica
monetizing the headphones I mean for
years and years and years everyone got
the exact same headphones with every
phone and Apple said wait a minute maybe
we can do something better so I wonder
how these are going to fit in my ear
because they look really weird anyway
we'll get back to that nice carrying
case though because these are kind of
chunky and clunky let's take a look at
the Thunderbolt wire and I want to
compare it to micro USB for a sec ok so
here we are very small it's a lot
smaller than it actually looks in
pictures I hopefully can get in focus
it's so small that the camera is having
trouble focusing on it let's look at it
next to micro USB it's literally the
same width and the cool thing about
Thunderbolt or lightning you know all
these you know storm names is that you
can insert this either way and that's a
big deal because with micro USB you got
to get it in the right way and you
always have to look at the phone at
least I do unless you have some sort of
some sort of texture on here to tell you
which way is the top so that's nice and
just for good measure kind of want to
plug it in just out of curiosity here
that snaps in nicely and it turns on
when you plug it in what do you know so
it's turning on it's going to ask me to
activate it for the first time let's
just compare it next to the iPhone 4s
and what they've done here is they've
essentially removed the back panel the v
has no back panel and they've thinned up
the front panel as you can see it's
about half or even a third or a quarter
of the thickness of that front piece of
glass I'm thrilled that there aren't two
pieces of glass on this because I
dropped my 4s my wife dropped her iPhone
and we keep cracking the backs and you
know you can get a nice thick case but I
don't really like to use a case I don't
want to have to worry about the back
getting cracked so we're going to set
this up and I'll be right back
okay so let's talk about some early
first impressions I've been using this
for about thirty minutes
got all of my data restored I've done a
little bit of comparison with the 4s I
just want to point out a few things
something kind of unfortunate actually
and look out if you're getting the
iPhone 5 for blemishes on the device
because you should take it back if you
look very closely right here there's a
little tiny nick taken out of this shiny
sort of polished edge not that big of a
deal but I just open this and it should
be perfect this is a definitely an
expensive foam so let's talk about the
screen Apple says this is the best
screen they've ever made and that it's
better than the iPhone 4s is it let me
show you so I'm gonna bring over the
iPhone for us over here and I want you
to look at the photos icon here okay
look at the color of the photos icon and
then look at it on the five I'd say it's
probably 25% higher in color saturation
which is nice it's very subtle and
you're probably not going to notice just
using the iPhone 5 day-to-day but if you
kind of compare the iPhone 4s with the
iPhone 5 side-by-side there's no doubt I
mean look at the blue in the facebook
icon it's a lot more blue over here it
kind of looks like in comparison like a
undersaturated
blue anyway we're going to do more
comparisons later something interesting
that I've seen is that I restored from a
backup and it installed literally 10
apps at one time whereas on the iPhone
4s
it only installs two apps at the most at
one time so maybe taking advantage of
that a 6 chip so this phone is fast I'm
going to take you on a little tour of
web browsing here just kind of give you
an idea of how fast this phone is things
just I mean the progress bar just
disappears so quickly let's go to the
full version of pocket now a obviously
is large and charger lot lots of images
lots of code let's watch the progress
bar up top done it's insanely fast let's
move around on the page it's nice to
have that extra vertical space in fact
just as a quick comparison we're going
to do the same thing here on the iPhone
4s let me just bring up pocket now real
quick kind of do a little bit of a speed
test here
so the advantage to the taller screen
you can see literally it's it's half
image it's not that much let's look at a
page at the all the way zoomed out view
so we can see down to this story down to
this story on the headline of this story
over here on the iPhone 4s we see down
to this story and just the headline in
first sentence of the next story so you
really get to see more on the screen at
one time which is fantastic
let's pinch-to-zoom see how long it
takes to clear up it clears up almost
instantly like did you see that there
wasn't even I couldn't even count how
long that took to clear up versus on the
iPhone 4s if we do the exact same thing
that's also pretty fast and there's an
annoying add getting in the way but it
just seems a lot faster on the iPhone 5
so let's move around on the page see
what's like let's go into landscape get
that full screen web browsing
performance what they just look
fantastic on this thing
it's just beautiful let's go into a
story today is iPhone day that's very
relevant isn't it something else I
should mentioned first impressions the
home button is stiffer and I don't
really like it that way because it makes
it slightly more difficult to DoubleTap
but really it's not that big of a deal
it probably means that I Apple has kind
of firmed up the mechanism because a lot
of people with the iPhone 4s and iPhone
4 have had problems with the home button
kind of breaking overtime some other
things I'm going to look at here
just look around the device we've got
these sort of drilled holes and this
seems to be a very common theme in
smartphone design we're seeing on HTC
phones we're seeing it on Samsung phones
it seems that these some of these these
smart companies these electronic
companies are getting excited by the
idea of drilling lots of little holes
and it's a nice touch
now going over to the back I put this
more so to the test and I can say that
this does not pick up fingerprints that
well the Apple logo yet because you get
that shiny metal II miss but you don't
really get fingerprints picking up on
the back which is a really nice touch
now up here at the top we've got the
white strip and if you get the white
unit you also get these white bars along
the side which look really
nice by the way and as mentioned if you
get the black version this silver
actually becomes kind of like a gunmetal
tinted black and some people are
complaining already that the black is
wearing off on these on these edges so
you might want to watch out for that
maybe Apple will refine the design
something I can tell you about these
edges is that they do actually pick up
fingerprints and I imagine that over
time the the sheen of them will wear off
a bit as you you know handle this thing
more and more something I did do is I
trimmed my micro SIM to the nano SIM
size and I made a video about it so if
you are running a prepaid plan or you're
buying this unlocked and you already
have a SIM card you don't want to use
the one that came with it which is very
tiny you can just cut it just like you
might have cut your SIM card down to a
micro sim as phones started to ship with
that smaller technology let's let's
launch the camera I'm really curious
about that because that's something that
always needs to be fast let's let's just
compare these two devices real quick
okay
iPhone 5 significantly faster and
launching camera that's always great to
see anyway we're gonna have so much more
on this if you want the best iPhone 5
coverage keep it to pocketnow.com we are
going to cover this from every single
angle we're extremely curious about this
device how it compares to everything out
there how it works in day-to-day testing
how battery life is and a lot lot more
keep it to pocketnow.com make sure you
subscribe to our Channel and of course
give us a thumbs up if you liked this
video and if you got an iPhone 5 let us
know what you think about it your first
impressions in the comments below thanks
