Ubuntu on smartphones in that time the
platform has gained compatibility with a
wider range of hardware picked up a few
interface improvements and spawned some
slick new features from the Ubuntu booth
at MWC i'm michael fisher with pocket
now let's go hands-on with Ubuntu for
phones I'm a sucker for new interfaces
so before I kick out about gesture
controls there are a few things you
should know about Ubuntu for phones the
so called apps you see on these demo
devices are mostly just wrappers for
mobile websites
well it's apparently pretty easy to code
native apps in Qt there's not really an
app ecosystem to speak up also while you
can install the OS on a wide range of
handsets we saw it running pretty well
in an ancient Nexus for only a handful
of phones currently offer it pre-loaded
out of the box
we used Ubuntu for phones on the best
hardware currently supported amazing pro
5 and while there were a few hiccups
here and there on this pre-release
software on the whole it was really
quite impressive
Ubuntu takes a different approach to the
homescreen with something called scopes
they're kind of like Google now meets
old-school Windows Mobile with the
today's scope displaying everything from
local weather to nearby restaurants to
missed calls when you want to get to
other apps you slide the launcher in
from the left side and though they are
if you want to shuffle between apps
you're already running in the background
you swipe in from the right and there
they are if you like the idea of Windows
continuum but don't so much like the
Windows bit pay attention if you're
using a phone with HDMI out you can plug
into an external monitor or TV and pair
it to a keyboard and mouse and poof
Ubuntu on the desktop and while
continuum is getting all the headlines
this is actually superior in a few ways
apps run in Windows instead of being
forced to fullscreen the browser can
manage multiple tabs without constantly
reloading and all apps installed on the
phone will run in desktop mode as well
not just a small subset of apps now
granted there aren't many apps to begin
with but still it's nice that you're not
limited
look Lubuntu four phones has been in the
works for a while and it's not likely to
catch fire anytime soon people aren't
exactly clamoring for a third mobile
platform and do I really want to
exchange all my third-party apps for web
wrappers course not but in many parts of
the world phones from Google Apple and
Microsoft just aren't feasible for one
reason or another
Ubuntu for phones could be a nice fit
for people in those regions while here
at home more and more folks are
complaining that there's nothing
exciting and smart phones anymore well
here it is we'll know how well it works
in the real world following a full
review coming soon for now we're just
happy that there's another option out
there there's still more to see from MWC
2016 in Barcelona so be sure to
subscribe here on YouTube and follow all
the breaking news at pocketnow.com till
next time this has been michael fisher
captain two phones on twitter thanks for
watching everyone
we'll see on the other side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
