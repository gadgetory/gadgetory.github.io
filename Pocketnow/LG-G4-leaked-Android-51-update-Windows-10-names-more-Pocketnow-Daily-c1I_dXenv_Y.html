emerging in photos you also get a new
version of android 5.1 launched but is
it really a new version and microsoft
couldn't make apps for its Windows 10
platform without making things confusing
I'm high memory that I and all I'm gonna
say is this tgif this is pocket out
daily brought to you by lynda.com the
official news today do with Microsoft is
the company doesn't only have the title
for the most ridiculous and longest
names and tech history but the company
plans to continue that way as it's
starting to make things confusing for
Windows users particularly in Windows 10
it's explaining to developers that if
they have applications that are
universal they are going to call these
windows applications and that they have
applications that are not universal
they're going to be called Windows
desktop applications and then we wonder
how they're going to handle the phone
apps we just wonder why they don't just
leave it as Windows universal apps but
that is much more understandable and
implicit but we'll see next up let's
talk about hcc as the company's lead
designer Jonah Becker has just announced
that he is stepping down after a year of
being on the job though he had been at
HTC for years and had replaced krill
after he also decided to leave a year
ago this is the lead designer behind the
1i mate and obviously the 19 and you
wonder exactly why is he leaving the
company just after Peter Chou is also
being moved from CEO to another position
we wonder what to expect from HTC's
design going forward since that is their
leading ticket now this will the
spotlight over to Google and
particularly Android five dot one dot o
underscore are three we don't know
exactly what the purpose of this update
is but the images are already at AOSP
you can download them for Nexus devices
and these could be bug fixes leave us a
comment down below if you've installed
them let us know what things have
changed now move the spotlight over to
LG as the company has already made their
LG watch urbane LT official and Korea
starting this week and if you want to
get some webOS love with LT capabilities
and just about everything that's already
baked just for Korea
you're going to have to pay for it as
the watch is going to retail for a crazy
six hundred dollars obviously after the
exchange rate six hundred dollars at a
time when the year s from Samsung is
costing 350 up really crazy we don't
know how that's going to perform let's
see if it ever makes it to the United
States webos watch and finally for the
hot news of the day when the most
anticipated bones of the year is the LG
g4 and we get the first leaked images of
the phone or at least we assume this is
the phone and yeah it looks a lot like
the LG G flex 2 without the curve and
that's really odd given the fact that
well LG launched a couple of a curved
phones at mwc that weren't flagships
like the g4 they don't have any
specifications all we have our images
that a little hump at the top we assume
is for a TV antenna which is common in
Korea you don't think that's a status i
lo but we could be wrong and it does
lead me to the question of the day links
in the description look at all the
photos of what we assume through the g4
and let us know if you want this phone
in the comments down below because in my
case I think I'll take the G flex 2 but
leave us a comment down below tell us
what you think folks if you've ever
wanted to become a pro and photography
