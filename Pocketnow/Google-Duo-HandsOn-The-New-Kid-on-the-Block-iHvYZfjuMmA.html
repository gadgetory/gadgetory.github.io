finally gone live and is one of the
simplest and sleekest ways we've seen to
reach out and touch someone
but is it maybe a little too simple
here's our first look at Google's duo I
still don't get the name as dual implies
two things like Batman and Robin but
this attempt at streamlining a video
call is largely a successful one after
installing the app the setup process
only involves allowing for different
permissions and verifying your phone
number now once in the app you have a
live stream from your selfie camera and
hitting the video call button is where
you enter in a contact or phone number
to initiate a call once in a call you
can mute your mic and toggle between
front and rear cameras unfortunately I
couldn't switch front cameras on my LG
v10 but who really expected that to work
and that's it this main application is
well handled sleek and fast and we get a
respectable video quality over Wi-Fi
some image degradation over LTE but I
was very happy with overall call quality
and for those of you who might be
wondering what the audio quality
actually sounds like doing a call over
Wi-Fi this is what it sounds like so
this is actually pulling audio from the
mics on the LG v10 and broadcasting over
the speaker on the galaxy s7 and it's
good enough I suppose so
I'm going to end this experiment now
because my other phone is in a
completely different room and I can't
even hear it to know what's going on if
there's a bummer here it's in how the
service is tied to your phone number and
locked to one device many people will
have a duo of phone say a personal phone
and a work device and duo will only say
active on one I thought I'd found a
loophole using my Google Voice number
which did activate and work for exactly
one call but after exiting the app it
deactivated one of the phones I had set
up so there you have it folks early days
yet for do own time will tell if this
level of simplicity will resonate with
consumers we can already anticipate some
issues in getting family to try this out
though you can FaceTime from a phone
tablet or computer duo not so much as it
requires an active sim and a real phone
number what do you think about duo so
far is this the killer app for video
calling drop
