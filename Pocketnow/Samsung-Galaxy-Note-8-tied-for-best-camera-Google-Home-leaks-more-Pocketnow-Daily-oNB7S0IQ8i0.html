declared as the best smartphone camera
along with the iPhone 8 plus google
products leaked just the day ahead from
the company's major event and Microsoft
debuts mixed reality along with a good
list of partners I'm Jaime Rivera and
dear Nintendo I'm waiting for the second
batch of SNES classics please
this is Parkin out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for an iPhone not necessarily
a new iPhone version Mobile has got some
very interesting deals that start with
$100 off last generation iPhones like
the iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus but then if
you keep going down the scale that deals
actually get better and better
sadly Beezer not available yet for the
iPhone 8 but they should only be a
matter of timing to learn more in the
description now let's talk about Samsung
and Microsoft as both companies have
just announced their collaboration for
Microsoft's mixed reality and that whole
headset that we saw a couple of days ago
is actually samsung's new hmd Odyssey
which is compatible with Microsoft makes
reality user interface now if you're
asking me exactly what the difference is
between mix reality and VR I don't know
I could just guess that it's Microsoft
Swift calling it but yeah we should
expect more developments over what this
whole platform will be in the time being
obviously devices like the viber
compatible with steam so it makes all
the sense in the world for Microsoft to
make its own take which we'll learn more
in the description as well now let's
move the spotlight over the leaks we are
just a day away from Google's major
announcement and we're expecting a ton
of things one of them being the Google
home Mini and well we've got leaked
images of the home from retail we got a
price tag 49 bucks and apparently
pre-orders will begin tomorrow as well
if you asked me 49 bucks for the speaker
should be compelling it's a great way to
compete against Amazon can't wait to see
the final product and speaking of Google
and products well we hear that the
company is working on its own made by
Google licensing scheme which is pretty
much the same thing that we know from
Apple we're made for iPod became May 4
iPhone where you know peripherals
accessories will be able to connect with
Google products and interactive ways
that's all fine and dandy and we love
the whole concept mainly because well
right now it's kind of a mess with how
USBC works depending on which om you're
using for example in the case of audio
summer passive some are active like in
the case of HTC so we can't wait for
this to happen we're just hoping that
this is not something exclusive to the
pixel we're hoping that made for Google
means well it will work with any Android
phone at least we hope and finally the
hottest news today have to do with the
XO mark and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
for those of you that didn't like the
fact that the iPhone 8 plus was declared
the best camera on a smartphone with 94
points the Galaxy Note 8 has just
garnered that same rating 94 points
meaning just like in the case of the
iPhone 8 plus you should expect amazing
photography from the Galaxy Note 8 which
is such an oddity because well the
Galaxy S 8 plus in the galaxy is it
pretty much have the same primary sensor
so it makes you wonder exactly what the
differences are here could be software I
do love life photos on the Galaxy Note 8
I feel it there far better than portrait
lighting on the case of the iPhone 8
plus but anyways it leads me to the
question today what do you think which
one would you pick do you think that the
Galaxy Note 8 or the iPhone 8 plus
should have the better smartphone
cameras in my case I would incline
myself to the Galaxy Note 8 but then
again we've got so many smartphones
coming up the iPhone 10 we've got the
Google pixels which had the crown for
the best smartphone cameras believe is a
