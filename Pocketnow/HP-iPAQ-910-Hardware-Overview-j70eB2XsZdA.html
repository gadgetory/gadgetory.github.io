one of the video review for the HP ipaq
900 series business messenger
we talked in the unboxing I have a 9 10
device here really nice i like the
chrome finishes on the side i like the
glossy finish up front in the rubberized
feel at the back the only problem is
it's a really nice fingerprint magnet
it's really hard to keep it clean so you
probably have to get used to that what
do we have here will we have a camera
button here on the side which tends to
be a bit uncomfortable because the
camera actually opens in landscape as
the screen is so you press it here and
then you have to press here on the
bottom you don't really hold it to the
side like a typical camera and press the
button on other devices we have an okay
pond here in a scroll wheel with a
pressing enter button which is really
neat really nice to feel on the right
side really comfortable interestingly
this I pack holds an external gps
antenna connector something really not
comment on nuke on windows mobile
devices which is it's okay we have a
reset button at the top non-conventional
but it's there we have a power button at
the top also we have a up and down keys
for volume and then we have a voice
commander button this is not voice
command it's not installed but you can
add it also if you want to we have a
flap here for external storage which is
good I like for it to be covered the
only thing i don't like about this flap
here is where you charge it here at the
bottom and you put your headphones if
you notice when you place the connector
in the flap will remain tilt it this way
which at some point in time I believe
will end up breaking probably after a
year of usage a bit uncomfortable don't
like that but you have to deal with its
hardware the microphone is here at the
bottom and then at the top we have LED
lights and we have the speaker here at
the top in the back we have a mirror
flash really nice and a three-point Oh
megapixel camera and the speaker here at
the back sound quality on the ipaq is as
other HP users have expected it's not
really that good obviously if you
compare it to your Q holding stereo
speakers don't expect it to be the best
as the cube but it's not really as good
as eyes I'd expect if i use my leather
cover which was not include at the bar
one if i use it i rarely hear the ipaq
ring so i have to actually leave it on
vibrate
ring and the speakerphone quality when
you talk is not really as good as I'd
expect but I do believe this is probably
a software issue that could be dealt
with another rom update we have a 2.4
inch screen here at the top and then we
have this really lovely cure the
keyboard here up front with sin and
calendar this would be the mail start
many okay and soft key buttons I like
the d-pad it really probably doesn't
look as nice as other devices but I like
the fact that it's not metallic finished
which is good because mostly other
devices would have the problem that this
would fade off with time and it would
leave the device looking really bad
interestingly we have this metallic
hinges here in the middle this would
probably just be design aspects just to
make the device look a bit more elegant
like the blackberry bold is somebody
mentioned in the form but I really do
consider them to be unnecessary and a
bit uncomfortable when you type on the
keyboard as I will probably show for
example we have one note mobile which is
included here if I try to type the quick
ouch brown fox jumps over the lazy dog I
would have preferred instead of these
metallic hinges probably a little bit of
separation between the keys if they're
not big enough I would have probably
enjoyed them to be separate but when I
press the keys I feel the metal and it
really makes the keyboard a bit
uncomfortable you have to get used to it
i would consider that probably after a
week of constant usage you would
probably get used to it and like it but
then again like i said it does bring a
little bit of elegance into the device
if it if that would be a point i do like
for example if you notice here on the
keyboard and I'm trying to focus here we
have a shift we have a symbol and then
we have a tap on which you're not really
the symbol in the tab button are not
really comment on other windows mobile
devices probably one thing I would ask
hardware manufacturers is guys please do
as a favor and try to keep the layout on
keyboards to be the same it's really a
to not have a backspace key on the q and
and have it here it's a good addition
but then we have the ship on on the
other side on the other device but then
this one has it here and it kind of
makes it uncomfortable to get used to
keyboard so try to keep a standard
layout if you will one of the things i
will like about this and i'm going to
try to turn this back on here on one
note is for example what's the point
about the symbol button it doesn't
really bring a symbol pad aside what it
does is for example if you're from latin
america and you want the special and we
use here you press the letter and as i
do here and then press a symbol pad and
you get the special end if you want a
registered trademark key you press the
are here and then press the symbol pad
and then you get the registered
trademark icon there which is really
nice one of the things i like is for
example if you press the function button
you'll notice that the SI p keyboard
here gives you an indicator and then if
i press the if i press the shift button
you do get another indicator which are
really nice additions and really let you
know where you're standing while you're
typing these are really really neat
additions here one of the things i have
noticed is that there aren't any options
if you go to settings and you try to
assign different keys to these you can
assign only one option as opposed to the
ipaq 100 and 200 series where you can
choose up to two different options for
the device how do you turn on and off
the device where you can use the key at
the top or you can also use the end key
and then one of the things that is
pretty nice is that if we go to settings
here and i'm going to i'm going to try
to show you something here we go two
buttons here and then we go to the lock
option we have a key lock option here
that ill enable you that every time that
you turn enable keyguard which is right
here so if i would turn the device off
and then turn it back on it would send
me to a keyguard that would ask me to
press the two soft keys on the side if i
want to release it from being locked
really nice probably one of the only
things i'm missing here is the stylist
pay at the bottom I love styluses to be
at the bottom probably the only thing
I've noticed is look at the size of this
thing it's really big
you actually don't even need for it to
be collapsible it's actually larger than
the HTC touch stylus but well it's a
glutton it's nice and it's really lovely
that you don't really have to be
extending it though it does extend
itself when you pull it out it's not
magnetic or anything but it's really
nice and then the bladder e flap is here
at the bottom and it's really
comfortable feels really good and it
does really give to this the device a
nice feel not heavy not too big it does
really heat up at some points in some
points in time when you charge it or
things these are really things that HP
has to consider with the roms so this is
pretty much it for the hardware aspects
of the device if you have any any
questions or any things you like for me
to go through let me know and we'll
continue on in the part 2 of the video
review for the HP ipaq 900 series for HP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
