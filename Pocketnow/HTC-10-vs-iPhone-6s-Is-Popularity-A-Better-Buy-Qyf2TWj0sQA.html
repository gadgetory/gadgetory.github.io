phones has existed since their inception
but choosing between the best of the
best has never been more complicated I'm
highly motivated with pocket now and
this is HTC 10 versus iPhone 6s it only
takes a few visits to any public area to
notice just how popular the iPhone is
Apple's marketing power is iconic and
its results can be seen in the wide
acceptance of most of its products the
story is very different for HTC the
company is known for pioneering the
first Android phone and also for its
design innovation but it's meagre
marketing has left its products with
little credit for it comparing these and
sales figures alone would have the
iPhone to stock the HTC 10 out but not
necessarily because it's a better
product on the positive front both
devices are at similar stages of
refinement for each company the iPhone
success has been in the market since
September 2015 and given the S after the
name this product is more boost in
features under a two-year old chassis
the HTC 10 launched in April 2016 its
design language began on last year's one
a9
but now the dramatic boost in features
over a concept that we all agree mimic
the iPhone both devices are made of very
strong aluminum and both include 2.5 the
glass on the surface the iPhone favors
more gentle curves all around giving it
a pebble-like feel whereas with the 10
the angular curves are less natural but
more eye-catching from a distance in the
hand the premium feel comes standard
thanks of the aluminum finish of both
devices where the ten would win this one
is mainly thanks to the IP 53 water and
does resistance where the iPhone doesn't
have any
the 10 is naturally more commanding
given at seven millimeters taller four
millimeters wider two millimeters
thicker and 18 grams heavier than the
iPhone that added body allows the tent
to house a larger 5.2 inch quad-hd
display compared to 4.7 inches at 750 P
with the iPhone the bonus is that the 10
offers an extra 300 40 pixels every inch
when compared to Apple's minimum Retina
display that doesn't limit either LCD
from being gorgeous but it's hard to
deny that the Super LCD 5 on the 10
seems crisper than the IPS panel on the
iPhone at first sight under each display
the differences are even stronger
HTC houses the cream of the crop and
Android specifications for 2016 with a
quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor 4
gigs of ram 32 gigs of expandable
storage via microSD the iPhone may seem
like a slouch on paper with its
dual-core a9 chip 2 gigs of ram and not
expandable storage options but we all
know that's only in paper wireless
connectivity on both is fairly standard
and in the battery department the 10
houses a larger 3000 milliamp hour
battery compared to 1715 on the iPhone
you think the iPhone would charge faster
though but that's actually not the case
given the fact that the 10 includes
Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 out of the box
overall at least on paper the 10 wins
this one by a longshot
all this being said we all know that the
reason why the iPhone doesn't need all
this powers thanks to iOS Apple's mobile
operating system continues to excel in
power efficiency reliability and
simplicity there's very little room for
gimmicks here and Apple's new 3d touch
user interface drives an extra layer of
ease by allowing users to interact
directly with shortcuts even before
launching an application HTC decided to
take some of these cues with the ten the
company is no longer trying to compete
with stock Android and instead
aggregating it's great style with its
proprietary launcher and then blending
it with the least amount of bloat
possible by not duplicating applications
with Google
the result is an HTC 10 that's far more
customizable than the iPhone standard
grid of icons and also a very pleasant
experience overall theming capabilities
on the HTC launcher only contribute to
making the phone feel yours where in the
case of the iPhone it tends to want to
show you what's best about the only
thing I prefer about the iPhone is its
denser grid of icons which in turn
requires less screen to portray the same
amount of applications where the ten
kind of doesn't know that it has a quad
HD display at times now whether that
improves or deters your user experience
as a matter of taste I know a lot of
people who find the grid less daunting
and others who like to make their phone
their own I found delight in both
devices but that's mainly because each
is great and performing without a
stutter using either phone to play games
was a delight Apple's a9 may have less
cores on paper but it's just as much of
a beast about playing graphics intensive
games as the 10 where the 10 wins mostly
is in battery life thanks to its larger
power pack allowing for more than a full
day of heavy use where in the case of
the iPhone you'll most likely have to
charge by 4:00 p.m. if you play a lot of
games even in the fingerprint scanner
Department Apple's famously fast touch
ID doesn't seem to be as fast as the HTC
capacitive button but that's mainly
because you don't have to press the
button on the 10
now one very interesting comparison has
to do with audio the iPhone may seem
louder but it's mono speaker can be
easily muffled the TENS boom sound dual
speakers ensure audio is played
regardless of how you hold the phone
where this technology really shines is
when wearing headphones iPhones have
always been great about retaining the
audio legacy of the iPod but the audio
deck on the 10 is just wonderful there's
simply no room for comparison and it's
also great that you can customize it
depending on which ear listens better
than the other and then when it comes to
the cameras the competition just gets
more intense the iPhone 6s sports a 12
megapixel primary camera at one point 22
microns F 2.2 aperture and electronic
image stabilization the 10 also houses a
12 megapixel camera but here we're
talking about a 1.5 5 micron ultra pixel
sensor F 1.8 aperture and optical image
stabilization the resulting photos on
both devices are gorgeous but the added
specifications of the 10 allow it to
provide brighter photos along with a
crisper bouquet than the iPhone the
iPhones camera application may be the
most practical in its class but it also
stands behind and supporting what the
HTC 10 can do with manual controls along
with the raw photo capability about the
only thing where I find the iPhone to be
superior is in the launch speed of the
camera application and the speed at
which it takes the photo and keep in
mind let's be clear the iPhone takes
really great photos just not as great as
the 10
when it comes to video civilization
there is simply no room for comparison
the htc tends optically stabilized
camera is doing a far better job than
the iPhone when it comes to the selfie
shooter that video stabilization is not
that evident on the 10 but you will
appreciate the added field of view that
the iPhone just does not provide overall
to conclude this video I think that the
theme of the comparison is clear the
iPhone success continues to be one of
the most popular smartphones in the
world but there's a reason why Apple has
finally found the sales slump the iPhone
success is definitely a great phone but
this video proves that it's no longer
the greatest one and the HTC 10 is a
clear example of how hard it's become
for the iPhone success to compete the
discussion of which platform is better
is not even necessary anymore the HTC 10
Dwarfs the iPhone success not just in
specification but because Apple is no
longer the only company that can delight
the consumer in the overall package I
definitely consider that HTC did just as
well here with the 10
