developers but none of us mortals are
cheering box white figures out how to
give your iPhone a slide-out keyboard
and a 17 year old kid gets into trouble
for selling legit white iphone parts all
this and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi Natalie vet and welcome
to the pocket nail I review the show we
go through all this week school and
they're not so cool inside the world of
Apple's iOS devices as always let's
start this week off with the cool well
the google voice native application is
finally made it back to our iphones and
this time it's free in the past you need
a GV mobile or any other option to get
the service but it was not free you had
to pay three bucks and two bucks in
other cases now it's free and aside from
that one of the coolest things that's
that it seems that google voice is not
anymore a subscription invite service
you can now just access it and you get
it for free so starting drawing free
calls and SMS as soon as possible the
app is free good itunes store and get it
now well if you remember our past
reports where we had apple and gold
medal and working on a built-in SIM card
for the next generation iphone it seems
that the project is falling apart
because even though the gsm association
offered a task force to I don't know
figure out how to get things done
European carriers are not liking this
project at all they don't like the fact
that Apple wants to control the whole
ecosystem so for the first time ever I'm
actually going to say this thank God for
carriers and we hope you continue on
with this and that I really just say
that I mean carriers usually become a
burden but for the first time ever
they're doing something positive for
users being able to swap sim cards on
iPhones and any other GSM phone was
really what made GSM the technology to
be and we really hope it continues that
way belton SIM cards are not the future
on a social networking site it seems
that both Twitter and Facebook have
updated their apps with new features
like on the Twitter case the fact that
we're now getting push notifications for
whenever you get mentions and it seems a
lot of people are liking it because it's
really quick and on the Facebook side
well some users are getting the new
messaging style service though it's not
getting deployed to everybody just yet
it seems that it's working slowly to
certain users and we'll see when it
comes to our case because for example
now not all of us editors have gotten
this service just yet what are our
thoughts well finally boxwave has just
carved out this really cool slider case
that includes a bluetooth thumb keyboard
for your iphone 4 and add some bulk it's
not really perfect but if you really
need a slider keyboard for the iphone 4
this is a really cool case it's
beginning to be sold as of mid-december
470 bucks it's not cheap but think about
it I mean it does add a little bit of
bulk again it's not perfect but hey it
gives you the option so let's hope it's
out there soon it's going to be called
keyboard buddy and I might just get one
it's really cool well rumors are growing
that Apple is considering offering
mobileme services for iOS devices on
everything except mail for free now what
is this well that includes I this
getting proves the photo gallery and it
includes to find my iphone services for
free though sadly you're not going to
get the mail services for push now why
is this cool well at currently costs 99
bucks which is not cool considering that
Android users get pretty much push
services and full sinking of calendar
and contacts and everything for free and
when those phone users do get the same
thing with my phone and with Windows
Live services so we feel Apple's been a
little bit behind on this if you
consider if you want really professional
services like exchange it will cost you
ten dollars a month so that'll be 120
bucks in comparison to ninety nine
dollars they monique cost and you get a
60 day trial but then again if it's free
i mean it'd be fantastic now it would be
really cool if they offered mail but if
they didn't who cares i mean if they at
least offer the Find My iPhone services
for free that will be really cool for
iphone users and iPad users and ipod
touch users out there
well that does it for the cool let's
continue on with the not so cool iOS 4.2
point 1.1 now gold master candidate is
out for developers and I mean we're
still waiting for the final release of
iOS 4.2 for mortals I mean what is this
going to happen yeah I know it said
november but i mean this is the slowest
appointment ever we're really worried
about the fact that we're not getting
real details on these changes but one of
the bad news out there is the fact that
it seems that iphone users are not going
to now going to get new basebands with
this release which is not cool if you're
considering you're going to need
unlocking your iphone with this release
like me for example so we'll see what
happens I mean we're really waiting for
this I don't know if it's going to be by
the end of november which is pretty much
a week away I mean this is again the
slowest appointment and let's really
hope that Apple fix things up because I
know the dev team is waiting for this to
be out any time soon continuing on a 17
year old kid is currently making
probably more money than you and I are
making a year why well because this kit
figured out how to get a contact within
Foxconn and get genuine white iphone
four parts to be sold as replacements
within the United States why is this
uncool it seems that Apple wants to
shoot a kid and I really wonder why I
mean the kid figured out how to get the
parts i think apple should be figuring
out where the problem is in Foxconn and
dealing with that and not dealing with
the kid I'd actually be hiring the kid I
mean how did this 17 year old kid figure
this out I really don't know that the
replacement parts are genuine everything
seems to be cool and we hope the kid
continues working because I mean hey I
mean that's really genius that's it for
today's I review thank you very much for
