is brought to you by XCOM global just
when I thought I was out Sony pulls me
back in an end-of-the-year refresh over
the xperia x performance we just
recently reviewed Sony took the wraps
off of the new xperia x Z a modest
update the Xperia bass remained similar
with a 5.2 inch 1080p LCD front-facing
speakers a Qualcomm 820 chipset with
three gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes
of storage for the single-sim version of
the phone Sony moves to USB type-c for
charging and the battery gets an
appreciated bump up to two thousand nine
hundred milli amp power the camera also
gets some new sensor technology for
faster autofocus and more accurate color
processing there was some confusion from
some of our readers initially over what
a triple sensor camera meant but Sony
only has one camera sensor on the back
of the phone Sony boasts the fastest
launch - first shot time in the industry
and holding the camera button can
complete an exposure in 6/10 of a second
though running their demo the fastest I
managed was 8/10 but that's still pretty
darn quick from screen off image
tracking looks like it's been improved -
and once the phone acquires a lock it
should be able to follow your subject
around small obstacles the overall
camera app doesn't seem to have changed
much from the Xperia x8 video recording
returns for the x/z lastly sony has
touched up the design of the XD
especially in how edges and seams are
finished off this top oval cutout looks
pretty sharp but for a brushed rear
exterior the XE was a bit more of a
fingerprint magnet over the last Xperia
we handled refinement is the name of the
game and ultimately the existence of
this phone seems to be designed to make
us forget about the ex performance there
aren't any radical adjustments but these
are improvements we're happy to see now
all that's missing is a price instead of
paying terrible roaming fees when
traveling abroad or the hassle of buying
another SIM card why not try a smarter
solution XCOM global gives you unlimited
