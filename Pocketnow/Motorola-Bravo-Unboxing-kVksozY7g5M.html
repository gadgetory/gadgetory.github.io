nada calm and this is the unboxing of
the motorola Bravo on ATT running
android 2.1 so let's get to it okay so
let's cut this package open eye on my
trusty scissors here oh there we go I
see you got the context of the box out
great so there we have the motorola
Bravo with motoblur and this is running
android 2.1 and which is open up the box
and let's see this is your motoblur
registration ID so you want to stick
that to your battery or what not we have
a quick start guide here very thin which
is nice save on some paper have the
device itself let's see a little bit
different than the other boxes so just
push it out quite tight in there so we
can see that it's sort of a rounded
shape and look at that in just a second
more cardboard and we have our power
adapter with a USB port on the side we
have the micro USB to USB charging sync
cable we have a huge battery let's see
this battery is i think was 1540
milliamp hours 1540 milliamp hours
that's a big battery for a small device
so and we also have the back battery
cover unfortunately there's no case and
no headphones included with this device
but most likely you can always use the
normal ones that most cellular devices
use these days okay so let's look at the
phone itself and take this plastic off
we have a 3.7 inch LCD display and the
cool thing about this is that it's a
very compact in form factor like from
the top to the bottom as you can see the
screen is very proportional to the size
of the device so let me just zoom in
here a little bit ok there we go on the
back we have our sim of course our 2
gigabyte card that comes with it i think
this device also has 512 megabytes ram
of course well cover all the rest of
that in our hardware tour coming up next
compare this to a couple of devices i'll
put the battery cover and battery back
on and i'll just show you a few other
devices that
for a size comparison okay so it should
mention one thing the outside has this
rubberized coating so it feels really
good in hand as you can see is quite
grippy so I don't think you'd have too
much of a problem as the slipping out of
your hand like you would with an iphone
4 or some of the other more slick
plastic devices it also has on the back
and you can see the motoblur and one
right here it's also like sort of a
rubberized texture so if we compare this
to another device that has a 3.7 inch
screen this is the nexus one you can see
that the motorola Bravo is much shorter
than the nexus one but it still has the
same screen size but of course you'll
have this track ball in the bottom
compared to the iphone 4 it's a little
bit shorter I didn't see much more thick
though of course and compared to another
AT&amp;amp;T device that's out is the samsung
focus with a four inch screen of course
and this is a little bit thicker the
motorolas a little bit thicker than the
samsung focus so as you can see all
around it looks like a great device
powered on then we'll come back to the
hardware tour coming up next along with
the software tour so if you like our
