more powerful than most flagships the
galaxy s7 leaks also into more details
on the phablet and it seems that the
microsoft lumia 950xl continues to
struggle I'm Jaime Rivera and I'm not
gonna complain about this Monday it's
actually cool to be in Vegas
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with the lumia 950xl
as Microsoft doesn't seem to be getting
more good news from retailers we heard
that Germany was a ditching it when it
came to Amazon and now Amazon in the UK
and France are following ship they are
not offering the phone anymore claiming
technical issues and we know those
technical issues you know how much we
did not like that phone when we reviewed
it
we can't wait for Windows 10 mobile to
actually get the update that fixes all
of that even though the hardware can't
really be fixed other official news come
from Samsung as the company has just
unveiled its a large galaxy a9 though in
China it's gonna retail for $500 and the
equivalent of Chinese currency and once
you get that phablet you're getting up
to things a large premium mid-range err
with a huge 4,000 milliamp hour battery
see to the premium mid-range is the way
to go and we can't wait to see when
products like these make it to the
United States more often and speaking of
Samsung and moving over to rumors we get
to hear more of the Galaxy s7 and these
rumors continue to be conflicting first
we hear if iPhone 2 inches in the
diagonal then we hear 5.1 inches again
then we hear that the the Galaxy S Plus
is gonna be a large six inch or now we
hear that it's probably going to be a
5.7 inch device and it seems that this
will be the edge variant and we kind of
wonder what's gonna happen to the galaxy
s6 edge+
as these rumors particularly claim that
this device is gonna be almost identical
to that it's really hard to believe that
that's gonna happen I don't think that
Samsung is gonna you know make the
current Galaxy s6 edge+ obsolete but
then again nobody is trying to compete
and we wonder what the future of the
edge variant will be moving the
spotlight over to Huawei and CES 2016 we
get to hear that the company is planning
to unveil something big
tomorrow January 5th and we can't
exactly what we're getting because of
two things number one we hear that it's
the probable Huawei p9 mainly because of
the design sketches that we see in the
teaser but even more interesting the
rumors sent to six gigabytes of RAM and
I don't think there's any processor
that's capable of sustaining that or at
least not sure we can't wait to hear
what Huawei announces and we will
definitely be covering it live and
finally very interesting rumors of today
have to do with the iPhone 7
particularly the iPhone 7 plus as
apparently there will be two major
boosts with this phablet number one a
3100 milliamp hour battery which will be
massive for a phone that's this
efficient but even more interesting 256
gigabytes of storage is apparently going
to be the option that users will be
getting which is a ton of storage I mean
I still have the 128 gigabyte iPhone 6s
and I have never gotten close to getting
that full but anyways it leads me to the
question today how much storage can you
live with and how much is your optimum
battery life for example in my case as
long as the battery can take me through
today without the need of a charge and
as long as I could keep as much as 64
gigs of storage I'm good with that but
there's a comment down below we'd love
