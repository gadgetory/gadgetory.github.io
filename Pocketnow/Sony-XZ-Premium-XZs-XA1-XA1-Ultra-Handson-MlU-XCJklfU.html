smartphone space over the last couple of
years but NWC is always the show to see
what's new I'm home Italy bit of a pawn
bag no from parking now when these are
Sony's devices at MWC
so we made a few headlines a couple of
days ago with the product announcement
slip disclaimer sadly they are not ready
they are so not ready they was not even
allowed to turn them on or show them off
because the software is not even close
and after playing with a little bit of
the software off camera trust me it's
still not ready what's important that we
have two lineups announce the X a 1 and
X a 1 Ultra are more the entry-level
clones they retain Sony's design
language but with entry-level
specifications you can read more about
in the links in the description the exam
line of the Sony's premium the xes being
the less specs of the 2 and the smaller
device with a 5.2 inch display at 1080p
less storage options for smaller battery
but sharing the camera specifications
and RAM in addition to other features
the true Sony flagship here is the XV
premium which Sony claims to be
launching with the snapdragon 835
processor obviously that way pushes it
to late spring but Sony brings yet
another attempt at a 4k display display
is also HDR capable for whenever you
want to pull HDR for content from
Netflix and other sources we also here
as a new motion our camera which the
company claims to bring super slow
motion video capture doing a crazy 960
frames per second and then playing it
back at 720p and it also brings
predictable captured for the next level
Android 7.1 is claimed to be the
operating system to launch here but
sadly there's none of that that we could
show you here overall the offering seems
quite interesting but there's only so
much we can tell you from unfinished
product that the only finish that we can
talk about is how this premium picks up
fingerprint but we will report more as
these review units arrive at the pocket
nail labs while you're at it make sure
