hey everyone Daniel Webster here from
pocket calm and today my shoe a
convenient way to go shopping at your
grocery store any other store that you
need to have a list for so I'm just
gonna actually go to start and the
program is called thumb shopper and it's
a very finger friendly program i'm
actually not going to use a stylus on
this program at all so I'm gonna go into
that and here I have a certain list I
can also go back to my other list I want
to close this current list I can do that
and go back to another list i have it
there just books to read you can select
any list by going down here and just
changing the name of the list and hit
cancel I'm just gonna actually go back
to the groceries again open that and as
you can see I have my list here with
different categories and you can add any
category you want and save the category
for future reference so I'm actually
gonna get a bakery and as you can see if
I was to go shopping I still need bagels
I've selected bread rolls and sourdough
so I've already bought those items in
there in the cart so when I've checked
off an item i can either have it cross
through as you can see if i was to
purchase the bagels i can just click
this tick button which is a checkmark
and it will draw a line through the item
saying that I've already picked it up
you can also select down here to hide
all checked items which is very
convenient if you want to not display
the items that you've already picked up
you can also delete the checked items
and uncheck all the items or check all
items so I'm actually going to exit this
option screen and we can go back to the
dairy and as you can see i have three
that are checked off go down to
essentials and let's say that I needed
another product so if i wanted to enter
a new product i can click down here say
new item and i can either type in a new
category or i can and save it using the
plus San over here or I can search for
categories they've already signed so
let's see if I wanted to do an
essentialist product I can go here and I
can also search for the items or save it
if I'm just going to type in a new one
let's see what would i need a think
let's say toothpaste so there it is and
I can either save in that category and
it will just save it there in quantity
I'm just going to select one and if you
want to use the unit let's say
let's just say it's one tube do that and
just click Save item and now it's saved
and if I picked up that item you can
just scroll down it's very finger from
like I said you just click here and take
this and then you're done so this is
thumb shopper and i'll post a link in
park and i have a comment so how to get
this the program does cost around four
dollars and seventy-five cents i think
but it's on sale right now and it does
require a touch screen thanks for
