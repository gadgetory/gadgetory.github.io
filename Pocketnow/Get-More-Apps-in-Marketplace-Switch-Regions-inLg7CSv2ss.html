pocketnow.com one of the biggest
problems with windows marketplace for
mobile also known as the app store for
windows mobile that it's region-specific
so if you turn on your device and you're
in Germany you won't see apps that have
been submitted to the United States
which really cuts down on the number of
apps that you can see but there's a new
application out from XDA developers that
let you switch regionality so that if
you are in a country like Germany that
doesn't have that many apps you can
switch over to the US market and get
apps from the united states that have
been submitted for that region and of
course this works for all the regions in
the world so let's take a look at this
app so start off right now I am in the
app store in Germany so you can see that
we have German languages here if I tap
on categories there's not that many apps
right now I'm used to seeing about 300
apps in the United States but right now
I'm seeing about Oh probably less than
50 so let's switch marketplaces let's go
to the United States marketplace i'll
show you the app that uses the switcher
to do that so here i have it in file
explorer and i'll put a link on
pocketnow.com on how to get it and quite
simply you open it up you press the down
arrow and let's say we want to go to
english language and the united states
and i'm going to click go ok so here we
are in the marketplace for the United
States everything's in English we go two
categories will see that there are a lot
more apps listed probably about 300 or
so now Microsoft has made the claim that
they're going to make this regional
switcher available I in a future version
of marketplace but right now you can get
it on XDA developers which comes in
handy if you're in other countries and
you want to be able to access more apps
from the market place for mobile we'll
post a link on pocket now calm that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
