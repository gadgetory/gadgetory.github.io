want to create the perfect blend of
price design and specs
well you build a desire phone I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our first look at the HTC Desire
6 to 6 so we're actually taking a look
at two phones here the desire 66 for
postpaid Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T and the 6 to
6s for a variety of prepaid carriers
externally they're identical but there
are important variations and specs with
the S version taking reductions in
camera quality NFC and LTE carrier
aggregation will focus on the standard
six to six which is not the same six to
six announced for Taiwan back in
February
yeah the branding is a little weird as
for specs
we're firmly in mid-range territory here
because this is an HTC phone there are
definite high points to that the
construction is HTC double-shot with
minimal or non-existent seams between
polycarbonate and abs materials it
finished in varying custom colors
depending on carrier the display is 5
inches at 720p the cameras are 8 and 5
megapixels for primary and selfie
respectively and there's a gig and a
half of RAM for multitasking plus their
support for microSD expansion to augment
the poultry 16 gigs of storage if 4G LTE
carrier aggregation and you've also got
HTC's newest build of blinkfeed riding
atop android 5.1 which skips along very
smoothly on the demo unit here you know
this is a budget phone so here comes the
other shoe the process are driving
everything is a snapdragon 210 hardly
the epitome of powerful silicon for the
more the battery is only 2000 milliamp
hours which is on the small side there
are no wake up gestures as there are in
higher-end HTC models and while the 66
looks like it's got HTC boomsound it
doesn't only the top grille is a speaker
the bottom one is just a fancy mask for
the microphone included for symmetry yep
those are some compromises alright but
for the right price do you really care
like all the desire devices HTC
announced today the 66 is priced very
competitively at well less than $200
unlocked
company isn't giving full details on
pricing until later on
HTC looks to have succeeded in bringing
more of its high-end features from the
flagship one series to the lower tier
desire family as for whether that's
enough to choose this phone over recent
entrants from competitors like a soos
and Alcatel OneTouch well time and more
pricing details will tell then we'll
find out in a full review coming soon
