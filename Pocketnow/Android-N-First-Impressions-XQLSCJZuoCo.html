is running on a whopping two point three
percent of devices it's time for us to
start talking about Android n I'm Joe
Levi with pocket now let's go hands on
the latest Developer Preview now this is
very much a developer preview and it's
not something that you're going to want
to run on your everyday carry device but
it is nice to know that if you've got a
nexus or a pixel see you can run this on
your device and see kind of what the
next version of android is going to look
like now most of the changes are
iterative but they're all really welcome
some of my favorites are those on the go
or doze mode on the go it's going to
take some time for us to see if that
really works the way that it's supposed
to but if doze mode the one that we've
got on Android amer android marshmallow
right now is really anything that we can
measure it by it should be great the
next thing I like is the system-wide
data saver now this is something that
I've been using on Chrome for a long
time and I really like it privacy
concerns aside this is something that
can not only reduce the amount of data
that you're sending to your device which
of course means you know reduce data but
it also means faster page loads better
battery life and of course if you're on
a limited data plan that's less data for
you as well if you're on an unlimited
plan like I am that just means that your
data is going to get to you faster
regardless of what your data speed is
all around that's good the inclusion of
the new emergency information screen
really is great now it's going to take a
while for it to get out into common use
so EMTs and first responders aren't
necessarily going to know this right out
of the bat but over time this could
potentially be a life saving feature
it's built into every Android powered
phone that that could be something major
split screen now split-screen
multitasking is something that various
OEMs have included in their builds of
Android for a little while now LG and
Samsung come to mind now
an Android way of doing that where we're
talking a OSP this is the way that
Android will be doing it in the future
that's good news the way that you can
slide and scale and run things side by
side and make things smaller and bigger
and whatnot that's great probably more
interesting to me though is well one how
it's going to look and how it's going to
work on a tablet and I can't wait to get
this on my Nexus 9 i'm waiting for the
OTA to be able to do that so follow me
on twitter at Joe Levi so you can see
some of my impressions once I get it
there but more so than that android TV
with picture-in-picture that sounds kind
of cool now it's worth mentioning here
that this is a Developer Preview edition
of the software it is not intended for
everyday use it's intended for
developers to preview what's coming out
in the next version of the Android
operating system just probably going to
be sometime this fall now some things
may change some might change a little so
much change significantly and some might
even be removed before we get to the
last or the final version the public
release version or even in any of the
upcoming Developer Preview so don't get
your heart to set on anything now
because this is a developer preview
version of the software you're probably
going to want to go back to the you know
the good version that's not a preview or
a beta so if you want to do that you
want to go back to Android marshmallow
it's really just as simple as by what
you did here to get Android n on your
device download the factory image for
your device run through the same
instructions to flash it you're good to
go again this is going to wipe
everything so once again you've been
warned one thing to keep in mind about
that however is if you opted into the
OTA beta you'll want to make sure that
you opt out of that before you go back
and flash marshmallow otherwise you
might inadvertently get android end
developer preview pushed to your device
again which would cost you time and
bandwidth and nobody's got time for that
so overall what are your thoughts of the
Android end developer preview what do
you think it's going to be called when
it's finally
leased to the public what's your
favorite feature and what do you think
they got wrong make sure you head down
to the comments and let us know your
thoughts and if you want to get any of
the links where you can download the
stuff and flash this on your own Nexus
or pixel see device I want to make sure
you head over to the article at
pocketnow.com i'll have a link down to
that in the description down below for
pocket now showing off the latest and
greatest preview versions of the android
operating system I'm Joe leave I will
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
