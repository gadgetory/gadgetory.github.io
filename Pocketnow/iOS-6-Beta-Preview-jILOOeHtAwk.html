Apple has finally released iOS 6 at WWDC
to developers a lot of the changes were
good but most of them were kind of
overdue I'm high memory letter with
pocketnow.com and let's go through iOS 6
beta 1 and all of the minor changes
after the update the biggest
disappointment I know many of us have is
seeing the same grid of icons as always
Apple seems dangerously reluctant to
change the style of their homescreen and
I guess we'll just have to wait another
year if you want to see a change in that
the UI has changed then some minor
extent though some integrated
applications have changing their UI
dramatically like for example the App
Store the Music Store and others and
there are some minor UI elements that
have changed in mail for example and
settings to make the experience more
fluid the music application has changed
dramatically it's completely different
to what you knew before and yeah even
the dollar has changed to some extent
though I wouldn't even consider that a
feature there's this interesting use of
blue at the top status bar within
built-in applications like settings and
while we're talking about settings you
now finally get a Bluetooth button at
the top and there's a new privacy
setting for you to check which
applications you're doing within your
stuff breezing through the major changes
you'll see that Facebook integration is
now supported just like Twitter was in
iOS 5
but both services are now deeper with an
eos than before for example you can now
view calendar information birthdays or
even your facebook contacts within the
built-in iOS applications you can now
tweet and update your facebook status
from Notification Center and yes you can
also do that through Cydia
speaking of Siri it's now supported by
the new iPad which is a big reason to
say finally it now allows you to launch
applications and also provide services
like scores schedules are even player
information and different sports
aside from also bringing you details at
even trailers and movies it also now
supports additional languages like
Spanish Italian Korean and Chinese sadly
it's still a work in progress since
additional language supports sense all
your questions to the browser instead of
providing
from WolframAlpha like you see in
English for example when getting a call
sliding up now allows you to decline the
call reply with a message or even get
reminded of returning that call later
which is also a welcome feature every
one of these enhancements now works
through FaceTime as well
and speaking of FaceTime it now finally
allows you to make video calls through
your data connection which is something
long overdue it also allows you to add
your phone number to your FaceTime calls
on your Mac and iPad but sadly the phone
number integration doesn't seem to work
it on beta 1 but it's gonna be a cool
feature in the future to have your phone
number work on every one of your iOS
devices Notification Center now has a Do
Not Disturb feature which is very
welcome but sadly only have done see do
not disturb is beyond good in cases like
blocking incoming calls from everyone or
people that aren't in your favorites
lists are on a specific group you can
also schedule when you don't want to be
disturbed which is also quite welcomed
the problem with the service are at
least for beta 1 is that it only works
when your phone is on standby and I
don't know about you but in my case when
I'm watching a movie or reading a book
on my iPad I don't want to be disturbed
when activated look out for a small moon
icon beside the clock in the status bar
Safari now includes a really cool
feature called iCloud tabs it allows you
to view what tabs are currently open on
your other iOS devices or Macs sort of
like chrome sharing in some way aside
from that you can also get offline
reading lists for articles that you want
to save for later and you probably want
to read whatever you don't have a data
connection very useful for the non 3G or
4G iPad a very long overdue feature is
your ability to now upload photos to
websites directly from Safari and yeah
you finally get full screen support at
least on landscape and Safari which is
also long overdue the iCloud photo
stream also got enhanced you can now
share certain folders with friends and
even interact with comments though sadly
this feature doesn't seem to work at
least completely on beta 1 mail also
gets enhanced you can now add filters
for VIPs so you can focus on their
messaging only you can also get filters
for flagged messages these filters can
even be rearranged at your convenience
is also this really neat feature that
allows you to add photos into messages
without having to look for the photo
within the separate application first
mail now refreshes with a pool though
the animation does seem kind of weird
separate signatures for email account is
also a welcome feature and now it even
supports HTML for that Apple is also
implementing something called passbook
which has the idea of collecting all
your boarding passes tickets store cards
and coupons though sadly this is not
working in beta one for us to review
Maps is probably the biggest improvement
and most overdue change it ditched the
Google map says the backend that is now
using its own software partner with
TomTom and others it provides
turn-by-turn navigation even if you're
on the lockscreen
and it's even integrated with Siri 3d
maps are awesome especially with its
flyover feature sadly though 3d maps or
even normal maps aren't really ready for
international locations at the moment
they'll most likely be ready for the iOS
6 launch in the fall
overall iOS 6 bring some welcome changes
I know many of you will be happy with
but Apple is definitely not planning to
make any groundbreaking changes here
some of these features like turn-by-turn
navigation and maps or sadly catch ups
the competition and don't really
dramatically improve what others do
already other features like passbook and
photo stream sharing are quite unique
and great improvements but these are
sadly not selling points for the UI the
company seems reluctant to change their
five year old user interface and while
that's good to some people it's
definitely boring for others like you
and me
if you have access to the beta I sadly
can recommend that you get it now there
are just too many bugs that make the
experience intolerable and if I were you
I'd wait for beta to that's it for our
preview of iOS 6 make sure you subscribe
to our channel for more videos or future
beta enhancements of iOS 6 and don't
forget to give us a thumbs up if you
like what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
