Android wear Samsung's gear line and the
pebble you might think the time for a
simpler wearable has long past but a
company called Martian watches is
betting the other way offering a line of
stripped-down analog watches with just a
tiny screen for notifications what we
saw of these watches at trade shows
didn't exactly light us on fire
but thanks to AT&amp;amp;T we've had the
opportunity to try one out for about a
week in our review labs and so far that
experience has been a pleasant surprise
I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow and
this is the Martian notifier the
notifier is really two devices in one a
typical quartz analog timepiece with
battery life of about two years set by
the manual stem on the right and a
Bluetooth powered SmartWatch with a
small OLED screen a bright notification
lamp and battery life up to five days
per charge which we've confirmed
accurate recharging is accomplished via
a USB cable specially designed for the
deep port on the watch's side and the
door over the port needs to be sealed
tightly to preserve the notifiers splash
resistance with a resin case stainless
steel bezel and beefy silicone band the
watch feels pretty robust it's certainly
not dainty marsian also offers 22
millimeter watch bands of many colors
that snap on without the need for tools
that said we were disappointed when our
watches clasp fell apart for no reason
which we had to go get fixed at a local
jewelry store and while the acrylic
crystal is supposed to be scratch
resistant we wish Martian had gone with
sapphire here being able to immerse it
in water would also be nice but we
understand some sacrifices had to be
made in the name of economy as with any
SmartWatch the notifier comes to life
when it's well notifying and here the
Martian does a good job you'd be
surprised how much you can fit onto a 96
by 16 panel the watch can display
notifications from many core and
third-party apps on iOS and Android and
the three button interface is very
simple the lower buttons the menu the
upper button selects and the screen
itself acts as a key to though it's
really just an accelerometer cue you can
tap anywhere on the watch as long as you
do it with enough oomph using the watch
as a remote notifier carries all the
advantages we've come to expect from a
SmartWatch and it even offers variable
vibration patterns so you can tell what
kind of notification you're getting by
feel alone there's also support for
weather reports Google now the world
clock a remote camera shutter a
flashlight and features that the
forgetful will appreciate a leash
function to inform you when you travel
too far from your phone and a feature
that remotely sounds a ringtone if you
can't find your smart phone there's also
a utility baked in for activating Siri
or voice command
but because the watch has no microphone
this is only useful in limited
environments call taylor martin brad
marks say select one for mobile say
select no just forget it that's a pretty
robust feature set for a watch that
looks so basic and with all the added
functionality comes the usual hiccups
too the watch doesn't always pair on the
first try when setting it up with a new
phone notifications themselves aren't
100% reliable we've had a few occasions
where the watch didn't tell us about a
pending alert or the opposite it buzzed
us several times for the same alert we
tend to think the martian app is to
blame here like some other wearable
clients we'd prefer it to be cleaner and
less buggy the Martian notifier doesn't
bring all the functionality of many of
its competitors but as we've learned
over the past week that doesn't mean it
should be dismissed out of hand it's
priced fairly it looks good it lasts a
long time and it does a fine job of
bringing the convenience and utility of
a smart phone to the wrist and as a
bonus it still functions as a wristwatch
even when it's smarter side Peter's out
I'd still like it to be truly waterproof
I don't like it's app and I'm a little
concerned about its latch falling apart
so like many smartwatches I'd maybe
recommend holding out for Generation 2
on this one but on the whole I owe you
an apology
Martian notice
you're a lot cooler than I thought you
were for more coverage on a whole lot
