upon us and we're here to talk about it
welcome to the pocket now weekly the
once-a-week podcast from pocketnow.com
where we discuss smartphones and tablets
convertibles and phablets everything
else in between i'm michael fisher and
i'm joined today for what I believe is
the second show in a row a first by Joe
Levi the android guy from Utah good
morning sir good morning why do they
take care of all these announcements and
events and cool things not in Utah they
should move that he should your salt
lake city should be the center of
smartphone announcements I agree and I
have committed a slight breach of
etiquette bye-bye not introducing my
steadfast managing editor and Tandy
Nadia from Romania good morning good
afternoon to you rather good morning to
you guys and I am jealous because you
guys will have the s4 event in New York
but then again I'll have to understand
because I attended the London event last
year exactly is that where that row made
a Bulgarian broke your camera I think
people he was Russian was he Russian he
was rushing yard it got worked out
though right you've replaced your LAN it
yet it got worked out yeah i'm not sure
what he replaced but i replaced my lens
i remember hearing that the pr a PR lady
had to separate you yeah she was she was
sweet and she was like like a 150 I'm
talking centimeters now tall and like 40
kilograms she was trying to hold me back
as I was rushing towards this guy's neck
so he said it was a I thought you meant
a hundred and fifty meters it was like
wow she was no 150 she's a sprinter she
just leaped over the table yeah yeah I
was basically dragging her around like
those chains and bold and she was like
after me like okay it was it was nasty
well here's hoping that this year at the
New York City event we don't have a
similar problem it'll be Brandon and me
listeners covering the event and Adam
covering the simultaneous Times Square
event
and there will of course be special
editions of the pocket now live I
believe tent-polling this right we're
doing a hangout beforehand and one after
is that right Tony we are doing a
hangout live as it happens with Jaime
Rivera Joe Levi Taylor Martin and myself
we're gonna bring real-time news we're
gonna bring real-time coverage from time
square and we're gonna dissect the
galaxy s4 from every aspect good good
good Joe are you excited about that I
just want to find out does it blend our
friend from Blendtec no longer does I'm
sure it will blend easier than the HTC
one I'm sure it will yes yes yes very
nice segue there Tony um this is a
special edition of the podcast listeners
it is going to be short because we had
some we had to swap our schedule around
when we were getting our HTC One review
unit because of our availability and the
one that is sitting in front of me
because before we talk about the galaxy
s4 we're going to be talking about the
HTC One the one that are sitting in
front of me was initially slated to go
to Tony in Romania and unfortunately
things didn't work out that way but HTC
was able to overnight one to me which
and I wasn't expecting it so I'd this
whole editorial schedule for the week I
was I knew what I was going to be
writing about and then this this one
shows up in my door right after the
Kyocera torque shows up my door so I'm
like oh boy so I'm like Tony we gotta
throw out the rundown well you know we
sounded the red alert if we worked it
out don't you love it when you had to
improvise yeah yeah I oh I do I'm not
gonna lie that I'm not complaining i
mean it when win a beautiful when
something awesome shows up at your door
whether you like it or not like the HTC
one is the most significant device that
HTC is going to launch this year it's
maybe one of the most significant
devices ever considering their position
in the company not even position in the
market not even maybe it is so I was
glad that when it showed Michael I have
a question about the HTC One did you put
it under your pillow last night haha I
did not but only because I had to put it
on the charge ooh you know yes maybe
tonight you know how that goes yeah
maybe tonight one one point about that
and we saw this in our hands on
at New York City the power button of
course we know is up top because that's
what HTC loves to do but it's offset its
overall in the left-hand side of the top
surface of the one as you're looking at
the phone and it is offset by the USB
port on the bottom which is all the way
to the right hand side of the phone as
you're looking at the phone so
stylistically that that makes a lot of
sense because if you hold the phone
right side up you're looking at it you
know you're you did the buttons on the
upper left but if you hold the phone
upside down the USB port is also on the
upper left and they're about the same
size and the same so every time I pull
the one out of my pocket it like like
half the time it's upside down and I'm
pressing on the micro USB port I'm like
why isn't this powering on oh right it's
not a button at all because they even
feel the same it's crazy yeah that is
crazy yeah now you have to kind of give
it to HTC for sticking with their button
on the top design everybody's kind of
been doing other things and and they
stick to that I commend them for that if
you've got an older HTC device the
buttons going to be in exactly the same
place well except for this one yeah
right yeah I mean we kind of gave them a
little bit bunk for putting it on top on
the droid DNA because the DNA is this
massive 5-inch screen you know in my
experience with the one it's a little
less annoying just because it's a little
tiny bit smaller but really I I think
buttons with the phones this size
buttons belong on the side I mean
there's there's very little you can do
gracefully to get your finger up there
to activate that button so and since
we're talking about buttons be honest
how many times have you pushed the HTC
logo on the front I know exactly once
well it wasn't even initially either
because initially you know I had my mind
on it and I'm like okay I know that this
is a new button configuration it wasn't
until I think midway through the day
when I'm starting to get a little tired
yesterday that I was like okay go back
home and I tap on the HTC logo like no
that's incorrect but I haven't I haven't
double tapped on the real home button to
use the multitasking interface only like
once or twice I don't know what do you
think about this guy's this this new
approach to the multitasking screen
because
I'm not completely sold on it are you
well it depends on what you're
accustomed to because if you're
accustomed to Samsung devices that's
that's just a long tap and hold on on
the button but from what I know when
somebody correct me if I'm wrong HTC has
been doing this long tap since the HTC
One got that it's update wait me the
double tap yeah oh well I might be I
might be wrong here even though I don't
think so so HTC fans or HTC users are
accustomed to this no because the 1x the
1x has a dedicated multitasking button
so you can tap that once but then I
guess you can long tap it for a menu
option if you have one or if you have it
inverted in the settings yeah see my
thing is this I'm I hate I'm sorry but i
hate press to present hold I don't like
it as an interface element and so I
don't like Samsung's implementation of
their you know mashed down on the on the
HOME key to call up the the multitasking
ribbon so I like the idea of a double
tap it's just add the layout of these
nine cards listeners if you haven't seen
the new multi task again since five
instead of HTC's ribbon of scrollable
sort of webos like cards it shows you
nine laid out on the screen and you can
still flick them up to throw them away
which is not as intuitive in this
arrangement but I guess you can see them
you know you can see more you don't have
to do as much finger work to see
everything you're running but I you
don't think I like it as much for some
what do you think Joe what do you what's
your favorite way to multitask on
Android honestly I like the dedicated
multi task button it's there it says you
can switch from one thing to another
thing really fast but but more home is
in the middle that I mean look at
Samsung it's in the middle look at Apple
it's in the middle look at every other
Android device running a recent version
of Android it's in the middle so
deviating from that too and i'm going to
call it a shameless plug of the HTC logo
that does nothing but stare at you and
make you want to push it to go home is
kind of lame and goofy regarding
multitasking I like the way stock
Android handles it I think everybody
else is trying
to come up with a way that's better than
that and I don't think anybody has you
know you look at all of the things that
even HTC is done in the past and it's no
better than then the stock stuff and
it's just a little bit more confusing it
serves to help people pick up an HTC
android device and say hey this is
unusual this isn't what I like this is
what I'm used to and and then they might
like better or they might not there's
really only well throw in the third
choice which is I really don't care just
let me go that other app so so yeah
that's that is the thing go ahead time I
have two things to note here and the
first one is that we have to be fair
with people we are exchanging phones on
a weekly or bi-weekly basis so we can
compare it to other phones but if you're
getting the one either unlocked or on a
carrier contract you're holding on to
that for at least one here and chances
are if you're getting a one you're an
HTC fat and you're going to get the 12
or whatever its thing is going to be so
you're you're used to the HTC way and
regarding the other topic I kind of
applaud HTC for for trying to go as
minimal as possible because instead of
having we initially had for Android
buttons we had now the standard as 3 and
HTC is going with number two it's just
normal that they ditch the search button
because you can now search with the with
the Google now and the on device search
which is good so it makes sense to have
a back and a home button only and since
it would have looked a little bit ugly
to have the HTC logo on one side and the
home button in the middle I kind of like
the way things are right now do you know
what I just realized i have not yet
accessed google now there we go
blasphemy I was like wait a man do it
I'm like well if I double tap the home
see now this is this is a testament this
is actually important I I thought that
okay if I double tap the home button I
get multitasking what if I long press
the home button like I would long press
the menu button on the Samsung device
and that is in fact what calls up Google
now on the phone so that's good that's
intuitive that's that's a good way to
implement it and I don't think that you
don't have a swipe up from the bottom
from any screen to get it
that it is not know it is not a Nexus
device and then in that sense or or in
any sense but it's not it's especially
not a Nexus device in that sense but
while we're talking about software
because we do have to touch on hardware
but if you've seen our premium unboxing
from yesterday you know a little bit
about the hardware and how we feel about
it but this software guys sense 5 so
what what happens when you get a new hot
piece of Android hardware that you're
not sold on the software guys what do
you what do you do we were to get
accustomed to exactly you rooted you try
and get a custom custom rom whatever or
just a watcher here or a custom launcher
exactly and you know that happens a lot
and the HTC One hardware is so beautiful
that a lot of people are going to jump
to that but I'm you know we're required
to obviously give sense 5 a shot and
more more than that personally I want to
like it because well because HTC right
we always talk about this any listen to
the podcast knows our feelings on HTC
would like them and God I gotta tell you
since five it to me is aesthetically
very very cool it manages to do what
Windows Phones modern style does but
differently it's it's as minimalistic it
really is but it's just different if she
is still sticking with their graze here
you know they're doing the grey and blue
and white thing to this it's classy
looking paired with the right wallpaper
it's it really pops and I gotta tell you
I we can talk about blinkfeed in a
second but just the visual design
language itself is is very striking I
think it's beautiful especially and it's
well matched the hardware that's what
I've been trying to say this whole time
it is well matched to the to the
hardware it's running on buddy from from
what you guys seen I've seen do you are
you hating it so far you're loving it
what's your opinion of it what are you
guys I what I was yeah because mine is
the shortest answer I wasn't there in
New York I only had a brief two-minute
hands-on with the HTC One at mwc in
Barcelona so I'm gonna pass on this
because I don't want to judge either way
for actually using the phone Roger yes I
understand but I mean like just the
visual style that you've seen from
screenshots and I I don't necessarily
have to say I like it but I don't hate
it I tend to be the user who is working
with whatever he gets from the OEM so if
its iOS 6 i'm not bored with it if it's
TouchWiz I'm not more with it if it
sends five point oh I'm not bored with
it I use it the way it was intended to
and I think this is good because
everybody on the team has a different
approach you guys especially Joe is the
guy who non-stop customizes and routes
Michael is summer in the middle and I'm
the stock only guy so this gives us more
perspective on every device right right
and I want a good show i want to get you
to weigh in on this and this is funny we
don't do a live podcast yet listeners so
this is just a moment of sheer
synchronicity my friend Chris just sent
me a text message a trot in the air like
two seconds ago and he's just kind of
vamping on the on the Hun Sen's five and
he says multitasking interface on sex
fun whoops and what he says multitasking
in her face on sense 5 is pretty sexy
blinkfeed is stupid as hell so he's just
kind of vamping on thing and why is the
apt or 4 by 3 or 3 by 3 with that stupid
clock at the top so it's interesting to
me the timing on this text message it's
almost as though we did have a live
podcast and those guys right I should
mention that though the app drawer is
they really have spread that out and if
CC seems to be saying with the new
version of sense that people who scroll
kinetically are like wrong it's not kind
of it's not going to serve them you guys
know when you have a long list of stuff
and you just give it a really solid
flick and it kind of goes on forever mmm
that does not happen on the sense 5
almost anywhere like no matter what
strength of flick you give it it's only
going to go one page that's one of the
fun things that i do i'm just sitting
there bored trying to occupy a time
looking at my phone because I don't want
to participate in the conversation and
I'll open something up and I'll do that
I will deliberately flick just to see it
go fast and well you're not going to do
that on Sam I
no definitely it's it's also what we do
when filming review videos when we don't
know what else to do with their hands
when we haven't shot that piece of
energy footage yet and it's like let me
just go ahead and flick through the
screens here look how smooth and fluid
this motion is just so like that I'm
usually more yeah good you've been
you're getting close to being 24 hours
with the HTC One right yes that's true
so not as a editor at pocket now not as
somebody from the business but as a user
how long do you think you can put up
with blinkfeed um I can definitely put
up with it and enjoy it actually for for
a bit blinkfeed allows you to not only
pull in you know news and and and other
information like that but it lets you
pull on your facebook feed your twitter
feed and a the meat let me have the
people right it's very much like the
people if if like the People Hub and and
Flipboard had gotten together and made
it made a baby and that's really it's
really cool because you can uncheck
boxes willy-nilly like say today I'm
overloaded with whatever say pocket down
news in my in my feed I don't want to
really pay attention to tech today all
you do is jump into the highlights menu
and then you take off you uncheck the
box next to technical and all of a
sudden your feet is just Facebook and
Twitter and CNN or whatever you whatever
else you have in there so you know
that's pretty cool it's you know it's
not I don't think it's the prettiest
thing in the world but it's it's it's
always to the left of your home screen
and it's nice having it there you don't
have to use it if you don't want to so
so then follow-up question when you boot
up the phone or when you resume from a
sleeping state does it default to the
bling feet or does it default to your
home screen number one I'm jumping into
the browser right now so the browser has
loaded up pocketnow.com and the HTC One
and okay I'm looking on page oh wow this
is a great website I got to come here
more often and then I hit the home
button and it drops me back to my to my
home screen not to the blinkfeed that is
good yeah so the blinkfeed is the option
to the left correct correct and in that
sense it's good it doesn't really force
it on you which is nice yeah okay so
Michael you're a Kickstarter backer did
you back the chameleon launcher on
starter I did not why does have a
similarity here well i'm looking at
blinkfeed and i've seen that and
chameleon launcher started out as a
tablet only launcher they subsequently
have got it over to smartphones now I'm
not running it on my Nexus 4 but the one
thing that struck me when I saw
blinkfeed was that looks just like
chameleons and those of you who are
familiar with chameleon it's available
in the in the Play Store go and check it
out but those of you who are already
familiar with it you can put your feeds
on there so if you want a Twitter feed
you want a facebook feed you want or
whatever it reminds me and I know that's
not exactly what blinkfeed does but it
reminds me of that it infers putting
your social content right there on the
screen because any more social is my
news you know I oh yeah old-time papers
New York Times know who are they let
somebody who's in the industry who knows
what's going on and doesn't have to go
through an editor that takes 2-3 days
before it's approved and up and online
so my news is actually knew its not its
old way that's what we should call it
baby I was just wondering if you'd back
that and if so what what similarities
you might have drawn between the two of
them but you haven't sold voice but
philosophically though it's interesting
that more than one company is doing this
and you know this is kind of split
between third party people and first
party cell phone OEMs or smartphone OEMs
I think blinkfeed is is it's not it's by
far not the most impressive part of HTC
sense I think the most impressive part
of HTC Sense 5 is that that cohesive
visual style that I was talking about
but it is you know they made a big deal
about saying this we're designing this
phone software so that when you're
waiting in line at the supermarket you
jump into your blinkfeed you take a look
at it this isn't to power through all
your feeds at all the time it is for
casual you know casual digestion of cool
information from what feeds you want and
in that respect it works really well
guys like it's it's big these tiles are
huge I've got a huge picture of of like
Brandon here from the story like it's
easy to read on this 1080p display it's
it's clear like so now that I infuriated
HD
saying that HTC doesn't really know how
to make good cameras I'm gonna probably
infuriate Samsung fans when I'm gonna
say and this is by no means pocket nas
opinion it is my personal opinion
samsung doesn't know how to make
beautiful phones I mean the S free I I
didn't like that it wasn't standing out
with anything the s2 was too close to
the iphone to be likable mm-hmm and it
was just yes so Sam emphasizing on
beauty not emphasizing on materials like
the HTC they are emphasizing on speed on
specs on camera quality and on user
interface and experience you know I like
I i think that uh I don't entirely
disagree with you what do you think Joe
they're writing on their own coattails
you know it's it's just another galaxy
phone what is that the galaxy why is it
the galaxy mini is that the galaxies
cores are the galaxy s is an access it's
the same thing come on let's do this is
your flagship product do something do be
gorgeous be wonderful be top tier
because dang it you've got so many
devices in so many hands you you owe it
to your people to your customers to have
something gorgeous and you know what
guys Michael and I were tossing back in
for some ideas and we have this killer
idea for an editorial which will
probably be going live somewhere this
weekend or beginning of next week that
Samsung might be pulling an iphone 4s
but then again samsung cannot really do
that because the S free is not nothing
like the iphone 4 or the iphone 5 they
don't compare and beauty so i think that
they know i'm sorry they don't compare a
beauty yet but they are starting to
compare in terms of mindshare and in
terms of what gets attention and i think
the iphones cachet has eroded a little
bit due to the efforts of Android
manufacturers but also just because
Android phones can now do much more than
the iphone can do and i think consumers
are starting to realize that and as a
result I think Samsung does have a
little bit of breathing room here to be
like listen we're going to kick out a
refresh for last year's model because
we're not going to be taken as many
with this one because we already know
that we're successful so why are we
going to jeopardize that I'm not saying
I like it but I'm saying I think that's
there that's probably they're at it and
that's that's the Apple mentality i was
i was talking about yeah it is right
well but the Apple mentality of doing
that they they had beautiful first and
then they're adding stuff to that and
they're being conservative afterwards
Samsung's the other way they're still
trying to get to that really really nice
really top-tier hardware experience and
now they're playing things conservative
too that's not a way to win you've
gotten there's a foundation there's also
something else to consider I think when
when they they sat down at the drawing
board the at one point the executive
said draw me a phone which is not the
iphone which is as far as the iphone as
possible with all the lawsuits going on
so yeah do you guys think that is there
any worth to these rumors that this
device is going to come out without a
physical earpiece that is going to come
out with bone conduction all that that
would be cool well I think that's that's
just a Photoshop mess up me too I I
don't think there's anything more to
that and as I've proven it in my post
I've overlaid the s4 on that teaser
image yes free I'm sorry and that's
basically just yes free with the top re
photoshopped so it's just the
placeholder yet I'm fancy lighting and
whatnot wow that's too bad what we've
been talking about these leaks and like
the camera lens on the back of that
sucker looks huge and we do have to talk
to touch on the camera quickly but this
like suppose a 13 megapixel sensor is
probably a really good idea but that
lens cover looks impressive as I mean
that that's it it almost looks
terrifying with this like I staring at
you like HTC the one has it to this big
lens cover that's that's that's kind of
this big black meatball on the back of
the device but for some reason it just
looks more pronounced on the galaxy s4
the rumored galaxy s4 do you think this
is going to help us for in terms of
delivering a good camera experience Joe
it's got to you've got the bigger
aperture you've got the bigger lens
you've got the bigger everything you've
got the
the better pictures you're going to have
whether or not you like that because it
impacts the design of the phone the
thickness of the phone and whatever is
moot if you care about having a super
high res high quality camera look at the
galaxy camera another galaxy device by
the way it's got a huge old honking lens
on it sure now I'm not advocating that
we do that on the galaxy s4 but it's the
same it's the same thing you you can't
have one without the other at least not
in today's technology what about you
Johnny so since everything we talked
about the s4 is based on rumors i'm
going to allow myself the and i'm going
to bring a new rumor to the table i've
recently read that samsung at one point
has managed to get a patent application
approved for a special lens on a camera
which would allow for better panoramic
pictures and if that is the case with
the s4 and this is again a rumor then
it's just normal to have a better lens
cover because that the lens which is
behind the lens cover is actually has to
actually allow the lens to have a better
panoramic look at the scenery mm-hmm and
we've seen the effect of that that can
have on devices like the droid DNA and
the yeah HTC windows phone 8x with its
front facing camera which is this this
little recessed bead and this kind of
counter sunk crater it gives you a
really nice wide angle view and it's
cool but everything we have said up to
this point is really nice and everything
but what really really really concerns
me is this morning's piece which comes
as a confirmation from Bloomberg of
course it's based on to people's
opinions who are familiar with the
matter unquote that the u.s. brians of
the galaxy s4 will indeed support the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 and the rest of
the world will get the 88 or x unos and
and i really think this is this is where
Samsung is shooting themselves in the
foot because once the notes you landed
and it was standardized across all
regions we thought that they finally
figure that one out the LTE and
everything but it if these rumors turn
out to be true then I'm sorry for us
customers not saying that the
600 is a bad cpu know it's an
exceptional CPU I'm just saying that
there will be differences across devices
gross yeah there were agents there will
you know that Samsung's problem I think
the Samsung would be shooting themselves
in the foot if that resulted in a
measurable impact in sales but I will go
out on a limb here and say it will
absolutely not nobody's going to care
you're probably right yeah yeah no but
no but no regular consumer is going to
it talks about processors that you know
people in the United States know what
Qualcomm is because there's a frickin
sports stadium named after the company
not because it's a processor
manufacturer so it's not going to do
anything to impact the sales the galaxy
s4 I don't think it's going to be
something to talk about for us because
we'll be able to run some comparisons
and see like what is octa-core really
worth anything and we'll be able to make
you know cool cool stories based on it
but and we're gonna bring in James Bond
villains and all kinds of stuff when we
talk about yeah absolutely weird i I'm
more interested i guess i'm most excited
about about the the camera and because
Samsung when they dropped the s3 on us
and we took that thing for a spin and we
took photos with that sucker I mean you
know Samsung didn't really go out of its
way if i recall correctly to puff up the
camera in its marketing materials but
the s3s cameras just it was incredible
and the software was incredible that
lets you tweak that performance further
and i think that there I agree with you
Tony they're really going to come out
and and probably destroy the performance
of the ones camera and I think this time
they're not going to be quiet about it
because they realize that the HTC One is
a bigger threat than the One X was maybe
well to be fair I think the s3 and the
notes who already are better cameras
than than the one that may be said now
we haven't done a that's fair you know
I'm probably yeah that's probably fair
to say yeah without doing the
comparisons which is where you were
going Michael yeah just based on my
mental image that that seems fair hmm
yeah and yeah based on my hands on
experience I can't readily say that
you're wrong Tony I think that's that's
probably true
but you know edit well at least a normal
lighting and low light the one
absolutely destroys them yeah so it
ended it as we've said about I think
maybe about 20 episodes in a row well
it's not good the sales of the HTC one
vs the galaxy s4 it's not going to come
down to equality equality against
quality is going to come down to which
one can be marketed better and unless
HTC has a real ace up its sleeve in
terms of a marketing approach I don't
see them coming out on top with regard
to this well the other thing to consider
is Samsung has already got the marketing
approach they've already got the name
they've already got that they've won
where HTC can can make inroads is with
carrier partnerships and contracts if
they flood the carrier's with this
device and make it more attractive to
the carrier's to offer to those
customers even though I hate that model
HTC could have a chance to get that
device in the hands of a lot more people
than dumping a whole bunch of of
advertising capital that I honestly
don't think they have into the market to
say hey HTC one every time you see
Samsung think HTC one that's an
interesting perspective Joe I don't
necessarily just disagree with you but I
also am forced to think of every Windows
Phone launched at AT&amp;amp;T say in the united
states where they have this nice little
side booth in the in the store
oftentimes it's up front it's called out
there's a big window size like banner ad
but still people come in and and you
know they were not always isn't taken to
that booth i think you really have to
sell the employees more than anything
and in my experience and this is a big
generalization but i'll allow myself to
do it because I used to be one wireless
sales people generally do not tend to be
people who respect things that are
different they don't like selling things
they don't know and they don't generally
use things they don't know they use
what's popular and I think that they're
going to continue to push samsung stuff
so until HTC can find a way to
ingratiate itself to these retail
employees they're never going to going
to see these type of success at samsung
has seen turn so you're saying they need
to give these devices to exploit yes
I think get them using them or maybe to
their children right because you know if
the children start using them though
it's it's it's apples technique to get
apple products to get kids using apple
products by putting apple products in
elementary schools and secondary schools
and colleges free of charge here you go
use it so that that's the technology
that's the brand that you know and
you're aware of and when you grow up to
be a real person you want to use that
same thing because you already know it
did they have its acceptance travel is
cash right very true okay so I was about
to say because I'm sensing from the
structure and from your ideas and these
sentences that were wrapping this up we
are yeah it is just fair to say the
following thing we are geeks and so are
probably most of those listening to our
podcast and following pocket now so it
yeah that yeah so it's just fair for us
to want to compare anything with
everything including the HTC One deal
with the s4 now the point is that the s4
will outsell the S free and the HTC One
will will not come close to twenty
percent of the s4 sales but i'm thinking
that HTC's point or target this year is
not the competition with the galaxy I
think HTC is directly competing with
themselves because they are on a sliding
trend and they want to stop that and the
HTC one is capable of stopping that
trend and that I read at one point I
haven't checked this so don't quote me
on this yet that HTC sales numbers are
close to where they were before Android
so I think that it's it's not the HTC
one vs the the s4 this year it's the HTC
vs HTC and and that's that's the end of
the story sure yeah I agree and they
definitely have to get their house in
order before they go after degree go
after Samsung's they're not at all in
the same footing they were before and
you know there's a couple other
competitors down at their level to worry
about but I think the interesting thing
about HTC and the reason we spend so
much time on the one and on HTC in
general is because we know the company
is capable of being that big and being
that successful because we've sort of
you know we've gotten tastes of it
before and also we're kinda
almost to a man on the team in love with
HTC hardware so you know as always I
think we got to wish him best of luck as
we cover their efforts but I I want to
know from each of you personally never
having held the galaxy s4 yourselves and
also never having held that the HTC One
for maybe more than a second but all the
same I want to know based on what you
know now which one would you buy if they
were both in front of you at the same
price Joe why don't you go first I it's
no no secret I'm an HTC fan and I hate
hyper glaze I have helped neither of
these devices and I really really would
like to hold them both violent had yes
for either no I'm on no I know I've got
a super slippery nexus 4 and what was me
but I know I know what Samsung is I know
what Samsung does I know what the s4 is
I don't have to hold it I know what it
is I know what its gonna feel like in
hand now the actual usability experience
that I'd like to see I'd like to use it
I'd like to I'd like to have it for a
week and just say this this is a nice
device and this is why this is a sucky
device and this is why looking at the
HTC it just looks quality it looks
high-end it looks like something that I
would like to have it's not like some of
the other HTC's I've seen it's got a
little bit more bold style and
appearance but it still emphasizes
everything that HTC is good at
everything that they've sold me on
across the many many years that I've
been an HTC fan so if I have the two of
them sitting on the table and the
salesman says pick one of those and you
can have it for free I'd go with the HTC
for free if they said pick one of those
and pay a reasonable amount for and they
were exactly the same price exactly the
same whatever else carrier I I'd go with
the HTC that this well answered Joe
thank you I reserve the right to recant
that statement if HTC screws it up but
the recorders on Levi yes you can't get
away from this one but just based on
what I've seen so far which is what I
think the question was getting at it
I I would go if it were my money and I
were spending it today I would put it on
htc just because I like the way the
device looks and I think HTC is going to
get back into the game in a strong way
with the with this device so I want to
make sure we're hearing you correctly
are you saying you'd go with the HTC
device out but I'm kind of leaning
towards it yes okay HTC what about you
two but this there's there's no secret
and there's no use in me hiding this I
hated the 1x last year i hate i was
about the only person on the team who
who really disliked it and sold my unit
just one month after purchasing it but
that's no secret and i said it many
times and i will say again ever since I
saw the design of the HTC One I said
that the HTC one is the phone for me
because it speaks Apple it speaks
quality and that means a lot to me but I
also said the following thing I will
pick the s4 over the one if it
collectively brings two things to the
table 1 a better design to a better
camera regardless if either one of these
happens on its own i'm going with the
one and so far judging from the leaks
the design is going to be the same the
way I hated the 1x last year I hate the
samsung design so if both happen it's
the s4 if only one of those two happens
it's the one nice thats that concisely
answered i think that i agree with the
both of you both made excellent points i
think one thing that there is an analogy
to be drawn between us and or a division
to be drawn between us and the regular
populace because as you said earlier
Tony we handle new phones all the time
right them but you know so we have to
kind of keep a level head about us when
we're evaluating these things for
consumers but I think what would they
there's an analogy between when a
regular consumer says will i buy this
and use it as my regular phone you know
we we don't really say that but we do
often say amongst ourselves would you
really want to review this because you
know that's about as intimate as we get
with a phone right it is reviewing
because you get to know every single
part in every nook and cranny and based
on I base my self perception of a device
of my perception of advice on whether I
want to review it as things stand
currently i would love to review the HTC
One I'm not going to but I would love to
I I based on what we've seen from the
leaks if the leaks are accurate I am not
at all interested in reviewing the
galaxy s4 um and I think that helps to
reinforce my sense of what's important
to me and certainly hardware it's a big
part of it but Tony I will district i
will take a different tack from you it
doesn't matter how much better the
galaxy s4 camera is if it comes in that
body I don't want to pee I don't want
any piece of it yeah that's what I said
if it just happens the camera and
without the new design it's still the
one right oh ok sorry then I misheard
you then yes then you and I are in total
agreement yeah um anyway we're we're
gonna find out what it is I mean for now
I'm somewhat enamored of the one but I'm
within the 24 hour envelope and I
therefore I'm not trustworthy I'm just
in the honeymoon phase so we do need to
wrap it up though because I do need to
get to work and listeners that work
involves creating more content we're
going to have another HTC One comparison
out as far as the camera goes that will
be a text piece maybe another lengthy
one and there will also be a video
comparing the HTC One to an earlier
smartphone so you'll want to check that
out also another reminder that we are
going to be covering the galaxy s4 event
in the matter that Tony described
earlier in the show I'm really glad to
hear Joe that you're going to be on the
pocket now live for that the special
edition that'll be exciting yes it will
and of course I'm gonna be in New York
with Brandon and then I'm gonna be
gulping coffee yeah yeah yeah that's
gonna be too am for you yeah yeah yeahs
sacrifices we wait I know it's tough so
so everybody out there just dropped Tony
line and tell him you appreciate his
sacrifice to be with us and to share the
world of tech with us I don't say that
nearly enough so I'm gonna pimp you Tony
his dang I it's hard enough for me to go
at six or seven a.m. and and do stuff
but you're up in the middle of the
freaking night so thank you I
I don't know exactly me waking up at ten
to do this podcast is very rough on me
but guys let's gather view of some
closing thoughts before we head on out
um yeah I think I think that tomorrow at
7pm or shortly after 7pm we will be at
least once at one time wild by the
Samsung announcement I'm not sure I have
that I have that feeling I mean either
these leaks are just dummies and Samsung
is doing whatever they did last year
with the S free and they are controlling
the leaks and it's gonna happen
something completely different or even
if these are true there's going to be
something which will allow us agreed it
definitely there's they're surprises in
store and there it's not going to be a
total disappointment of an event then
we're going to get a lot of video if
they give us some hands-on time so it'll
be fun to trade opinions on that and
it's dead from definitely tune in for
next week's show because we're gonna
have a lot to say aren't we like always
yes we might go past 45 minutes we might
even be my team for the first time in
the weeklies history Joe anything to to
lead us out yeah I'm gonna sound like a
broken record and I I don't mean to do
that but look at what we've got today
guys if we're arguing between two
wonderful beautiful high spec devices
everybody's entitled to their own
opinion about which one they like more
but we're carrying around a powerhouse
in our pocket let's let's make use of
that let's make the world a better place
let's participate in good uplifting
conversations with these wonderful tools
and it's a wonderful time to be alive
and just to show the same amount of love
to everybody there's no just only these
two devices there's also other
spectacular devices out there like the
Xperia Z which we are reviewing and by
the time this podcast will be up the
review will also be up so make sure to
check that one Taylor Martin's first
review for pocket now I cannot wait I've
seen it in a brush or Taylor spray right
I've seen it in his prototype form it
looks good yeah definitely check that
out dizzy dizzy doesn't get my motor
running
even I would read that review and I was
like this is great stuff maybe the ZL
will and neither I since I can't do
anything that interests me apparently on
the hand side side but but tablets
anyway that's a whole nother discussion
so for now we're gonna leave it be and
we're gonna put a closing stamp on this
episode of the weekly I don't know what
that means but we're definitely yeah
