calm i'm going to show you a little bit
about microsoft's new service called
office 365 and how it works with the
windows phone 7 so let's check it out
first off let me show you the office 365
service a little bit about what that
comes with and how it works on a tablet
pc or we go desktop so first off i want
you to know you can join the beta free
but only one of these versions will work
with Windows Phone 7 see it says getting
started with small business or get
started with enterprise what they don't
tell you is the small business beta
version right now does not work with
Windows Phone 7 it's been disabled but
it should be able to work when it's
finished and it's you can pay for it so
if you want to test windows phone 7 with
office 365 right now you should sign up
for the enterprise version so that's
what we've got and it's working so there
you go first off let's see here's the
administer you can add all sorts of
users all sorts of management features
here that's a pretty straightforward you
can download a setup files that will
help make it really view to set up out
looking office 2010 on a desktop you
also get the exchange 2010 account so
this is the web version all your email
calendar contacts and tasks right here
accessible from any web page and of
course this you can just set up in
outlook 2010 right down there I have to
do is login with your username password
same with windows phone or any phone any
mobile phone that supports exchange is
going to just set up right from the
username and password so that's real
easy we also have a your link
integration up here I can set which
status I am and there's link down there
this is for instant messaging between
corporate users as well as video calls
and conference calls so that's cool
feature to that can close that and we
also have a SharePoint site so when you
sign up for office 365 you can have you
can add bunch users and they can all
have access to SharePoint site you can
set different access permissions so some
people can only access certain parts and
there's tons of stuff you can do here so
let's just look at this so we've got
tons of little lists here's some tasks
you can create tasks and assign them to
different people so there you go you can
do description all of this stuff here's
a calendar so this is a shared work
group calendar that all the people with
access to it can back you know add in
see the appointments you can also
connect it to Outlook go to the cellar
exes lots of cool stuff let me go back
oh here's some other libraries I have a
pictures library I made that so this can
hold pictures as I'm loading and you can
add any lit anything there we also have
a shared documents library so this is
where I uploaded some documents and we
can actually click on one and this is
going to open the web app so there's my
SharePoint notebook in the sharepoint
note of the OneNote web app and we can
see which things synced over some of
them didn't work right there's some
files touched let's go back
there's a word document I can open in
word or edit in browser some pretty good
web apps I've also uploaded a PDF and a
picture to the shared documents library
and if this has great integration with
office 2010 as well so see here's my
OneNote notebook I can access the
SharePoint notebook and there it is it
all syncs up and here is the SharePoint
workspace that I have set up this is a
application that comes with the office
2010 and I can access everything here as
well so there's my shared library and
there's the same files so I can open
this and it'll open in word there it is
now all I have to do is edit it and then
choose save and I'll go back into the
SharePoint site really great integration
now if I make a new word document it's
really easy to put it on to SharePoint I
just go to state and send save to
SharePoint and it's already set up my
shortcuts so there it is right there I
just select that and click Save so
there's some really great integration
there ok so how does this all work with
Windows Phone 7 and the Office hub well
here we are this is the office of don't
forget the exchange 2010 account you can
really easily set that up so that'll get
your email and contacts and calendar
right in there right away but for the
sharepoint stuff we have to go to office
and we have to go to the SharePoint
section and we have to go to open URL
and then we type in the SharePoint URL
which is ok
it's not it's going to be this URL up
there and once you type in the URL it's
going to go to a web-based login page
where you enter your username and
password and then if all goes well it'll
show up with something like this so
there's my SharePoint workspace the one
that we were just looking at on the
tablet pc you can see announcements form
templates links shared documents there's
15 there and tasks so the tasks there's
the tasks that I created and
unfortunately can't edit this or
anything it's just a readable so you can
read what that is and same with other
things like links I can't click on it or
edit it it's just there and I can read
it that's a slight limitation but let's
look at the shared documents whoo look
at all that so share documents come over
just fine and we can see that this
picture in the shared documents library
is going to load it's a refreshing
there's the picture in my share diagnose
library
and all these files work fine there's
the word document it's connecting it's
downloading it making sure it's got the
right version give it a minute okay
there we are there's the word document
can edit it
there's some edits and that can save and
it's going to save back to SharePoint if
I do save as I can only save to the
Office hub there we go it's going to
save back to sharepoint
and that's done
and we have PDFs
there's a PDF floating in Acrobat Reader
or it out of the office hub okay and
everything else works there one other
thing that you want to know I create a
new document I cannot save it to
SharePoint I can only save it to the
office of and then from there I can only
email so that's a little limitation as
well now one thing you notice when I go
to the SharePoint workspace remember
that pictures library that I made it's
not showing up so it would seem that
some libraries do not show up when you
sync it on windows phone 7 so all those
pictures are not going to be able to
download here but pictures in the shared
documents libor I do so you got to put
it in the right type of library for it
to sink of course this is all beta
office 365 we're not sure exactly when
i'll be out it's supposedly going to
start at six dollars per user per month
we'll see if that's true right now it's
just in free beta and this only covers
the current windows phone 7 features
you'll probably see more coming soon in
the mango update anyway that's it for
now hope you enjoyed this video just
thumbs up
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
