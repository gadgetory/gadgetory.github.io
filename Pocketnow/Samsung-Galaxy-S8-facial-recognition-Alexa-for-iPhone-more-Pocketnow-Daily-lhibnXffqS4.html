galaxy s 8 in its facial recognition
Amazon's Alexa makes a jump into iOS
territory sort of and why don't we add
yet another luxury brand into the
Android wear mix I'm high memory that I
and well I've always dreamed ever since
I was a kid to have a jersey baseball
jersey from Voltron thank you RIPT
apparel this is out daily the
official news today begin with deals we
actually admire a lot of the latest
Android tablets mainly because well
you'd get a lot for your money they're
not the cheapest but they provide some
of the best specifications and
experience and for example there are a
ton of mate books right now that are as
well as 399 you can learn more about
these deals in the link in the
description other official news has to
do with Android wear of Mont Blanc it's
just joined the android wear spectrum as
the company has just announced a few
Android wear smartwatches they are not
the most or least expensive 890 dollars
is the starting point the design is not
really that great but then again if
you're out there for a luxury brand and
a SmartWatch then this is yet another
option even if you can strap a Ferrari
watch face did pretty much every other
Android wear SmartWatch and speaking of
Android believe it or not one of the
companies that has shined in Android
updates is one plot the company that did
not shine all of last year Android 71
Darwin has just made it to the one plus
3 and 1 plus 3t through oxygen OS 4.1
and the amount of changes are really
incremental it's really nothing to
report on as a major change but still it
is just great to c 1 plus finally get
this one as well they figured out
hardware now they figured out software
and the one plus 3t continues to be one
of my favorites bones of last year and
pretty much of this year as well now
let's talk about Amazon's Alexis service
the company has just rolled it out to
iOS on both iphones and ipads but the
thing is it's not going to work like we
expect it to work on them 89 very soon
here really what you're getting is an
enhanced shopping experience because
it's going to work on amazon shopping
application pretty much you can't really
replace anything l
like replace any digital assistant or
anything no not really all you can
really do is shop with it and that's
really what we always expect from amazon
anyways and finally the very hot in
should they actually have to do with
digital assistants let's talk about the
samsung galaxy s 8 we've got some very
trusted sources that are claiming a
couple of things number one is that
apparently we are getting at the dual
systems but if it's not based on this
technology we're wondering exactly what
it is then and then second is we've got
some teasers from Samsung we noticed the
dates at the bottom and the fact that we
might be getting the galaxy s 8 as soon
as April but even more interesting is
the fact that we hear more about facial
recognition it is coming to the phone
and apparently it's going to be a major
deal up to the point where you can
actually use it for samsung pay so this
is a really great reason for you to want
to use a feature like this obviously
facial recognition has been hit-or-miss
since the days of ice cream sandwich
back in android so it leads me to the
question of the day from all the past
experiences with facial recognition
would you trust it and give it a try or
we just remain safe and stick to the
fingerprint scanner in my case because
of the place in the fingerprint scanner
I will definitely give it a try but
leave us a comment down below we look to
know your opinion friends you know the
way it goes if you want to get to lose
earlier before the video is filmed
although was I'm talking out I've come
and hit that subscribe button down below
for more videos like this one you can
also follow me on Twitter hind
underscore that I'll run into the ground
behind that we better please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am high netted I thanks so much
for watching we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
