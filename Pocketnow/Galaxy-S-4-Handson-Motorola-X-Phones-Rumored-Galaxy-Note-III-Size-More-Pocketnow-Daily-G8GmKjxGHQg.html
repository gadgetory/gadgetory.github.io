the heck out of it Motorola X phone
rumors are just customisable hardware
and rumors say that the Galaxy Note 3
will be extra-large I'm high memory beta
and even though I'm tired I have little
sleep I have a ton of plans for the
weekend this is PocketNow daily that's
right our galaxy s4 coverage is now live
we have a full hands-on video along with
a full comparison between black and
white to help you choose which is the
color for you and alongside with that we
also have a comparison with the HTC One
we also have a comparison with the
iPhone 5 and even the departing Galaxy
s3 which is your next device it's really
hard to pick well we also have an
episode of pocket now live that discuss
is absolutely everything about the
galaxy s phone and the impressions from
Brandon minimun on the show floor so let
us know what you think which is your
next device is it the Galaxy s4 and
speaking of the galaxy s4 retailers are
already believing that this device will
be the best-selling smartphone in the
world for 2013 according to them this
phone will be a gold mine and they're
even plan for pre-orders even though
samsung didn't really mention specific
dates or pre-orders on their website or
whatever but the question is do you
really believe that this phone will be
the best selling phone of 2013 I mean it
looks pretty much the same as the galaxy
s3 do you really believe that to be
possible it was a comment now some
competitors weren't at all happy with
the galaxy s4 and such as the case of
HTC's president Jason Mackenzie who came
on record to state that the presentation
for the galaxy s4 went from nice to
pretty much embarrassing and you know we
kind of agree I mean I think that
Samsung went too far when it came to the
tap dancing and all the showing and
everything and they pretty much removed
the spotlight from the phone to feature
all the tap dancers and all the acting
that was going on and then backs to
wonder if the Galaxy s4 is as cool as
they say it is and then again Mackenzie
also went on record to state that the
HTC One is as a barrier device because
it's made of aluminum and then you come
to the point where some people just
debate I mean some people believe that
beautiful phones are better than phones
that give you the better specs and some
people believe otherwise so in your case
what do you prefer in my particular case
I would rather have a phone that would
give me everything that obviously tastes
differ
so leave us a comment let us know what
you want and yes the Galaxy Note 3
rumors are back and it's been tossed
around whether this device will have a
5.9 inch display or a 6.3 inch display
but for those of you that we're
wondering apparently this device will be
gigantic and the reason why is because
Samsung is also showing off a new game
pad that will retail with the galaxy s4
as a new accessory that will allow you
to play games and for me that's kind of
genius I wonder why other companies had
not figured that out before but the
interesting part is that apparently this
game pad according to specifications
will fit both 4-inch displays up to six
point three inch displays so for those
of you that we're wondering how big the
Galaxy Note 3 will be well I guess you
got your answer and finally for even
more interesting news today and yes it's
about Motorola but it is interesting
first of all apparently the X phone is
not really an X phone but actually a
next line of devices that are coming in
the future to Motorola a lot of rumors
are being tossed first of all the first
octa-core processor on a Motorola phone
which is interesting even though their
previous devices haven't really
delivered when it came to software even
with all the hardware but even more
interesting is that apparently Motorola
will have phones ala carte meaning you
can tailor your device to fit whatever
specific needs you want so that really
leads me to the question of the day we
had actually in a tutorial a couple of
weeks ago where we were wondering if it
would be great to have a la carte phones
so would you love phones that are
customisable that's actually the
question would you prefer a phone that
you could tailor to your own specific
needs just think about it I believe that
this is a genius idea the phone would be
sold online and you would choose your
processor your color your amount of RAM
absolutely everything your display in
order to fit both your needs in your
wallet as well and you wouldn't have to
actually just settle for whatever the
carrier or manufacturer has decided for
you to have you can decide what phone
really fits you it would be the Motorola
X you pretty much so leave us a comment
down below I consider the idea to be
genius and I really want that to happen
and yes for an earlier scruple of
everything that's happening in the swan
