calm and this is another episode of the
windows phone 7 app roundup and which we
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get started electric
themes is a fun and challenge game in
which you must move the electrical
inputs to light up various lights so I
will start on level 2 here and just
click on there so what I want to do is
move these pieces over to one of these
sides and what I want to do is to light
up all these lights in this arrangement
of this beam so there I go and now to
light up on three of them I can go over
here and move this one down here and
move this one over here and the game
continues on just like this if you
remember JS ball from back in the day on
pcs ice ball is sort of a clone of that
game so i'll just tap here so what I
want to do is to isolate each one of
these balls into a smaller shape than
this rectangle so I'm going to go here
and hope that my ice balls do not hit
the bar before I close it off so let me
try this again and unfortunately I hit
that one so i will try this one more
time there we go so to beat the game
what you want to do is to get your
pieces into a smaller and smaller square
swiping man is a surprisingly
challenging game in which you must move
you're swiping man onto one of these
platforms from dangling on the rope and
what i want to do is to launch my
swiping man onto one of these platforms
and the further you go into the game the
more platforms show up and the more
difficult the levels become and have
already died once so I can continue down
the game and I've made level two and the
object of the game is to get the highest
score possible course it's so
frustrating that what makes you want to
continue to play so photobucket is a
great application if you want to store
the photos that you've taken on your
Windows Phone 7 device directly onto the
photobucket server so i can view all my
recently added uploads here so i can
view all these cell phones that i've
uploaded i can also search for things so
look they want to find an image so i can
just search here let's just search for
balloon
and we will hit go and we will wait for
this to lope and we have many balloon
photos that we can save and share with
our and we have many balloon photos that
we can view and save on to our windows
phone 7 device if you're in the market
for a new home or just want to compare
what homes are going for in your area
you can use this real tour com
application and let's say they want to
find homes for sale live just click on
here and we'll find nearby homes ok so
here we have quite a few homes and you
can see that they're ranging from around
340 for up to six hundred thousand
dollars so quite a big price difference
apparently if you're in the right
location that's great you can also view
rentals so if you need a place to stay
open homes and start a new search so
