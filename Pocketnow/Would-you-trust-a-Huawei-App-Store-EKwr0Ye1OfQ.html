is expanding its way and making it to
future Google pixels iOS 13 beta hints
that we might be getting us PC on 2019
after all and Huawei is already asking
developers to put their apps on its own
app gallery I'm Jaime Rivera and Tuesday
is going to be about pre recording
because travel is upon us as always it's
always great to have the news for you
guys this is far down daily the official
news today begin with deals I mean if
you're in the market for Google pixel 3
it's not necessarily my favorite phone
but it's not a bad phone it's got a
great camera on probably not the best
design in the world but the thing about
it is right now Google pixel 3 excel is
$650 on B&amp;amp;H and you get 3 months of mint
mobile and so $650 and you get 3 months
of mint mobile prepaid for that's the
value of $60 where you get it for free
so I jump on that it's actually a really
good deal and the camera is on the pixel
will not disappoint and for all of you
that went crazy for the new Mac Pro and
the pro Display XD are obviously I'm
sure you all went crazy for the stand a
thousand dollar one as well obviously
Apple didn't provide specific dates for
a launch but we already have trusted
sources that are claiming that September
is the date this is actually a lot
earlier than we expect and some people
were speculating November probably late
October I'd say late September still a
good deal it's just obviously you're
talking about it
$5,000 display almost six thousand
dollar computer and guys don't buy the
stand I'm sure you can find a vase
amount for a lot less money and you
could just use that mounting bracket as
well think about it is that for those of
you in the market obviously the Mac Pro
has its advantages it is probably going
to be the most powerful computer but it
launches and also the most crazy
expensive for the stand price now for
those of you that are going crazy over
the Galaxy Note tender then we currently
have on the s10 and pretty much every
other galaxy which you're stuck in quick
charge to it seems that there were
rumors of a 45 watt charger coming with
the galaxy note now we've got some
trusted sources from xda-developers
claiming that know that apparently it's
gonna be a 25 watt
we know that there are two variants it
could be that one brings the 45 the
other brings in 25 but no according to
the source it's no it's 25 watts it's
the highest one and the thing about it
is there is a 40 white 45 watt charger
coming it's just not coming for the note
apparently it's coming for the galaxy a
9 B when is that going to come no idea
but we do know that Samsung likes the
test technology on mid Ranger's and then
launch it on its flagships so true that
it could be that we're getting it on the
galaxy s 11 we'll see and how about we
talk about the global pixel for I mean
we know that there have been some
renders but we also hear the Google is
trying out three different design
companies as to what this phone should
look like and the interesting part is
some renders that have just emerged
where we see a stove camera at the back
which is hilarious because truly it's
become popular because of Apple and the
possible design of the iPhone 11 but the
thing about it is we also know that this
has been the design of the made 20 pro
for the longest time so the thing about
it is still design at the back
apparently there will be a minor notch
at the front with a speaker we don't see
any selfie cameras which is weird it
could just be that these are very well
hidden under that and knotch and
apparently there could be an on display
fingerprint scanner let us know in the
comments I mean do you like the still
design for the pixel or for any phone
for that matter because I don't really
mind it on the May 20 Pro because it's
in the middle of the device but these
companies want to experiment with
placing it on the side which I don't
understand why we'll see what we get and
for those of you that are wondering when
is Apple going to kill lightning I don't
think it's gonna happen anytime soon I
mean if you buy keyboards or the mouse
or the Magic Trackpad from Apple even
air pots they come with a you know
lightning connector but the thing about
it is that in iOS 13 beta there is a
restore screen that it's just the merge
that it's not for iPads it's actually
for an iPhone that shows a USBC
connector and obviously we are seeing
that Apple is making a major move in iOS
13 for iPad OS for you to be able to
take advantage of USB see we're not
exactly sure that that's going to be an
iPhone thing but I mean why not even for
the max whatever max variant we get it
would make a lot of sense for at least
this phone to bring us BC but whatever
the case may be
obviously things will continuum
over time and finally the hottest dishes
that I have to do with backup plans for
what to expect for huawei phones and I
know that we've been discussing this
topic so much it's just it's so hard and
it evolves over time so much that it's
hard not to cover it the thing about it
is for those of you wondering what will
happen to the App Store as we were
covering yesterday it seems that Huawei
has already started reaching out to
developers and telling them that they
should port their applications to work
on huawei zap gallery and by porting I
mean just make them available because
these are still Android applications if
you think about it and it seems that the
email is being pitched as we have 350
million users out of which 270 million
are active right now so just placing
your apps on our store is going to be
beneficial for you because you don't get
to lose consumers it makes all the sense
in the world if you think about it this
app gallery is pre-installed on huawei
phones already it's not like if you have
to install it anymore because it's
necessary if you want to use the phone
in China anyways but in today's question
let us know I mean we've been used to
the Google Play Store for so many years
that has been the default way that we
interact with Android applications truly
you have the Amazon App Store separately
but would you trust the Huawei's app
gallery because in my case I can't say
that I wouldn't because it's already
pre-installed on every will - that I've
used I just ignore it because all the
apps I want are in Google Play but if
you have to pick what you pick or I
don't know trust the app gallery or
would you demand that while we use
Google Play in my case I don't know
again as I mentioned it's very hard for
me but think about the fact that I would
really want something like Google Play
protect which is something that Google
is providing we'll see what happens
