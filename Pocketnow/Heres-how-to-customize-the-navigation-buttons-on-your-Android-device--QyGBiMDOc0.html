Android customization I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow and this is how to
customize the soft neva Gatien buttons
on your Android device customization is
one of Android strongest suits it's the
only platform that truly puts the power
in the hands of its users and allows
them to create a truly customized and
personalized experience there is
literally no end to the number of
changes you can make to your device's UI
you can change the launcher the keyboard
the theme of the keyboard the ROM
recovery and practically every pixel of
the device's interface until recently
however there's been one part of the
Android UI that's not quite as easy to
change the soft navigation buttons sure
there have been customized navigation
buttons in various roms since
CyanogenMod 9 most notably paranoid
android with integrated PI controls if
you want a truly custom experience
paranoid Android is definitely worth
checking out
but if you want something that's much
more plug-and-play the easiest way to
customize your navigation buttons is
with solved key Z it's an application
that can be downloaded from Google Play
in a matter of seconds though there are
some caveats the application itself is a
dollar ninety-nine it requires root and
it requires busybox to be installed if
none of that turns you away soft key Z
is certainly worth checking out simply
download the application and open it
when the super user prompt appears grant
the application permission and read
through the tutorial if that's your sort
of thing before you do anything else you
may want to consider hitting the backup
button at the top of the app which will
backup your stock button configuration
to go one step further as it should be
second nature to anyone who mods
regularly it's a smart idea to also
perform a nandroid backup before
beginning as this will alter some
framework files if you somehow lose your
original back up you can simply restore
the nandroid backup and start over once
you've taken care of all the
precautionary steps you're ready to
start customizing your navigation
buttons simply open the application hit
the Skip start soft easy button press
Continue and begin selecting the style
of navigation buttons you want you can
choose an entire set mix a match or you
can even import your own
again now is a great time to hit the
backup button before you get started
just so you can get back to the original
configuration once you have selected the
soft buttons you want simply press the
check box your phone will perform a
quick soft boot and once the boot
finishes and you slide past the lock
screen you will see the brand-new
navigation buttons you picked out neat
and simple to revert to the stock button
configuration open the application again
press the backup button at the top and
simply select apply backup the phone
will once again reboot and when it does
the original soft buttons will be back
in place and if you want to test your
skills you can attempt to make your own
buttons like I've done here I'm a huge
fan of the Roboto typeface so it created
some minimal text buttons with the
Roboto light font and also made some in
red and all lowercase
