has begun to share press invitations
rumours lame but Samsung plans to launch
a very early Galaxy S 9 the Moto X 4 has
just made its official debut at Aoife
I'm Jaime Rivera and the biggest problem
with the ephah is that as the show
begins our coverage is actually ramping
up but this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with t-mobile
and carrier and the craziness that
happens every time Z Mobile has an event
September 6 set your calendars
apparently there is yet another and
carry event to happen we're not exactly
sure what the company is going to bring
but given the fact that we're getting
close to new iPhones and a lot of every
other thing yeah this might be a very
interesting show to attend to those will
the spotlight over to Lenovo Motorola
yesterday we saw the Moto X for our
hands on video is already live and
believe it or not even though many
people were underwhelmed by this phone
because of its specifications and the
fact that it looks more like a premium
mid-range er it turns out that the phone
is actually very beautiful very
practical to use it reminds us of
absolutely everything that made the Moto
X line a popular again watch our
hands-on video to learn more and we
cannot wait to have our review until
more you tell you more about it now
let's talk about Lenovo again for those
of you that remember the whole Jedi game
and everything that was being teased a
couple of weeks ago it turns out that
the Lenovo Mirage is that new AR headset
that is actually less expensive than I
thought I hear that the whole bundle is
going to be around 300 dollars you have
that opportunity to play that gel Jedi
challenge this game and it turns out
that the experience wasn't bad we
actually tested out last night it wasn't
bad at all for the price tag hopefully
it becomes something more than just a
Jedi game because I'm gonna be bored of
playing with that sword all the time now
let's move the spotlight over to Samsung
for those of you that are not wondering
when the s9 is going to launch because
the note 8 is pretty much a couple of
weeks away yes we already have rumors of
the s9 we've been covering up for the
last couple of days and we hear that
Samsung is planning to have a very early
launch to compete January as an event
that could be CES and a probable launch
as soon as February why would the
company do it so early we don't know
exactly why but we do hear that there
aren't many changes on the
new galaxies so it does make sense for
the company to iterate early and finally
the very interesting news today actually
happened like 30 minutes after the
pocket hotel he was already recorded
Apple has sent out press invitations for
its event to happen at the Steve Jobs
theater on September 12th and we're
still trying to figure out what is shown
in this Apple logo I mean a lot of
people are already trying to predict
that the company is already teasing the
new design of the iPhone through the
logo whatever the case may be we are
expecting the latest iPhone in addition
to a 4k Apple TV and other features but
it leads me to the question of the day
number one what do you think the logo
means number two are you excited or re
are you already set with devices like
the B 30 from LG or the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
