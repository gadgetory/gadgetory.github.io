didn't get a new version of android
officially released we did get a
Developer Preview that landed just this
morning I'm Joe Levi with pocket now
this is a first look and hands-on with
Android L on the Nexus 5 before we get
started we need to point out that this
is not an alpha this is not a beta this
is a developer preview which you can
download today for that link you'll want
to head over to pocketnow.com and we
will show you where you can go to
download either the SDK or the image for
your nexus 5 or your Wi-Fi Nexus 7 but
let's jump into it this is the lock
screen and as you can see highlighted
first and foremost we've got the the new
notifications that they showed off at
the event will go ahead and scroll up to
unlock go back home notice we've got new
buttons down here on-screen buttons back
now looks like the Google Play icon just
pointing the other direction home is a
circle that's kind of reminiscent of
some other things then our running tasks
which now are in the full card based
motif the material design is a basic
square let's go back home we've got a
basic overview welcome make yourself at
home this is a tutorial kind of like
we've seen before well okay out of that
organize your space hangouts now does
sms so stuff that we're familiar with
we've got this nice brown and a light
blue wallpaper running and brand-new
version of our app drawer icon folders
get a little bit different look to them
a little bit of a new keyboard here it
looks a lot more flat this is very
obviously the google keyboard has the
same personalization information and you
can see a little bit different way that
its handling the numbers above the
letter let's look at the app drawer
pretty much the same thing we don't have
the the play store or the marketplace
icon up there so very similar to the
Google now launcher in that respect got
a nice tilt effect like we've seen in
the past go back home and pretty much
everything we do now has this ripple
effect that they talked about so if you
can look closely down here we've got a
glow there around the browser we've got
a ripple on the home button let's see
what our notifications say I've already
taken a screenshot I can share
immediately right from here I don't have
to go in and open up any app or even
open up the gallery to find it i can
share right there let's go into our
Wi-Fi settings pull this down
notification shade and notice over here
we've got some much different
iconography we no longer have what we
had over there on the side our time
clock is now bigger go ahead and tap on
this little less snowman this little
person over here very different in fact
this looks an awful lot like what we saw
on the asuste padfone x just from a few
days ago very very similar we want to go
into settings we're going to tap on the
COG from here very very pastel but not
Apple pastel it's kind of a more subdued
subdued theme we pull it down you can
notice we've got that shadow effect on
the bottom we do too so no more balanced
no more glow just the the shadow a new
toggle switch over here too it's more
like a a knob rather than it is a square
button like we had in the past you can
go in and look at additional settings
pretty much the same as what we'd come
to expect to go back out of that you can
see I've got an authentication problem
because I type my password in wrong but
that's what it would look like for you
in the same situation now we're in
settings let's go ahead and take a look
through bluetooth is off we'll turn that
on nice little subtle animation there
picking out what we're running this is
the nexus 5 running android version l
they're not calling it licorice or
lollipop or lemon meringue or anything
like that just l at least for now our
dialer looks a bit different notice
we've got our dial pad icon down at the
bottom and when we move it it scoots out
of the way just quickly and easily like
that so it's still there it's there for
you but it's not in your way it's not
maintaining that place right in the
middle unless that's where it should be
and again the nice subtle animations and
drop shadows that go along with that you
have it Android L on the Nexus 5 now

conference has been built into this
