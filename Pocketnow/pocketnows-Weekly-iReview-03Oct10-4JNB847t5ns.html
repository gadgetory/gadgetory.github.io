developers rumors are that the iphone
3gs will get HDR photography after all
and PayPal is working harder to turn
your iphone into your next wallet all
this and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hina to be better than
welcome to the pocket nail I review the
show we go through all the week school
and they're not so cool inside the world
of Apple's iOS devices as always let's
start off with the cool one of the
things that really amazed this this week
is how Apple is being quick about
releasing their beta to developers
lately right now they're on their beta 2
of iOS 4.2 and we're still expecting it
to be really cool for November really no
big things happening right now barely a
couple of improvements on speed and
stability apparently the only thing they
actually did work on was releasing
itunes 10.1 beta alongside iOS 4.2 beta
2 and apparently it's only for them to
be able to test their airprint services
on or through the new itunes service and
apparently well that's going to be it
itunes 10.1 is going to be the name of
itunes available for iOS 4.2 so let's
see what happens eventually when
everything is released in November
considering on with more cool news if
you remember one of our biggest rents
and one of our pest I reviews was the
fact that we were not going to get HDR
photography for the iphone 3gs and that
Apple didn't say anything well it seems
that iOS 4.2 or probably a later version
is going to bring HDR photography to the
iphone 3gs surely there are ways to
jailbreak your device engage get HDR
photography for now but some people
really prefer to go through with the
official releases really nothing
confirmed just yet we don't know what to
expect so we'll see what happens
eventually when Apple does release iOS
4.2 probably will get a surprise right
there another cool thing that's
happening is that paypal is releasing an
update to their iOS application that
will allow you to deposit checks using
your iOS device how will this work well
you'll have to take a picture of the
check and the device or the camera and
the software will figure out what the
check is and actually deposit that to
your balance this actually not new had
already been implemented by Chase Bank
so it's really cool
technology is becoming mainstream and
other services and let's hope paypal
continues evolving their services into
allowing you to do even more and more
things that will save you a couple of
minutes or hours making line at the bank
just to get your check deposited so
we'll hope that this feature becomes
available to other banks eventually
really cool another cool thing that
happened this week is that the Apple TV
aside from being released also brought
us information on its firmware if you
remember the iphone 4 is considered to
be the iphone 3.1 for them internally i
don't know what's the reason or what's
the point but it seems that the firmware
of the Apple TV also mentions the
existence of an iphone 3.2 and an iphone
3.3 what are these I'm not even going to
mention the verizon iphone because i'm
tired about that but could it be the
iphone 5 already being in works or could
it be I don't know some sort of an
existing update to Apple fixing
antennagate in that being iPhone 3.3 or
3.2 could be you never know rumors are
still rumors and we don't know what to
expect and most probably we won't know
till next year you know how much it
takes for Apple to test the unit but at
least we know that Apple is already on
the workcenter well let's hope it's an
iphone 5 or something for other carriers
we never know what to expect yet
let's start off with the not-so-cool
September 30th has already passed the
iphone 4 case program has ended and as
of now Apple is not saying anything
about their and tenets issues they're
not saying if they actually release the
new batch of devices or if we can expect
that the I don't know antennagate issues
that miraculously been forgotten so what
happens for people that actually buy an
iphone 4 as of now what can they expect
well you can pay 30 bucks for your
bumper case for now or any sort of a
colon cases because that's pretty much
it no confirmation no rumor is nothing
everything's been shut don't really know
what to expect but I don't know Apple I
mean do something about it at least
extend your case program more confirm
that your new device is being released
as of now won't have the issues and for
more not so cool news it seems that ping
has really not been what Apple expected
aside from the fact that it doesn't work
with facebook at the Apple and Facebook
really haven't I don't know figured it
out on how they're going to implement
this it seems that it's really not doing
very good i mean aside from the fact
that a lot of people are already
subscribers that's pretty much it i mean
nobody's following anybody it's really
not as mainstream it out as apple ii
expected they did release an update on
itunes 10.1 to actually offer more
services for ping as it stands I think
Apple really lost a lot of time on that
instead of working on itunes on the
cloud so back to the drawing board huh
that's it for today's i'll review thank
