improvements for windows in it's built
conference Samsung's q1 earnings show us
that the smartphone king is back in tech
yours Android wear SmartWatch is rumored
to be hotter than we expected I'm high
metal Iveta and how's the weather in
your area cuz it's currently raining
hail sleet cats and dogs here this is
PocketNow daily let's begin today with
the official news as Samsung's quarter
results are in and the smartphone king
is back the company lured 5.6 billion
dollars in profit which is good but even
more interesting it has 24.1% of the
smartphone market compared to 17.6% of
the smartphone market when it comes to
Apple so yeah this is the smartphone
King again Sam sink supremacy is back
and this is before the launch of the
galaxy s6 so let's see how the galaxy s6
makes sampson look up next sorry about
Microsoft the companies built conference
happened today and there are so much
news I'm gonna condense it into which
we're probably the hottest ones starting
with the fact that Microsoft is making
some interesting changes if you want to
develop apps for Windows or Windows
Phone there are some new tools on
Windows 10 that will allow developers to
natively pull applications from Android
through JavaScript code or objective-c
code for iOS and use that to build a
very quick wouldn't those application
through drag and drop settings and stuff
like that it is really cool to see that
Microsoft is being aggressive about
bringing applications let's just see if
developers do so other news from
Microsoft have the Spartan browser
renamed that's now being called
Microsoft edge and yeah during the build
conference they showed us everything
that the edge browser can do but the
coolest part was again the company is
being aggressive with cross-platform
stuff so now they're allowing Google
Chrome add-ons and Firefox add-ons to
work natively not necessarily natively
but yeah they will work on the Microsoft
edge browser I was about to say Spartan
so these are cool things that are coming
let's see when the official launch
happens now some about Apple the company
was just granted a patent that
filed back in 2013 and it's called
humanized navigation information and
what that means is that you will now not
be hearing Apple maps telling you three
hundred meters or three hundred yards
here destination er head north you will
actually be told to turn in Walmart or
turn at Starbucks because it seems that
those Apple vans that we've seen in
leaks are apparently to get some
information on what stores are in
different streets and stuff like that
for Apple even though it seems that a
lot of it will be crowd-sourced as well
we'll keep you posted as a Apple
probably implements this in the future
and makes it smarter and finally for the
very hot news of the day we get to hear
about the Tag Heuer SmartWatch that's
being built in conjunction from Tag
Heuer Google and Intel it's an Intel
chip and yes it'll be running Android
wear and the cool thing is two things
the company's CEO just came on record to
state number one that the SmartWatch
will have 40 hours of battery life which
is already better than the Apple watch
and already better than every other
Android wear device in the market as
long as they can deliver but the second
is that this Tag Heuer SmartWatch will
cost $1400 and if that sounds steep for
you just think about the fact that that
Apple watch with the steel links
bracelet cost $1100 it is a crazy price
tag for the Apple watch but this is a
Tag Heuer that you'll be paying $1,400
for I know that there's a big market of
fans for tech here already so this lead
me to the question of the day if you had
the money would you buy attack your
Android wear SmartWatch or that steel
links Apple watch for $1,100 because in
my case honestly who I would pay for the
Tag Heuer the brand the Swiss brand is
so important it it's already so
streamlined that yeah I would prefer
something that's already a luxurious
product but leave us a comment down
below what is your case renze know the
drill if we want to get the news early
