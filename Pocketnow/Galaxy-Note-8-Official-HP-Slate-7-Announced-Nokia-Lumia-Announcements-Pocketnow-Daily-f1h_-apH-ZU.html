HP / Church the mobile space with a new
7-inch tablet and no kit releases a lot
of phones cheap phones that is I'm hi
marietta tamdan ready for action and
this is parking out daily oh man where
do I start so far we already have 23 mwc
2013 videos and this was just the first
day there is a lot more content coming
up so stay tuned and make sure you
follow the playlist for everything
that's happening at mwc 2013 but so far
one of the hottest news is the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 which was silently
released there's now available with the
usual suspect of specification that
everything that we already knew and the
design is pretty much everything that
was League now sadly as always who don't
have specific dates for a launch but
obviously this Galaxy Note 8 could be
your next device so make sure you follow
the links of the description because we
do have already a hands-on video and
also a comparison with the ipad mini and
with the nexus 7 and speaking of samson
they've also released this new media
player based on the x and o's processor
and that's being run by android this
looks a lot like the Apple TV where you
could actually just stream the content
from your galaxy device into your TV
using this box through a Wi-Fi network
but it's still hard to know if this
device will allow you to also purchase
content rent movies and everything else
you can do with the Apple TV now stay
tuned it'll be released in April no
pricing as always but stay tuned now
let's move over to know care they just
launched for new devices and I'm not
going to say smart phones because
they're not all smartphones but these
are cheap new mid-tier devices that are
planning to bring nokia technologies
into the entry-level market as if the
Nokia Lumia 920 wasn't already cheap
enough we've got the Lumia 520 in the
Lumia 720 good designs we already got a
lot of hands-on videos available but
obviously none of these devices are
overwhelming enough to say wow this is
the device that I'm going to write down
most probably the Lumia 920 will return
or remain being the flagship for a long
time but there are also two feature
phones that are not even going to waste
my time mentioning just make sure you
follow links in the description for full
details and videos of these devices now
let's talk about HP and don't look at me
funny I did say that right HP they
believe they just launched their first
android tablet it looks a lot like the
nexus 7 though well it's got
for price tag it only cost 170 dollars
and it's just interesting to see HP come
back to the mobile space after so many
attempts so many failed attempts and for
those of you asking yourselves what ever
happened to webos well can you believe a
company just sold it to LG and no it's
not to power smartphones the new Smart
TVs that are coming from LG in the
future we'll have webos sad news for
every one of us but the news for webos
they finally figured out what to do with
it and finally for the intriguing news
of the day we've got more samsung nuzen
you believe this is the company that did
not even show up with a president from
the VC and still they are the hottest
news of the day and the reason why is
because they show to pull up a stunt
that pretty much remove the spotlight
from every other company that published
anything at mwc today they just sent out
press invites for their unpacked event
for March 14th where they plan to reveal
their galaxy s4 yeah just think about
that it happens on the first day of mwc
and it also happens a day before the HTC
One gets released you get the point but
not easy to the question of the day is
the galaxy s4 a hot enough device for
you to actually wait for it after
everything you've seen today including
all the devices that were launched today
LG and just about everything please
follow the links there are so much that
I'm not going to mention all of them but
just think about it are you willing to
wait for the galaxy s4 or get an HTC One
a day later or pretty much I don't know
get any other devices that were
mentioned today I really want the HTC
One I just sadly don't like the whole
ultrapixel idea so leave us a comment
down below what are you waiting for I am
waiting for the galaxy s4 as always if
you want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone
