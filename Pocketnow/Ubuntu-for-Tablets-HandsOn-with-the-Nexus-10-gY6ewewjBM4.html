released to the public yesterday I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is Ubuntu touch on the Nexus 10
the first time your Nexus 7 or Nexus 10
boots with Ubuntu on it it'll be very
warm and fuzzy inside
not only because you're looking forward
to using it for the first time but
because the welcome screen this is not a
lock screen make no mistake it is a
welcome screen and it relays that
filling perfectly there are a lot of
warm red and purple tones that make you
feel very at ease and once you get past
the welcome screen once you get into the
operating system you should feel right
at home especially if you've used Ubuntu
before you will notice that this is
designed with unity in mind the colors
the layout and everything looks very
similar to how the desktop version of
Ubuntu looks but even if you haven't
used it before even if you've only used
Windows or OSX or even mobile operating
systems they're accused from each of
them that really make this familiar to
just about anyone it uses a very similar
interface to the Kindle Fire the
notification shade is similar to
Notification Center in iOS or the
notification shade and Android in the
way that phone and tablet applications
work beside one another it's very
similar to how Windows eight handles
applications keep in mind that this is a
Developer Preview and not everything
works
several of the applications that come
pre-installed on this or actually just
screenshots you tap the icon and it
opens just a screenshot of what the
application would be not everything
works the rear camera on the Nexus 10
did not work and the front camera on the
Nexus 7 didn't work either and there are
other features such as options and
settings that just simply don't exist
yet and it's very apparent after just a
few minutes with the operating system
that not everything is gonna work right
off the bat like the name suggests it's
only a preview and it's meant to show
developers and alike
how the operating system will work in
the future a sneak peek if you will as I
explained in the video yesterday with
the bun 2 hands-on with the Nexus 4 the
question many are asking is why should I
care about Ubuntu why would I want it on
my phone what is the benefit of it all
the main difference that canonical is
driving home is convergence the fact
that you could carry a single device to
do everything the version of Ubuntu you
have on your phone or tablet is a
full-fledged version that means you can
plug up peripherals and you can have a
full fledged desktop version wherever
you are monitor keyboard and mouse
that's all it takes and it will revert
to the desktop version so what is the
difference between Ubuntu for tablet to
Ubuntu for phones honestly not a lot but
they're big features that really
optimize the larger screen one you have
a horizontal layout on the tablet
version and a vertical layout on the
phone version and smaller tablets also
have a vertical layout the other big
difference is guest mode or multiple
user support can have multiple users
three four or five people use a single
tablet without having to share the same
data you also have what is called side
stages and those are the multiple views
you have a phone app and a tablet app
that can be ran side by side you can't
do two tablet applications side-by-side
but you can have phone applications such
as the dialer notes Twitter Facebook or
contacts side by side with the browser
music player or any other larger
applications keeping in mind that this
is just a Developer Preview that it's
not ready for primetime and it's just a
sneak peek at what we'll see next year I
could really see why I would want this
on a tablet I would also want it on a
phone if it were more refined and had
the application support I need a tablet
is a little bit of a different beast I
don't need necessarily all the same
applications I need on my phone but I
would need it to do more laborious tasks
and having a keyboard mouse and monitor
revert this to a full fledged version of
Ubuntu I can definitely see why I would
want it on a tablet however in its
current state it's very primitive and
there are a lot of things missing and
it's not ready to be a daily driver for
anyone using this I've had issues with
bugs where applications won't load I get
kicked back to the lockscreen and all
sorts of other little quirky things
where the operating system will just
spaz out for a minute and not take any
touch input and then jump through 15
screens it's fun and cool to play around
with for a little while but at the end
of the day I will flash back to Android
and enjoy applications and other things
for the time being so this has been a
look at Ubuntu touch on the Nexus 10 if
you liked this video give it a thumbs up
and subscribe to the channel and don't
forget to give us a follow on twitter
google+ and facebook I'm Taylor Martin
and I will see you next time
