paki medicom and stammers show you
probably one of the most addicting games
i've ever played on the windows mobile
device and this game is called hunting
and there is a free version available on
windows mobile marketplace so I'm just
going to go into start and there's a few
different levels I've already unlocked
the wilderness but I need to complete
the rest of them to unlock the
multiplayer battle and the siege and the
jungle on the plane so I'm just going to
go into the marsh again and now I have
three different levels that can play
easy normal or hard I can select either
a hundred rounds or in infinite rounds
and the game is pretty long so I'm just
going to select 100 rounds ok so the
object of the game is to prevent these
enemies or animals from exiting this
side of the screen and they have to
follow this predetermined path so what I
have to do is I have to defend my
territory I can just select on any one
of these areas that turns yellow and put
one of these defenders here I can either
have an archer a swordsman magician or a
barbarian so I can click one of these
and I can select my Archer and then
she'll begin defending my area so as you
see she's attacking these people so I'm
going to pause the game for a second now
all I have to do to actually increase
the strength of this character is select
on them and I need at least eight meat
and it says up here that I have 22 so
all I have to do is select on her and
then click level up and now she's more
forceful and now she'll chew two arrows
at a time so I'm gonna play the game
again and as you see if she's shooting
more powerfully than last time so if I
want to speed up things i'll have to
just click this double arrow right here
and they'll actually go a lot faster so
now I can add different different
defenders as soon as soon as she kills
these other enemies I get more meat so
then I can add more defenders so i can
add one of these guys here a swordsman
and the game can become very large the
first time I played I had nearly every
square covered and they were still able
to get through even on the easy setting
but you have on the easy setting you
have 20 enemies that can get past
without losing the 100 rounds so from
the main menu I can go into options and
I can select my language right now I
have it set to the United States because
that's the one that I purchased on it
windows mobile marketplace I can also
change the volume and the sound so I
need to go back so if I need help
information all I have to just click
here and it will connect to their server
you'll need an internet connection to do
that so if I click on the defender
button it'll give me a graphic to show
me how I can increase my strength board
an end defense and also how I should
position my pieces strategically so we
go back I can go to unit introduction
and this will show me my different
characters on the game so as you see we
have these first four characters on the
first level so if I click this arrow
here I can see the next defensive pieces
for the specific game so I'm just going
to go back so this is another
marketplace pick and the game is called
hunting and there's a free version
available on windows mobile marketplace
but the full version will cost a dollar
in 99 cents thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
