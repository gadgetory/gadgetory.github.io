begin aside from leather options
Google's Android TV gets leaked and
shows its new UI and not even Apple
seems to like its own ads lately as Phil
Schiller explodes I'm high memory meta
and probably my Monday resolution is not
to complain about Monday's until the day
is over but this is pocketnow daily
let's begin today with what's official
as what did you guys expect I mean we've
got Google's Android in the vehicle and
we've got apples car place so Microsoft
had to take a stab at something and we
do know that there is Ford sandwiches
made by microsoft but the company has
just demoed this new windows in the car
well as it was actually windows phone in
the car it's more like carplay you need
a windows phone to actually get this to
work but even funnier is the fact that
at some point this service did crash in
the demo and it did reveal a full
version of Windows happening on the
dashboard and not really on the phone so
it's really hard to predict exactly what
microsoft plans to do with this concept
you just revealed today again there's an
option for applications for different
things that will probably come in the
service though obviously it sounded more
like a way to generate buzz than
something that they really had ready for
mainstream now let's talk about the Moto
X the phone that almost every reviewer
likes but that the market doesn't seem
to like as much and well apparently
we've got some new rumors of what to
expect from the 2014 version of the Moto
X and apparently it starts with a new
name it's apparently going to be called
the Moto X plus 1 naught X 1 X 2
apparently it's X plus 1 and even though
that does sound ridiculous probably one
of the coolest things is that apparently
moto maker will continue and that will
bring you a leather option which will
definitely be cool but stay tuned you
never know what Motorola now being part
of low novo could bring now let's talk
about Samsung in its gear lineup as one
very interesting leap from korea shows
us a samsung gear solo and the reason
why it's called solo is because
apparently there is a SIM card tray in
there for you to make this a standalone
SmartWatch that does not need a
smartphone end yeah it was a cool idea
to have a speakerphone in your wrist I
mean why not if it'll cost you enough
for you to be able to you know use the
service but still we don't really
see this becoming a mainstream though
hey probably Samsung can figure it out
let's just see how that battery life is
but again these are just rumors
apparently this will happen in the next
couple of weeks it's pretty much a
geared to with a SIM card tray let's see
how that goes now let's talk about
Google as we do know that there is this
amazon fire TV that was just announced
lightly only have the rumors of apple's
future apple TV but apparently google is
bringing us android TV which runs on
android runs android applications but
has a very different UI now the question
is exactly what is it running on because
apparently it should run on the
chromecast but we don't exactly know if
this is going to be a new bigger box
with more features or if it's the same
chromecast or exactly how is Google
planning to align this with their
current products it's a I got really
interesting to see what's coming from
the company though again the league
sources are quite credible so this will
happen the UI is cool but it looks like
the Apple TV and finally for the very
interesting news of the day this whole
thing about apple vs samsung poises a
very interesting opportunity to see
documents that you wouldn't rather see
between companies because they are part
of the trial and we've got these emails
between Phil Schiller and his ad agency
and he's complaining about the fact that
he doesn't like the iPhone ads lately
especially when compared to samsung sad
because the Wall Street Journal had this
article saying that Apple was losing its
cool against Samsung when it came to
advertisement and they're kind of right
but it's really interesting to see that
Sheila was completely shocked at the ad
agency asking for more liberties because
Apple wants to continue doing what
they've been doing for 30 years but
anyways that leads you to the question
of the day do you really find Samsung's
ads to be cool lately when compared to
anything else because in my particular
case I do agree like for example the
Samsung Galaxy gear ads were great for a
very terrible product which just proves
you know just how cool the ads are but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
