really high resolution why not take
advantage of that by running a
tablet-like layout I'm Joe Levi for
pocket now and with paranoid android you
can let's go take a look this is a
google nexus 4 and as you can tell it's
a little bit different and i'm not just
talking the wallpaper which is a
wallpaper that comes with this version
of paranoid android you'll notice at the
top I don't have any status bar to pull
down it's down here at the bottom I've
got my back my home and my multi task
button right there but I also have my
neat little notification shade that I
can pull up on that side and down here I
have a nice new tablet display where
I've got one column and a second column
very much like email we'll get to that
in just a minute but this allows me to
save a bunch of screen real estate by
putting all of this information in one
bar instead of splitting it up into two
and this lets me see at a glance where I
can go and what settings I can use now
how does I do that let's come down here
into customization we can do some themes
some lockscreen stuffs and toolbars
where this one really excels is in
hybrid properties to jump in there now
the first thing I want to do is change
my interface back to regular phone mode
so you can see what I'm talking about so
there's phone mode I can change global
apps i can change global colors i can do
all kinds of stuff in there let's apply
it so you can see the changes that just
took effect down here I've got my normal
large three buttons and across the top
you can see I've got my regular status
bar so it looks a lot more like a
regular phone now coming back in here
you'll see I still have some
tablet-style layouts which is really
kind of cool that's where this rom is
really nice you can change layout based
on you know tablet phablet or or phone
across the whole OS or across specific
apps or both so something they call
hybrid mode let's go ahead and take a
look at phablet mode and over here
global apps let's also use tablet mode
for them phablet of course is a half
phone half tablet takes just a second
for the changes to apply you can see I
still have essentially the same thing
there but now I can see if I can do this
on camera I can pull on either side of
the screen to get a different drop down
and because my screen is a little bit
off I need to make some tweaks here to
make sure that I can see everything in
my notification shade in my quick
toggles rather to be able to get at it
but enough of that let's go ahead and
take a look at some of the cool stuff
let's jump into gmail inside gmail you
can see again I've got my list of stuff
and then I've got my this is my list of
folders and I have my list of emails I
don't like that no problem we're going
to go ahead and jump back here into
settings come back in two hybrid
properties we are now going to go over
here into apps and let's see if we can
find gmail right now it is set at 250
DPI and 600 p so let's come in and
change that we can change the size we
want bump that a little bigger we can
change the layout which is it 600 to 360
right now change colors if we wanted to
let's go ahead and apply that now this
is one thing that it tells you it might
break the first time you run it don't
worry about that if you have to just
launch it again that usually takes care
of it if not you may have to restart to
get those changes to take effect like
you can see there so that was the first
fail we'll watch it again this time you
can see it's just like I'd expect with
my folder list over there and my email
list here and all I had to do is launch
it twice once to to get it working or to
know fail out so that it would reload
with the the new layout really kind of
cool now this is just scratching the
surface there are lots and lots of other
things that you can do here that we
don't have time to go into in this video
but hopefully you have seen kind of what
this can do and you know you kind of
like it if you do I want to hear about
it what did you like that I didn't show
you in this video let us know / in the
comments at pocketnow.com and of course
make sure you share this video with your
friends on Twitter and Facebook
4-pocket now i'm at Joe Levi on Twitter
