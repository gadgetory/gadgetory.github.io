high-resolution look at the iPhone 8 1 +
+ EXO team up to make the 1 + 5 included
stellar camera experience we get the
final name for the future galaxy note 7
yeah I know future
I'm Hina Ravenna and I just got called
out on Twitter because I don't make any
jokes anymore you guys want that back
this is fogging out daily the official
news today begin with some very
unexpected deals the galaxy s 8 has
barely been in the market for a bit it's
actually kind of hard to find so far and
still Best Buy it's offering it for $100
off doesn't matter if it's bs8 or si
plus and if you're lucky enough you
might be able to even score a wireless
charger which that fast wireless charger
is actually cool decent I wouldn't buy
it but if you get it then free makes all
the sense in the world
and speaking of Samsung those of you
wondering exactly what the final name
for the future Galaxy Note featured
Galaxy Note 7 by the way it's actually
not going to include the 7 it seems
kylie is going to be called a galaxy
note F G sort of like se for the iPhone
se e for special edition not only this
FG is not going to be the F edition it's
actually going to be the fan edition and
bear in mind you're not really getting
monstrous specifications for that to be
a fan edition but I know I would be one
of those people that would get that
phone just for the sake of having luck
we'll see I was going to fly over to
Google as Google i/o continues and we
hear new changes like for example the
fact that the Android device manager
which was the weirdest name ever is just
going to be called find my device
Thank You Google this name makes a lot
more sense and yeah it literally is for
exactly what the name entails now it is
your opportunity to find your phone in
case it gets lost I would highly suggest
you enable it it is completely freaky
now it's like the spotlight over to the
1 + v this is the final name it was
confirmed by a source recently now it's
being confirmed by PR of both DxO and
one plus because they have this
confirmed that they've teamed up for the
camera on this phone to be stellar and
bear in mind the first time we ever
heard of the bxo market
was with the HTC 10 then with the ghoul
pixel these those actually had really
great photos so if the XO wants to team
up with the oneplus and make this a
great experience of I can't wait to get
my review unit 1 plus and finally the
very interesting news today because I
don't know if I should call them hot are
the fact that we got leaked images of
the iPhone 8 yet again apparently these
are dummy units that are being I don't
know tested for cases or whatever you
know the way this works the point being
is that apparently that camera at the
back is going to be vertical some of us
were wishing that it was going to be
flush to the chassis for it not to be so
terrible but apparently it's not so
we've got a glass back with a very
terrible camera hump and we've got the
curves at the front really and our
question today what do you think do you
think that Apple could pull off a design
this ugly again because I will say it
again and like I think not I mean look
at the galaxy as a look at the LG G 60
so gorgeous it's worth it to actually
use them I'll need to include the HTC
you 11 like really Apple your fans are
fans but they're not that much I'm not
even going to say the name they're not
that much of your fans leave a comment
down below we like to know your opinion
friends you know the way goes just want
to get the news earlier before the video
was filmed although with Han Pagano calm
and have that subscribe button down
below for more videos like this one you
also follow me on Twitter hi man your
story better on Instagram but hi
metadata please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I am high
memory but I thanks so much for watching
