phone that has both touch ID and face ID
at the same time the qualcomm snapdragon
855 seems to be ready for the arrival of
foldable smartphones to 2019 and we get
more screen protector leagues for the
galaxy s 10 that confirm that the punch
hole is either smaller or probably in
existent I'm Jaime Rivera and there are
some fake news out there that are
claiming that today is my birthday I
don't know how that would be possible I
mean the last time that I remember a
birthday was in 2006 and I just stopped
counting
this is Fargo now daily sponsored by the
Huawei may 20 pro the official news
today begin with the Huawei no before I
mean usually I didn't really care much
about this lineup but listen to this
kare 9 and 70 processor 8 gigs of ram
128 gigs of storage a 48 megapixel
primary camera and then two other
sensors a twenty five megapixel selfie
camera four hundred and ninety dollars
and if you want to save 40 bucks you
could go for the 20 megapixel primary
and that will give you a it's would like
for 40 I mean that is a crazy price tag
the phone looks great can't wait to get
in the labs until if it's actually good
or if you're getting what you pay for
because that's cheap now let's talk
about Sprint and t-mobile I mean they
pretty much started the year telling us
that they were merging that they needed
to merge in order to make their proposal
for 5g great and well it seems that
we're just waiting for FCC approval so
once that FCC approval goes down it
seems that sure everything's gonna go
well but there seems to be a catch as we
all know the legal debacle that's
happening in the United States when it
comes to wall way and it seems that the
companies have to drop their Huawei
equipment for this to happen so we
wonder exactly how long either that's
gonna take or what's gonna go on now
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy has
ten we've got two separate leaks of
screen protectors man I know I'm tired
of getting this as well but listen to
this one one of them shows a very very
small hole for the camera and then we've
got another one that doesn't show the
hole in either of three designs either
so I don't think we're at a prototyping
stage anymore I think that we're already
stay true the phone is uh they're close
to being manufactured or somewhere
around there so I wonder which one are
we getting and for those of you that
care about those foldable smart phones
that we've got teased obviously chipsets
determine how many displays are being
supported so for those of you wondering
what processor is going to power these
foldable products of Qualcomm just
pretty much confirmed that they're
Snapdragon in 55 is ready we don't have
a time line I don't even think this is
gonna be ready by the 855 but we'll see
and finally the hot news today have to
do with iPhones finally we needed a
break from all those Galaxy S 10 leaks
we've got patents that reveal that the
company seems to still want to do touch
ID I mean even if the phones that are
currently available are ditching it
seems that Apple still wants to work on
the idea of having touch ID on the
display if you remember that pretty much
got ditch because synaptics was unable
to deliver and now we've seen how
qualcomm pretty much owned it and we've
got other optical solutions and so Apple
seems to be working on that working on a
solution that will bring face ID and
touch ID let us know in the comments
down below I mean we've had more facial
recognition this year than fingerprint
recognition depending on what phone you
picked so which one is your favorite so
far
cuz honestly in my case it depends in
the case of the iPhone and the mate Tony
Pro I prefer facial recognition in the
case of every other phone I prefer the
fingerprint scanner leave us a comment
down below love to know your opinion and
friends before we end this video we
would love to thank the huawei mate xx
pro for making our content today
possible Huawei has proven that it can
blend hardware and software well with
this devices performance the Carey 980
processor is 75% faster 58% more power
efficient which for you means longer
days without the need of a charge while
you're playing your favorite game or
doing whatever it is that you need
follow the link in the description below
to learn why the huawei mate xx pro is
so cool friends again if you want to get
to do this earlier follow us on
