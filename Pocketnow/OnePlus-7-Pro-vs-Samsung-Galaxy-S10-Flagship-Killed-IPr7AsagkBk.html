with the latest galaxy for years and
usually the oneplus wins see well the
galaxy has always been a better phone
the differences were never enough to
warrant the substantial differences in
price tag the oneplus was just good
enough thing as the dynamic has changed
the oneplus 7 pro is a completely
different beast that now doesn't just
want to compete with specs and price
this wants to be a better phone than its
competitor and still priced aggressively
the question is if the bar is high
enough to compete I'm high metal even
out with pocket now and this is one plus
seven pro versus the samsung galaxy s 10
plus
I guess the biggest question is should
you trust oneplus I mean Samsung has
been in the market for years they owned
the most popular Android brand by far
and well the answer is actually quite
complicated
side-by-side both devices are flat slabs
of aluminum and curved glass both have
shiny finishes and the borders and both
are reflective fingerprint magnets at
the back neither of them is what I'd
call ergonomic but the oneplus 7 pro
makes it easier to reach the power
button at least and the mute slider is
also very convenient where the galaxy
seriously has the worst power button to
reach by far that being said the Seven
Pro is five millimeters taller one
millimeter wider one millimeter thicker
and 31 grams heavier than the galaxy
this allows the oneplus 7 pro a larger
6.6 7 inch display when compared to six
point four inches on the galaxy with a
negligible difference in screen to body
ratio these are both Super AMOLED
displays at quad HD plus resolution that
are a stunning sight to see and both are
capable of HDR 10 plus if you're not a
fan of notches or interruptions you'll
prefer the display on the 7 Pro you knee
didn't say oneplus has a better display
because of its 90 Hertz refresh rate but
not so fast
if you value brightness in direct
sunlight the Galaxy would be the device
that I recommend most also give extra
points to the galaxy on content
consumption it's not really just for the
stereo speakers because both devices
have them but because the Galaxy
includes a headphone jack internals are
a mixed bag though they both have the
new Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 and both
have a four thousand milliamp hour
battery the seven pro has faster
charging through warped charge but the
galaxy has reversible wireless charging
the galaxy also starts at more RAM but
you'll pay a lot less money for six
eight or twelve gigs of RAM on the 7 Pro
they both start at the same storage but
the 7 Pro has faster storage even if the
galaxy does bring expandability the
Galaxy S 10 Plus also brings an IP
rating where the 7 pro is guaranteed to
be water-resistant even if no
certification is provided let's just
call the
Part A ty given all the variations as
for the cool factor I'll tell you this
much both devices have their own they
both have an on display fingerprint
scanner with the optical solution on the
seven probe being significantly faster
and the option on the galaxy being more
secure at the top of the coolness food
chain is the one plus motorized camera I
find it to be a smarter solution than
the Infinity opuntia on the galaxy from
a visual perspective though durability
is obviously a concern and the galaxy
does bring the added kick of a deaf
sensor for portrait selfies seriously I
don't blame you if you consider the
hardware portion of this comparison to
be a tie both companies bring their own
levels of innovation seriously the best
tiebreaker right now is software this is
really an easy win for one Plus given
its simplistic approach oxygen OS looks
like stock Android but is faster more
fluid and has a lot more useful touches
like the flexibility in the navigation
buttons the options to map the Google
assistance of the power button and the
Google feed on the launcher if you're
using the t-mobile variant not really a
fan of the drawer with the unlock
variants and don't get me wrong there's
nothing wrong with Samsung's one UI it's
more ergonomic thanks to menus and
options now being presented at the
bottom it's a bit more elegant from a
design perspective and I find it's
customization options to be more
complete thing is if I had to pick only
one I would go for oxygen OS those of
you interested in the Android cube beta
this phone already supports it and I've
also noticed that oneplus devices have
aged better over time from software
optimizations to getting software
updates now once you compare them in day
to day use a snappy phone is always more
convenient the Galaxy user interfaces
lag with animations that make it look
better but which provide no useful
benefit it's still a fast phone but
there's no denying that the 7 pro feels
better it also feels like the 7 pro is
more power efficient people did praise
the Galaxy S 10 plus for its battery
life but I can't really say that was my
case even today you will get through end
of day but only the 7 Pro will give you
an extra one and faster charging in the
box
phone calls sound great on both devices
and data speeds are comparable I highly
recommend that you watch my separate
video on the Galaxy S 10 5g to see the
test being conducted between these two
phones and that one as a comparison now
the camera comparison is an interesting
one because both devices have embraced
the advantages of versatility but do
yourself a favor and don't make this a
comparison about specs surely oneplus
has more megapixels in the primary but
the sn+ has a brighter aperture that
adapts the sn+ has more megapixels on
the telephoto but the 7 pro is 3x
optical versus 2x and even if the
megapixel count is the same on the
wide-angle for both the Galaxy has
slightly more field of view really
what's most important to compare is how
software is optimized for both and the
resulting photos Samsung has more of a
reputation for taking better stills but
oneplus has brought some dramatic
improvements in photography there are
certain cases where you'll have a hard
time telling them apart
another is where Samsung pulls out more
dynamic range there are times when
Samsung does a better job in the light
but since one Plus has nightscape it can
grab more detail and let me just go
quiet for a bit and show you some more
samples and let you be the judge of
these results
where things start to incline more
towards Samson is the maturity of the
software the fact that you can now get
portrait shots without needing to step
back from your subjects whereas the crop
is really aggressive on the seventh row
you can also edit these portraits after
the fact and Samsung's life focus and
even apply some neat effects while the
seventh row just gives you the still and
that's it
same thing with selfies where oneplus
offers more megapixels on its module and
a slightly wider crop but the Galaxy has
larger microns and a built in depth
sensor nicely I tend to like more how
the galaxy handles selfies and even
portraits but I'm not the biggest fan of
these so I'll let you be the judge and
you can also notice this maturity in
video where the galaxy s 10 plus allows
you to select different cameras to
record your shot and even lets you move
within them while you're recording where
the 1 + 7 Pro only lets you record video
with the primary video quality is
comparable on both and also
stabilization but if you're willing to
take the hit into 1080p territory
Samsung's super steady video play with
the wide-angle camera is quite epic and
even in the case of selfie video I'd
give more points to the galaxy for being
able to record 4k from the front while
the 7 pro is still limited to 1080p and
this is even while having more
megapixels on the sensor to conclude I
think you understand why this is one of
the toughest comparisons that we run
every year both companies pull some
really good punches with all the quality
and versatility that they offer and each
set a very high bar each device is
beautiful and powerful the only thing
left to compare is the price and guys
please bear with me here I do know that
you can find some really great deals for
the galaxy in all US carriers but that's
not a permanent reality and that's not
something that people can take advantage
of outside the United States if we were
to compare these devices by their retail
price the t-mobile variant of the 1 + 7
Pro starts at $6.99 how the galaxy s 10
+ starts at 9 9
nine guys $300 is $300 that's almost the
price of a Nintendo switch a SmartWatch
you can get a cheap Chromebook for that
money you can get a lot of stuff for
$300 these days in the past I would
conclude these videos by saying that the
shortcomings of the oneplus made it good
enough for the price today we pretty
much have a tie and with the tiebreaker
being the price if this were my money I
would buy the oneplus 7 pro now which
one would you buy let us know in the
comments down below and while you're at
it make sure you follow us on social
medias our extended coverage happens on
instagram you can also follow me on the
links below if you want to see some
weird running photos or you want to see
these cameras in action please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw
i'm home everybody-- thanks so much for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
