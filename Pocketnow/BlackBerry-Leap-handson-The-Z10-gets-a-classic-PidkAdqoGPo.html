return to its roots in search for a
little success ah flee the company has
just surprised us at MWC 2015 with
something else I'm Jaime Rivera and
Michael Fisher with PocketNow here in
Barcelona and let's talk about the new
BlackBerry leap it's tough to be
BlackBerry right now especially when
it's recent blackberry classic attempt
has proven to be just as unsuccessful as
its blackberry 10 reinvention two years
ago still it seems that the company is
willing to give its keyboardist
blackberry 10 UI a second chance with
its surprising announcement of the
BlackBerry leap that reminds us a lot of
the BlackBerry z10 according to the
company CEO this device is targeted to
the young mobile professional who value
security and privacy in a modern and
powerful design package it sports a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4 plus
processor two gigs of RAM 16 gigs of
expandable storage up to 128 gigs via
micro sd LTE capabilities an 8 megapixel
primary camera 2 megapixel front facing
shooter a non-removable 2,800 milliamp
hour battery and the 5 inch 720p display
of undisclosed technology the device
does feel substantial and sturdy in the
hand and it's textured back this make it
feel really good something that we've
praised BlackBerry for in the past and
its overall design and sharp corners
give it a certain degree of elegance
even if the device isn't really what we
would call a flagship of anyway the spec
she does run BlackBerry OS 10 point 3.1
and it runs it very well we also see the
Amazon Appstore bundled within the app
tray so you can just load a selection of
Android applications from the store as
an extra variation to the BlackBerry
World
now since blackberry doesn't really skin
its overall operating system we really
won't cover it in detail you can do so
in our full review overall this sadly
doesn't seem like the device that will
take the world by storm and especially
it's such a mid-range sector still we
have to commend BlackBerry for its
resilience and we can't wait to test it
out for a full review we should expect
it to begin selling this device by the
end of next month
once again this is Jaime Rivera and
Michael Fisher from Parker now here
