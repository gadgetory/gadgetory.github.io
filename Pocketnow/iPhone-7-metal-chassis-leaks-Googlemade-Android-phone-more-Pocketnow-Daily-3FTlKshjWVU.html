speakers are going to be a big deal if
there is any doubt over the final name
of the future galaxy know we've got some
news and Google seems to be in need of
building its own smartphone after all
I'm hi meri behna and the problem with
recording in the tropics is that it's
horribly hot in the day and then right
now it's raining this is pocket out
daily the official news today again
begin with deals and with the 32
gigabyte Nexus 5x I think we dedicate at
least three or four days of deals for
this particular smartphone and it just
keeps getting less and less expensive
right now it's four two hundred forty
dollars on eBay I know don't even think
about it just hit the link of the
description now for those of you that
still have doubts over the final name of
the galaxy note well famous dips are
evident last just came on record and
confirm that there is rendered text
directly from Samsung that says galaxy
note 7 and this makes a lot of sense
obviously it's the galaxy s7 year
there's always been that confusion and
well known as this early convenient but
just that disparity over numbers every
year so it would just make sense to
bring everything on pard not just with
the galaxy s but also with the number of
the iphone that's coming a little later
right and since we're speaking iPhone
we've got some very interesting metal
case leaks of what we expect to be the
iphone 7 revealing two very interesting
things number one the camera hole which
is huge means we probably get an update
there but the other very interesting
change is the speaker grills at the
bottom we've been debating if it's just
going to be one speaker if it's going to
be four speakers this metal casing kind
of reveals only two at the bottom and we
are just hoping that this is not just a
design thing that we actually get stereo
speakers on this thing that mimic what
we get on the ipad pro lineup which is
amazing now let's move the spotlight
over to huawei there has been much
speculation over the company moving away
from android for reasons not really
mentioned we do know that Huawei is the
company that's been doing a ton of its
own stuff starting with processors we
heard some rumors that it might build
its own operating system but according
to the company CEO the company will
main using android going forward so long
as the operating system is a pretty much
free meaning so much that it's open
source they can do whatever they want
with it because that's really the beauty
of android you could pretty much do
whatever you want so long as you're an
oem right and finally the very hot news
today have to do with google alphabet
and the probability of a smartphone
that's not a nexus apparently the Nexus
lineup will continue but it seems that
there is an alphabet subsidary that will
be building a smartphone for Google and
the only company that we can really
think of is the one that's in charge of
project ara which is great for not
necessarily sure of this phone will be
the project ara phone but it seems that
the company wants to build its own
smartphone and have it complete with the
Nexus it seems which is rather weird but
it leads me to the question of the day
do you think that there is a need for
another google phone out there in my
case it would make sense for there to be
a google phone for emerging markets it
would be cool to have the google phone
be the project our phone but for its
Cathy with the Nexus I don't know leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
