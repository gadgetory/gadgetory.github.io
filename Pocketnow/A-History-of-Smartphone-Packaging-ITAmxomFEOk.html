pocketnow.com we don't really stop to
think about it but smartphone packaging
has evolved tremendously over the last
three or four years we've gone from huge
boxes with lots of empty space to boxes
that could hardly fit anything else
inside of them if you tried I've dug up
some old boxes here and we're going to
take a look at how smartphone packaging
has evolved kind of a different kind of
video here that hopefully you'll find
interesting so let's get to it
okay so we're gonna start off over here
with this particular box this is for the
I'm a SP 5 M a device that came out in
about 2006 2007 it was my first
smartphone and the box was huge the
device itself is actually only as big as
it is seen over here but there was just
a tremendous amount of wasted space
inside of this box of course the benefit
was that the manufacturer I me could
make this big bold picture on the front
which looks great in a store but again
it's a lot of waste and for a device
that's this big you really don't need a
box that is as big as a software box in
the in the mid-90s and then we came to
devices like the verizon trio 700 w this
was one of the first or the first
windows mobile palm smartphone in the
world was turned upside down when that
happened and inside there is a lot of
wasted space this box is even taller
than the im8 box but it's not as wide as
you can see but it's just really
different packaging than you would get
today so if we open it up I still
actually have this device inside you can
see that there's plastic use not very
eco-friendly you can look down and just
see how there's so much wasted space
inside really unnecessarily but it
really helped to display the phone
nicely and bring it forth when you have
that unboxing experience and then we
start to see an evolution to the flap
design this was the top flap design and
then we started to see sort of the side
flap right and the side flap is still
with us today and it has led to smaller
size boxes like in the HTC tilt too so
we bring up the flap we open up the top
and we just have the device on the top
neatly displayed and below are the
accessories and then they kind of
modified this a little bit more say for
example the propel Pro which has the
same flap design although it is less
tall even smaller than the tilt too and
again we still see this design a lot
today
HTC came along with their no touch
diamond2
Touch pro2 they didn't use flaps they
just had a typical you know pull out the
tab and open the top and they started to
use different materials so recycled
cardboard here to be a little bit more
eco-friendly when the original iPhone
really was released it had a very small
box and
with each successive generation of the
iPhone the box has gotten smaller and
smaller here's the 3GS which has a very
small almost handheld sized box it was
all about the device you open up the top
the device would be on top with tightly
packed accessories down below the iPhone
4 represented an even smaller box
compared to the iPhone 3GS and if we
stack them you can see length width and
height are all smaller a little bit on
the iPhone 4s box and again when you
unbox an iPhone you'd have the device on
top with some information here and a
link to download iTunes if you hadn't
already done that so a very nice
unboxing experience for all the iPhone
devices then HTC came along and actually
innovated a little bit in packaging
which was really nice so here we have
the HTC hd2 which has one of the best
unboxing experiences because you look at
the front and it says big big and this
shows the actual dimensions of the hd2
and as you slide it off the the top here
you get this green which contrasts very
nicely with the device the big screen
HTC hd2 here in the flesh just almost
artistic in the presentation and then
you could lift up this tab and see all
the accessories below and then we have a
device like the Droid 2 in the Droid X
which has probably the tightest
packaging of any smartphone ever the
height of the Droid 2 in this case is
actually the exact or almost the exact
height of the actual package there is no
wiggle room in this in this box it is
just packed to the gills so we have just
the device itself here and then if we
open it up we've got some accessories
below and if you've ever tried to
recreate says inside of a newer
smartphone box you know how difficult it
is everything has its place inside of a
box and it's very tightly fitted which
means less materials and better
eco-friendliness so that was a little
look at the evolution from huge to small
even though smartphones have gotten
bigger with larger screens the packaging
has gotten much smaller to the point
where we have these tiny little boxes
which go a long way in protecting the
device and staying eco-friendly while
still maintaining that great
boxing experience so if you liked this
video please give it a thumbs up and
leave a comment about your previous
experience with cell phone boxes and how
you've seen them change from being huge
to Titan that's it for now thanks for
