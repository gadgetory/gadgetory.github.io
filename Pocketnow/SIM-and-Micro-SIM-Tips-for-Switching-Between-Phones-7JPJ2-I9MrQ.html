calm and lately we've seen some new
phones coming out that require micro SIM
cards so this video is going to be a
little tip about making your regular SIM
card into a micro SIM card so first off
this is one that I made with scissors
there's a few video other videos on
YouTube where you just kind of cut
pieces off of your rubber SIM card until
it kind of resembles the shape of the
micro SIM card and the fitting kind of
like that but it's I didn't really do it
too well it's kind of wobbly so instead
of just trying that again I bought this
little micro sim cutter it's about two
dollars I found it you can just search
for my percent cutter and you'll find
them ranging between two dollars and
maybe eight dollars and it comes with
micro SIM adapters which is something
important for me because I like to
switch phones a lot and sometimes I
might want to go back to a larger sim
which is not going to be very easy to do
if I only had my scissors and cut up all
my SIM cards so we're going to try this
my person cutter and it is very
important that you put the SIM card in
the right way there's a little diagram
right there so you have to have your
edge your little corner there and then
all we do is hit it down like that and
there's the micro SIM card let's take a
look it is perfect
just like a real micro SIM card that you
can buy from your carrier and the
micro-sim hourly a sim cutter was a lot
cheaper than buying an actual micro SIM
card and there you have it now I can put
that in a micro sim compatible phone
like the Nokia Lumia 710 or iPhone or
some of the other Nokia Lumia devices
coming out and it fits in the adapter
now one thing to watch out for with
these micro sim adapters to go back to
the normal sim card size is that often
they make the SIM card ever so slightly
thicker so now when I try to get it in
here it doesn't fit just right and it's
a little tight now it doesn't come out
too easily because it's really tight in
there and when I put the cover on
there's actually a little bit of a bump
so if you want to get your freshly cut
micro SIM card to fit more easily in
older phones what you got to do is
really file down the back so I'm already
starting to do it here so because it's
the adapter adds just a little tiny bit
of thickness it's going to fit really
tightly and you want to make that easy
to remove so you got a go to any finger
nail file will do and just file off some
of that plastic like so and that you can
just put it back into the adapter and
look really closely and how much this
sticks out trying to make it stick out
not at all and be flush with the rest of
the adapter
and once you get it like that it should
fit pretty nicely in your old phones so
give us a thumbs up if you like there
are a little tutorial and that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
