light along with a small rounded one
that we've seen before McLaren and
oneplus salute to speed is now official
and boy is it a beast after all and new
leaks of the Galaxy S 10 confirmed there
is one variant with a very interesting
flat screen I'm high metal Iveta and the
noise you hear is a brain outside it's
very noisy and the second one is of me
coughing all day it's been bad this is
pocket out daily sponsored by the huawei
mate 20 pro the official news today
begin with huawei making their punch
hole smartphone official this is
actually gonna be a topic of choice for
the podcast this week punch holes and
phones
the Nova 4 goes live and it's rather
interesting because it never really the
Nova line I've never really had the best
high-end specifications and now we've
got the karin 980 powering this phone in
addition to 6 things of ram we expect
the full launch on December 17th we'll
keep you posted now let's talk about the
oneplus sixty McLaren Edition if you
have not watched our unboxing it is epic
and it's highly worth it for you to
invest five minutes to see what you're
getting for $6.99 10 gigs of ram a
faster protocol for charging and a
beautiful design and my god again the
unboxing experience was just probably
one of the best with a our experiences
and a ton of other things again watch
the video now let's talk about the nokia
9 PureView as for the first time ever
the company actually talks about the
existence of this phone German PR just
pretty much confirmed that yes there is
a phone with so many cameras that looks
rather interesting but that the company
hasn't really been able to nail the
software and hardware just right and
that's the reason why we're still
waiting and apparently we'll have to
wait until MWC but I think that that's
actually perfect timing for a launch I
need some time off for more phone
reviews now let's talk about the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 the rumors that keep on
coming I actually decided to not leave
them for the hot ones because they're
just too many right now but yeah
infinity Oh display on the smaller five
point eight inch variant seems to be a
possibility we see that the curves on
the display pretty much I mean this
looks like a you know just the curvier a
design but it looks so
plain just so minimalistic that my god
being able to differentiate galaxies is
gonna be rather interesting that being
said let us know what you think about
this design in the comments and finally
the hot news that they have to do with
pixels as apparently Google is not done
with the amount of phones we've already
seen we've noticed that the company did
the whole entry-level moto x4 thingy but
apparently there are two pixels in the
works Excel and a pixel three light I
guess XL light I guess a snapdragon 670
processor four gigs of ram 32 gigs of
storage there's a 12 megapixel primary
camera and we're actually wondering is
it gonna be that we're gonna have
watered-down specifications on a premium
mid-range sure but we're still gonna get
the photography let us know in the
comments down below what do you think
about this idea because again for me if
there's gonna be significantly less
expensive and brightly bring great
photos following on the pixel name then
sure I'm all down for it leave us a
comment down below we love to know your
opinion and friends before we end this
video we'd like to fake the huawei mate
20 Pro from making our content possible
today Wawa's unique combination of
hardware and software and sure the phone
is born fast and stays fast the new 7
nanometre keren 980 processor delivers
75 percent better cpu performance and 58
percent more power efficiency follow the
link in the description below to learn
why the huawei mate 20 pro is so cool
