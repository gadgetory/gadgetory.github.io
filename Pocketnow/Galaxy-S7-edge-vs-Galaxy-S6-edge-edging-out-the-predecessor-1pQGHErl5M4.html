edge+ from last year in the middle you
can see almost weighing in at about the
same size the galaxy s7 edge from this
year and the little fella on the far
right is the galaxy s6 edge from last
year i'm anthony nod and we're going to
give this back to Jaime but we're going
to focus on the differences and
similarities between the LXE s6 edge and
the Galaxy s7 edge last year's galaxy s6
edge looks like the s7 s the s7 edge is
baby that's because Samsung decided that
this year the s7 edge will be bigger
we're not sure whether they want to
ditch the s6 edge+ aka the s7 edge plus
from this year's lineup but what we do
know is that we have a 5.5 inch display
on the yell XE s7 edge compared to the
5.1 inch display of last year's model we
still have the same curvature granted
you will see that there's less of a
bezel on this year's unit and since we
are here we're going to take this
opportunity to look at them from the
side I'm not sure if you will be able to
tell but this one's almost flush while
the Galaxy s7 edge is a little bit
rounded so it has a better keying and
you'll despite the fact that it's bigger
you like you like holding it more in
your hand also on the back you'll see
the huge difference in the camera comes
the s6 on the left this one had a decent
camera huh some did not like it some
others did not have anything against it
but apparently this year samsung wanted
to go all in and flatten it as much as
they could it's not completely flush but
it is not standing out the way it did
last year same heart rate sensor we have
the flash on the back and that's
basically pretty much it these stones
are almost identical in terms of aspect
give or take five point five inch
display versus the five point one inch
display what is the resolution about
Exynos 7420 octa-core on last year's
model Exynos 88-90 on this year's model
of course some devices from some regions
will get the snapdragon 820
line but that shouldn't be a problem
four gigabytes versus free gigabytes of
ram 32 gigabytes of storage expandable
this time around versus the fixed amount
of storage which you could have gotten
last year's model 32 64 and 128 we
talked about the back cameras flipping
back just once more we have a 12
megapixel camera versus 16 megapixel on
last year's model but we set this in
previous videos we'll see it again
that's not necessarily a bad thing
because this time around we have bigger
pixels we have more light sensitivity on
the sensor and we have a brighter lens
on the s6 I'm sorry on the s7 this time
around f 1.7 versus f 1.9 fingerprint
scanner is also in its place beneath the
home button which is a little bit more
square this year than it was last year
is just a little bit of esthetical
difference you will not probably notice
it and the Samsung user interface as you
know it and as you've grown to love it
it's the same song it's a different
melody though the lot has changed
and a lot has remained the same we'll
have to wait and see until we get this
in a review lab so we can properly apply
about it but the initial first
impressions are good and that's pretty
much it we'll wrap it up thank you very
