their partnership with camera
manufacturer Leica but as the p9 a well
rounded flagship or a phone built around
a photography gimmick you'll get the
answer to that question and more in 60
seconds or less let's start with what's
not hot for fans of the traditional
Android feel always emui launcher has
more in common with iOS in eliminating
the app drawer mixing widgets with your
entire app collection often feels
cluttered and with so much focus on
camera performance video output is at
best two generations behind phones in
this price bracket so what's hot this
dual camera setup delivers some of the
best photos we've ever seen from a
mobile device in a year of terrific
phone cameras the p9 delivers
class-leading color and dynamic range
and for including an unfamiliar
processor with a little less Ram the p9
performs well against other flagship
phones it's even able to unseat galaxy
s7 s in a select few gaming tests where
the p9 faces challenges is in balancing
compromises against price reduced to
seeing quad HD screens and for Digga
bytes of RAM at this sub $700 tier but a
photography is a killer app for you
this Huawei delivers stunning results
and the rest of the phone is plenty
capable of satisfying normal daily
smartphone use you just might want to
swap that launcher if you get one for
seven more minutes on the Huawei p9
