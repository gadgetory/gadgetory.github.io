pocketnow.com in this video we're going
to talk about wireless sync in the zune
software for your windows phone 7 device
let's get to it okay so right now i have
my samsung focus connected with the USB
plug here and i have the information
here on the screen because you can't see
this information and set up the wireless
sync unless you plug in first so if i go
over here to view sync options and I go
to wireless sync it says thats wireless
sync has already been set up it takes
about two minutes to set it up and it's
a really awesome feature let me show you
how i use wireless sync to keep my media
up to date on my windows phone 7 device
so i'm gonna detach from the computer
here and then you can see that the zune
software has sort of faded to grey and
now let's say it's the middle of the day
I've just downloaded a new CD that I
want to send to my phone well what
happens is when you plug your windows
phone 7 device in to a charger after 10
minutes wireless sync begins so every
night my phone syncs with zune to the
music that I have added to my library
and it works the other way too if I
downloaded a new album on my windows
phone 7 device with zune pass since zoom
past gives you unlimited music I'll wake
up in the morning and the album will be
here on my computer so let's say I want
to put this new album the notorious
b.i.g or it's new to me I want to send
this over to my samsung focus so I'm
going to click and drag down here and
release okay and now i'm going to go
plug in my samsung focus for 10 minutes
i'm going to show you right now that
that album does not exist here so i'm
going to go into music and it's actually
called greatest hits so i'm going to go
over to music and albums actually we'll
just go to artists and this is notorious
b.i.g so go to n and you see that
there's no notorious b.i.g so i want to
plug in the phone for ten minutes
pretend it's the night time i'm going to
come back with the video ok so the phone
has been plugged in for 10 minutes and
watch what happens if we go to music and
video it is connected it is syncing
right now so pretty cool I'm going to
let it sync up and come back and show
you that the the
bum is on there all right so it's
finished synchronizing and we're going
to go over here to music and video and
see if the notorious b.i.g album is
there we're going to go to music and
albums it was called greatest hits so
we're going to go to G and there it is
notorious b.i.g greatest hits so this is
a great way to send music to your phone
overnight maybe you've downloaded a
couple of albums during the day on zune
pass you want to send them over to your
phone wireless link is awesome for it or
if you've discovered music for on your
Windows Phone 7 device and you want to
send it over to your computer it will go
the other way too so you're always
synchronizing between your computer and
your phone really awesome way to keep in
sync there if you like this video please
give it a thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
