version of Apple's current flagship and
probably the phone you'll see in most
hands of year in the United States are
certain other markets a lot of people
call it the iPhone 7s for obvious
reasons but my first weekend with it has
proven it to be more I'm high middle
even with pocket now and this is what
I've learned so far from my honeymoon
phase brought to you by deep brand after
using the iPhone 7 plus says one of my
primary phones I decided to switch back
after the buzz video explains how I just
didn't feel that I was getting my
money's worth I never used it to exhume
and the battery life just wasn't at all
great I've been using the iPhone 8 since
Friday and boy is it great to go back to
a phone you can actually handle a minor
maneuver and I can touch all four
corners of this display and the glass
finish reminds me of the LG G 6 which
means it's not too slippery in the hand
then you approach the space great color
option is a more lighter tone of black
it actually reminds me of the quite
black Google pixel setting enough for
the first time as a blend of old and new
and by new pretty much the only thing
that's changed is that if you have an
old device running iOS 11 already it's
just the quick snapshot to restore from
the old phone but I had already wiped my
old phone so I had to start with the
basic manual way which means you set up
language Wi-Fi to achieve initial
Network activation once you follow the
process and you set up touch ID and then
you're asked if you'd like to set up the
phone as new or if you'd like to restore
from iCloud or iTunes iCloud restores
are my personal favorite I love how all
your applications home screen layout and
settings are all ported like if they
were a carbon copy of your previous
phone right down to the photo gallery
and even the music downloaded you then
set up the sensitivity of the home
button and things like Apple pay and
Siri are optional things you can set up
later and after that's all done you are
taken to your new home screen which yes
hasn't changed at all at Bose there are
a few new wallpapers to remind us of
what's coming with the iPhone 10 we have
a separate video detailing everything
that's changed in iOS 11 which in
iPhones isn't really as much as what you
get in iPads my favorite so far is
definitely the new approach to control
center how you can add or remove options
and how you can also rearrange them I
also like the new layout of the App
Store even if the learning curve has
been a bit much over the last few days
another thing I praise is that two-tone
technology has made the jump from iPads
to iPhones to have this LCD adapt to its
surroundings and if you chose the 64
gigabyte iPhone 8 offloading
applications you don't use commonly as a
true space saver but to be honest with
you Iowa's 11 and the iPhone 8 are most
relevant to me when it comes to
performance this phone is blazing fast
and that's even with the 179
applications I have installed I also
began to use AR kit with services like
ikea and this is just genius to be able
to see if furniture fits in an area
without having to guess it's just one of
the many scenarios where augmented
reality is really useful best of all I
don't know what it is but this is the
first ever non plus iPhone that I've
ever used where the battery has lasted
through a day I spent both Saturday and
Sunday in Manhattan and even with the
terrible Network in the city with the
Apple watch series 3 connected low power
mode switched off I was able to end the
day with at least 20% battery life
whatever optimizations Apple has between
iOS 11 and the a11 chip have certainly
paid off so far and I also have the same
opinion about the camera this is being
dubbed as one of the best cameras of
2017 and my initial impressions that's
actually very accurate
I can't wait for Juan's real camera
review coming soon but in a nutshell
there are things that the iPhone 8 can
do that not even the camera that I'm
filming this video with can do for
example I can't record slow-motion 1080p
video at 240 frames per second on my
camera
and even more expensive cameras can't do
4k at 60 frames per second and even if
he won't use these things all the time
the fact that the iPhone 8 can do all
this out of the box is really
astonishing obviously this is just after
a weekend of use in my next video I'll
focus on the differences between the
iPhone 7 in order to help you decide if
it's worth the upgrade you can also
expect want a shimon with more content
on his experience with the iPhone 8 plus
and keep in mind that grabbing this new
iPhone means that the glass will most
likely become a fingerprint magnet the
brand skins will eliminate those
fingerprints and add some grip to your
upcoming iPhone 8 or any iPhone for that
matter check out the brand calm slash
