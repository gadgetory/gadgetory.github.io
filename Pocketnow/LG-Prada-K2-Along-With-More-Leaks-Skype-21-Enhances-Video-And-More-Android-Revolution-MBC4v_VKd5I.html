leaks from Samsung HTC and LG make the
scene skype 2.1 brings video calls to
more smartphones and gingerbread updates
haven't been fun for everyone all this
and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm home it'll be better
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
android Revolution the shore will we
tell you what's hot and what's not
inside of Google's Android project let's
start this week off with what's hot all
right so this week was full of leaks so
sit back relax and let's go through them
the LG product cave2 made the scene and
it seems gorgeous with a design that's
only nine millimeters thick though it's
interesting that it has a 4.3 Nova
display that's supposed to be bright as
hell though we're not really sure what
to make of it it's got 16 gigabytes of
built-in storage and it's hspa+ and
since it's got gingerbread built in it
shouldn't take long for it to be
released though we're not sure how
Google's going to handle this the
verizon roadmap was also leaked and well
we mentioned an HTC vigor which had no
specs revealed the motorola droid bionic
was also mentioned but you already know
about this phone but what's interesting
is that it made it to the FCC and it
seems to be a world phone which is
really cool aside from that well this
leaked roadmap also included the LG
revolution which we already reviewed so
it should take log for this devices to
be released also now on the tmobile side
there was also mentions of a samsung
hercules which we got the exclusive
leaked photos which seems to be
t-mobile's variant of the galaxy s2
aside from that it's weird to see that
the phone won't bring the Samsung Exynos
processor and instead bring the Qualcomm
chip that we're used to seeing on just
about every other phone so not really
sure what to make of it also we see an
HTC Ruby which looks a lot like the
current HTC Sensation though it's
interesting to see that it has a white
back or could it be a metallic back not
really sure but the HTC Sensation is
already being sold on t-mobile so not
really sure what to make of that but
aside from that yeah we also caught
images of the LG flip to which is a you
know that other device that has a dual
screen and a keyboard it may be cool for
some people it may be cool for others I
don't really like the thing it couldn't
be uglier but if you're out there for a
dual screen device and don't want to get
the bulk of the kyocera echo stay tuned
for that device when it gets released
not really sure when though alright so
speaking of phones what would the season
be without some really good back to
school deals amazonwireless just
published a really good deal for selling
Verizon
phones in this case you get the HTC
Thunderbolt for 50 bucks after signing
your kidney offered to your contract and
aside from that you also get the samsung
droid charge which is another really
good 4G phone that will cost you a
hundred bucks after the same kidney
contract really good phones really good
deals both phones got really good
numbers in our reviews so stick around
if you're interested for a good device
hit on Amazon aside from that wall of
Amazon's app store is not really
treating you well with just one
application free a day you should have a
look at the service called getjar which
will offer a lot of really good
applications for free though you'd ask
what the catch but the catch is that if
you have to get these applications
you'll be stuck to one version meaning
if you get version one point no love an
application there are apparently no
updates you'll only get that version and
that's pretty much it not really sure if
getjar is going to update this to offer
more options but as of now it's a really
cool way for you to try out an
application before you buy if you like
and you keep it and you buy from the you
know android market or you just stick
around with what you got and just deal
with version 1 point 0 most applications
are good from the start anyways out of
the smartphone releases for the week
spin is just announce that they'll be
releasing their conquer 4g from samsung
which will bring you why max out of
august twenty-first for 100 bucks after
two year contract sadly it looks like a
cheap device though it'll bring you why
max so you might want to consider it
because it does look budget aside from
that thinking about our reviews for the
week our HTC evo 3d review is already
live which got 4.5 out of 5 stars which
is really good almost made our editors
choice so you might want to consider
that and aside from that our mytouch
slide 4g also made our review being
robbed though sadly got 3.5 out of 5
stars not really good and build quality
and video quality so might want to
consider reading Adams review before you
continue and well deke Adams review on
the droid 3 is already live in videos so
you might want to stick around before
considering buying any of these three
devices because we always have your back
on reviews on the software update side
of things skype just released version
2.1 of their android application to
bring video calling to more gingerbread
compliant devices brandon and tony
recently filmed the video demo showing
how it works and it seems to work quite
fine might want to hit the
because it's currently free aside from
that and speaking of those devices that
require gingerbread the htc inspire 4G
finally got the update though it's not
really good to be smiling about these
gingerbread updates because it's already
a year old it should have been released
a long time ago aside from that the HTC
EVO shift 4G which is a mouthful to
pronounce just got an update that allows
you to fix the mms issues if anybody's
still using mms i'm not really sure if
they are and aside from that the Samsung
continuum is finally getting froyo I
can't believe I'm Iraq chua ly saying
this froyo that should have been last
year I mean I'm not really sure what
these carriers and device manufacturers
are taking so long to bring these
updates along but actually they're at
least there I mean anyways and for all
of you living on that XDA developer edge
you remember that HTC announced back in
June that they'll be offering a portal
to allow developers to create more
integrated apps and experiences for HTC
devices which is a load or unlock that
everybody's looking for and that'll do a
lot more than just that well ACC just
offered a website called HTC dev com
which is this portal that allows you to
download these updates but sadly it
currently has nothing it's just there to
crash but remember you can always count
on us on pocketnow.com to offer whatever
these updates are available aside from
that the famous signage in mod has just
been ported to the lg optimus 3d at
least tease that's really not there
available to everybody just yet but it
worked buttery smooth and 3d was also
working which is really great not really
sure what we're gonna get it but it's
actually being tested so that's really
good and well finally the sbf file for
the motorola photon 4g and also the
droid x2 is now available you know that
SPF file in Ethernet whenever you mess
up in using custom roms well it's
already updated and it's already
available you should be getting it just
in case you want to really play around
with custom roms
okay so that does it for what's hot
let's continue on with what's not spread
has just pulled their gingerbread update
to their bulky kyocera echo after
customers were complaining of brick
devices in their hands and also for
those of them that were able to actually
pull through the update they ended up
with performance issues and you think
that these manufacturers and these
carriers would test their units and
their updates before releasing after
they take ages to release them but it
seems that something went wrong right
they're not really sure what the update
will be rolled back to customers but you
know just beware before you update and
continuing on with sad gingerbread news
HTC Thunderbolts update that was
supposed to come out in June is now
being mentioned to be pushed back to
october and well not really sure what to
make of it not really sure when we're
going to get it but if it doesn't
disappoint you enough i mean gingerbread
is almost a year old it was released in
december of last year and devices are
barely getting it and those that are are
having issues not really cool all right
so dual-core processors are barely
making the scene to a small handful of
devices and many of us went crazy when
nvidia recently announced their Tegra 3
kal-el quad-core processor recently and
thought yeah that'll be cool because
nvidia said that we're going to be
releasing these processes are on tablets
as of this month and on smartphones as a
december but sadly not everything went
well that proposal was too ambitious and
vide just pulled back their announcement
and said that no we're not going to get
it this year we'll probably get it
sometime in 2012 though sadly didn't
offer specific dates or quarters I
really sure what to make of it savvy
Nvidia I mean again hey I mean it was
ambitious we know we are barely getting
dual core so we'll cut you some slack on
that but don't play with our minds man
don't go on 2013 or 2014 just 2012 early
on make it happen that's it for today's
show thank you very much for watching
I'm high matter iveta remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
