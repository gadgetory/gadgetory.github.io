2016 last year ctia showed us all the
progress the company has made with the
Internet of Things but now that the
company has invited us to its developer
summit at CES 2016 we've learned that
that was just the tip of the iceberg I'm
hi Mary better with pocket now here with
a quick look at a connected live
sponsored by AT&amp;amp;T
atts developer summit is a big deal at
every CES it Jose TNT's major
announcements for the starting point of
every year and it also features one of
the largest heck cons in the world the
idea of this event is to be a true
win-win if you think about the many
cases where developers come up with
really smart ideas but like the funding
to make them happen or the right tools
and api's to have these ideas reach
their maximum potential the result of
all this collaboration is just amazing
from robotic trash cans too smart
cameras to control drivers in public
school areas to smarter medical
treatment solutions we saw a lot of
products that will hopefully become
tools to solve real consumer problems
and needs in the near future the winner
this year was kinetic care and it's easy
to see why as the solution allows
caregivers to remotely monitor their
patients through wearable technology
that triggers a TNT's digital life home
solutions to call 911 unlock doors that
just mention a few of its features as a
follow-up to our interview back at ctia
the company's CEO of mobility Glenn
Murray was nice enough to give us a
quick overview of everything we've seen
at this conference our developer
programs world-class what we've been
voted the best and and we're proud of
that because you get voted that because
you're really truly giving developers of
tools they want and when you think about
what they picked a hack on and the folks
obviously connecticare is one example
they're doing things that aren't in my
view they're really cool but they're
simple they're solving problems for
people and that was what's most exciting
and we're going to continue to invest
and continue to focus on giving them the
things they want so their stay
interested in all the things that we're
doing the keynote later serve for
companies like for to announce some
major plans like turning as many as 10
million vehicles and two connected cars
over the next few years all in
collaboration with a TNT our vision for
from the time we started what we used to
call merging devices eight years ago to
now is that everything's going to be
connected what you saw on the keynote
was was you know a nice view of a whole
bunch of different things that are
taking place but you think about last
year we talked a lot last year about the
industrial Internet of Things which is
really businesses looking at how they
get
better faster smarter more efficient you
know we did three hundred deals in that
just in 2015 and that's not just us
going out chasing these or we are right
but it's also them looking and coming to
us saying we hear you're pretty good at
this and we want to get better and to
get better while seen abling things
allows you to get that real-time data
allows you to do better for your
customers now the crown jewel of this
event was definitely smart cities this
is clearly the stuff of science fiction
where AT&amp;amp;T will collaborate with major
players like Ericsson and Intel to
provide smart connected solutions a DNT
will initially launched this
collaboration in three cities Atlanta
Chicago and Dallas and the scale of
services that will be benefited it's
just endless we view smart cities is
picking very very relevant use cases
improving they actually work and those
relevant use cases we talked about us
together its energy whether its water
right whether its sustainability
opportunities whether its traffic we can
go down the list but what we started to
see in the marketplace was with our
reputation in the IOT space I think
that's helped because we have cities
coming to us and we started to see more
and more and more of that so we put a
smart cities team in place dedicated in
2015 and it just kept snowballing and
this was kind of similar to some of the
things we saw in the car business so
really what smart cities is about is
making cities better and making people's
lives better it's also about bringing
all of IOT together because reality is
is you live in a city we've got to
connect at home and connected car a
smart phone etc acceptor they need to
work together to really allow people to
mobilize their lives that's our ultimate
goal overall it's really hard not to be
excited for all we've seen at this AT&amp;amp;T
developer summit it's great to see a
company commit to a very bold vision
early on and deliver solutions
progressively with every event we attend
CES 2016 is just the start and we cannot
wait to see smart cities in action very
soon folks there's a lot more coverage
from CES 2016 so make sure you follow us
