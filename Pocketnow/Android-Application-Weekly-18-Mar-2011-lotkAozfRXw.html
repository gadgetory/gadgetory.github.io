another calm and this is another episode
of the android application weekly in
which review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started can
knock down to is a paid-for game which
cross madam nine cents on the android
market so we have three separate games
here between either hit the target hit
the cans and try to knock them over kind
of like at the carnival or hit the cans
in a set amount of time as they're being
fired into the air so let's try this hit
the target one and i'll show you how
this works so it's pretty simple all you
do is aim the ball at the target and
fire and let's see how well we can do in
this a short amount of time and not just
the games get the most amount of targets
hit in one minute mr. number is a free
application available on android market
they're allowed to block unwanted phone
calls and text messages from either
unknown numbers or just people on a
blacklist so if I want to add people to
a blacklist I like to do is go here to
add more to list a select a number or
type in one of the contacts like I can
also show how I appear on other people's
caller ID so I can go to unknown caller
here I can view history if I like and I
can also go to settings and change all
of the settings for how I want people to
be blocked or how I want to be blocked
time lapse is light and paid for
application which costs one dollar
ninety-nine cents on the android market
so the purpose of this is to create
time-lapse photography and what the paid
version you can make it it's up high
quality let's see here as 2592 x 1944
pixels so we'll just go back so i
already recorded one of my videos based
upon these settings so I've Joyce here's
to my time elapses and just go to one of
my videos you can view it and it is a
pretty simple video but it's still fun
the tower raiders is a free and paid
tower defense game which costs three
dollars and ninety-nine cents on the
android market so this game is pretty
easy to operate and it's also very
addictive what you have to do is to
build up defenses and then you can
increase their strength by clicking on
them and increasing their levels so
let's see Oh unfortunately they
were able to get some of these crystals
which is the object to prevent them from
getting so let's see if we can add
something else here all have to do is
double tap on a green square you can add
another cannon and the game continues on
like this layer is a free augmented
reality applications will actually get
information about businesses are
practically anything by adding different
layers so how it works is if you're in
front of something like to do is aim
your camera towards it and it will give
you a little bit of information and also
give you ratings so you can go here to
your layers and you can view which ones
are your favorites and which ones you've
purchased you can purchase different
layers so let's go to categories and try
something here go to art so from here I
can add this layer and then if I go in
front of a picture it'll be able to
recognize what that is so this has been
