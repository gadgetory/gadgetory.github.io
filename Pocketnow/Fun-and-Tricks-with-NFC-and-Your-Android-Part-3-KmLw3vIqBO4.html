some cool things you can do with NFC
tags like sharing URLs sharing your
business card sharing text just by
embedding them into a relatively
inexpensive NFC sticker well before that
we talked about some really powerful
things that you can do with NFC and
profiles in CyanogenMod 9 but what if
you're not running CyanogenMod 9 but you
still want to be able to toggle on and
off various things and settings on your
phone or your tablet using NFC a lot of
you wrote in and recommended NFC task
launcher that's the app that we teased
last time that's what we're going to
talk about today this other app is
called NFC task launcher and with it you
can do some cool stuff kind of like what
we did with the profiles over on
CyanogenMod nightly but it's a little
bit more difficult to set up the
flipside so got some more fun stuff you
can do with it and you don't need to
have a custom ROM in fact you don't even
need root except for a couple things
that I'll show you but it won't show you
and you'll see why so what I've done we
can create a new tag and we've got a
shameless plug over here to be able to
buy tags so you know where you can buy
them from if we wanted to create a new
one we could it jumps us right over here
we can create a new URI that's a
universal resource indicator new vCard a
new message new URL don't really know
what the difference between those two
are or a new switch switch is something
where you can toggle between two two
tasks essentially and then of course the
all-important erase right down there so
if we were to create a new task we can
add an action in this action we can do
lots of stuff we can set up some toggles
turn on and off and whatnot that's great
this Wi-Fi hotspot it doesn't want you
toggle your Wi-Fi hotspot it lets you
create a Wi-Fi hotspot not the one
that's already pre-configured kind of
funny this GPS on off you do have to
have route which I do on this device and
time that I've told it yes go ahead and
do that it says hey this needs to be set
as a super user or a system app rather
and it attempts to do that tells me I
need to reboot I do and well it never
works again so I have to go in and
remove it not from the Google Play Store
but from the control panel of the
settings and it's messy and painful and
it's why this video took a little bit
longer to get out because I had to
figure all that out
so in this build GPS don't miss with it
or you'll be in the same pain that I was
in and then of course mobile data on off
just toggles cool stuff we're gonna
leave that alone for now you can also
set sounds and volumes of all of those
including vibrate on off just like that
always never when sound is off stuff
that you're accustomed to back in here
we can set the alarms very cool we can
go to social media and post something on
Twitter check in with Foursquare
Yatta Yatta Yatta all the way down there
we can't which is kind of cool you know
you can program a tag to say check in
with Google+ in your business and then
have somebody tapped their NFC enabled
Android phone to check in at Google+ if
they have a Google+ account it's a lot
of ifs huh down here we can select an
action to launch an application open a
URL or navigate to someplace display we
can change the brightness notification
rotation lots of cool stuff and then
tasks or tasks tasker's not installed so
it's not letting me do that you can go
in and look at this if you've got some
interesting tasks you want to share with
us please do that in the comments over
at pocketnow.com so we can know what
you're doing with it kind of cool so
what I've done is I've gone through here
and I have created a couple different
tasks Hey so see if I can get over to
that so back on the home screen here are
my recent ones I've got one for home and
I've got one for work so let's go ahead
and open home this is what it does it
turns on Wi-Fi turns off Bluetooth sets
my notification of my alarm volumes to
seven that's all it does I can add more
stuff if I wanted to but
for now let's go ahead and finish just
go ahead and place the tag against the
back of the phone we'll use this one
we're not gonna make that read only and
it says okay that's done so this is our
we said that was home I hope we said
that was home we'll move that over to
the side and now let's do one for work
so when I get to work I want to disable
Wi-Fi disable Bluetooth and post a tweet
okay so let's go ahead and finish this
one set that down there tagged written
successfully great so here I am I've
just arrived home I want to pre
configure everything so set it down goes
ahead and it runs the task sets the
volumes tells me what I'm doing down
here in toast notifications and when
that's all said and done tells me up
here that it ran tasks home very cool I
go to sleep I get up in the morning I'm
still at home I get in my car I go to
work and I want to pre configure all of
my work environments so get to work and
I do that it finds the tag it disables
Wi-Fi disables Bluetooth posts a tweet
and by the way that tweet says something
to be effective saving the world one
line of HTML at a time something like
that and then I have a notification up
here that it ran tasks work so very cool
you can set up kind of location-aware
tasks for you just for you to do things
to kind of mimic those profiles that you
may not have on a stock device and you
can do it all without needing to have
anything custom or anything routed
unless you want some of the more
advanced features so both of these apps
are available in the Google Play Store
they're not free you're gonna be looking
at about a buck two bucks somewhere in
that range for one of them the other one
is free and you can just use it like
that let's come back home and there we
go
I don't have to worry about changing the
volume toggling you know my Wi-Fi on/off
because thanks to fun with NFC
phone and my little sticker can do it
all for me what do you think kind of
cool stuff I hope you liked it this
isn't the only thing this technology can
do I'm sure there's other cool stuff but
that's all I've done with it so far so
what have you done with it head over to
pocketnow.com and I want you to show me
what you have done with your NFC stuff
that's made it all kinds of cool this
will go ahead and post that tweet using
the Twitter API while it's doing that
make sure you give the video a big
thumbs up for pocket now it's showing
off NFC I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
