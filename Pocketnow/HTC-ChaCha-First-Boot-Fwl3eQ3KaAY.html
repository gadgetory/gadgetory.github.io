pocketnow.com and we're gonna boot the
HTC ChaCha for the first time to see how
it sets up to see how HTC managed to
somehow tweak HTC Sense 3.0 to a
landscape display instead of a portrait
one and see how the resolution might
impact its usability or experience so
stay tuned for the HTC ChaCha first boot
okay we've got the power button at the
top let's start it up classic HTC
vibration I'm gonna zoom in on the
screen just like this just for a second
until it boots to recap the specs it
sports a 800 megahertz processor it
supports a two point six inch
touchscreen 512 megabytes of RAM 512
megabytes of RAM 5 megapixel color
camera with autofocus and LED flash
meanwhile we can see the HTC classic
boot logo with the HTC classic sound and
it should get us to the tutorial - the
setup process of a new smartphone just
in a matter of seconds
and here we are you can recognize the
classic ring at the bottom which comes
from HTC Sense 3.0 it should bring up
the welcome screen with the tutorial of
setting up the smart phone let's see
whether it be a smart phone is locked or
not yes it is we just unlocked it and
it's interesting that the HTC has
switched to this ring type of unlock
where you can take the ring from the
bottom of the screen and drag it all the
way to the screen or on a certain
application to go straight to that
application okay so our language will be
English United Kingdom we don't want to
transfer stuff at the moment I'm going
to skip this one we want to synchronize
yes in both via mobile network and
wireless automatically if possible let's
set up just for a second until we
introduce the password and we're back
let's connect to the wireless router
there we go and reconnected we can skip
the screen yes we want to allow for
location data because we want the full
package we agree for our location to be
shared
HTC may collect yes we have our privacy
statement which we need to scroll
through and choose a language of course
see the United States and we will of
course accept it right from the start it
asks for a Facebook account to be linked
so let's set up the account we of course
agree and let's enter our credentials
we'll be right back and we are back
logged into Facebook it asks us whether
we want to sync friends with contacts we
can sync all sync with existing contacts
and don't sink and the default is OK
with us and this marks the initial
startup process and tutorial for the HTC
ChaCha so we having problems dooming
focusing let's try to focus again yeah
there we go
and it's switched to Facebook Romanian
because it knows we are in Romania of
course we will accept the permission we
will grant the permission to post to our
Facebook wall
getting all the information let's go
over this one and we should be ready and
this is the HTC ChaCha homescreen and of
course this was the HTC ChaCha first
boots video this was on Sunday night
from pocketnow.com
