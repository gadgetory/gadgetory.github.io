behind
according to Oppo its new Renault series
is all about being able to further your
vision as a result we have one of the
most versatile camera combos in the
industry with some very interesting
tricks that are rather unique the
question is does it really deliver on
that promise and there's really only one
way to find out I'm Jaime mater we got
up a pocket now this is the Opel Reno
10x zoom and we're about to test it in
one of the most beautiful cities Tokyo
Japan
so our tour guide has a little birdie
what is it about animals and tour guides
and I don't know
so we're currently in the Sensoji temple
probably the oldest temple in Tokyo
founded in 645 ad it is gorgeous
a lot of color a lot of saturation
perfect for testing the Oppo RINO TEDx
and I'll tell you this much this camera
is really impressing me and also the
display I mean colors and saturation
really pop here and it doesn't really
matter if I'm using the 10x hybrid or if
I'm using the 6x zoom or the standard or
the wide-angle colors are beautiful
obviously we're just getting started
with our testing here are some samples
of the experience and we've got a lot
more to go
sorry about crazy restaurant names were
currently at Wagga Mama's shabu shabu I
hope I got it right
Japanese food is definitely my favorite
and testing the AI capabilities for food
photography have proven to be really
good here a couple of samples impressed
with the overall renown
I'll let the samples do the talking
we're currently in the annika sector
which is a very old area in Tokyo what's
most important we were able to test
video capabilities of the Oppo RINO 10x
and we've got 4k at 60 civilisation was
good
4k at 30 as well sadly in the selfie
camera you're capped at 1080p at 30
dynamic range was a little overexposed
for my taste now you probably noticed
that audio is quite epic from this phone
there are a couple of modes standard and
then there's a directional audio option
that will prioritize depending on where
it senses audio it that's coming from
and then there's the 3d audio option
which is the one that I'm currently
using speakers from this phone are very
loud and is they I'm hoping that this is
what the resulting footage is gonna
sound like in the computer civilization
on the selfie camera is not necessarily
the best but other than that I like the
performance wish it were 4k I mean
you've got the megapixels to be able to
achieve that so hopefully for a future
version probably one of those
interesting parts is that even if you
have all the versatility of you know
optical image stabilization in the main
sensor and everything you can't use the
10x zoom for video nor can you use the
wide-angle you are stuck with the
primary camera and the 2x crop that it
creates is literally just the crop
within the same sensor though you've got
enough megapixels to achieve that and
have it look lossless
I'm currently in the beautiful mezu
shrine they're actually a couple of
shrines in this area this is the most
beautiful one let's talk portrait
photography I find it rather interesting
that you've got a lot of versatility you
don't need to step back from your
subject to be able to take your shot
it's using the wide-angle as the
assistant for the depth sensor which is
fabulous you cannot edit the photos
after the fact though there are a couple
of effects but you have to select these
before you take the shot now the results
are rather natural if you stick to the
main camera the results are really
really good and I love the colorscience
that Oppo is using for these the case of
selfie portraits they're good I like the
fact that the crop is actually not bad
it's not too close to you so that's
great then the results are obviously hit
or miss depending on the amount of
lighting you have your hair is gonna
either show up or look Jaggi and all
depends but so far that's par for the
course it's usually the way most phones
behave I actually like the results let
me know what you think in the comments
we're currently in a lake called Mont
suku which if you grab any 1000 yen bill
you'll see that lake in the background
and yes behind me is Mount Fuji this is
a beautiful beautiful places is day two
of the tour having a great time here had
an opportunity to test out the camera
and this is one of those places where
the versatility is extremely evident the
fact that if you want to capture the
lake you need the wide-angle if you want
to capture Mount Fuji and its full
splendor you go for the standard but
then if you want to get closer to Mount
Fuji my god I got some clips of 2 X
optical 6x optical and even 60 X digital
and obviously once you zoom in fully
being able to stabilize a shot is really
difficult but you will notice some
really good detail regardless of all the
light that we currently have there's
more to go as mount Fuji's next and
we're hoping to be able to get there
we're still an hour away and find Mount
Fuji visible it wasn't a couple of hours
ago so we're getting lucky here
so we're currently in the climb to Mount
Fuji
we're actually 2,300 meters above sea
level this is the fifth out of nine
stops to get to the top by the time you
get to the sixth stop you have to hike
there's no way to get there by Road I'm
really impressed by the fact that you
can actually get this far by Road it's a
very beautiful area sadly we came here
with the whole idea of taking photos and
well you can't see anything everything
that you see here this is not fog these
aren't clouds it is fascinating to be
all the way up here and obviously there
is a hit when it comes to breathing and
oxygen so we spend some time having
lunch and I was able to experiment the
capabilities of this camera in 4k video
at 60 frames per second and then slowing
it down for you to create that awesome
sort of slow-mo footage that makes it
look very cinematic
I'm very impressed by the capabilities
at this one when it comes to video
obviously we've got more to go so let's
continue
okay out of everything I've seen this is
the most beautiful shrine of all this is
fujiyoshida we're currently at the
bottom of Mount Fuji gorgeous views
gorgeous trees a lot of green a lot of
saturation wow this is you have to come
and see this this is fabulous definitely
a lot of samples from here I took a lot
of advantage of the wide-angle in
certain spots took some advantage of a
lot of telephoto as well it's amazing
how far you can get with that 10x hybrid
put this place in your bucket list this
is a very beautiful shrine oh my god now
I don't know if you notice but there are
certain cases where in the samples it's
hard to tell the difference between
ultra wide shots and using the standard
lens and that's mainly because there is
ZERO barrel distortion this is something
that many companies struggle with where
you get that fisheye effect around
photos not a problem here obviously it's
not the best sensor for low-light it's a
16 millimeter equivalent of 2.2 aperture
8 megapixels but still if you're in
daylight this allows you to compose your
shots without having to worry about all
those borders and everything a really
really good versatile lens
so you have most likely seen this place
in a couple of postcards that epic
shrine with Mount Fuji in the back this
is the otaku Toyama Schengen Park let's
talk about that particular telephoto
lens we've got a periscopic lens at 13
megapixels on the sensor f3 aperture 130
millimeters we've got 5x optical zoom
and optical limit civilisation now an
interesting fact about this phone is
that one of the things that I did not
like about the Huawei p30 Pro is that
there was no stop at 2 X which is my
favorite for street photography it would
immediately jump into 5x here no it
jumps to 2 X so you get that option then
it jumps to 6 X and you're wondering why
6 X if it should be 5x optical but no it
jumps to 6 X because according to the
engineers that's like the best blend
between sharpness and detail and then it
also jumps into 10x hybrid unless you
want to go all the way to 60 X which is
another option the resulting photos from
this area are fantastic
I am shocked at the amount of detail you
get obviously you've been seeing samples
all throughout this video over what this
zoom lens can do definitely that's the
biggest story in this phone the fact
that we've got that 10x zoom even if
hybrid it provides some amazing detail
and yes this is day three from Tokyo and
there's a main reason why I left the
segment until now it's because we were
waiting on a software update that just
arrived that brought some tweaks and
enhancements to the software and also
some major improvements in photography
and we are totally seeing it primarily
on the main sensor which is another
great part of the story the fact that
we've got that 48 megapixel camera
I'd have 1.7 aperture at 26 millimeter
equivalent that really has point 8
microns but becomes 1.6 once you apply
pixel binning there's face detection
autofocus and optical image
stabilization and the reason why it's a
major deal is because pixel binning plus
a dedicated night mode in the software
makes for some really amazing low-light
photography obviously the primary sensor
does really good during the day great
color and everything but it's in
low-light where it shines the most
because while we see a ton of detail and
one of the things that I like about this
night mode is that you don't really have
to wait long to get your shot that for
me is a big plus but even more important
which is one of the biggest
disappointment with other phones is the
fact that night mode doesn't work with
the wide angle or the telephoto not the
case with the Oppo Reno just like in the
case of the Huawei P 30 pro night mode
does work with the ultra wide-angle it
does work when you zoom into subjects
obviously I still don't know exactly
what lens is being used here but we do
have the advantage that we do get a lot
of highlights in detail from either
zooming into subjects or again in wide I
really like the performance of this
camera in low-light and obviously in the
day it's even better the experience has
been fantastic to conclude I have to say
that my experience with the Oppo Reno
10x zoom has been far better than I
expected I had seen Opel working a lot
in their photography over the last
couple of years but this is proof that
they've come very far and that they've
harnessed all the technology that we've
got here and that they innovated with
the sensor in addition to the fact that
we've got this periscopic zoom lens
we've got the versatility of a wide
angle it doesn't have barrel distortion
let us know what you think about all the
samples and the experience that we had
here in Tokyo with this phone while
you're at it make sure you follow us on
social media subscribe to both our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one you can also
follow us on Instagram and social medias
our extended coverage happens there and
you can also follow me for samples of
what I do with these phones please get
this video thumbs up if you like what
you saw
I'm highly metal but I think so much for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
