there was a very interesting study
published by Oakland you know the makers
of speedtest.net they said that not all
flat ships are created equal
doesn't really matter if you have the
$1000 iPhone 10 if you have a device
with a call come snapdragon 845 it will
outperform the iphone 10 and data speeds
I was like all right that sounds
interesting but there's really only one
way to find out we decided to put two
$1000 phones to the test
I'm hematuria better with pocket now and
this is Samsung Galaxy Note 9 vs iPhone
10 data speeds from the most complex
city in the world New York
so bear in mind these are not our full
reviews those are actually separate
videos but I just I find goolies results
so mind-boggling that the smartest thing
to do is to bring both these phones and
test them in the city using nucleus
speedtest.net application and see how it
goes
so we are currently here in Rockefeller
Center definitely one of the busiest
busiest sectors of New York
we ran the tests and I wasn't expecting
great result from either device but
regardless the results of the galaxy
note 9 were significantly better than
the iPhone 10 considering the fact that
in the second test the iPhones and
didn't even raise the bar at all it
didn't even work it just got stuck there
clearly if you are in a congested
scenario like this one the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 is already performing
better let's go somewhere else
all right so we're currently in 57th and
seventh for those of you that want to
test the maximum data speeds of your
phone I happen to know that there's a
t-mobile tower here
we ran the tests oh my god this was
insane the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 got a
maximum of 160 megabits down the iPhones
maximum was thirty two point eight that
is insane two phones on the same
networks did you see that same price tag
theoretically same capabilities for
which are paying for you'd assume but
note that the differences is just
significant stop by 57th and seven run
your test on your own we're going to
continue
so let's go through a little detail
about the claim if you remember I had
horrible complaints about battery life
on the iPhone 7 plus when I reviewed it
it turns out that the reason why was
because the Intel modem that powered the
data was not performing as well as
Qualcomm modems this iPhone 10 on
t-mobile has an Intel modem as well
depending on your carrier there are some
options that don't have the Intel modem
but obviously this new Samsung Galaxy
Note 9 has the new clock from stamp
dragon 845 the new Snapdragon X 20 modem
and so far of the results have been epic
let's prove some more so we are
currently in Union Square one of my
favorite parts of the city I highly
recommended we're actually going to
another one of my favorite ones after
this so far the test results are close
but not quite the Samsung Galaxy Note 9
is still on top in some cases
we're running three tests and everywhere
we go in some cases were five percent
higher there was a test where it was 20%
higher but still on top when compared to
the iPhone 10 upload speeds are pretty
much the same in most cases but down
those speeds are significantly different
and some of the tests that we've run so
far and we've got more to go
we're currently at the High Line which
is on top of the Chelsea Market
I love the sector you should definitely
be here fun fact Chelsea Market has got
the YouTube space if you haven't visited
speeds Esper rather interesting for the
first time the iPhones and Juan attest
but then that only lasted one test the
other two tests that we ran the galaxy
note 9 one and by a higher margin than
what the iPhone one definitely upload
speeds varied but so far it's proof that
we are still I don't know the note 9 is
still beating the iPhone
now any season New Yorker will know that
the ultimate test is the subway there is
no data between stations and there is
some data in certain stations like for
example right here in the 14th Street
Station where you can catch the AC Andy
close to Chelsea
we ran the tests the galaxy note 9 won
by a good margin in two of the tests
only in the third test of the iPhone 10
beat the galaxy note 9 and by a
significant margin and that has been the
second test out of pretty much every
single other test that we've ran all
throughout Midtown and in this Chelsea
sector so far definitely the galaxy note
9 is winning it proves a ton of things
it is nearly 9:00 p.m. we are at our
office in midtown 19th floor we ran the
last test right now and even though the
iPhones end shows a superior quality
when it comes to upload speeds download
speeds are still won by the Galaxy Note
9 and absolutely every single test we
did and we've even seen cases like for
example when it comes to Wi-Fi if I'm
here in the office
I will even notice that the Galaxy Note
9 will retain connection to Wi-Fi from a
further location than the iPhone 10 so
who's the winner where you gonna spend
money on $1000 is definitely a lot of
money and I guess my point would be that
a device with a qualcomm snapdragon 845
is definitely a better Buy this is a
clear example of real-world use from
different locations around New York City
let us know in the comments what you
think which one would you pick what are
your opinions overall the enhancements
of Qualcomm has brought to the market
