pocket out that we are taking a look at
the droid bionic by motorola it has the
temper to platform so poor 1 gig of
processors 4g speeds the only difference
between this and the eighth tricks is
that this has less ram 512 megabytes we
think that that's because this device
can't do the down a doctor little
netbook thing so let's go to
applications and take a look at how much
RAM we have available at this moment in
time just to get some confirmation on
that so it's a little bit slow actually
which is kind of a kind of surprising so
we are not all right screen here it's go
to services
look down there how much memory we have
so probably about 300 megabytes of RAM
after the operating system takes note of
some so this is the qhd display which
means that you get an extra amount of
pixels down here is 960 x 540 you can
really tell like on the nature really
tell about to be the case by the home
screen because get an extra row of icons
on the bottom kind of like a down you
can swipe to the right swipe to the left
performance seems to be a little bit
choppy which is strange for dual-core
processors right so let's move around
here let's open up a few apps jump into
the web browser here and see what it's
like in there so someone was on YouTube
do it video playback looks like here
lots of fingerprints on the screen every
morning see a smooth video and expect
that to be the case here let's jump into
other applications so let's go to
wandering installed on here in
fortunately
maps remember that
trouble finding Google Maps seem to be
installed on here okay we'll go to
something else in that case so let's
just jump around alarm and timer just
get an idea
so
skype demo
it's just a video right so again did
like we're finding on the entrance this
device isn't that fast and maybe it's
because software is not yet optimized to
take advantage of the dual core
processor android 2.2 point one Froyo
yeah anyhow that is the droid bionic
like the atrix but less ram doesn't
happy doc functionality overall a thin
device probably has a pretty big battery
to be able to handle that 4G LTE
connectivity on verizon tough
a rubbery feel to the back yeah sort of
see that over there hdmi we got here on
the left side of the price and
