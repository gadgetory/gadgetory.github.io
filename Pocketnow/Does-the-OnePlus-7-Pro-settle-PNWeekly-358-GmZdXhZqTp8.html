about half an hour into this episode
David Amell who is joining us on this
episode his audio gets a little wonky he
actually kind of sounds like Bon Jovi
and it's is it's my life where he uses
that voice modulator or something it
sounds a little bit like that I did my
best to minimize the damage that might
come to your ears it's about a five
minute stretch of this podcast but after
that or aside from that everything is
perfectly fine so hopefully you'll bear
with me and also when you hear that no
nothing's going on with your car stereo
or your headphones or your phone or
whatever you might be listening to us on
it's not you it's definitely us my
favorite phrase during that dinner for
men abang wise no I get it
you you you're totally right but it
doesn't matter oh boy Thunder he shouts
out to you bro okay
hello everybody and welcome to the
weekly brought to you by PocketNow a
next day developers on this day it is
May 17 2008 busy week it's been a busy
honestly year there's been so many not
only leaks rumors speculation but there
have been so many announcements actually
happening in this week we had one of the
biggest ones it's going to be the crux
of our episode this week when we react
to the 1 plus 7 Pro which I believe
everyone in this group we were all at
the event and we all have our hands on
the actual device actually let me go
ahead and what I find funny about this
is that now we can actually have these
in frame whereas in the last two
episodes of the podcast we don't have to
like keep it out of frame okay yeah
didn't talk about it yeah exactly it's
physically in frame right now all right
let me go ahead and start with David
then oh no that's TK there you go let's
start with David then David animal from
Android Authority welcome back to the
show brother hey been a while yeah um
and like a yoi I like that painting
behind you if you had relocated yourself
to just one other portion of that
apartment you would be in the same exact
set that Cogan was it last week yeah
exactly I dividend while you staying
with our friend the unlocker who is
probably working right now it is we work
but yeah we were there just before this
and then I came here to be cool to have
quiet
it's basically record well thank you for
being on man how are things been for you
the last time we saw you I think was
actually during travel and since then
you've been traveling everywhere this is
usually this is a trope whenever David's
on a podcast it's like where have you
been
well there's the tickety podcaster this
podcast yeah I was in San Francisco for
a little bit before this I went to
Vancouver for Galaxy fold mm-hmm and
then I went to San Francisco and I
actually stayed in San Francisco for
almost two weeks which was a big deal
for me and then I came to New York and
did one plus and then I've stayed the
whole week but I did I'm working I
picked my pixel 3a review
finishing today and then that's gonna go
out on Monday and then on Monday I get
the zenfone 6 oh ok so we're definitely
gonna be talking about that our pixel
3/8 reactions are kind of ongoing still
because everyone is using it I I was
recently asked like what is it man
exactly I was recently asked what is
your daily phone and I was like I it's
it's weird to say but I keep coming back
to this is it weird that I like this
more than the pixel 3 itself no I think
that's pretty universally yes I feel
like because it's lighter and I actually
love the feel of plastic phones I they
actually feel great I don't I don't know
it's a me it's awesome I do honestly
wish people would give plastic more
credit yeah yeah I just know this
obsession with glass like it's gonna be
important for 5g because those antennas
basically bounce off of everything and
they need the windows so it's important
that phones are glass now but man it for
4G phones or like I think that for sub 6
gigahertz spectrum can actually go
through plastic so if you make a phone
that a sub sick
sub 6 but not millimeter wave did I
think plastic would be fine yeah look at
that look at that 5g top coming from
David already we had a few buddies were
they all out in New York or somewhere
she robot shake ah go yeah yeah yeah
Chicago Minneapolis
none of us Android blog friends got
invited really it was like it was just
all the traditional pubs yeah indeed ok
so while I remember that I don't have
any of my lights on in the background
I'm gonna fix that right now
TK Bay back once again you were yeah
yeah I'm let me just say real quick to
the both of you thank you so much for
being aa social you t K was a super
last-minute request for you to come on
oh yeah anytime thank you so much and
this time around like I was alluding to
in the last episode you're back outside
again I yep no this time I happen to be
outside it's just a timing but yeah it's
good day you know we have Sun here it's
not writing but it is going to rain in a
few days so it it's good I'm happy that
it's a good weather I was actually
really depressed when we came back from
New York and it was raining yeah
it was just when I saw hi Otto talking
about it on Twitter the day everybody
was leaving it suddenly became sunny in
New York you know is there any you know
it's funny is I got the opposite effect
because it was sunny as heck in San
Francisco for like the whole two weeks I
was there I came here and it just became
beautiful and then it's been thundering
and storming in San Francisco the whole
last week I have waited all the bad
weather it's been great all right I
loved it no New York was great yeah so
we're gonna talk at length about the 1
plus 7 Pro not the 1 plus 7 all we got
was the 1 plus 7 Pro in New York and
then 1 plus 7 is a whole different thing
and then there's a 5g version and then
it's just it's kind of crazy how one
Plus did this entire launch everyone in
my review was like why didn't you talk
about the fact that has 5g and that's
like it this one does not know but will
react to that in a little bit I do want
to make sure we spend a little bit of
time reacting to yet another phone that
is trying to do something different we
all pretty much agree that phones are
getting interesting and fun again when
we have things like that pop up
happening yeah also the others yeah at
the elbow Reno with its shark fin the
shark fin one and now we have the
zenfone 6 it's the 6 right
yeah there's n phone 6 Oh suits kind of
really quietly and a little bit
surprisingly put out their announcement
of a phone that also has a type of
pop-up camera only right now you're
probably seeing the b-roll as I put it
in its the rear camera module that
actually flips forward somehow it takes
for me 8 megapixel selfies I was just
about to say okay so since I don't want
to see my pores I'm gonna need that
beauty mode so how do you feel about
this particular cuz the last time I saw
something even remotely like this was
the Oppo n1 and the n3 and he wasn't a
mechanical back then I think it was with
just a manual right you had that flip it
many no wait with it one of the days
yeah and one of them was yeah yeah yeah
so some some takes from you guys like is
this is this the next wave of our
cameras on smartphones because I mean it
is nice to be able to use the main
cameras
more than one breath and it does - it
does take away the front-facing camera
that is something that we've been
talking about for a long time for
naturalist phones I don't think it will
last that long because I mean I saw a
report the other day that Samsung is
working on an under display camera and
if Samsung's working on it you know that
VEVO and Oppo probably have one ready
that they will show us in like two
months right after yeah exactly
how about you to get has how does this
pop-up look to you like a form factor
that you're into yeah it's an it's an
interesting form factor to say the least
I think it it looks nice it may look
good on video but in reality like if you
have your phone sitting against I mean
so my thing would first thing I'm
thinking is cases right how our case is
gonna be able to work on this one the
mechanism opens up so that means that
entire area has to stay open okay so
it's nice to see I think built in the
way the Reno does it the way the Oppo or
you know the art they I think the re 11
Pro or even the what we have here with
the one plus seven pro I think it's a
better implementation I'm not I'm not
sure I like the fact that we can use the
main camera I just felt like it should
have been a little bit like the older
mechanism was a little bit easier to
work with but even then there was no
cases for the original Apple ones I
think was it there the one from a long
time at the end 7 I think yeah I think
the there's nobody at the end one of the
n3 are the ones I remember oh yeah yeah
the cases for them basically just didn't
have a top so yeah because it's gonna be
and then just imagine if that mechanism
ever breaks that's it you lost your
front-facing camera you mentioned the
open or 11 RR 11 Pro how did that one
handle it again I I can't remember also
to say if I'm not mistaken it's the same
as the one plus seven oh it's just you
had enough yeah I think it that's
actually not a bad out option I mean if
we you need it it's there if you don't
you know the display is bigger and you
obviously have the better cameras on the
back and you know if you get the mirror
grey which I realize that the the event
after we're all getting our hands on
this stuff that is actually literally a
mirror it's meat very very reflective I
just kept looking at the elephant
honestly like that's the one that super
hot yeah yeah that I loved last year how
they did the was they called the
oh man they had the other white one last
year on the 1 plus 6 remember I think
was man now I can't remember it but
anyway it's it's nice to have these
options I like their limited edition
colors and they are always nice yeah so
going back to the foreign factor changes
when it comes to all of this like I I
was always a huge proponent of the
slider you know the length of me mix 3 I
stole I still adore it it's my office
phone so when I need to use it for like
a teleprompter or for controlling my
cameras that's someone I usually go for
but also you have those you have this
pop-up like I'm saying and then you have
this flip over there is one little issue
and that's a little for someone like me
because I use these all the time
you can't put a clip-on lens on that oh
no no no that depth but all of that out
you're wrong that annoys me because if
the front-facing camera and this is this
is alluding to a point that we'll make
during our 1 plus 7 Pro discussion later
but if the front-facing camera is not
wide enough then your solutions are all
bunk like it's just not going to work
and that honestly depresses me a little
bit because just speaking about this one
in particular but most phones they don't
have wide front facing cameras and not
very few I think there's LG's one of the
last ones is that or and even the pixel
3xl yeah it's really wide but even then
the pixel 3a it's not all that bad but
then again it doesn't matter it doesn't
matter if this lens is wide because I
can put a I can attach a lens to it so
that's fine it's just all of these like
crazy phones that are coming out that
don't seem to be like they're not going
to be able to take it so as a moment I'm
not a moment ambassador but I am an
advocate of the moment lenses hashtag
sponsor moment the that the moment lens
is once I found out how to use them as a
clip-on lens like I try to use them on
all my phones but all of these fun
phones that are coming out right now it
doesn't work so no kind of depressed
about that it's that experimentation
phase yeah exactly
back to the Asus zenfone 6 seeing
everybody talk about it obviously we're
going to be talking about price when it
comes to oneplus later
$4.99 for this phone it has I try to
remember what the eternal specs are but
the one thing that I kept remembering
that it has like you said David that 48
megapixel camera $4.99 855 six gigs of
RAM and under 28 good storage like this
is it's basically it's basically a one
plus seven pro came out of nowhere right
I mean it's hold up I think the best
thing about this phone is the UI they
like gave up on whatever the heck you I
there is on you are which was anyway
yeah so many it was so bad and they're
they're doing like a stock plus thing
ZTE did this a couple years ago they
started using they literally call it
stock plus and actually liked it a lot
like I didn't think I would ever like a
ZTE phone but it feels very stock
Android and then they just added a few
extra features like you know scrolling
screenshots and like screen recording
and stuff it's good it's good and I
guess the Zeus is doing it I haven't
actually got to touch the phone yet but
I get it on Monday so no I want I need
to figure out a way to try it out then
again for $4.99 I don't think I could I
would be against actually buying it the
way that I did with the pixel 3a yeah
how compelling is this price point to
you guys how important yeah how
compelling is this like because $4.99 I
have a lot of people on Instagram and a
lot of people on Twitter saying that
this is the warm plus mentality that one
Plus no longer has again alluding to our
discussion later it's a mixed bag it's
like I really need to try it and see the
experience first because the one like 1
plus phones have this really really
well-designed ubiquitous design
experience that is like that goes
through the entire ecosystem of the
phone like they kind of 1 + s UI is kind
of based around the old Google now that
was like a thing in 2015 where they
would you know they had a little
material people that would run around
and like they were cute and colorful and
that's kind of one plusses thing and it
populates throughout the entire UI
whether it's the clock app or whether
it's like they're new like time out
Digital well-being thing like yeah and
it's just it just makes experience feel
relief
like whole which i think is what you get
you know iPhone and that's something
that everyone like Apple has been like
narrating or like just making better and
better since they made the first iPhone
yeah and if we'll have to see what Asus
does to like make it feel like a whole
experience rather than just like a thing
that has Android on it you know do we
know if this is coming to Western Shores
I think it is look I think it's actually
gonna be available on like bnh and
Amazon oh okay
fair that much I have to double check
that though because like honestly it's
it's not been on my radar that much and
I only started looking at like looking
at stuff about it because I was told I
needed to review it fair enough so I buy
you TK $4.99 Snapdragon a 55 for the a
megapixel camera that you can use for
your face as it looks like simply saying
before that as long as they have that
beauty mode setup 48 megapixels I mean
Kent I know I've got yeah that is that
is not the high quad so the hope
essentially is that it actually does
hold up the to what they're claiming
obviously topknot specs are one thing
but the only UI the experience the
camera experience and as there you know
hopefully we actually be able to see for
actually you know pick up against this
hasn't been doing that well in the US as
far as like a main market so it's gonna
be interesting when they come back and
try to bring in this new camera module
you know ecosystem I'm I'm hoping that
you know it does come out and we'll see
some kind of Android Q to it that'll
also make it a little bit more
compelling for people because you don't
want to just get it and get stuck with
that invert you know current version of
Android that it just sits on so that's
my main thing it's updated
sustainability so hopefully but 499 is
definitely interesting enough in federal
yeah it is it is super interesting and
it's almost like a return for a sous in
general because man I remember back in
the day when we would have like the
zenfone 3 there's f-14 and there was
like yeah eight different versions of it
yeah
the whole the whole point of the Zen
phones in the past was just to be like
hey we have the latest Snapdragon
chipset and then a sous used to be the
company that would always show
people with they had the most RAM out of
anyone yeah yeah one of the first
articles I ever wrote for a blog was I
think the zenfone 3 and the fact that I
had four gigabytes of RAM and I remember
being and it was like a shocking amount
of RAM at the time like everyone was
doing one or two gigs and I remember
writing like oh my gosh this is insane
like you're getting four gigs of RAM for
it was like 399 or something it was it
was pretty chit was still super cheap
that's the thing today they're still
going with the super cheap mentality and
the high-end specs but now I feel like
they're actually trying to appeal to a
wider audience and realizing that their
UI was crap so okay which is probably
something that we should tell other
companies sometimes like you know right
now the right now the guiding force
towards like really good and thoughtful
Android design is oxygen OS it is one of
the mainstays right now and of course
you have like what we would call the the
pixel launcher but it is the Google
Android version on the pixel 3a and the
pixel phones but yeah I'm personally I'm
pretty excited about that about that
phone I just wish that there was a
little bit more fanfare about it like it
was super quiet and you know it would
have been great to see you soos actually
try to like you know ruffle some
feathers with this particular phone
because it would have like the price
alone ruffles feathers and people out
there people are talking about it a lot
right now all right cool so we're about
we're about in a little bit we're about
20 minutes in already and I do have a
mid role to do but I'm gonna go ahead
and go to our break do that mid role and
when we come back we're going to talk
about what is in our pockets now it's a
weird way to put it you might have been
listening to us talk about 5g a lot on
the weekly but there is another internet
revolution coming it's called Wi-Fi six
and to get the kind of blinding speed
that you know you want in your home
Netgear now has the nighthawk Wi-Fi six
router it is capable of four times the
capacity compared to today's Wi-Fi
standards and that means you will have
more devices working simultaneously
without any impacts to speed and
reliability as smartphones and laptops
and TVs are getting more and more
advanced the data that powers them will
need to be
as high-powered as possible so make sure
your internet is future-proof for
services like Netflix Hulu and even
gaming you can turn your Wi-Fi up to six
with the nighthawk Wi-Fi six router at
Netgear comm slash Wi-Fi six that's
Netgear comm slash Wi-Fi and the number
six it's the biggest revolution of Wi-Fi
ever when we go ahead and ask our guests
right now tku did enter this already
last week but I wonder if there's
something different I have this
recurring segment on the show now where
I asked our guess what is in your pocket
now so I can actually say that I have
this one in my pocket so I do have the 1
plus 7 throw in my pocket and I actually
still like using my may 20 Pro mmm may
20 promo and and I have something else
but I can't really talk about which ask
you real quick though what your phone
serve those that you're using I think
they're called a shark it was part of an
IndieGoGo campaign that I got and it was
just basically their stereo earphones
with 7.1 surround sound oh and it has a
detachable microphone so it's a gaming
gaming microphone for the for your
smartphone dang those look pretty cool
and it sounds nice I get to think it's
good that you're using that for the
podcast yeah it sounds yeah yeah even
though you're outside in sunny Pasadena
right now yeah it is it is nicely but
it's going to start raining in a couple
days but yeah so may 20 promo 7 throw a
lot of pros alright so David ml you have
your hands on so many different phones
at any given point what is in your
pocket now also one plus seven Pro just
because I love one plus phone so they
haven't switched back to the six or 60
yet usually when I'm not reviewing
something I either use the 6 or 16 I
still think that the 1 plus 6 is the
best smartphone that oneplus has ever
made and I really really like it but I'm
also using the pixel 3a because I'm
finishing up my review today and it's
going out next Monday and I really
really like this phone too
I we were talking about this before the
podcast started but there's something
about polycarbonate plastic then I think
it's super underrated and I wish
should make a comeback it's it's lighter
it's it feels nice in your hand
I draw okay the first day I had it I
dropped it it's spun like 20 times and
just clattered on the floor it's plastic
it's not gonna shatter like come on
shatter like yeah I can just do this and
it doesn't matter like do you do that I
do that anyway I'm not I'm not that
careful
I often review phones without cases
because I'm like the manufacturer wants
to make it stronger they'll make it
stronger yeah exactly I saw a tweet
earlier today I'm try remember who said
it was it it might have been it might
have been Flossie actually fluffy Carter
where you said that he already broke his
pixel 3a but no biggie just pick up
another one because you can and I can't
believe I'm saying that because you know
I complained a little bit last week
about how a lot of people were given the
pixel 3a they were quote-unquote team
pixels and I was not I'm trying to fear
was an event here in New York two days
ago in which everyone got three A's I
didn't go to it I didn't get invited to
it it was for
I don't remember just gonna do this
right now I am a LA over here so I think
I think the reason I didn't get invited
is because they only sent two invites
out to people who lived in New York the
new New Year which Google and Samsung
they're usually pretty they're pretty
guilty of doing that they did they want
you to be as local as possible probably
because if they want those devices back
it's easy to get um perhaps assigned you
at your house that's just a theory
that's all I'm saying you know door
there are quite a few of us in LA I'm
just saying you know but anyway I guess
we got to move up to San Francisco I see
what you're saying at the Iowa I mean
that's a whole different discussion but
my pocket now I don't have it I actually
I need to sort of unbox it and get it
set up and I don't have it on my desk
right now cuz I actually left it in the
car but this morning I did have a bit of
a meet with insta 360 and when I when I
spoke to them a little bit and I told
them that I have a few trips coming up
including an upcoming trip to London the
honor lunch is about to happen I told
them like yeah it'll be great to be able
to use something for vlogging and for
testing purposes and now I have an
integer 361 X to test out it also came
with this like did you guys know that
one insta 360 has this like bullet time
mode do you know about this no no okay
so it's obviously a 360 camera right so
what you do is you put it at the end of
a selfie stick and then they have this
this like pistol grip that has a
rotating top so what you do is you put
the entirely you extend the entire
selfie stick you screw it onto the the
handle and then it rotates freely so
what you do is you put it above your
head and you just hit it and it goes
around like this oh I've seen this yeah
it's pretty cool and I can't believe
it's an actual mode in the insta 360
camera so she the person that I met when
she showed me an example of it when she
was in Japan I'm about to be in Japan in
about a month but she showed me one in
the middle of a forest and it's just
this really slow motion capture of like
a bullet time thing and I was like wow
that's sick so I'm pretty excited to
actually try that try that out
the thing I will say also just a delayed
so this the thing that I want to be in
my pocket now you guys saw that DJI
announced I write oh yes you know the
new action camera in the gadna days it's
called the DG is the Osmo action Osmel
action the Osmo action yeah
that is one heck of a device it's it's
great to see that all the reasonably
priced reasonably priced yeah very
reasonably priced it's gonna be like it
might be the darling camera for a lot of
budding vloggers no such as since that
screen is upfront but yeah I definitely
wanna get my hands on that too
alright now speaking of what is in our
hands right now it's time to start
reacting to this thing right here the 1
plus 7 pro bro hot take from me to just
real quick I do have a case on it I do
love the nebula blue but I do have a
puff socket on here I think this one's
too big
yes thank you okay you know okay I'll
let you finish right I actually think
it's the right size it's the form I mean
it don't get me wrong it is six point
six seven inches it's longer than most
other phones but for me I mean I I've
used the the made X the may 20 X
yes it'll set Michel on here because
he's as the may 20 X's in sailing right
yeah who use it as a daily driver so
that's that's a seven point two inch
display and and that's even bigger than
what we have and I actually it's it's
really more fitting exactly depending on
you watched a lot of content you hear
you clean a lot of games the form factor
is definitely there the stereo speakers
are great and and I mean I'm still in
that honeymoon phase I feel like I've
had it for a couple of weeks now
and I still AM in that honeymoon phase
and I don't want to put this phone down
it's that kind of moving away from just
reviewing it - I actually want to just
keep using this as my main driver so
it's getting very close to my may 20 Pro
just mostly from a comfort level of
using it and I love just the overall
real estate I just get so much more into
it so I'm four four six point seven inch
its I mean up not seven point two
anymore but yeah how would you David
it's too big that was kind of my first
thing I even said in my review like if
they'd and so I think that I think the
trend was the one plus six was like six
point two six and then the one plus
seven the one plus sixty was like six
point four six four six ago and then now
the seven pro is six point six seven and
so they keep upping the size of the
screen by like point to zero inches and
I think that what they should have done
was if they were going to be able to
remove the knotch
I would have liked to see a phone that
was the same size as maybe the one plus
six or sixty but then just like get rid
of the notch because then you basically
have a bigger screen in a in the same
form factor and I think the six and
sixty both feel like good sizes at least
in my hand and I do have average-sized
hands for a male I don't have small
hands call back I was saying last week
that I have my hands so I'm triggered
because my first video ever on a a was
why I felt why I didn't like the galaxy
s 8 plus and one of the reasons was that
at the time it felt very big when all of
the YouTube comments were like you have
small hands you must have little tiny
baby hands
yeah it just feels large and I really
really would have liked that they kept
the form-factor smaller because honestly
if you reduce the bezel it's basically a
bigger phone so oh it's oh yeah no no
definitely they could have still claimed
a bigger display all of the new things I
think for me I appreciate having the
bigger battery the bigger display and
then being able to fit all of that into
the it's a nice it's I mean really it if
it's well balanced as far as just
usability it doesn't just tilt over so
it's not heavy or bottom heavy or
top-heavy so for me it's the weight
distribution is not bad and you know if
you have the right case on it that gets
rid of the whole slipperiness of the the
back just you know cuz I know yeah so
I'm using the yet well I'm not even
there I'm like puff socket all the way
guys like it's gonna fall out of my
hands if I try to maneuver around it
with one hand I even tried texting ah no
anger gymnastics yeah and dramatic and
it'll get me wrong I'm good at hand room
tasks but the moment you use I I'm
always going to be an advocate if the
moment you use a puff socket like
everything changes like it's just that
much more convenient it's not slippery
hmm polycarbonate where to bring it back
easier to grip to begin with which i
think is that my main takeaway is that
like the using a smaller phone along
with the bigger phone like there's an
obvious skew in my usage like there's
one that i have't eight towards because
of usability
alright so nebula blue for all of us
obviously any thoughts on the colors you
were mentioning earlier we did mention
earlier that there's a mirror gray we do
like the almond as well that's not
coming in till june right is that what
they said yeah yeah I think that's the
announcement and it is the same thing Oh
pearl white that's what it was last year
I forgot the name so last year was the
six they had the pearl white
yeah well that was gorgeous yeah that
was ice now man I did the moment that
came out I ordered that one right away
okay had was and I ordered six had
awesome colors and it wasn't even the
fact they were just colors it was the
fact that they all had different
textures the pearl white was like it
felt like baby powder was applied to the
phone it felt so like grippy and kind of
just soft it was awesome but they said
that the difference though is that in
the almond the almond actually is more
of like an iPhone 10s type back where
it's like more glass glass where this is
like frosted glass Oh interests exactly
yeah yeah I know that that there's a
different texture going on but uh it
looks like the gold iPhone 10s basically
all right so daily usage obviously
performance they're all about that speed
thing was it called speed you need speed
you need and so any thoughts from from
you guys about like just a performance
aspect because it seems like as far as
flagship quality is concerned and as far
as the whole never settle mentality is
concerned it seems like it's about the
daily usage oxygen OS performance 855 12
gigs of RAM for crying out loud I know
what is your daily experience been like
so far you know something that oneplus
does that I think people don't really
take into account is that they're they
like don't use animations for a lot of
stuff and it actually makes the phone
feel faster a lot a big tip that I
remember people talk about I was like
dude just turn off the animations for
things you have phones benefit less is
fast and one place actually doesn't have
animations
a lot of stuff so like Xinbo on the s10
when you unlock the display with the
instinct in the bolita
there's like yeah it didn't feel like I
was like downgrading in the screen speed
so like and the fact that this is a
whole nother thing I know I want to be
able to talk to them pop over there
all right go for it
any thoughts so like 90 Hertz I
personally love it I think it's a great
I think it's great I do it I do admit
that it seems most noticeable in oxygen
OS yeah so because apps apps appear at
space specifically support 90 Hertz
you're only actually going to get the 90
hurts when you're like it's the same
thing that we had with the razor phone
to it you'd notice it when you turn on
and developer options the root they had
the FBS showing on the display most of
the time we hit 120 whenever we were in
the UI flipping between you know on on
on our launchers and so on so I mean for
me like they've said it David I said
it's it's really more it's a smaller
upgrade right we're normally set at 60
if we go up to 90 it's a small up here
but when you go from 60 to 120 it's a
bigger noticeable change you can see it
a little bit easier and
really most games right now we're not
even using the 90 Hertz we don't have
any even not even port Knights even
compatible at 60 frames or even stuck at
30 frames per second there so there's a
limitation of what we can do no I know
it I mean the honor of u-20 came out and
even at launch had 60 frames per second
support right out of the box so those
are things like you know they're
thinking about it and they're trying to
push this with a new fanatic mode as a
gaming phone you know the battery life
the and there's just there's little
things and it with RAM boosts that they
put into the settings in there as well
so they're they're wanting us to use it
more but their optimizations were done
mostly internal now we need to wait for
developers and companies actually you
know adhere to their new standard or at
least bump them up to something close
because we want to be able to not
specifically we just hope that they will
do it eventually I feel like it's less
of a focus for oneplus and more for like
Xiaomi and black shark and obvious you
know obviously the actual gaming brands
are gonna want to be in that but I guess
oneplus is just trying to support gamers
rather than actually sponsoring them or
actually like really focusing on that
but the fanatic mode I love it like the
fanatic mode is just a great idea and
I've been doing so much work with gaming
phones recently that different things
like the shark space or the game space
on the red magic Mars I believe yeah the
market yeah those are those are great
ideas that oneplus just proved you can
do without needing a toggle or a
completely different side it just needs
to detect that you're playing a game and
then it'll give you
options that you need obviously
controllers and inputs are a whole
different story oneplus is not really
into that but at least as smart as a
performance standpoint is concerned
they're doing a great job of supporting
gamers that's that's great I think
that's the screen recording for a long
time it's and they're gonna have it in
Android q natively but the fact that
oneplus was like you know what these
people need it now I really appreciate
that because I used it today and their
implementation of screen recording is
actually great it's better than Huawei
is for sure yeah oh very very smooth and
works perfectly especially if you're
narrating all the options that you get
it's just it's amazing and then you can
edit your video right into your gallery
and just write it there you can post it
straight to social media that's
fantastic I love it yeah it's actually
like I said in my part one of my review
of the phone this this is probably the
most gamer centric phone if you think
about it from a content creation
standpoint because I actually have a
gaming channel and you could open up an
Android video game hit record and then
just have like an external microphone in
order to like do some commentary and
there you go you have gaming content for
a YouTube channel and it's like this
phone supports that and that's one of
the reasons why I'm happy to have it in
my pocket because it's the one that
supports that I did however find out
I think Android Q is supposed to have it
built in now right because in the Q beta
I think I found it does it does yeah
it's a Q beta 3 has it in Q beta 2 is
technically in there the but it was like
broken and laggy 3 it's in there
a lot better I think it's like actually
pretty much per million
yeah and even then like the screen
recorder it says game launcher right
here so they are it is very specific to
that use case here's another question
though because Q launched on 12 brands
at i/o as a beta and I'm wondering if
one plot because the this phone actually
officially launches today at the day of
recording today mm-hmm which is Friday
the 17th and I wonder if they're going
to push Q beta for this starting today
because they pushed it yeah it was
available for 16 6 + 5 t + 5 + 3 T
that's another thing is like the soft
the software support that oneplus puts
out is freaking amazing but yeah I would
like to get Q on this as soon as
possible
basically is what I'm saying yeah
definitely
alright so I'm trying to think of avoid
other aspects of the phone alright so
let's go ahead and just get into the
cameras then because well even talk
about battery life Oh better really I
was like that's my main concern
okay go for it alright so there was we
did some testing and if you turn off it
okay so a lot of the comments that I got
on my youtube video and in my written
review my battery life was not great I
got like five to five and a half hours
of screen on time so anxious I know I
know I know screen on time is whatever
people hate it Fisher gives me a lot of
crap for it but the 60 I got like seven
to eight hours okay and for me
fundamentally I would prefer a phone
that lasted all day and I like the fact
that phones can charge fast now like
Huawei has best of both worlds because
not only does the p30 pro last literally
two days but also charges in like 45
minutes anyway if you turn this to sixty
Hertz you get about an extra hour you
get an extra two hours those free no
time if you turn it to 1080p you get an
extra hour so if you were to downscale
this to 1080p and 60 Hertz the battery
life is actually good it's like pretty
good but the problem is like and that's
what everyone in my comment section was
saying because I said this has bad this
has pretty bad battery
life in comparison to other flagships
out right now and I I really really
appreciate good battery life on an
Android smartphone so and everyone was
saying well just like Twitter to 1080p
and make it 60 Hertz it's like you so
you want me to remove like the main
reasons why people are gonna buy this
phone like oneplus is biggest marketing
but the most money that they spend
around marketing the most time that they
spent at the event was the 90 Hertz
display yeah real quick though I want to
make sure we catch TK before his battery
is battery's gonna die yeah sorry dude
and I'm gonna take up all the time oh it
does seem like you can't hear TK can you
know did he die yeah something died it
wasn't something no no no no battery
than that yeah sorry oh yeah I had the
microphone on you so the quick 30 second
clip on my impression so you're totally
right on the battery exactly if you if
you do reduce the battery well the
screen resolution as well as no no there
we go there we go poor guy okay what I'm
gonna do let me see if I can message him
real quick
type type it to me yeah I'll be his
voice type it to me and I'll read it
yeah I'll just continue talking then
until he no I do want it I do definitely
want to get into the some thoughts on
there like okay so you said around 5
hours of screen on oh there you go he's
on no so so this is where the experience
changes oh so now I'm on my phone that's
the only way for me to get back on but
what I want to say is that battery life
on this is actually not bad it's just
the only thing you have to keep in mind
is you are pushing it into new
technology and then think of oxygen OS
isn't really a hundred percent optimized
to handle the battery being basically
consumed that where we have it at 90
Hertz and you know what HD so hopefully
other updates or future updates will
help us with it but where we are right
now like David said 1080p unfortunately
at 60 Hertz gets you the best battery
life but you have the ability of
controlling it right you have to
turning it on and turning off when you
don't want and I think the way that we
was raised from to did it was a little
bit better in their gaming mode because
he had the ability of customizing when
20 Hertz was kicking in and when you
weren't using it to be able to save
battery so hopefully there's something
they can add into their gaming mode and
that will help people basically enjoy
the quality very much better or the
lightfrom obviously for those you know
it's 7 to 8 hours of battery life mmm
gotcha
let me see what are some other things I
want to get ok so since you're on here
right now I don't I don't wanna take up
too much of your time and also you're
probably your arms gonna get tired
holding that phone you do quick thoughts
on the camera before we get into it for
a more long form discussion so for the
camera experience I'm gonna say it's a
better camera than what we've had in the
past is it the best camera right now
they just pushed out an update like this
yesterday morning actually they start
another update to optimize the camera so
I haven't had a chance to play around
with that yet
but the camera is ok it just it's not
the best camera I would say the
front-facing camera is actually pretty
decent yeah and that's that's one thing
that I like is the fact that I can
actually just open it up and take a good
selfie
especially when I with my family with
friends you know when I saw you guys
over at the event you know Josh night we
took a picture with it
it works really nice that's such a
common comment that I keep saying these
days it's like yeah but you came on
there and I'm like I I personally never
do that I maybe I should but it makes
everything better that's all I could say
if you can get it yeah it definitely
makes it better but if you're just using
the native app and what they have I
think their scene detection is a little
bit hit miss it turns on every once in a
while but you don't see it all the time
and it doesn't really optimize the
software yet so like I said this is the
first time they've gone three lenses
it's a good start it's a solid camera
from the sensor that you can do good
pictures with it you just need to maybe
do some editing a little bit afterwards
for me it's great it's a good phone it's
a good complement good set of lenses
they went with the right set you know we
want the wide-angle lens we want the the
you know the 48 megapixel one I just you
need to improve a little bit on the
software I think they can definitely get
there all right cool all right okay well
thank you so much for
for being on I'll go and let you go that
way you don't have to like worry about
being on the phone the entire time well
yeah thanks for finding a way to pop
back in and we'll see you in a little
bit from I'll see you guys nice seeing
you day yeah say you need to write
alright so unfortunately for TK when he
got onto the phone his feed wasn't
working anymore I guess NDI off of a
mobile phone is not the most ideal thing
so it's okay there's like a big old
Skype logo where his face should be but
I will make sure to give TK his
shoutouts when the time comes but here
is here's what I want to start off the
last like maybe 5-10 minutes of this I
did a real-world camera test with the 1
+ 7 Pro out in New York City centered
around the launch but I also went to the
vessel which is in New York City which
is pretty dope it's it's a pretty
awesome structure it looks a little bit
like a supervillains lair but what I
what I kind of when I came to the
conclusion and I'm wondering if and TK
kind of alluded to this I wonder how you
feel about this David this phone is
saved by the grace of that 48 megapixel
sensor because it's the only part of the
camera experience that I feel is
actually quite good the rest is not
doing it at all
I kind of disagree I actually really
like this camera and I feel this I felt
the same way about the 60 and most of
that for me has to do with one color
reproduction and two sharpness okay um I
think that while the p30 camera is
freaking insane and amazing it also over
sharpens the heck out of everything and
the colors not quite right
the Samsung the Samsung has ten does HDR
way too aggressively and it make it
washes everything out I think that one
plus does a really nice in-between of
still obviously having some good dynamic
range but it's not so aggressive that
every single color looks like it's
luminance was boosted by two stops and
then also the sharpness feels very
similar to the Xiaomi me eight for me
which was my favorite smartphone camera
of last year
because it's it they didn't try too hard
to like aggressively sharpen everything
I feel like a lot of manufacturers I was
actually talking to Brandon have art
about this before the event a lot of
manufacturers they make their cameras
based on what engineers think people
like they don't actually make it based
on what looks good in photography and I
think that people have this notion that
Oh sharper is better right but that's
not always the case it's all it's like
almost with also with cinema cameras
cinema cameras are intentionally soft
and they actually look more pleasing to
the human eye so for me I feel like
oneplus kind of took this new IMX sensor
this new 48 megapixel which I agree is
better it helps it a lot yeah but I feel
like they took it and they were like you
know what let's just kind of take it as
it is and then add a little bit of
processing but not overdo it which which
I agree with you on there's a lot
there's a lot philosophically that
you're saying that I totally am on the
same page with the problem that I have
with this is that it's more to the
credit of the sensor than it is to the
company's own processing absolutely yeah
because I do you give them because when
you look at it you have the 48 megapixel
sensor that already is an amazing thing
like yeah a stabilization on that lens
is so amazing I could get slider like
shots with this 48 megapixel and it's
true not only for this phone but also
for the honor of you 20 and for the
mimics no not to me makes that me 9
these are the other two phones that have
it but the thing is when you when you
look at it this way where it's the 40
megapixel sensor doing a wonderful job
and then what deep and then what happens
when oneplus is given a couple of other
sensors to tweak how they see fit okay
so I know I know I know why it is so why
this oh I can't believe it like it's the
first wide-angle lens that I'm actually
super disappointed by and the telephoto
is like even though it's telephoto it's
still like 3 X 7 this phone teaches me
that 3x is actually pretty good like 2 X
was always useless to me 5 is a little
too far 3 is kind of the sweet spot
however to your point about softness and
the sharp
and everything like that yeah you're
right if it's over sharp pins from the
48 megapixel sensor we probably wouldn't
feel so good about it but then you have
the wide angle and the telephoto which
are like four octaves softer than
anything that the 48 megapixel sensor
does like to me there yeah there's no
sharpness at all in the other two lenses
and the same goes for the front-facing
camera there's no sharpness at all on
the front-facing camera it's also very
tight frame which you know I'm not a fan
of I really like the front-facing camera
I think it's really nice that's okay but
it's it's it's it doesn't it doesn't
excite me whatsoever so you want to have
to have the phone like so far away to
actually get something done because as
you know I've vlog with smart phones
this is not doing it for me right here
yeah so that's the only thing I I wreck
I I definitely find this phone easy to
recommend to a lot of people but the
cameras it's not that it's not that they
fail at providing a good camera it's
that everything that they claim the
cameras can do they don't seem to live
up to their own potential yeah so I
think yeah I think the spec sheets great
I think the specs are awesome three
different camera 60 megapixels for the
wide and the telephoto those are all
good specs it's just that they're not
realized and yeah and I and also no
wide-angle for the video I mean what are
you what are you doing yeah yeah it's
yeah that's pretty ridiculous
I really really enjoy the versatility
though I think because I I talked so in
my 60 review
I called that review fundamentally great
and that's because I analyzed like what
makes a phone good in my opinion it's
performance UI and battery life are the
three things that I personally really
care about in a smartphone and I feel
like one person grieves honestly what
but they didn't well they do except for
the battery life and this is not good
and that's why I didn't like it quite as
much no flight but after what are the
two phones I reviewed but right before
this phone
I read the s10 and I reviewed the p30
and one of those both of those phones
have three cameras and even though I'm
not someone who I don't post any photos
I take
on my smartphone camera so I don't
really care but after using those two
phones and just having that insane
versatility of a wide irregular in the
telephoto I feel like I can't if I'm
gonna buy a flagship smartphone now it
has to have that so I think that that
was really smart of oneplus to follow
the trend and like add those and they'll
make them better like you said the the
white is really bad and they were
obviously just trying to throw it in
because they wanted to they wanted
people to be able to pick this over the
s10 to make it an option that wasn't
just like well the SN has more
versatility and they'll make it better
so but what I meant to say was that
after using those phones it felt like a
fundamental for me now and so I'm just
really happy that they they have it yeah
I'm glad it's there I just wish it was
better I guess is the best way for me to
put it I think that they'll push
software updates that make it better
yeah I mostly they do that all the time
yeah yeah so where do you where do you
land on the obviously the version of the
phone that we have is really more
expensive I think it's the 70 in doubt
yeah that the fully expect that one yeah
yeah it's $7.99 okay 669 however for six
gigs and 128 how do you feel about the
price on here when we have a lot of
commenters and tweets coming out saying
like I missed the old one plus why isn't
it cheaper you know like that kind of
thing you know at the very end of my
review I said when oneplus with with the
60 in the six actually just with oneplus
in general before to me that could like
any phone that company made was
basically a no-brainer because it had
the latest specs the best UI good
battery life and it was half the price
of everyone else right mm-hm now it's
$120 more and but it doesn't have the
things that you're paying about three
hundred dollars more for so it doesn't
have official IP resistance it doesn't
have wireless charging and the battery
life isn't as good as the s10 or the p30
so for me it's not a no-brainer anymore
it's an option it's a good option that
kind of slots in but
the pixel 3a and something like the s10
or the p30 yeah I think I agree with
that so then the the question there is
had this phone not existed do you think
that your opinion would be different
because there was a huge discussion that
I had with Fisher and a bong or Thunder
he rather David Koga and a bunch of
people we were all having dinner and
Fisher's whole point which I think
everyone kind of agreed with but didn't
want to accept was that this changed
everything
it actually did and I I had this call
with Eber
shoutout to Eber from hardware Cano just
check out their channel I had a phone
call with him a few days before I did my
before I actually filmed my oneplus
review because I like to get other
people's opinions and feel a feel it out
and what we both said was that like the
pixel three existing makes you realize
like how good of an experience you can
get in such a cheap phone and it makes
the one plus it also makes the oneplus
feel overpriced which is crazy because
never before have one plus phones ever
felt overpriced agree and so the crazy
thing for me this is a little tangent
about the pixel 3a and how awesome it is
Google Google stripped away the the
extras that only some people will care
about but they kept everything that is
core to the pixel experience and that's
why this doesn't feel like a mid-range
phone it feels like a pixel phone mm-hmm
and it doesn't not feel like a pixel
phone just because it doesn't have
wireless charging or water resistance
right it feels like a pixel phone and
you still get the experience is what
matters at the end of the day honestly
like that's what people care about and
the pixel experience is one of the best
Android experiences because its first
party Android and if you can get that
for 400 kind of 300 cuz like every
single place you buy it at it has like
$100 giftcard I'm still figuring out
what to use my best buy card on your
right right if you buy it at Google
store you get a hundred all gift card if
you vitamin H you get $100 gift cards so
it's like effect
300 bucks which is its soul you're
getting a premium experience in a body
that people don't most people are not
going to care that this is polycarbonate
most people are not going to care that
this has doesn't have wireless charging
and because they were able to take out
the things that people didn't
necessarily care about and keep all the
things that made a pixel of pixel that's
what makes this phone amazing and so
yeah this existing basically is put in
one plus it makes us think a little
differently about about oneplus you know
yeah I think I think it really does also
I don't know what happened my camera is
dead yeah your video died just do my
beautiful face for the rest so you have
a blank space a Skype logo and David
