another pocket now face off this time
between that Samsung Galaxy s2 and the
Motorola Droid Bionic
all right let's kick off our face off
before we get to and I want to thank the
good folks at Best Buy Mobile for
setting me up with the Motorola Droid
Bionic if you're a need of a smart phone
make sure you stop by a check out the
good folks at Best Buy Mobile
all right let's kick this off we're
going to run through the specs first up
that we're going to boot up and check
the available RAM on both then we're
going to run both of them through the
quadrant standard benchmark test smart
bench test as well as Linpack Pro then
we're gonna do our unofficial speed test
our little gaming extravaganza our
browser comparison and last but not
least attach to the end of this video
will be a video comparison shot from
both of today's contestants all right
let's kick this off Samsung Galaxy S 2
weighs in at 116 grams the lighter of

taking a look around on top to an F
millimeter headphone jack along with one
of the microphones on the right hand
side is the power and lock key on the
bottom another microphone as well as the
micro USB port and on the left hand side
is the volume rocker also give you an
idea how thin this phone actually is and
on the back in the lower right-hand
corner is the phone speaker all right so
that's the galaxy s2 let's take a look
at the Droid Bionic the long-awaited
Motorola Droid Bionic weighs in at 159
grams so definitely the heavier the two
also offers a 4.3 it's displayed this

Neph millimeter headphone jack
on the right hand sides the volume
rocker on the bottom is a microphone and
on the left hand side is the HDMI port
as well as a micro USB port and on the
back in the lower left-hand corner is
the phone speaker alright more specs
let's look at processors Galaxy s2 has
the 1.2 gigahertz dual core Exynos
processor the Droid Bionic offers the
one gigahertz dual core Tegra 2
processor both offer 1 gigabyte of RAM
as far as internal storage the Droid
Bionic offer 16 gigabytes of internal
storage the Galaxy s2 comes in two
versions either 16 or 32 gigabytes of
internal storage both use microsd cards
both can expand internal storage so 32
gigabytes to the use of a micro SD card
spar is Wi-Fi Galaxy S 2 offers 802 1180
BGN support for DNA as well as HDMI out
Droid Bionic 802 11 BGN with support for
DLNA and HDMI out Bluetooth Galaxy S 2
version 3 with support for high-speed
data transfer Droid Bionic version 2.1
both can be uses Wi-Fi hotspots both
offer a GPS as far as their GPS is
concerned both run on Android 2.3
Gingerbread do you user interface on the
galaxy s 2 is Samsung's TouchWiz 4.0 and
on the Droid Bionic I guess you'd call
it motoblur would be the overlay next up
let's boot up both of our contestants to
check for available RAM at boot and look
at the galaxy is 2 running there it goes
and will fly up the Droid Bionic
it does Center for you and let them do
their thing
and the galaxy s2 looks to be their
first there we go
yeah it comes our Droid Bionic galaxy s2
on the settings applications man its
apps running and it's currently showing
607 megabytes about 600 megabytes free
at the moment let's see well go to
settings on the choi Bionic applications
or the odd applications there it is
manage running yeah we've got 400 let's
give it a minute to settle for 79 and it
looks like on the galaxy s2 you can have
a little better than 600 megabytes of
memory available free memory available
and on the Bionic you're gonna have a
little less than 500 around for 80
megabytes free available after boot
first test up we're gonna run the
quadrant standard benchmark test and
we're off we got a go clean start on
both alright we've got our results on
the Droid Bionic a little over 2000 on
the Quadra Center benchmark and on the
Samsung Galaxy s2 third a little over
3300 so our winner here is definitely
the galaxy s2 of our quadrant standard
benchmark test next up is the smart
bench test and we're off good clean
start on both again alright let's take a
look at our results we've got a split
decision our cpu winner is definitely
the galaxy s2 a little over 3,800 versus
2800 on the Droid Bionic as far as GPU
we've got the Droid Bionic
2,500 besting the 22:30 of the galaxy s2
alright last but not least we're gonna
run Linpack pro and we'll run single
thread and we're off and as far as mega
flops at galaxy s2 is the winner with 51
point 6 5 3 mega flops versus the Droid
Bionic at forty three point seven three
two all right it's time to run our
unofficial speed test I just rebooted up
both of them so we'll start with
settings and I'll try and get those as
even as possible it pretty much like a
dead heat try contacts that seem to be
the Galaxy s2 but not by heck of all
let's try Maps I'm gonna definitely seem
to be the galaxy s2 let's try a calendar
that seemed to be the Droid Bionic I
believe Gmail that was a hard for me to
tell as well let's try YouTube in the
both running up the same Wi-Fi
networking that was obviously the Droid
Bionic let's try the market and that was
definitely the Droid Bionic again Droid
Bionic seems to be quicker when we're
Internet's involved based off this Wi-Fi
let's try Fandango third-party yeah
let's see if we can run a trailer home
both play trailer anywhere off so you
loads that up quicker
and I think that was a joy biotic bike
hair so there's a look at our unofficial
speed test all right time for a little
gaming extravaganza notice your favorite
part of all the reviews I do and we'll
kick this off with beef Droid Bionic and
off and again a fact I'm doing this
through a camera
for me a little bit more difficult
so much math shortcut huh
cousin around her yeah baby there
all right let's try a galaxy s2
alright there's a look at our gaming
extravaganza on the Droid Bionic and
Galaxy s2
alright it's time to wrap up today's
face-off between the Samsung Galaxy s2
and the Motorola Droid Bionic for
pocketnow.com
I've got a bow throwing up the same
Wi-Fi network I've got the cache and
history cleared on both and I've got
flash fully and abled on both so seeing
as how my galaxy s2 is running out of
juice we better hurry up and get this
done let's head over to end gadget to
start on both and we're gonna go to the
full site and there it is and we're off
and it looks as if that GS 2 is out in
front a little bit there comes the Droid
Bionic looks like it's gonna be a Galaxy
s2 I don't know what it's the galaxy s2
and the Droid Bionic was right behind it
but as you can see there's a big
difference as to how smooth they are and
that robotics pretty smooth but it's
nothing compared to the galaxy s2 when
it comes to the browser and it's just
incredibly smooth and let's double tap
and zoom it on both and there's a good
look at the text for you on both you get
a pinch to zoom both very smooth no
issues at all
one thing that's nice
there we go a tree wraps the galaxy s2
doesn't you have to set the size as to
how large you want it to zoom and if you
pinch to zoom and DoubleTap on it again
it simply pulls out but as far as being
smooth I would have to say it's but ah
alright let's head over to pocket now
there are smartphone reviews there we go
smartphone those reviews and we're off
and galaxy is 2 went to the mobile site
let's go to the full site and see how we
end up here oops that's not what I
wanted to do desktops what I want all
right here we go I've given the Droid
Bionic maybe an insurmountable lead
although here comes the galaxy s2 a
little bit behind you can see that flash
is starting to load on the Droid Bionic
alright comes to galaxy s2 not too far
behind right now and let's see yeah and
it looks like I couldn't tell I think it
was a draw and actually you've got a
flash and that loaded on the galaxy s2
that didn't load on the Troy Bionic even
though flash is enabled on both Droid
Bionic is good but it's just not
anywhere near smooth and I think you can
see that through the video compared to
the galaxy s2 let's double tap to zoom
in both the panel very well and you can
see that it's just not quite as smooth
let's head over and take a look at the
article itself and see who loads that
quicker and you can see I just got a
text wondering how my review is going so
hopefully you can tell everybody it was
wonderful there we go nes the galaxy s2
has quite a bit smoother than the joy
Bionic which still has a loaded there we
go Droid Bionic just finished anyway
there's a look at our browser comparison
definitely the Samsung Galaxy s2 is
quite a bit smoother it's one point two
dual core Exynos processor seems to be
unmatched as far as handling browsing
between these two and the one gigahertz
I go to on the
joy bionic so anyway there's our look at
our pocket now face up between the
Samsung Galaxy s2 and Motorola Droid
Bionic be sure you hang in there and
we'll have the video comparison 1080p
video from each coming up right after
this take care
