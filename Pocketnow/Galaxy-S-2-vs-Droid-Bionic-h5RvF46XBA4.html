the motorola droid bionic if you're in
need of a smartphone make sure you stop
by a check out the good folks at best
buy mobile alright let's kick this off
we're going to run through the specs
first up that we're going to boot up and
check the available RAM on both then
we're going to run both of them through
the quadrant standard benchmark test
smart bench test as well as linpack pro
then we're going to do our unofficial
speed test our little gaming
extravaganza our browser comparison and
last but not least attached to the end
of this video will be a video comparison
shot from both of today's contestants
alright let's kick this off samsung

more specs let's look at processors
galaxy s2 has the 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core Exynos processor the Droid
Bionic offers the 1 Giga hurt dual core
tegra 2 processor both offer one
gigabyte of RAM as far as internal
storage the droid bionic offer 16
gigabytes of internal storage the galaxy
s2 comes in two versions either 16 or 32
gigabytes of internal storage both use
micro SD cards both can expand internal
storage so 32 gigabytes to the use of a
microSD card safar is Wi-Fi galaxy s 2
offers 802 11 a BGN support for DLNA as
well as hdmi out droid bionic 802 11 BGN
with support for DLNA HDMI out bluetooth
galaxy s2 version 3 with support for
high-speed data transfer droid bionic
version 2.1 both can be uses Wi-Fi
hotspots both offer a gps as far as
their gps is concerned both run on
android 2.3 gingerbread do you user
interface on the galaxy s2 is samsung's
touchwiz 4.0 and on the droid bionic i
guess you'd call it motoblur would be
the overlay next up let's boot up both
of our contestants to check for
available RAM at boot and look at the
galaxy is to running there it goes
fly up the droid bionic until centered
for you and let them do their thing
and the galaxy s2 looks to be their
first there we go it comes our droid
bionic galaxy s2 going to settings
applications manage apps running and
it's currently showing 607 megabytes
about six hundred megabytes free at the
moment let's see well go to settings on
the droid bionic applications or the odd
applications there it is managed running
and we've got 400 let's give it a minute
to settle for 79 and it looks like on
the galaxy s2 you can have a little
better than six hundred megabytes of
memory available free memory available
and on the bionics you're going to have
a little less than 500 around for 80
megabytes free available after boot
first test up we ran around the quadrant
standard benchmark test and we're off we
gotta go clean start on both alright
we've got our results on the droid
bionic a little over 2000 of the
quadrant standard benchmark and on the
samsung galaxy s2 third a little over
3300 so a winner here is definitely the
galaxy s2 of our quadrant standard
benchmark test next up is the smart
bench test and we're off good clean
start on both again alright let's take a
look at our results we've got a split
decision our CPU winner is definitely
the galaxy s2 a little over 3,800 versus
2800 on the droid bionic as far as GPU
we've got the droid bionic
2500 besting the 20 to 30 of the galaxy
s2 alright last but not least we're
going to run a limb pack pro and we'll
run single thread and we're off and as
far as mega flaps at galaxy s2 is the
winter with 51.6 53 mega flops versus
the droid bionic at 43.7 32 alright it's
time to run our unofficial speed test i
just rebooted up both of them so we'll
start with settings I'll try and get
those even as possible it pretty much
like a dead heat try contacts that
seemed to be the galaxy s2 but not by
heck of all let's try maps it definitely
seemed to be the galaxy s2 let's try a
calendar that seemed to be the droid
bionic I believe gmail that was hard for
me to tell as well let's try youtube and
they're both running up the same Wi-Fi
networking that was obviously the droid
bionic let's try the market and that was
definitely the droid bionic again droid
bionic seems to be quicker when we're
Internet's involved based off this Wi-Fi
let's try Fandango third party and let's
see if we can run a trailer on both play
trailer and we're off so you loads out
of quicker
and I think that was a droid bionic by a
hair so there's a look at our unofficial
speed test all right time for our little
gaming extravaganza I notice your
favorite part of all the reviews I do
and we'll kick this off with Pete droid
bionic and we're off and again the fact
i'm doing this through a camera to make
a little bit more difficult
Oh
so much for that shortcut
where's me around Paris yeah baby good
air all right let's try the galaxy s2
boom
alright there's a look at our gaming
extravaganza on the droid bionic and
galaxy s2 alright it's time to wrap up
today's face-off between the samsung
galaxy s2 and the motorola droid bionic
four pocket now calm I've got a bow
throwing out the same Wi-Fi network I've
got the cache and history cleared on
both and I've got flash fully enabled on
both so seeing as how my galaxy s2 is
running out of juicy but I hope and get
this done let's head over to engadget to
start on both and we're going to go to
the full site and there it is and we're
off and it looks as if the gs2 is out
front a little bit there comes the droid
x ACK looks like it's gonna be a galaxy
s2 I don't know what it's the galaxy s2
and the droid bionic was right behind it
but as you can see there's a big
difference as to how smooth they are and
it joy biotics pretty smooth but it's
nothing compared to the galaxy s2 when
it comes to the browser and it's just
incredibly smooth and let's double tap
and zoom it on both and there's a good
look at the text for you on both you can
pinch to zoom both very smooth no issues
at all one thing that's nice
there we go a tree wraps the galaxy s2
doesn't you have to set the size as to
how large you want it to zoom in if you
pinch to zoom a double tap on it again
it simply pulls out but as far as being
smooth I would have to say it's butter
alright let's head over to pocket now
there are smart phone reviews there we
go smartphone news reviews and we're off
and galaxy is two went to the mobile
site let's go to the full site and see
how we end up here oops that's not what
I wanted to do desktops what I want all
right here we go given the droid bionic
may be an insurmountable lead although
here comes the galaxy s2 a little bit
behind you can see the flash is starting
to load on the droid bionic all right
comes to galaxy s2 not too far behind
right now and let's see and it looks
like I couldn't tell I think it was a
draw and actually you've got a flash and
that loaded on the galaxy s2 that didn't
load on the droid bionic even though
flash is enabled on both droid bionic is
good but it's just not anywhere near
smooth and I think you can see that
through the video compared to the galaxy
s2 let's double tap to zoom in both the
mela very well and you can see that it's
just not quite as smooth let's head over
and take a look at the article itself
and see who loads that quicker and you
can see I just got a text wondering how
my review is going so hopefully you can
tell everybody it was wonderful there we
go ne se galaxy s2 has quite a bit
smoother than the droid bionic which
still has a loaded there we go droid
bionic just finished anyway there's a
look at our browser comparison
definitely the samsung galaxy s2 is
quite a bit smoother its 1.2 dual core
Exynos processor seems to be unmatched
as far as handling browsing between
these two and the one gig or two on the
droid bionic so anyway there's our look
at our pocket now face-off between a
samsung galaxy s2 and motorola droid
bionic be sure you hang in there we'll
have the video comparison 1080p video
from each coming up right after this
take care
you
