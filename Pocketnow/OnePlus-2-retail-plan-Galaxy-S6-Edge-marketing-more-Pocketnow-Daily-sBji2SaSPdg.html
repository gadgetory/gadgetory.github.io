retail Samsung seems to have to find
what to prioritize with the Galaxy Note
marketing scheme and the Moto G seems to
have already been unboxed I'm hi mera
neta and if you hear a lot of noise I
apologize we are moving into a new
studio this is sparking out daily
official news today start with LG if you
thought that the flip phones were done
we show you at our mwc 2015 coverage
that that was in the case and the
company continues to push this trend
with the LG gentle and Android the vice
lollipop 3.2 inch display not the best
resolution in the world 1 point 1
gigahertz processor 4 gigs of storage 1
gig of ram obviously not the the biggest
device in the world but for those of you
that wants and flip phone nostalgia
you're gonna have to buy it from China
and even though Samsung said that they
were going to tone down the devices they
were in a launch it seems that many
phones are still going to be a thing it
seems that there is a galaxy s6 many in
the work 720p display snapdragon 808
which is interesting since the LG g4
runs the same processor but the rest of
the things are not really top-notch as
always 2 gigs of ram in addition to
every other bell and whistle we'll keep
you posted most likely we learn more
about this device at Aoife and speaking
of samsung and speaking of Aoife it
seems that the company has already
defined how they will handle their
marketing with the case of the galaxy
note 5 and galaxy s6 edge+ it seems that
samson already knows that they have a
market made for themselves with a galaxy
note and they will launch it without
much marketing and focused on their high
end markets like the United States Korea
if not everywhere actually they plan to
do a global launch as the galaxy s6 edge
as a foul the device where you won't
need to buy it with an S Pen this is
really an interesting change for samsung
as for them you know the file that has
always been the note and it's
interesting to see what the company can
achieve with this launch now one device
that will apparently be announced
tomorrow is the Moto G expect our full
coverage of motorola's event but
interesting we've been covering moto
maker we know that you will have options
for this device but the vice gotten box
in Brazil we're talking about the Moto
gee here and interesting the box
included a couple of covers in addition
to other accessories like an audio
extender which is interesting and this
could just be the case that moto maker
will launch in the United States and in
other countries they'll just get a
couple of spare backs but stay tuned we
will let you know more tomorrow and
finally for the very interesting rumors
of the day would have most anticipated
the vices of the year the oneplus 2 will
be announced in the next few days but
for those of you that are wondering
exactly when you can get the device it
seems that it will start retailing as
early as august eighth in the chinese
experience stores so yeah if you are
wondering exactly when the global launch
might happen it seems that it's just a
couple of weeks away which is great but
it does lead me to the question of the
day with all the announcements that are
coming later this year editha are you
looking forward to the oneplus 2 or are
you looking forward to something else
that's coming from Aoife in my case I am
waiting for the new Galaxy Note but
leave us a comment down below what is
your case friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video was filming sure you follow
us on Pocket out on comment subscribe to
channel as well you follow me on twitter
i underscore rivera we're on instagram

video a thumbs up if you liked what you
