calm and i'm going to show you the
official october six release of windows
mobile 6.5 here we have the lock screen
now this is new you have your clock and
date at the bottom along with your next
appointment now you can see nothing
happens if you touch anything so for
this little lock icon up there and it
says tap or slide that's because we have
a couple notifications let me zoom you
can see number three right there so if i
tap it so we see three more icons listed
this one is a voicemail that's a missed
call and that's text message now if i
slide any of those to the left or right
it'll go directly to the application
associated with that so if i go to the
missed call it goes to that
let's get back to the lock screen
sea-doo again there's our voicemail or I
can just slide this one okay and here's
our new today's screen we have a list of
items here now there's a couple
advantages of this I mean one it looks
really good you see the little star an
extra voicemail that means I have a
voicemail what one means i have an email
message and there's different ways you
can control this you can tap on the
selection box and move it up and down
and go to the one that you want like so
or you can drag the whole background
around like that and then we go to the
one that we want okay or you can just
tap on the one that you want so lots of
ways to use this you kind of got to
figure out which one you want to use all
right and then if we go to certain ones
have little arrows on the left and right
if I flick that way it moves to the next
thing
sing like that
got your music here
and we can change tracks like that so
that's pretty nice and another thing
that's new is the start menu so if i
press Start we get a list of icons and
you'll see there's an X up there now and
the start button is still looks the same
even if i press it again nothing happens
now because I'm in the start menu but
it's hard to tell because let's start my
new button didn't change and this is
flick scrollable you can see some icons
are cut off down here that is a visual
indication that there's more so new
users will be able to see that it's a
list that you can move but there's no
way of telling where the end of the list
is there's no length indicator so you
have to just kind of flick through here
and try to find the program that you
want all right next internet explorer
will open and you see completely new
interface with five icons at the bottom
and it disappears on you all the time
and that's kind of annoying I've got our
favorites
it's going to load a webpage and it's
still pretty slow loading I got the text
is really big here that's really small
okay there we go I got the zoom slider
going there's a zoom icon down here I
press that we get a slider on the screen
and that's working pretty nicely of
course this is a mobile site and there's
some options here
text size smaller let's see if I can
history you also have a text selection
capabilities since dragging your finger
crossed texts now will pan the web page
you have to have a selection mode is
pocket now loading
stop button up here another thing about
this address bar is that it will also
search so if we type something
down here we can compress search it also
searches your favorites so if you have a
favorite in there will be listed and
it's going to Bing for a search you know
and i'll stop that so there's a youtube
video i tap and hold i can go to full
screen and tap the button
and it will play the flash animation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
