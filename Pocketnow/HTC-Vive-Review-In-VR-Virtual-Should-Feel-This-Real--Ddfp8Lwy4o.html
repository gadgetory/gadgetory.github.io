important focus to the company's
business that there are even rumors of a
brand spin-off recently but is the vibe
truly worth a more dedicated focus I'm
hey man we met up with PocketNow and
this is our review of the HTC vive
virtual reality is not just difficult to
show off in a video review but also a
hard concept to explain for someone
who's never tested the service I've
actually had to invite friends and
family to test the vive because everyone
thinks that this is similar to a Samsung
gear VR and there's simply no room for
comparison for starters the HTC vive is
a product designed from the ground up
for B are the words virtual reality
literally define what the product should
do meaning that what you see virtually
should also feel real and after testing
the gear VR and even the oculus rift I
have to admit that HTC has figured this
out a lot more than the others for the
experience the feel real HTC has done a
few things to make it more natural the
setup process alone is crazy as we
detail in our unboxing video but
mounting sensors around the room allows
you to naturally walk around and
interact with the game the vive offers
options for both walking around and
remaining stationary if you don't have
enough room as well the controllers also
play a key factor in this all feeling
natural their wireless and extremely
light their battery lasts for days and
when playing these adopt different
designs in order to hint of what you're
doing whatever you need to walk beyond
your play area the trackpad serves to
have you move around and the trigger is
self-explanatory
the headset is not the lightest in the
world but it has a sensors that interact
with the base stations around you and
requires wires to provide you with the
video in audio these cables are all
connected to the gorgeous Falcon
Northwest Radeon tikki that houses all
the power needed for the
experience to work without a stutter
sadly for 2016 you have to acknowledge
that this comes with the territory if
you want to do VR seriously and really
once you start playing you simply forget
that the headset is there and the wires
do a really good job at staying off your
path the camera at the front serves as
your chaperone which either displays a
grid around you or allows you to see
what's in front of you by raising the
controller after you press the menu
button playing with the vive is simply
awesome I've had at least five people
try it out with me and none of them have
ever commented over the wires or the
heavy headset no one really cared the
experience was so cool then all the talk
was really about how immersive it was
HTC clearly did its homework for the
vive and making this a geek product the
lights on the head said when putting it
on remind us of the moment when Darth
Vader wore his mask for the first time
and then looking around the room when
playing certain games reminds us of how
neo loads up his guns on the matrix it's
those little things that make the
experience so cool from start to finish
yes you can't control what happens with
the vibe through the PCs monitor but you
don't really need to I sadly can't show
this to you on video but when you press
the menu button you can't control your
PC from the headset your controls become
the mouse allowing you to define audio
gameplay and hey if you want the full
desktop experience on the vibe you can
do that too and then the game's oh boy
the games this was the first experience
I've ever had with Steam games and I'll
admit that I'm hooked I haven't had this
much fun since the old super nintendo
games or with computer games like doom i
am a big fan of first-person shooters
and there are a few games here that are
extremely addicting like space fire
trainer for example or the lab these
games require you to move around
duck turn around and you simply feel
like if you're in the game when you're
playing around the lab in particular has
a few games where you simply forget that
you're holding a bow with your left hand
and an arrow with the right hand and
there comes a point where you just
continue
shooting at your targets like if you're
there and the vibe does a tremendously
great job at detecting where you're
shooting so it just continuously feels
natural regardless of what you're doing
in the game sadly as with every review
not every product is perfect what really
the tourists from the experience of the
vibe feeling natural is its resolution
it's not that bad for games but it's not
perfect either and feels kind of grainy
particularly in game menus another is
that you can adjust the lenses
internally but even so the content tends
to reflect on them at times which this
make your vision a little blurry if
you're not a fan of wires this is
definitely not the system for you as the
base station the wires on the head said
pretty much everything has to be
connected at times and probably the most
annoying part of using the vibe is the
whole process of setting it up you have
to clear the room first which is not
that easy if you live in New York and
then loading games takes a while which
shouldn't really be a problem if you're
using and setup this expensive and
powerful and really that's the biggest
challenge about adopting something like
the HTC vive at $700 which is the
standard price of affleck ship
smartphone I honestly don't find all
this technology to be expensive at all I
find the vibe to be extremely affordable
for everything you get the problem is
really the fact that the computer alone
will cost you more than $1000 if you
want that GPU to be powerful enough to
run it and then there's the challenge of
the games which are all cool but
honestly not popular enough to drive
people don't want to buy a vibe to play
them as we see the halo effect with game
consoles like the Xbox that being said
if this was my money I would totally buy
the vibe this product has made me a
believer in games again and I love every
second I play with it I would even
suggest that you go out and give it a
try because showing you on video is
really not enough this is something you
really need to experience for yourself
I'm Generation X guys I grew up playing
with controllers and now I'm having a
hard time going
back to them and that says a lot about
how powerful the vibe can be when you
give it a try
