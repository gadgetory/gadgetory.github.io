teased for next month Sony's revival
plan seems to include everything but its
own smartphone lineup and motorola CEO
feels the need to defend moto maker from
Johnny I've I'm hi meri behna and is it
just me or do people still party on
Thursdays this is fargin out daily
brought to you by Squarespace the
official do should I have to do with
Sony as we know the company is desperate
for a turnaround then the company CEO
has just announced the company's revival
plan and it doesn't seem very good for
the exterior lineup we've heard that
Sony wants the seller is considering it
and as it turns out the company is going
to focus on image sensors and gaming
that's going to be the focus until 2018
to get some profit and probably invest
that profit in other division so that
knows but hopefully they'll still build
the Satan will experience now let's talk
about one of the only smart watch
companies that's actually succeeding
pebble the company is not only working
on bringing us new hardware probably for
mwc or close around there but apparently
the company is finally bringing a color
display now it seems that the focus that
the company is still to bring the
legendary battery life that we currently
have on the two pebble generations that
we have so we wonder exactly what type
of technology that will be we will be
looking forward to this very soon now
listen to these new rumors we've heard
that there is an HTC One m8 I that keeps
the current HTC when I made design and
then we've also heard that the HTC one
and nine will probably not bring a quad
HD display merrily it'll stick to a
1080p display but if you're wondering
what will happen with that quad HD leak
that we talked about so many weeks ago
turns out that there is apparently an
HTC One m9 plus and I am starting to get
tired of pronouncing these long names
but yeah apparently there is a beefier
quad HD variant and we don't know if it
will retain the same design there is a
lot of debate on the display size
between 5.1 inches and 5.5 inches but we
will keep you posted and speaking of HTC
the company is pretty much spilled the
beans on what to expect the next version
of android not sure if this is a dot one
update since we are waiting for android
5.1 but according to
companies movers e it seems that Android
a 5 point something is going to be
launched in march and don't bring a lot
of the bug fixes that we are waiting for
lollipop some people are calling
lollipop the old honeycomb a lot of
things can be said about this new update
and hopefully it will happen at the time
of the release of so many smartphones
that are coming out in March and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
if you remember there are these news
that Jony ive was recently interviewed
by The New Yorker and spilled it at the
apple watch is probably his final
project but another thing that he did
was complain about things like motomaker
you didn't mention motorola but he said
that the fact that you get to choose
your color and trim for smartphone is
like advocating a designer's job meaning
that a designer should be good enough to
know what colors are the best for his
product which is really interesting up
to the point where motorola CEO Rick
Osterloh came on record on bbc2 state
that wow he can't believe that Johnny
said that and that it's outrageous what
apple charges for smartphones and so
many other complaints link to this river
for the full story but it does lead me
to the question of the day given the
fact that motorola gives you the option
to customize your smartphone and you get
so many cool things like moto voice etc
why do you think the Moto X doesn't sell
what is it that the Moto X is missing
that the iphone has because in my case
i'll be honest with you i don't know i
love the Moto X and my also like the
iPhone 6 what do you think is missing
from the Moto X for you to personally
buy it leave us a comment down below
