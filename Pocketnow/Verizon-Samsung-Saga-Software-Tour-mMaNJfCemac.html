calm we're finishing up a look at the
samsung saga today we're going to be
taking a software tour looking at
software that comes installed on the
device to get started we'll take a quick
look at the today screen you notice they
give us a much larger clock then you
might have up in their toolbar typically
you can also see quick access here and
your connections to your phone call logs
to your messaging bluetooth wireless and
your cellular network settings you can
also click to your favorites and set up
favorite applications so if you have
some application on your device that
you'd like to set up you can do that
here just add a program say we like to
get to the calculator lot and now here
it is quick access to the calculator
from your today screen if we look at
contacts we can add contacts tour today
screen so if we have frequent contacts
we can put them in here quick access
again from right former today screen
along with system settings so you can
get to hear you've got memory you've got
your battery use life you can
automatically lock the device or to set
up your optical mouse so different
settings that media access right on a
screen sort of convenient feature if you
look at our drop-down menu here on a
start menu notice we come with office
mobile there's office mobile 6.1
including the OneNote mobile application
if you're running windows mobile 6 this
would be a nice upgrade to grab that
application as well yorks also notice on
the Start menu will have the Opera
browser if you're not familiar with the
Opera browser it's a great upgrade over
the internet explorer that comes with
Windows Mobile here you can see if we go
in real quick we can get nice flick
scrolling through a full size screen
nice readability this is a great upgrade
even if you're not getting a samsung
saga just for whatever windows mobile
phone you might be running so I'm glad
to see that they've chosen to install it
as a standard part of their software
package here will click down and take a
look at the programs available no
special games just your standard to a
bubble breaker and solitaire
they do have a special alarms
application which I sort of like you can
set up as many alarms as you'd like when
it was mobile you typically get three
built-in alarms that you can set up too
far off a little alarm when you need
some need some reminder this is
convenient I have a lot of reminders
like that are used infrequently but it's
nice to have them set up and all you
have to do is come in here and turn them
on or turn them off a nice convenient
addition to Windows Mobile you can go
into your camera application from here
in a 1.9 megapixel camera no great
features there no flash no zoom but it
is a nice camera if you just need to
grab a quick picture I've got a min
Ewing application here we can set up
some custom menu items for maybe
frequently accessed applications on a
reach live search or want to quickly
access the file explorer I can set up
this menuing application so that have
quick access to nine different
applications scroll down we notice we
have our remote desktop software if you
want to connect to a remote desktop and
view your laptop or desktop display
right here on your mobile phone you can
do that we also have this modem length
if you install the VZ access manager on
your laptop you can use your samsung
saga as a high-speed internet connection
also for travelers a smart converter if
you're traveling overseas and need to
figure what what is a certain weight
converted from kilograms to pounds you
can punch it in here and see 10
kilograms that's equal to 22 pounds drop
this down you can change your units and
it's a little hard to click here with
the mouse from an angle we're with the
stylus 10 pounds that would then be four
and a half kilograms a nice little
addition for anyone traveling overseas
and dealing with different units of
weight measure also a tip calculator not
quite up on calculating your tips you
can do that here split the bill between
numerous people we also have access to
the VZ app zone you can go online and
try out different applications from the
right
verizon app store VZ navigator would be
an example of something in there so you
could use your phone for GPS navigation
we also have a world clock if you have
colleagues that work in other time zones
or if you're traveling in a different
time zone you can quickly check here and
set up different time zones for make
sure before you make that phone call
that you're not going to wake someone up
you can then see if I'm in London now i
can check back and see what was my time
back on the east coast so nice addition
here for anyone traveling across time
zones also go in and take a look at the
settings the settings here we can set up
our dialer display a little bit of
customization not not a great deal but
we can change our colors we can also go
in here and tell it we want to be right
handed or left handed and it'll switch
around it's on our phone
I'm trouble hitting that button there we
go so that it will switch the talking in
buttons to the other side of the display
no I don't want to save those options
scroll down we can look at the today
screen we've got an option here for
samsung has their own version of the
today screen samsung today we scroll up
turn that on and now if we go look at
our today's screen will find that has
been replaced with some nice large icons
you may have seen this on other samsung
phones access to our call log messaging
some applications nice little addition
if you just have some things you like
quick access to nice large
finger-friendly buttons we can also look
through our settings and see we've got
function shortcuts we can set up short
cuts using the function key under keep
keyboard so that we can have access to
different programs you can set up one
for each letter of the alphabet so for
instance if I go in and hold my function
key down I will have a let's say I need
to get out of this video and if I hold
it down I will have a min you pop up and
then I can just hit 0 on my keypad and I
will be right back in the Opera browser
nice little addition just get you from
anywhere into a different application
that would be a nice addition to any
windows mobile phone I think it'd be a
good addition to the standard operating
system you can also go in and set up
your network mode switch from gsm to
cdma set up your optical mouse if you
want to go in and change your mouse
cursor to a crayon for some reason now
if you use the optical mouse you'll see
you've got a crayon for a mouse and
we'll finish scrolling down here a nice
addition here if you're using the
headphones listening to music watching a
movie you can go in here and actually
set up different sound effects so that
you can get for instance a 5.1 channel
effect on your headphones i'm not sure
how well this works i didn't have
headphones to plug in here but it's a
nice addition to give you a little bit
better listening experience on your
headphones connected to your phone if we
go down last thing here we'll take a
look at is our wake up button you have
the option of turning on your phone
waking it up from sleep using the button
on the top of the phone or you can set
it up to use any button I found using
any button to be a little bit dangerous
sitting in your pocket you can really do
some damage opening up the phone
different applications when you're not
expecting it and finally our connection
settings standard connection settings
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi if we go in and we
can enable bluetooth and Wi-Fi
connections so that is a quick tour of
the samsung saga software thank you for
joining us and if you haven't had a
chance to check out our unboxing and our
hardware tour go back and check those
out as the pocketnow.com site and also
look for an upcoming written up review
of the samsung sock up to cover all the
unboxing the hardware the software and
give some overall impressions of the
device look for that to be written up
