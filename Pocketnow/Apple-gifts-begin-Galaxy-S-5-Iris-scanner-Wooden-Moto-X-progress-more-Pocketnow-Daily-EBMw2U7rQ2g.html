yet and they're already giving away
stuff rumors of a galaxy s5 with an iris
scanner have begun to surface and the
u.s. variant of the LG G flex could be
closer than you think I'm hi mera neta
and please do not remind me of the
weekend because that'll just make me
want to go back this is PocketNow daily
let's switch the day off with some
official news as even though Apple has
been giving away their 12 days of eels
application for quite some time the
deals don't really begin until next week
and still Apple has begun giving away
music gasps of today so make sure you
download the application on your iOS
device I believe you can get a single
from Lord as of today it probably some
things later on so stay tuned for that
free is free now in the case of Windows
Phone does Cortana and a notification
center in Windows Phone 8.1 ring a bell
and I'm sure it does I mean these rumors
have been talked about for the last
couple of months I think I got tired of
talking about these things that I just
ended up skipping them because they
never happened but as it turns out we've
got some more credible sources talking
about these features coming to Windows
Phone 8.1 very soon the problem is when
is very soon for Microsoft because it's
never soon enough we're hoping for this
to come out at mwc 2014 so stay tuned
we'll be there covering it and for those
of you following the LG G flex and its
launch the United States two things
number one hit the link of the
description for our full review and
number two apparently Sprint will be the
first carrier to bring it we're still
not sure exactly when there are no dates
the problem is that the date on the
phone says februari 7 which is really
far away from now but probably it will
be for that date and hopefully that's
the case a lot of people are waiting for
this phone I just don't know what the
subsidy price will be for a
one-thousand-dollar phone and for all 10
of you that are still waiting for the
wooden Moto X Motorola has just sent out
a teaser poster that says put this DIY
project on hold and trust us which means
that we are getting the wooden phone
probably for an extra 50 bucks with the
problem is we still do not have any
specific dates and judging by the fact
that we're probably just a couple of
months from the Moto X 2 we don't know
if this should be a good idea to wait
for and not just get a moto X right now
but stay tuned it could be early next
year or it could not be and finally for
the hot news of the day let's talk about
two things from Samsung number one
android 4.4 points who should reach your
google edition galaxy s4 today so look
out for that but
I'm even more interesting news we've got
some more rumors of the galaxy s5 and
number one apparently we are getting a
2k display which is expected you know
Samsung always pushes the bar with their
display but even more interesting is
that apparently we're getting an iris
scanner and no I did not get that right
iris scanner for your eyes and you know
that leads me to the question of the day
what exactly what you do with it I our
scanner what do you think would be the
usage scenario that Samsung is planning
for this phone because in my particular
case I do feel that they're going for
some competition to touch ID I just
don't know if that's going to work great
judging by Samsung's gimmicky features
all the times don't always work great
but leave us a comment down below what
do you expect and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video is filming
sure you follow us on packing out
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
as well can also follow me on twitter i
underscore to be better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi Mary later thank you very
much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
