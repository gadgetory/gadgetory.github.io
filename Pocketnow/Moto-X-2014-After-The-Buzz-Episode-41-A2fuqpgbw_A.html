over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it
let's take a second look at Motorola's
second take on the ideal android
smartphone
i'm michael fisher with pocket now this
is the Moto X 2014 and this is episode
41 of after the buzz to paraphrase an
old saying I'm not just a Moto X
reviewer I'm also a customer shortly
after reviewing the second gen Moto X
back in September I bought one of my own
to replace the first gen Moto X I'd
carried for the Year previous so this is
a device family I've been living with
for 18 months despite the fact that I
can carry pretty much any Android phone
I want to at any given time despite my
earlier editorial protestations at
pocket now that says something for its
quality part of my dedication no doubt
has to do with the fact that the Moto X
has my name on it
my twitter name anyway and this is item
one in Motorola's corner even one and a
half years after the company's Moto
maker smartphone customization suite
came out no one on the market can match
it you can get a Moto X in bamboo walnut
smooth the leather football leather even
the boring old plastic comes in more
colors than you can find anywhere else
and that's not even counting the
made-to-order aluminum trim custom
engraving and custom boot greeting we
are seeing some manufacturers like a
sous take the message offering a wider
choice of back panels for its zenfone 2
and even smaller players like Yola have
long understood the value of
customization but when you buy a Moto X
through moto maker you're truly building
your own smartphone and if you're the
sentimental type
that makes for a much more personal
connection from unboxing to retirement
if that sappy stuff doesn't move you too
much well you probably won't care about
spotlight stories either
every quarter or so motorola partners
with animators and storytellers to kick
out a new augmented reality game that's
pushed right to your home screen now
that sounds kind of intrusive but it's
really not it only happens once every
few months and you can disable it if you
really hate it but I leave it on because
the games are cute beautifully animated
really short and they reinforce the
feeling that the motox experience is
something special it's not just another
stock Android smartphone while we're
talking software the moto suite has the
same effect it's not every phone you can
talk to from across the room when you
want to ask it what notifications you've
missed or you want to set a reminder to
change the laundry or set an alarm for
the morning this still comes in handy
almost every day for me but a problem
from the old Moto X is already starting
to assert itself on the new one it's
starting to chug a little that is as the
months go by
moto voice gets slower and slower to
carry out vocal command sometimes I'll
find myself waiting up to 8 or 10
seconds for something as simple as an
alarm clock confirmation or a web search
and other times the command just never
registers moto voice is one of the most
convenient features of Motorola software
package so it's really frustrating to
see it stumble like this particularly
since the competition is slowly but
surely catching up hey Cortana
fortunately other aspects of the suite
like moto assist and moto display are
still in top shape after six months and
I really miss them when I'm using
another device in terms of general
performance the phone is still snappy
though not quite as brisk and crisp as
it was before the lollipop update the
Moto X isn't the only smartphone
suffering a little from this so-called
new and improved software and with its
relatively modern internals I think
it'll aged better than its predecessor
did but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
a little wary of Motorola in this regard
by the time I give up the first gen Moto
X using its software had become
something of a slog and I hope the same
thing doesn't happen here other pain
points we mentioned in the full review
persist
whenever I recommend the Moto X to a new
phone buyer which I do quite often
I'm sure to inject this important
qualifier just don't expect it to last
too long and don't buy it for the camera
battery life is barely adequate for me
as a heavy user maxing out at four hours
screen on time between charges and near
as I can tell lollipop did nothing to
change that
after the Nexus 6 came out I did start
keeping the turbo charger plugged in for
quick Moto X charges and that's helped a
bit but if you don't have one already
that charger will cost you 35 bucks and
the camera well in daylight it's still
just fine more than enough for the kind
of casual snaps that probably make up
about 80% of my photo taking but when
the lights go down in the city well
let's just say there's a reason a Nokia
Lumia makes up the other half of my two
phone lifestyle pretty much the best
part of the Moto X's camera continues to
be its twist the wrist launch gesture
which protip you can do twice in a row
if you want to jump right into selfie
mode again it's the little things that
make this device the tiny comforts not
many companies bother to think about
that's something worth keeping in mind
as we approach a busy flagship release
season this spring and you know the Moto
X already has many of those devices beat
in one important respect price like its
forerunner the new X got a big discount
on carriers within a few months of its
release in an upload time it's starting
at $4.99 unlocked direct from Motorola
with republic Wireless shaving a whole
benjamin off of that and some major
operators like verizon offering it for
free on contract in the end a little
more time with the Moto X has reinforced
my original position this is the
smartest smartphone around yes you can
find less expensive options but I
wouldn't recommend it few cheaper phones
will pack these specs and none offer the
particular cocktail of features and
custom options that make owning the Moto
X such a singular experience despite my
natural inclination to drool over the
new smartphones coming up and a little
uncertainty about the future of Motorola
under its new owner Lenovo I still think
the Moto X is one of the best Android
smartphones to come out of 2014 and I
continue to
two new smartphone buyers here in the
first quarter of 2015 for more on the
second generation Moto X including our
