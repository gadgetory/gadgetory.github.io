April with a full mobileme revamp
verizon quickly grasping twelve percent
of the u.s. iPhone marketing just one
month an AT&amp;amp;T seems to already know if
you're carrying a jailbroken iphone all
this and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi metal even and welcome
to the pocket now I review the show we
go through all this week school they're
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices let's start this week off
with a cool this is Apple released iOS
four back in april 2010 rumors have that
iOS 5 will be released sometime with an
april and an apple event call this just
in time after the release of xcode for
that was recently published from apple
well it seems we don't have any sort of
specifics on what to expect with the
update but there seems to be a lot of
buzz with mobileme getting a full revamp
and even though price tag now we've been
waiting for this mobile meet update for
a while now so will believe when we see
white iphone full rumor seems to be
getting stronger it seems that Apple has
finally noticed that users went so crazy
over the white ipad 2 that a market
without a white iphone 4 had a big gap
in it well Philip Schiller comes up on
Twitter first saying that the white
iphone 4 will be released in spring and
then we have the icons of the white
iphone 4 in both gsm and cdma versions
pop up on itunes 10.2 now call this in
time for an april event could be rumors
have the next-generation iphone sporting
a larger screen within the same current
iphone board design which makes all the
sense in the world if you consider that
the retina display is able to provide
more pixels per inch then the human
retina is able to figure out aside from
that NFC technology is also being
mentioned and a metallic backing instead
of the current glass on glass design now
will this be aluminum stainless steel
and titanium liquid metal or whatever
we're not really sure or even sure if
we'll see more information about this in
the April suppose of event so could be
speaking of Verizon it seems that
they've already nabbed twelve percent of
the u.s. iPhone market in just one month
which is a lot of great performance
considering that AT&amp;amp;T has had for years
for iPhones to build the rest of the
eighty-eight percent that's left really
cool numbers let's hope that they bring
real sales figures to the market soon
and well good news for those who unlock
their iphone 3gs with ultrasnow 1.2 all
you need is to update your ultrasnow
with an ultra snow fixer which was
brought by the same developer that
created tinyumbrella remember that
ultrasnow 1.2 was the one that brought
the iPad baseband six point 15 to the
iphone 3gs now there's no word on when
anybody will ever figure out how to
unlock the iphone for above one point 59
baseband but there are a lot of us who
pray every day kneeling down for anybody
to figure it out anyways and well out of
the updated applications for the week
Google Mobile has just changed their
name to google search and brought a lot
of really cool UI enhancements to the
application aside from that well Bing
has just brought QR code and even
microsoft tech support for iOS devices
and if you blog well the WordPress
application has brought almost a hundred
bucks fixes in their current update so
make sure you update these applications
ASAP
well that does it for the coolest
continue on with the nacho cool if
you've got a jailbroken iphone on AT&amp;amp;T
well it seems that they already know if
you did so now that doesn't worry you so
much as to the fact that users have
already been getting emails and even
text messages because they've been using
their current data plan without
tethering with my Y or tether me or I
tether to bring their internet
connection to their computers or iPads
now our advice to you as well wait for
your bill to come up or check online to
see if you're getting extra billing
because you know that could be a problem
aside from that well not really sure
what AT&amp;amp;T can do with this legally but
again it's your device but it's their
service so we'll see what happens in the
end nitro JavaScript didn't make it to
iOS 4.3 and yeah browsing has gotten a
lot better on iOS devices now the ironic
part is when web applications are not
really working well with the current iOS
4.3 update instead of working the same
or working better it seems that web
applications that weren't optimized for
the Nitro JavaScript or even getting
much lower than they were before not
really sure what to expect nor if Apple
will bring an update or if this has to
do with the developers having to improve
their code anyways now Apple has just
released their new iPhone ads called if
you don't have an iPhone and even though
they do a good job telling you what
things you can do with an iPhone that
you can't do everywhere else how about
if we do the same thing backwards so
here goes our own version of the ad if
you don't have an iPhone well you don't
have to worry about carrying a phone you
can't easily unlock and end up with an
overpriced ipod touch you don't have to
be stuck to the same UI that was
designed three years ago and can't even
be customized you don't have to worry
about your carrier knowing what you do
with your own property yep if you don't
have an iPhone you most likely carry an
android phone anyways that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm high metal iveta remember
to give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
