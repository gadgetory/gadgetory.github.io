some name skipping with the next iPhone
applecare+ leaks detail the special
treatment that the apple watch will
receive we get more details on the next
generation Moto 360 I'm hi Mary mehta
and i am happy this friday has breezed
quickly this is out daily
brought to you by lynda.com let's we get
today with the official news as LG has
just launched a new quad HD display that
measures 5.5 inches in diagonal so yeah
you get that this is for the g4 they
always do this they always launch the
panel before and we're getting a little
bit more screen resolution but that's
not really the big deal we are getting
better in-cell touch sensitivity in
addition to better contrast which was
would kill the g3 so a good news coming
up let's see what we get another device
that's been in our radar is the new Moto
360 we saw 100 CEO leak at a couple of
days ago and now we get details on the
codename apparently it's being called
smelt the reasons we don't know
apparently there is a new processor and
there is a small bump and resolution
we're giving 360 x 360 it seems though
we don't get any any other details on
what exactly we're getting we do get a
coat day for the processor but we can't
make much of it so we'll keep you posted
as soon as we learn more now one of the
biggest deals for this year was the fact
that microsoft made windows 10 free
something that the company had never
done before and given that was the most
expensive operating system in history
and one of the few as well then yeah it
didn't make sense for migrant off to do
this but the company CTO just came to
our records say that the company is even
considering making it open source and
even though we don't know why it's good
to see that competition is going that
way let's see if it happens now even
though we've been calling the
next-generation iphone the iphone 6s or
6s plus or whatever the case may be
iphone 6s plus doesn't sound well and
apparently Apple agrees as a some
trusted sources claim that the company
is going to jump names and call it the
iphone 7 and apparently the only change
we're getting is the new force
sensitivity module on the display so
we're not really sure why Apple is going
to make this name jump in addition to
the fact that it just doesn't make sense
but uh well we're gonna have to wait
until the end of this year to know that
and finally for the interesting rumors
of the day let's talk more Apple as we
get more details on how much the company
is going to be charging for applecare+
on its next-generation wearables
apparently will be charging sixty
dollars for the aluminum model eighty
dollars for the stainless steel model
and apparently up to a thousand dollars
for the golden model but the applecare+
works differently remember this you get
the two accidents over pairs and an
extra year of warranty in the case of
the aluminum and stainless steel and
apparently the case of the gold watch
you'll get an extra year three years of
warranty for these products which means
a lot it could be that these products
won't go obsolete on the next generation
but it does lead me to the question of
the day do you pay extended warranties
for your gadgets in any case because in
my case I do I've used that will care
plus a lot and it makes a lot of sense
to me because yeah to excellence will
repair if you smash it do whatever you
want to just get a new phone from 50
bucks but leave us a comment down below

ever wanted to become a pro in
