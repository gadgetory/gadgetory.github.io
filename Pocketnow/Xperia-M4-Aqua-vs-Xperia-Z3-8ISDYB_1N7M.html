the mobile business is the great
performance of its flagship phones the
Xperia z3 for instance as well as its
many versions we're referring to the
compact apparently now the company wants
to expand that to mid Rangers as well
I'm Anton denied with pocket now doing a
quick show floor comparison between the
new Xperia m4 aqua and the Xperia z3 the
Sony Xperia z3 needs no introduction
just like its predecessor it performed
really well in our review and it was and
still is a top phone to consider with
the newly announced Xperia m4 aqua Sony
wants to set a new standard for
mid-range devices and it has every
chance of succeeding if our demo unit
would have been black like our Xperia z3
we would have had a hard time telling
them apart the m4 aqua is basically a
mid-range err copy of the flagship at
first glance the outer aspect is almost
identical and Sony has kept its water
and the sprue thin construction made
famous by the Z line it's not only the
looks and waterproofing that the m4 aqua
borrows from the z3 sony emphasized that
camera capabilities as well as 2-day
battery life to be confirmed upon review
of course are also flagship features it
brought over furthermore with the m4
aqua Sony takes a step further encoding
the charging port making it waterproof
without the need of an additional flap
to cover it however making a mid-range
requires some sacrifices like tone down
internals or cheaper materials we will
touch on internals in our next segment
but opposed to the Xperia z3 the m4 aqua
doesn't feature an old glass backplate
instead Sony switched it out to plastic
moving on to the internals is where the
similarities stop the Xperia z3 packs a
5.2 inch full HD screen 2.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon 801 processor 3 gigs of RAM
16 gigs of expandable memory and the 20
point seven megapixel shooter on the
back compared to that the m4 aqua has a
5-inch HD display 64-bit Snapdragon 615
octa-core processor clocked at 1.5
gigahertz blah
one gigahertz for the two quad-core
systems two gigs of RAM eight or 16 gigs
of expandable storage and a 13 megapixel
main camera these toned-down
specifications however don't seem to
impact on performance and they are
pretty admirable for a mid-range device
on the software side Xperia z3 owners
will be jealous because the m4 aqua is
already running lollipop Sony's own
custom user interface has been slightly
tweaked to add ear to Google's material
design but aside from that all the apps
and functionality are present and
working as they should
camera capabilities are similar with
Sony's automatic scenes and shooting
modes in addition to manual and a
cornucopia of other options available to
the user front firing speakers offer
improved multimedia capabilities and
overall the m4 aqua is definitely phone
you should consider if you run a budget
or just looking for a mid-range err we
will have more thoughts on this once we
do an in-depth comparison as part of our
review procedure at pocket now for the
Xperia m4 but until then please

follow us on social media I've been an
attendee nagy if you've liked this video
