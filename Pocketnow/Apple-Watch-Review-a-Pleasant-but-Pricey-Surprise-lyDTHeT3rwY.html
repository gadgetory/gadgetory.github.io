products that do less than competitors
but do it better with its first proper
SmartWatch the company takes a different
tack trying to do just as much and still
doing it better does it succeed I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow let's find
out in our Apple watch video review
no matter how you feel about Apple
you've got to admit the company makes
beautiful hardware even at the
entry-level sport version the attention
to detail is evident in everything from
the knurled digital crown to the
placement of the heart rate sensors to
the seam between the ion strengths and
the cover glass and aluminum composite
body the 81 gram total mass of watch and
band is solid either too light nor too
heavy the band itself whose fluoro
elastomer material looks rubbery and
stiff in some photos is actually
comfortably soft and swapping it for
another band is just a button push away
the watch sport includes two band sizes
in the box and apple also sells
additional styles at typical Apple
prices also included in the box is a
charging puck with a simple design that
attaches magnetically and charges via
induction that makes it similar to the
inductive pedestal that ships with the
Moto 360 smartwatch apple's version
isn't quite as elegant in that it
doesn't stand the watch up but at least
it's compact for travel and speaking the
size our review device is the 42
millimeter version of the Apple watch
those with smaller wrists will
appreciate that there's a 38 millimeter
version as well both feature a 1.3 to
inch high pixel density OLED display and
all versions of the watch can be set up
for either right or left handed users
the watch is rated ipx7 meaning it can
theoretically survive immersion in a
meter of water for at least 30 minutes
though Apple doesn't recommend this
driving the day-to-day experience is
watch OS 1.0 which is based on iOS and
powered by Apple's s1 processor the
feature set is where Apple goes the
extra mile with the watch compared to
much of its competition but once you've
paired it to your iPhone there's an
awful lot you can do without taking your
phone out of your pocket and a lot of it
works very well first and foremost among
those notifications the watch is very
good at knowing when you're looking at
it and when you're not and raising it
after getting a notification will
immediately display the alerts content
if you missed that chance or just want
to review notifications you've received
you can swipe down from the top of the
watch face to view a list of them and
dismiss them individually swiping up
from the bottom of the screen gets you
access to glances which range from
miniaturized card versions of apps like
Apple Health
Calendar Twitter and Instagram to
collections of functions like power
management heart rate reading media
controls and the watch's control panel
here you can set the watch to silent or
airplane mode and also ping your phone
to make it ring out if you've misplaced
it you've also got more options for
interaction with all this software than
on any other SmartWatch in addition to
the usual touch screen taps and swipes
the digital crown is here for scrolling
and zooming so you can keep your finger
clear of the display there's also the
new force touch which works just like it
sounds you press a little harder on the
screen to access more options like
changing the watch face the faces Apple
ships with the watch out of the box are
fortunately very customizable my
favorite configuration tells me battery
level date outside temperature exercise
activity level and of course the time
all at a glance I've been using the
Apple watch tethered to an iPhone 6 for
two weeks and in that time I've found
more than a few reminders that this is
very much a version one product firstly
all those separate kinds of interactions
make the watch more confusing than some
of the competition the digital crown is
fun but it also feels underused I'll
twist it to try scrolling through
glances for example only to find that
most of the time it does nothing also
you can use it to scroll through your
favorite contact but try selecting one
of them by pressing the digital crown
and know you're going back to the watch
face I understand that Apple's trying to
keep its behavior consistent as the kind
of home button of the watch but there's
a whole nother button that could do that
speaking of it's great to use that other
side button as a shortcut to the friends
list but confining such a prominent
control to such a limited purpose feels
odd somehow
almost as odd as sharing your heartbeat
with another Apple watch user some base
functions could also use some
improvement every time you try a new app
that requires specific permissions you
need to grant access on the phone first
frustrating speed bump also you can
reply by voice dictation to some alerts
but not others and taking calls on the
watch requires an almost totally silent
room so weak is the integrated
speakerphone this is one area that
Samsung's gear s enjoys an edge
admittedly at the cost of a much larger
size get past those frustrations and
there's so much to like here thanks to
the linear actuator that Apple calls the
taptic engine notifications really are
more gentle tap than rattling vibration
voice dictation is an accurate and fast
way to reply to texts and Siri on the
wrist is a big help when it comes to
simple requests leaving my phone in my
backpack I successfully navigated a four
mile suburban walk to a specific
restaurant just by telling Siri to take
me there and I also used it to track my
exercise during an all-day hike in the
woods in both cases it performed
flawlessly even on my more sedentary
days the reminders to get up and stand
every hour were less annoying than
encouraging thanks to the gentle tactics
and then easy to read exercise meter
navigating the app launcher is much
easier than it looks
and apples off to a great start
encouraging developers to build apps
that also work on the watch though it
must be said that you'll often be
waiting longer for an app to load on the
watch than you would on the phone you'll
want to charge the watch every night but
even with lots of wrist navigation and
heavy notification traffic my watch
would usually have more than half a
charge left at the end of the day which
came as a pleasant surprise to me
considering its tiny battery
pleasant surprise is a good way to sum
up the Apple watch experience as a whole
given all I'd seen from other reviews
and Apple's own advertising the watch
seemed ungainly confusing and overpriced
after 14 days only one of those strikes
really sticks the Apple watch ain't
cheap especially considering the nigh
inevitable upgrade coming in a year or
two if you're looking for a simple and
affordable wearable companion for your
iPhone there are better choices out
there from pebble Martian and Alcatel
One Touch among others but if you want
your SmartWatch to echo the features and
fit and finish of your iPhone and you
don't mind spending a pretty penny to
get it the Apple watch is a good buy and
for Apple it's a very solid jumping-off
point for a whole new category of gadget
