software tour now that we're away from
the excitement and the noise of the
exhibition hall it's time for some quiet
time I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow
and this is blackberry z10 first
impressions
okay so this is our BlackBerry z10
review unit provided to us by research
emotion just we've given you a look at
the hardware on our unboxing video but
just to elaborate a little bit on that
and how it feels in the hand before we
pair on the screen it is definitely a
unique device I really like the look
here I think the white one really looks
amazing but even the black one has a
quiet sort of distinguished dignity to
it and as I mentioned on the unboxing
video this looks like a kind of a rigid
textured back but it's not it's actually
soft touch and then gives you a good
amount of grip as you can see the screen
is no stranger to fingerprints here but
it doesn't mean it feels bad under the
thumb it feels in some ways a lot like
many other portrait smartphones the 4.2
inch display is certainly smaller than
we're used to seeing from flagships but
to be honest it's quite refreshing to be
able to get to the entire display with
with one thumb but in some other ways it
certainly stands out nicely these are
you know very sharp angles on the front
here but they don't hurt at all they
just add to the aesthetic kind of a
brutally simplistic aesthetic but it
works for this device on the first
impressions basis powering it on we can
see that the power standby key is
mounted up top but once again because of
the size of the device that's not a
problem as it is on say the HTC Droid
DNA when your fingers way up here this
is actually not too bad because your
finger is sort of already there anyway
we're confronted with the lockscreen
this is a Super AMOLED panel we are
informed having a little bit of trouble
loading the BlackBerry specs page at
BlackBerry's website right now
wonder why as you can see we've already
got this synced up with some of our
accounts and we're getting an indication
here that we have some notifications in
Twitter email Facebook and a
notification and one of our calendar
events has already populated the lock
screen so that's nice and the lock turn
you can't unlock this from just anywhere
you have to see this is actually
happening none of this is actually
having any bearing on the phone you
notice you get a little prompt there the
BlackBerry 10 OS is very nice at
prompting you when you're getting
something wrong as you can see but and
you can see the the UI peeking from
underneath the lock screen as I slide up
to unlock but also as was demoed in the
software demonstration you can tap and
hold on the camera
con to jump right into that might be a
little bit frustrating to have to tap
and hold for a quick launch feature like
a camera we would prefer a hardware key
but that's the case on a lot of phones
at least we do have a jump right into
the camera there another interesting
software point is while the application
launcher looks an awful lot like those
you'll find on Android and iOS hopping
on to the home screen does not you've
got cards showing your active
applications which can be dismissed with
a tap of an X but also despite these
soft keys these are that we have dialer
search and camera down here for the soft
keys and those are not omnipresent if
you jump into an app those disappear and
there is no home button down here it's
just the BlackBerry logo and the
microphone that are gonna greet you down
low so what you have to do to get back
to the home screen is a swipe up from
the bezel that Blackberry already took
the initiative to incorporate that into
its PlayBook so that will be familiar to
users of the PlayBook but it is
something that new users are going to
have to get used to and that brings us
in to the other gesture that that swipe
up from the bottom bezel requires which
is the peak if you swipe up from here
you can see this is just a peak of your
current notifications there as we saw on
the home screen you can do that from
within any app so let's just hop into an
app here let's say we want to hop into
weather not sure about our data
connection here yeah it's gonna see we
haven't set that up yet but if you go
ahead and swipe up you can just peek see
if any of those notifications are
crucial if they're not you can go back
into the app if they are you just
continue that motion slide your thumb
over to the right and there we haven't
now I haven't agreed a couple of
accounts already as I mentioned this is
my Twitter feed integrated with my email
some other Twitter I think these are
direct messages or these might be
mentions I looked at already recent
phone call more Twitter and of course if
I if I were more active on Facebook
today we'd see more of that but that's
very interesting to get out of that once
again just swipe up from the bottom and
it's not just the bottom bezel getting
all the fun you can of course swipe down
from the top as well for some familiar
settings we see something like this on
Android jelly bean but
there's a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi toggles
you can jump right into the settings
notification selector rotation lock
which we're always very happy to see if
we do jump into settings we can look at
all the stuff that we have to explore
because we are going to be checking that
out in detail in a future video
but there are also handy gesture
tutorials which let you know how exactly
to operate the OS and one of the nice
things about the bottom gesture which
the gesture tutorial just reminded me of
is when the device is locked you don't
have to rely on this clunky button up
top it's one of my favorite things about
the PlayBook that nobody ever talked
about after it was released you can just
swipe up from the bottom and there's
your lockscreen right there there is no
there's not a necessity for this clunky
button action you just slide up from the
bottom when the device is asleep that is
very very very handy
speaking of features we remember from
webOS we do have this handy search
functionality down here which
approximates the just type functionality
if we go ahead and type pocket no no
even after just the barest of syncs we
get contacts all my contacts from pocket
now we get messages containing the word
pocket now and then if we want to extend
the search down here we can do so via
any means we desire they can just tap
Google it will open up a browser session
for us and hopefully a load a page yes
searching for pocket no and there it is
well very quick response on the browser
there that's very nice gonna just hop on
back to the card view so that's one of
the things we are not big fans of you
really have to give it a good determined
to swipe to get back into card view just
as some often a simple flick does not do
the job you really have to deliberately
come back here to go back to the home
screen so there is that and then we also
saw our typing experience now it's going
to take us a while to properly formulate
an opinion here but just so you get an
impression this is not a bad typing
experience at all that's what I've tried
to say and we got most of that right as
you can see the word experience and then
entirely correct there okay long tap
highlights the word and we can just do
that and then what if we want to just
haha you tap on and then you get to
these context-sensitive cut copy paste
shortcuts that's very nice let's go
ahead and cut it
and then we're automatically dropped
into the magnifying glass and we will go
ahead and try and type the word
experience out of the box it looks like
that suggestion functionality is not
enabled we're going to go into settings
and play with that also out of the box
there's a very quiet keyboard as far as
the acoustic responsiveness goes and
there is no haptic feedback don't really
like that too much but one of the good
things is that when you're in a password
field you can do get a persistent number
row across the top kind of which that
was consistent across all
implementations of the keyboard but you
can just tap into it there also people
who port from the iPhone to the new
BlackBerry OS will be very at home but
people who pour it in from say Windows
Phone or Android will be frustrated that
no matter what your shift state is the
keyboard stays in all-caps configuration
we'll have some more in-depth thoughts
on the keyboard when we've had time to
play with it and actually we'll have
more in depth thoughts on the entire
device when we've had more of a chance
to play with it this is just quick first
impressions on my first hour with the
BlackBerry z10 running the new
BlackBerry 10 OS we're gonna have a
whole lot more coming up follow us on
the links down in the description below
and stay tuned for more videos they are
coming up today tomorrow and for a few
days as we explore this brand new
platform from blackberry
