and there may be some solutions to the
notch Samsung is going on that with the
display and party tricks with the
upcoming Galaxy S 10 if you thought that
face ID is cool wait until you see what
vivo is cooking up I'm home it'll be
that I apologize for the lighting we're
in Paris and hotel rooms here are small
if you want to be close to the Eiffel
Tower so fitting here was a nightmare
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin not with deals but with
interesting products as a we just see
the launch of the Oppo f3 which are a
new pair of wireless headphones that are
actually not the same as everything else
first of all they're priced at a hundred
bucks but they sport qua comms new
technology that actually allows both
headphones to be fully independent
meaning that one is not driving
information to the other meaning that
there are a ton more battery efficient
it has a lot to do with the enhancements
of blue through five by the way and
everything that's coming later so yeah
this is just been announced we will keep
you posted as they will launch
apparently in August now let's talk
about motorola as the company has just
scheduled an event to happen in Chicago
which is weird and their headquarters on
August 2nd at 3:00 p.m. and we're
already speculating over what we're
getting it could be the Moto XIII force
or whatever the company is cooking up we
also hear there's probably even a moat
Omaha that's already capable of 5g
whatever the case may be stay tuned now
let's talk about vivo as a the company
is apparently cooking up something
interesting when it comes to facial
recognition they're working on a new 3d
sensing technology that has up to
300,000 sensors I'm just hoping that it
doesn't include a knotch
but apparently with all those amount of
sensors unless I got a typo on the
script that's a ton of technology I
doubt that it's gonna be something that
swivels up and swivels down but you
never know now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 and I think we're
actually talking about the plus the
rumors are kind of vague but it seems
that that device will be larger than the
Galaxy Note
the note 8 as well but I think that it
just has to do with the fact that the
company is going to play a little with
the display technology hopefully not
with a notch again but the whole idea is
to bring us a taller display on the same
chassis which would probably also mean
retaining the same footprint of the
galaxy s 9 Plus that we currently have
in that I currently like whatever the
case may be stay tuned I would actually
love to see a change and finally the
most interesting news today I have to do
with the Google pixel three and three
Excel mostly the pixel 3 we have CAD
renders of the phone we noticed that the
design that we've seen in the back with
a single camera apparently will remain
the same we also here that we will be
getting dual cameras at the front but
that we will be getting the 2 by 1
aspect ratio on this phone meaning it's
you know gonna be more up to date with
the current trends which is great think
about it as I still feel that it's I
don't know dated that's my impression
with the Google pixel - it's the reason
why I went with the Google pixel to work
so but let us know in the comments what
do you think do you like this design
would you recommend other changes in my
case again I would like a little more I
don't know modern daring changes but
that's just me leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us I'm out
