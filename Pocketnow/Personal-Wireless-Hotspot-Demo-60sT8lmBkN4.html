pocketnow.com one of the coolest
technologies to come out in the last few
years is the wireless personal hotspot
you may know it as a mifi the mifi is
available on various carriers like
Sprint and Verizon it comes in the form
of a small device about the size of a
deck of cards but usually a lot thinner
and what it does is it takes in the
wireless data the internet connection
from the cell phone company and spits
out Wi-Fi that you can use for your
laptop or netbook or iPad or whatever
needs Wi-Fi these things are super cool
because they have a lot of battery life
they offer very high speeds of
connection and you can use them pretty
much anywhere so you can use them at the
park the backseat of a car the starbucks
really wherever you are problem is they
cost a lot to use every month so they're
about fifty to sixty dollars to use the
data and you probably already have a
data plan on your smartphone so in this
video we're going to show you three
different programs on Android web OS and
windows mobile that will turn your phone
into a personal wireless hotspot we'll
see how well it works and the speeds
that you get through them let's take a
look
okay let's start things off the android
phones we're going to go into settings
and change the Wi-Fi network after I
turn on the Wi-Fi router program or the
wireless tether program here on the
nexus one so it says press here start
tethering and it's going to take a
moment okay and it's tethering and I
should see Android appear here in the
Wi-Fi network list after it refreshes
good there it is and I'm going to
connect to that great we're connect ok
let's first test the speed right now
we're still tethered here with the the
Android application so I'm gonna go to
speedtest.net application and hit begin
test see you again we're probably going
to get over 2 megabits per second which
is quite impressive to think that you
can take your cell phone out of your
pocket and get a 2.2 megabit per second
connection on your ipad or laptop or
netbook really fantastic and we're gonna
get one point five megabits per or 1.6
megabits per second up almost 1.7 so
let's go to the web and just browse
around here we're on pocket now calm I'm
going to just click on a permalink and
see how fast it was just so you can get
a sense for what this would be like on
your laptop or other device so pretty
fast things pop up pretty quickly we can
jump around to various things and it's
it's fast it's pretty fast so let's test
the next device and see how it compares
to this so next up we are going to use
the touch pro 2 here and on the touch
pro two are going to use the Wi-Fi
router application well known
application that a lot of people use to
get that wireless hotspot so i'm gonna
click start and says connecting and i'm
going to jump into Wi-Fi and change the
network
oh wait down here it says Wi-Fi router
and that is the touch pro two were
connected now so again both of these
devices the Android device the nexus one
and the touch pro two are both on a
tease hsdpa network which is relatively
fast around here so I'm gonna jump back
in to speedtest.net we're trying to be
about 2.2 megabits per second don't
think we're going to but let's see how
fast we can get through the touch pro
touch pro2 actually looks like about 1.7
going to one point yep 1.8 megabits per
second down which is still quite
impressive and then we get about one
point point five or 1.6 up let's go to
the web browser and see what it's like
to just bounce around to different
things so I'll tap on that story and see
how fast it is so naturally it's a
little bit slower than before because
the the clock speed is a little bit
lower and wait for that to load and
we'll jump to the next thing down here
not too bad though so let's test the
last device here the verizon palm pre
plus using the wireless hotspot
application that you could get on the
market I think you still can get it on
the market or they call it the catalogue
for webos so we'll go back here we'll
turn on the hot spot program and then
we'll change the settings okay down here
here we are webOS network connect to
that and we're connected and i just got
a vibration from the the palm pre plus
to let me know that i am connected so
i'm going to jump back here go to the
speedtest.net application click begin
test okay so we're on verizon's evdo rev
a network which isn't that strong around
here so as you can see we're not getting
nearly as fast speeds as we get on a
tease hsdpa network
so much slower but still not too bad
let's jump into the browser and go to
another story del lightning Windows
Phone 7 leak see how fast it loads
so definitely much lower than the touch
pro 2 in the nexus one but still
certainly capable if you have a webos
device so again that was just a quick
look at three devices that can act as a
wireless hotspot again i'll post links
on pocket now calm so that if you have
windows mobile phone and android phone
or a webos device you can get this
application and if you have an unlimited
data plan or a data plan capable of
tethering than you will be able to do
this that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
