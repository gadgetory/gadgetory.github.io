probably one of the hottest events of
the year and for us to focus in noble
definitely the hottest one there is a
lot to expect here so let's begin
talking about this I'm Hina Rivera this
is pocket now and these are the top five
things that we think you should expect
for mwc 2015 number five let's sexually
start talking about the things we don't
really expect to see at mwc starting
with Sony which is a big disappointment
we were expecting to see the Sony Xperia
z4 at the event and it seems that we
won't apparently Sony is going to wait a
little Boren it does make little sense
the company has had this flawless launch
cycle every six months for its Sony
Xperia Z smartphones and they haven't
really sold well so it does make sense
for the company to rethink things a
little in addition to that we don't
really expect to see much when it comes
to tablets these products haven't really
done well in sales for the last couple
of quarters and so it does make sense
for these companies to not launched so
many tablets it just doesn't make sense
for it not to happen at mwc we could see
submit to your tablets but not really
something that's in our radar so far
number four another player that might
disappoint is Microsoft disclaimer there
is an event happening from the company
but we are not really expecting any
flagship devices to be announced you
know that the company is geared up with
Windows 10 and everything we're not
expecting any flagships until probably
build but even by the time that built
happens in April we're not expecting the
Windows 10 operating system to be ready
for new hardware so word of warning
there is an event or just not expecting
something hot number three NBC is going
to be about wearables a lot there are a
lot of teasers of what to expect
starting with a sous apparently they're
working on this SmartWatch that will
have a week of battery life but not run
Android wear but we are also expecting
some Android wear variants from a sous
in addition to that we are expecting a
new pebble though we're not sure of mwc
will be the show floor for this and yeah
we are also expecting the LG G watch or
bane to be shown off it's already been
announced by LG and there is a lot to
expect from LG particularly as well
hopefully and smartphones as well
but again when it comes to wearables
even though this market hasn't taken off
we are expecting for mwc to be the
maturity of wearables for 2015 and
hopefully we will see something Kron
will keep you posted on that number two
HTC this is going to be one of the
hottest players of the mwc and that's
great it's great from WC to come back to
this event and do something hot it
didn't happen for the past two years
this time we are waiting for as much as
31 devices the HTC One m8 I which is
apparently the m8 with new
specifications the One m9 which
apparently will not have this a great 2k
display apparently we're sticking to
1080p which means great battery life and
a good enough display guys come on but
even cooler apparently they're also
working on an m9 plus for those of you
that want the 2k apparently HTC is going
to be prepping us for a lot at this
event probably this product will not be
ready for a launch atoms of easy just an
announcement we should expect things to
happen later in spring and yeah a lot of
us are excited about this and finally
the top number one thing to expect for
mwc 2015 is you know it the galaxy s6
the galaxy s edge and that yeah a lot of
you are probably not spiked about galaxy
phones anymore not as much as you were
couple of years ago but that is the
hottest selling Android smartphone in
the world regardless of what you think
and yeah it will be announced at mwc the
company has seized everything about it
we're hearing new materials were hearing
new changes that TouchWiz we're hiring
so many things coming from Samsung that
could make the galaxy s6 something
desirable again because the galaxy s5 is
appointed completely and it does lead me
to the question of this top five if not
the galaxy s6 or if it is what is the
thing that you're expecting for the most
because up yeah in my case I'll be
honest with you yeah why not the galaxy
s6 is cool and everything but I am
expecting the HTC One m9 that is the
phone that I want to see and I want to
see a lot from wearables but leave us a
comment down below what is your biggest
expectation that's it for a top five
