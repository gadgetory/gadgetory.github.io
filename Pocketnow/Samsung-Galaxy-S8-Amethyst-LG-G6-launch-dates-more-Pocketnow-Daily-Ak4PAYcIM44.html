possible final name for color options we
get a solid date for when to expect the
official LG g6 launch and Tag Heuer
takes a stab at a modular Android wear
SmartWatch to a certain degree I'm high
metal Iveta and after three hours of
shoveling a car out of the snow just to
not be able to use it let's go through
the news this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with teasers
to a certain degree as for those of you
that like the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 3
that we saw back at MWC I personally did
Best Buy has just begun teasing that the
tablet is coming soon apparently the
price tag is going to be $600 but the
cool thing is it includes the standalone
S Pen in the bundle I do consider the
price X to be a little steep but then
again once you add S Pen functionality
that tablet could be a really hot sell
another very interesting announcement
comes from Tag Heuer as we hear of the
company's new connected modular 45 this
is a 45 millimeter SmartWatch that is
modular but instead of being modular in
the things that we kind of care about is
geeks meaning you're able to swap
antennas and stuff like that it's kind
of difficult in a SmartWatch actually
what you're able to change here are
design elements like for example the
crown and the bands and pretty much
everything that is focused on how the
SmartWatch looks and even though the
claims and certifications aren't really
that great we do have a new Intel chip
on this watch so let's see how it works
as it'll cost $1600 now probably the
hottest official news that I have to do
with the LG G 6 as the company has made
it official you can expect your new
smartphone on April 7th pre-orders begin
in the United States and Canada and
certain carriers starting tomorrow
though we're kind of confused it seems
that this pre-order only begins in
Canada tomorrow we'll try to figure that
out over the next few hours cool thing
is the LG G 6 is probably one of the
hottest smartphones we've tested so far
I highly recommend it so far from
working with a pre-production units our
final review will be live over the next
few days to help you decide so far will
I recommend that I
really do as well the spotlight over to
the other flagship from Korea that
should Pete announced very soon for
those of you that are wondering why oh
why is that fingerprint scanner on the
galaxy s 8 so high at the top well we've
learned a couple of things over our
usage with the g6 first of all that it
really won't be that high up given how
little bezels you're getting on the
display second is that apparently the
reason why this is not a full screen
fingerprint scanner as was teased in
rumors is because apparently synaptics
did have the technology but it just
wasn't ready it did not pass testing it
was a little finicky for what Samsung
needed so apparently we will have to
wait another year for this and hey I
don't think it's gonna be that bad but
we'll see and finally the very hot
nurses they have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy s8 and color options we heard
that it was going to be launched in
black and then in silver and some sort
of tone of purple and apparently
according to certain invites that
certain consumers have received it's
going to be called amethyst amethyst as
in the certain type of quartz color that
looks purplish and amethyst sounds
actually really cool those of you that
saw the leaks yesterday of the gold
variant we wonder if that's actually
going to happen and then we have other
teasers from Samsung that show other
color options not just the ones that
we're mentioning right now it's really
interesting it could probably be that
sounds and we'll launch the other colors
over time but it leads me to the
question of the day if you had to choose
which would be your favorite color
option for the Galaxy s8 in my case I
really liked that sapphire black with
the galaxy s7 so I will stick to black
again this year hopefully but leave us a
