a possible final name for color options
we get a solid date for when to expect
the official LG g 6 launch and tag heuer
takes a stab at a modular Android wear
SmartWatch to a certain degree I'm hi
Natalie then I am after three hours of
shovelling a car out of the snow just to
not be able to use it let's go through
the news this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with teasers
to a certain degree as for those of you
that like the samsung galaxy tab s 3
that we saw back at mwc I personally did
best buy has just begun teasing that the
tablet is coming soon apparently the
price tag is going to be six hundred
dollars but the cool thing is it
includes the standalone S Pen in the
bundle I do consider the price actively
a little steep but then again once you
add S Pen functionality that tablet
could be a really hot sell another very
interesting announcement comes from tag
heuer as we hear of the company's new
connected modular 45 this is a 45
millimeter SmartWatch that is modular
but instead of being modular the things
that we kind of care about is geeks
meaning you're able to swap antennas and
stuff like that it's kind of difficult
in a SmartWatch actually what you're
able to change here are design elements
like for example the crown and the bands
and pretty much everything that is
focused on how the SmartWatch looks and
even though the claims and
certifications aren't really that great
we do have a new Intel chip on this
watch so let's see how it works as it'll
cost 1600 dollars probably the hottest
official is that I have to do with the
LG G 6 that the company has made it
official you can expect your new
smartphone on April 7th pre-orders begin
in the United States and Canada and turn
carrier starting tomorrow though we're
kind of confused it seems that this
pre-order only begins in canada tomorrow
we'll try to figure that out over the
next few hours cool thing is the LG G 6
is probably one of the hottest
smartphones we've tested so far I highly
recommend it so far from working with a
pre-production unit our final review
will be live over the next few days to
help you decide so far will I recommend
it I really do
as well the spotlight over to the other
flagship from Korea that Pete but
announced very soon for those of you
that are wondering why oh why is that
fingerprint scanner on the galaxy s
eight so high at the top well we've
learned a couple of things over our
usage with the g6 first of all that it
really won't be that high up given how
little bezels you're getting on the
display second is that apparently the
reason why this is not a full screen
fingerprint scanner as was teased and
rumors is exactly synaptics did have the
technology but it just wasn't ready it
did not pass testing it was a little
finicky for what Samsung needed so
apparently we will have to wait another
year for this and hey I don't think it's
going to be that bad but we'll see and
finally the very hotness they have to do
with the samsung galaxy s 8 and color
options we heard that it was going to be
launched in black and then in silver and
some sort of tone of purple and
apparently according to certain invites
that certain consumers have received
it's going to be called amethyst
amethyst as in the certain type of
quartz color that looks purplish and
amethyst sounds actually really cool
those of you that saw the league's
yesterday of the gold variant we wonder
if that's actually going to happen and
then we have other teasers from Samsung
that show other color options not just
the ones that we're mentioning right now
it's really interesting it could
probably be the tans and will launch the
other colors over time but it leads me
to the question of the day if you have
to choose which would be your favorite
color option for the galaxy s 8 in my
case I really like that sapphire black
with a galaxy s7 so I will stick to
black again this year hopefully but
