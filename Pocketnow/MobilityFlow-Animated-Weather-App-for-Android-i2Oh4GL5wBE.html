Pacquiao calm if you recently switch
from windows mobile to Android and you
follow our YouTube channel then you may
find this weather app a little familiar
animated whether from mobility flow is
the Android version of what was once
known as touch whether on Windows Mobile
it gives you the weather forecast but
does it with some beautiful animations
kind of like the effects you get with
HTC Sense let's take a look all right so
as you can see we have some animations
going on over here with the clouds and
the Sun we'll get back to that in a
second on the Left we have the
temperature on the top bar we have the
city on the bottom bar we have the date
followed by time of day and as you can
see it's morning
so what we see here is what's going on
outside so if we swipe over it changes
to the daytime and as you can see it's
going to start raining later in the day
swipe again you can see that starting to
get a little darker the rain stops and
it says evening swipe again and we have
night time with the moon and starting to
rain again and it says night on the
bottom bar so those are some animations
for the current day now if we want some
more information we can just tap on the
screen we get some info up here and we
get the extended forecast down here so
the first bar up here allows you to go
through that current day just like we
swiped over just another way to do it on
the bottom here we can actually switch
the days so here's Wednesday Thursday
and Friday so a nice array of options
down there now up here we have some
icons for some more information if you
can't tell what they are you can
actually swipe this down and see read
what it says so we have humidity winds
pressure sunrise water level UV class
and moon shadow so some detailed info in
case you want to know it another thing
is that we can adjust these bars to just
show a little bit of the information so
it doesn't obscure what we see with
these scenes up here so that's kind of
neat we'll go ahead and close that out
and go to menu and let me just show you
the demo here this will show you all the
animations that you might see throughout
the different seasons in the year so we
have the Sun some rain clouds raining a
little harder and here we have some
Lightning and the next and final
animation should be some snowflakes and
some snow so those are the different
animations I'll go ahead and stop that
and if we go to background we can
actually change the scene so here we
have a lake and this is the forest and
space
nice options here and finally tree we
have cheery right there so we will check
out some other options we can select the
city unfortunately you cannot program
multiple cities so if you want to switch
between multiple destinations you have
to actually enter and do a search
hopefully that will be change in a
future update
we'll go to menu we can update weather
and we'll go to settings we can change
from Celsius to Fahrenheit if you go to
update time we can put it to manual or
change the intervals for automatic
updating only by Wi-Fi and show frames
per second so this was a look at
mobility flows animated weather if
you're not running sense or you want an
animated app that provides a bit more
information this may be a good option
for you there's a free ad-supported
version which limits the amount of
viewable days I believe it only allows
you to or three and there's a pro
version which costs you a hefty $4.95
future versions are supposed to include
more options like widgets and possibly
possibly live wallpapers that's it for
now thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
