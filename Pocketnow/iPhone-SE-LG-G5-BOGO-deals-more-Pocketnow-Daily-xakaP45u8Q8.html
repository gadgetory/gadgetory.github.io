were pretty much ready to see the LG g5
brings deals that make it worth it to
hold out a little more and we get more
details on what to expect for the specs
of the HTC 10 I'm hi meri behna and if
this is the first day of spring it
started out with snow you're probably in
New York City this is parking out daily
the official news today are actually
going to wait last because they're also
the hottest news today are actually
going to start with rumors today with a
particularly Samsung's gear platform the
company's first started being reluctant
to share love for the gear line up with
the rest of Android phones now it does
and now we have trusted sources claiming
that that support is now extending to
iOS according to the rumors we should
expect iOS compatibility of Samsung gear
smartwatches by the end of the month
whether that happens or not is still
hard to believe but hey Samsung is
trying to play hardball with
smartwatches that's the smartest way to
do and speaking of trusted sources if
you want to know anything about any
particular League famous tipster ebb
leaks is always on top Evan glasses now
tipped more things to expect for the HTC
10 starting to the new Super LCD 5
apparently it is not going to bring the
AMOLED technology that we saw in the one
a9 which is rather sad we actually
really like that but we also hear that
we are getting a 3000 milliamp hour
battery which is rather concerning as
HTC hasn't really been famous for
battery life over the past two
generations let's see what we get in the
end though I was will the spotlight over
to LG as we were rather surprised today
to see the watch urbane LT return to the
AT&amp;amp;T store you get it for two hundred
dollars over a commitment or 350 bucks
you're pretty much getting the same
SmartWatch we're not exactly sure what
changed here but yeah this is pretty
much the first android wear option that
you have with LTE capabilities though we
would highly suggest you hear the next
segment as there's a smarter way to get
it because yes the watch urbane LT is
not the only LG product that's coming to
AT&amp;amp;T soon the LG g5 is the other 180 mg
is teasing two things if you get the g5
number one a free battery pack which is
awesome since you do have a replaceable
battery and that's even better than five
charging but if you want that watch
urbane LTE believe it or not it'll just
cost you an extra one hundred dollars
and for a phone with expandable storage
that is actually a big deal links in the
description to learn more and finally
the hot news today come from Apple the
event for much 21st just happened I've
recorded a separate video with
absolutely everything that got announced
in detail i'm not even going to bore you
with specifics we just know that we have
a new iphone we have a new ipad and
before we ramble with just about
everything we already know let's just go
directly to the question of the day
which of these products that you like
the most from apple's event because if
you look at the comments for the video
that was recently published a lot of
people are just complaining about
everything that was announced it seems
that nobody was happy and you know what
ever since I saw that protruding camera
on the ipad pro 9.7 inch I kind of a
great leave us a comment down below
probably some of you could say something
positive runs you know the way it goes
