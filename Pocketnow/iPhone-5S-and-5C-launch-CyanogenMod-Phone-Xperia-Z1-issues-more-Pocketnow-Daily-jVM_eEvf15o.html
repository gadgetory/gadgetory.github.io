began today with some interesting
surprises reverse point to the first
ever cyanogenmod phone and do not I
repeat do not unlock your bootloader on
the Sony Xperia z1 I'm hi Mary vetta and
if you don't like celebrating Fridays
let me know in the comments and I'll
gladly celebrate it for you this is
pocket out daily let's arts day off with
the official news as Apple has now
launched their iphone 5s and iphone 5c
to the public either shipments poor and
the store you can get your phone today
but interesting I mean we've got a lot
of great things to talk about this phone
we've got unboxings video comparisons
tutorial just about everything you can
think of today and in the days to come
but hmm you know people were complaining
about the fact that for every 10 iPhone
5s is that we're sold only one iphone 5c
was sold in stores apparently the golden
iphone is already out of stock and the
knife on 5c doesn't seem to have the
same amount of popularity so did you get
an iphone today which iphone that you
get why would you or why would you not
get an iphone 5c it's just interesting
to see if the budget model is not
getting accepted now let's talk about
phablets and more interestingly
microsoft which didn't have a phablet
before kindly Terry Myerson just came on
record to say the company is very
interested in building phablet
ecosystems but not based on windows
phone 8 apparently apparently is
interesting i'm doing it on windows RT
which we kind of can't understand i mean
why would you do that with windows RT
when you already have Windows Phone 8
and the only reason why we think that
these two things matches because
apparently they will be merging both
operating systems in the future so stay
tuned for that now there is one family
that will apparently reach the market
with Windows Phone 8 and that is the
Nokia Lumia 1520 if it does keep that
name as it turns out apparently a very
very trusted tipster is now confirming
that the device will launch on november
eighth yeah november eight that far and
apparently it will cost the same amount
of money as every phablet which is 219
after two year contract 699 unlocked
you'll be available on AT&amp;amp;T and four
different colors now even more
interesting is the fact that we have to
wait so long could it be that we have to
wait because Windows Phone
point one will be ready for it or could
it be that we need to wait for it to
merge with Windows RT we'll see now
going through some interesting and kind
of negative news if you're interested in
buying the Sony Xperia z1 for a you know
unlocking the bootloader and doing just
about everything you'd want to do with
your own phone as it turns out Sony is
warning you that this will cripple the
camera yes do you unlock the bootloader
of the phone the camera will be crippled
according to the company apparently
there will be versions of the phone that
will allow you to do this but not the
current ones in the market so you know
just buyers beware you probably saw on
time to return the phone if something
goes wrong and finally for the hot news
of the day you heard about cyanogenmod
Inc you know that new incorporated
company that was just built out of a
service and how much we dreamed about
the fact that we love to see a phone out
of the box with cyanogenmod as the
company is working on smarter and easy
reports for Android but as it turns out
it seems that our dreams are coming
through as well Steve Kondik just came
on a YouTube teaser and he's saying that
that oppo and one that will be launched
on Monday has everything to do with his
excitement so could it be that this will
be the first ever cyanogenmod phone well
that leads you to the question of the
day would you be interested in paying
for a phone to be run with cyanogenmod I
mean you currently can get it for free
on just about every flagship of the
market when you pay for a phone
specifically for cyanogenmod and my
particular is honestly since i can buy
pretty much any phone and just unlock it
and route it and lo cyanogenmod i don't
think i'd like to pay for it but anyways
if that don't bring something compelling
unique that's completely different to
any other phone that's not just
cyanogenmod then yeah sure why not leave
us a comment down below what do you
think friends is always for an early or
scruple of everything that's happening
in a swamp one in town world machine
