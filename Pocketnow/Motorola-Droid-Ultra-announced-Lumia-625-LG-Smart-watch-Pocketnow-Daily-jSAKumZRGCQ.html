droid ultra lineup nokia also launches
the Lumia 625 as their big thing and
i'll need trademarks into tablets and
smart watches i'm high memory that out
and when so many smartwatches being
rumored out there can somebody please
just announce one this is pocket now
daily let's let's day off with some
interesting product announcements
motorola and verizon have wrapped their
new droid ultra lineup and it's really
interesting because first of all they
run a new x8 processor and I said day
because the three phones the droid ultra
the max and the mini run the same
specification is pretty much the obvious
is not there obviously the mini has a
smaller display a smaller battery but
and everything else they have the same
ram the same storage pretty much the
same everything and its really
interesting I mean this is the first
time that a company figures out how to
bring out a mini phone with high-end
specification so Lacey the description
for full specs prices and everything and
obviously launch dates nokia has also
unwrapped their big thing as being the
Nokia Lumia 625 as we expect that you
know this is the biggest Lumia ever but
not necessarily the best one it doesn't
have the best specifications but it does
have a very affordable price tag so
we're still trying to figure out which
market the skaters to at 4.7 inches but
anyways link in the description for full
details and both price points now let's
move over to LG as the company is now
trademark new names in South Korea that
link to the fact that they're probably
working on a SmartWatch and it's habit
they've trademark the Warren G pad
g-watch G glass G hub g connecting g
just about everything i wonder what
happens when all these products become
oh geez eventually but anyways obviously
these are just trademark names no
products just yet or at least nothing
that we know it but we'll keep you
posted now let's go over to HTC as we've
got some more reports that come from a
very trusted source that's say that
apparently the HTC t6 AKA one max is
going to AT&amp;amp;T hopefully not exclusively
but it will be and apparently that HTC's
are that we talked about yesterday will
be a mash-up between the HTC one in the
desire line of leaning it's going to be
a very pretty phone that will prob
they have some Ryan specs but made out
of plastic and it's going to sprint so
stay tuned to see how that turns out
this most probably it will happen and
finally for the hot news of the day
we've got Google's breakfast with sundar
pichai happening tomorrow at nine a.m.
pacific time which would be noon eastern
standard time we will be covering
everything live in our pocket now live
hangout where obviously we'll be
discussing everything as it's being
announced during the event and well you
know there's a lot here at the table a
lot of products that could be announced
it could probably not be announced so
that leaves you to the question of the
day what are your predictions for the
event that's happening tomorrow I mean
we've talked about the nexus 7 we talked
about Android 4.3 these are the obvious
ones but we do believe that android 5.0
might be announced since iOS 7 is
already a reality so leave us a comment
down below what are your predictions and
please join us tomorrow at the Hangout
