now calm the samsung galaxy s2 has a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core Exynos processor
we're thinking that it's going to have
the best web browsing experience the
fastest pinch-to-zoom the fastest
scrolling the fastest page load times
and we're going to test that out in this
video we're going to compare it to
Windows Phone 7 on the Samsung Focus the
iphone 4 and the HTC Thunderbolt it's
going to be fun let's do it and starting
things off we've got the HTC Thunderbolt
and the galaxy s2 obviously both are on
the same Wi-Fi network both have had
cash cleared we're starting off on
Google here we're going to go to
engadget we might not land on the same
webpage actually on engadget sometimes
it goes to mobile sometimes it doesn't
let's see what happens and let's see
okay we've got the mobile on the galaxy
s2 we're probably going to get the full
version here on the on the HTC
Thunderbolt we're going to put them both
on desktop view so that we can move
around the page see how planning and
scrolling compares so okay that's
loading and while the galaxy s2 is
loading but finished very quickly we can
flip down the page put down the page on
the Thunderbolt it's obviously a little
bit more choppy there but as the web
page gets into memory it becomes
smoother right off the bat the galaxy s
was extremely smooth let's check out
pinch-to-zoom very smooth there a little
bit smoother on the galaxy s2 we're
going to click click on this link at the
same time see which device loads it
faster okay let's see who finishes first
or which okay galaxy s2 finished so we
can move around on the page the galaxy
s2 is an interesting feature you can put
two fingers on the screen and move the
device towards your face this is kind of
cool when you are doing it in landscape
you could kind of go like that kind of a
weird feature so let's check screen
rotation speed as the Thunderbolt
continues to load the page it hasn't
finished yet and looked about the same
there looks like the galaxy s2 is a
little bit faster there we're going to
stop it from loading right hit the back
button on both of these devices and have
them both go back to the home page of
engadget
we like using engadget because it's a
very long webpage with a lot of text and
flash content and by the way both of
these devices have plugins turn to ask
so it's not actually loading the flash
content so again in terms of web
browsing speed speed between the
Qualcomm Snapdragon one gigahertz
processor what you find on the
Thunderbolt and the Exynos processor on
the galaxy s2 galaxy s2 beats the
Thunderbolt so let's move that off to
the side now let's bring in the iphone
and see which one will get two pages
faster which one's smoother we're going
to kind of get it loaded here here on
engadget let's actually zoom in a little
bit so we can see what we're doing
scroll to the bottom the iphone kind of
invented pinch to zoom and really smooth
scrolling desktop like browsing so it's
interesting to see how the galaxy s2
measures up against that so of course
we've got the single core about 1
gigahertz processor the a4 chip on the
iphone 4 let's check screen rotation
speed before we click on any links give
galaxy s2 is faster the galaxy s2 was a
little bit faster there let's move down
the page and see what it's like the
iphone is a scroll as quickly but that's
just sort of how the operating system is
built and we can go to the top like so
just do a quick little flip to get that
let's zoom in on something let's compare
the pinch to zoom obviously very very
smooth on both and let's go to this
headline and we'll click them at the
same time and see which gets to the page
first boom go and let's see cave galaxy
s2 finished first so we'll move around
on the page here kind of scroll down the
iphone is still going the galaxy s2 is
just really remarkable in how fast it
can load pages again we're hit the back
button and have them both go back to the
engadget home page see which gets there
first okay the samsung galaxy s to beat
the iphone and we can move around on the
page and do some reading while the
iphone is loading the iphone 4 screen is
looking very small nowadays and you know
we're likely to see it bumped to 4
inches for the iphone 5 but it's just
it's very much noticeable because you
have so much space to work with on a 4.3
inch display or even a 4-inch display to
pinch to zoom whereas on the iPhone you
almost feel like you have to you know
you wish your fingers were a little bit
smaller so you can get in there to be
more precise ok so the galaxy s2 won
against the iphone let's bring in the
Samsung Focus Windows Phone 7 has
extremely fast web browsing faster than
the iphone in most cases and when mango
hits with ie9 it's going to be even
faster so again we're going to do what
we did with the other two devices let's
drill into engadget com get the desktop
view loaded okay we're back we got any
gadget loaded here on the samsung focus
running Windows Phone 7 let's do a
screen rotation speed test okay we've
got the galaxy s2 is faster there galaxy
s2 is faster there you've got that
animation the kind of fight I'm in
Windows Phone 7 by the way forgot to
mention that all of these devices that
we were testing had no other windows
open so no windows there if we do a
little pinch gesture here you can zoom
out to see that there are no open
windows so let's move down the page
witness 17 is very good at not having
checkerboards when you go quickly down a
page once in a while you'll get a white
spot implying if we go really fast you
can probably see it's trying to keep up
but pretty good in Windows Phone 7
especially compared to the iphone we're
even on the iphone four you get
checkerboards all the time so let's test
out pinch-to-zoom very very smooth
comparatively let's move down to a
certain story let's go to the Microsoft
story they're buying skype and we'll
click on the links at the same time if I
can actually find it there it is so
we'll zoom in on both make a really big
target so it's impossible to miss and
let's tap it at the same time and let's
see which gets there first it's amazing
it seems that the galaxy s2 is almost
loading the pages before they show up
because as soon as you click the link
you're at the page the galaxy s2 browser
is smoking every other browser that we
are testing right now and so here comes
the Samsung Focus loading the page
probably 10 to 20 seconds later the
browser on the galaxy s2 believe us when
we say this is probably the fastest
browser that exists it's incredibly fast
let's go to pocketnow.com desktop will
go into landscape view and we'll see it
just just pop up it's it's really
incredible how fast this browser is and
of course we'll get some other dual-core
devices in here to test because you know
certainly this isn't the only dual core
smartphone out there we've got the HTC
Sensation 4G coming out soon which is
going to have a really fast Qualcomm
Snapdragon 1.2 gigahertz processor but
we are thoroughly thoroughly impressed
with the capability here of the samsung
galaxy s2 and again it has this feature
where you can put two fingers on the
screen bring it closer to your face and
the text will zoom it's not working
ideally here but you can actually tilt
it this way to make it happen better
kind of a novelty feature doesn't really
help very much but it's a nice thing to
have the double tap to zoom in works
very well it reflows the column double
tapping again will zoom all the way out
let's dive into setting up while we're
taking a look at the browser on the
galaxy s2 you saw that gesture
previously if you pinched you can zoom
out to your window view and you can add
new windows here and then it makes it
really easy to manage multiple tabs
sometimes it takes a little practice you
can easily flip between two tabs we're
okay let's see how much memory the
browser is using right now we've pocket
now open in just Google we're using
about 86 megabytes of RAM considering
that we have a full gig or so to work
with that's not too bad and let's take a
look at the options that we have here so
with the windows we can change browser
brightness independently of the rest of
the operating system you can go into
more you can add a shortcut to home
which is cool kind of an iOS like
feature you can do this anyway in
android but most browsers don't put the
option actually in the browser it puts
it on the home screen we can share the
page we can print let's go to settings
here we can change the default zoom we
can open the pages in overview mode and
block pop-ups I mean these are kind of
standard gingerbread options actually
most of these change your home page
clear cache accept cookies enable
plugins is somewhere around here so that
you can view flash content on that on
this in fact performance of flash
content is very very good
in fact let us go to youtube and take a
look at what it's like to look at
youtube videos and of course this has
the YouTube application on it but we're
going to do it through the web let's
search for pocket now real quick pokemon
that's interesting pocket now where we
go and let's take a look at this let's
try to play it in the browser here
should be able to and check out
performance it's actually loading it in
the sort of web player but very good
performance and if you were to load this
video in line in a page the performance
would also be quite fantastic in fact
let's uh let's do that because that's
something really you should really
should take a look at so here's one the
great thing about the galaxy has two
browsers you don't have to wait for the
page to finish to start working with it
so I'm just kind of ignoring the status
bar up there here's a video I want to
see I tap on it and it's going to load
the video right in the browser just like
you're used to on other android phones
but performance is especially good here
on the galaxy s2 so that we're playing a
 video scroll down awesome inline
video it looks awesome so yeah the
browser on the samsung galaxy s2 is is
quite possibly the best mobile browser
that's out there right now I'm sure that
in the near future that will be outdone
by another device maybe the HTC
Sensation maybe something else coming up
soon or now before of you on
pocketnow.com we're going to talk more
about battery life benchmarks in hand
field day to day usability a lot of
other things as you probably have
guessed by now we're in love with the
galaxy s2 we think Samsung did a stellar
job on this device and it's a very well
rounded smartphone that gives you
performance in every app and really in
every aspect of the operating system so
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and watch out for that review
on pocket now thanks for watching and
that's it for now
