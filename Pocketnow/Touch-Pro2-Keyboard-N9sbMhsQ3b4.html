Pocket now calm and today I'm going to
show you a new keyboard that's been
ported over from the touch pro two for
wvga devices such as the xperia x1 and
touch HD okay so I'm going to show you a
little demonstration on the original
keyboard so let's go in here and I'm
just going to type a little sentence hey
how are you doing so the unknowing thing
about this keyboard is that you have to
either use a stylus or your female and
as you can see you can also make my
pretty easily mistakes and it takes a
little bit to get good at it
okay so as you can see it took you have
15 seconds to type that so I'm going to
clear this and show you the new keyboard
and it's called touch input
and the cool thing like this keyboard is
actually gives you X t9 settings so it
will allow you to automatically type
letters if you excellently hit the wrong
letter it will automatically correct the
word so I'm just going to type this in
and they use the pad on my finger I
posted by fingernails so it's almost
like typing on the iphone which is which
is very nice to use okay so as you can
see it was much easier to type on that
and I'm going to go to show you the
settings real fast okay so going to go
down here to options and this is the
touch input so I'm as you can see you
can turn on the symbol lock and turn on
the keyboard sound which is what i had
on and you have it vibrate when the keys
are pressed and it will automatically
spell it automatically correct your
spelling and you can have word
completion both ABC and xt9 settings and
this is it by HTC so as you can see it's
copyright 2000 I so it's brand new and
this this keyboard will work in both
landscape and portrait mode so let me
clear out of here and show you how that
works this this particular device has an
actual physical keyboard so there are
two different downloads that you can
have one for a physical keyboard and one
for just a touch device so as you can
see the keys on this is same Cordy set
up and it looks pretty similar to the to
the portrait mode so clear that okay so
i'm daniel webster with pacquiao calm
and i'll post a link after I know this
video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
