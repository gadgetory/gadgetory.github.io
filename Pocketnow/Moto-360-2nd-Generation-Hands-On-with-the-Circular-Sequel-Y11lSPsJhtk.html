kick off the first wave of Android
wearables just got a sequel I'm Michael
Fisher with pocket now with Adam Lane
behind the camera join me for a quick
hands-on with the Moto 360
second-generation the new moto 360
differs from its predecessor in some
pretty significant ways starting with
size while Motorola continues to offer a
46 millimeter version there's also now a
42 millimeter casing available with
narrower bands for women or just those
who prefer a less ostentatious smart
watching you'll also notice the lugs at
top and bottom of the casing which the
former generation lacked personally I'm
not a fan of the shift here I think the
absence of band amounts made the
original 360 stand out more
but the plus side is that bands are now
more easily swappable using a built-in
latch motorola promises up to 1.5 days
or 2 days of mixed use with the embedded
300 or 400 milliamp hour battery and
obviously the bigger the watch the
bigger the battery it's also kept
wireless charging in place and retained
the heart rate sensor and ip67 dust and
water resistance rating and yeah the
flat tire at the bottom of the display
that's still here to accommodate the
ambient light sensor the screen itself
gets a slight resolution bump to 233 or
263 PPI depending on which model you
choose but it's still IPS LCD and not
AMOLED the most significant upgrade is
probably the change from the ancient
Texas Instruments processor to a more
modern Snapdragon 400 and yeah you can
definitely feel the difference even on
the demo unit here for the old moto 360
what occasionally stutter and drag the
new model seems as smooth as any of its
contemporaries whether you're changing
watch faces or shuffling through
notifications to turn it on or off you
use the new two o'clock mounted crown
button which isn't a huge change from
the three o'clock button on the existing
phone motorola doesn't seem to have
followed other manufacturers lead in
bundling a bunch of fancy watch faces
it's mostly the same old selection
though of course you can get more
the ignant hardware store the moto 360
is customizable via the same moto maker
comm you can use to build the new Moto X
smartphone and it's available for
pre-order right now starting at $299
we've got our own unit on order and
we'll follow up this hands-on with our
usual full review coverage just as soon
as it arrives be sure to check out our
other wearable coverage from Aoife 2015

follow me on twitter at captain to
phones until next time this has been
