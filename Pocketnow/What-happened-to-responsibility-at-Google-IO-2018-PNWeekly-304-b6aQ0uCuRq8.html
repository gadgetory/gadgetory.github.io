the pocket now weekly alright we are
live another heavy news week some really
cool Google and Android news ete is in
bad shape following us import bans we're
pretty confident that we'll see a pixel
SmartWatch this fall net neutrality
inches one step closer to actual death
and we've been digging into the
announcements at Google i/o taking a
look at Android P previews we've got a
lot to talk about so make sure you're
charged and ready for episode three zero
four of the pocket now weekly recorded
may 11 to 10 a.m. Pacific this weekly
podcast is where we dissect and discuss
those gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and the smartest watch on
the playground was really just a
calculator I'm point Carlos back now
contributing editor at pocketnow.com
joined as always by plucky podcast
producer mister Jules Wong on the East
Coast and I think we're both even though
we're bicoastal sharing some allergy
histamine have you solder the video
we're like there's a backhoe
the tree exactly what you're talking
about and the pollen just goes it's all
crazy it's a cloud like that's that's I
don't believe there is a hell but if
there is a hell that's that's what I'm
surrounded by I mean I'm a via Brenda
Stowe and it's freakin trees full of
pollen
my personal hell is the happening but
not where I go suicidal because of the
plans just just normal plants just
normal plants that's me huh yeah and the
nasal passages over here are kind of
suffering so I apologize if I sound a
little more stuffy than I usually do
I've also very stuffy usually but this
time around an extra stuffy right and
tell me last night if you had the same
thing where I was like I would roll over
and feel one nostril clear and the other
clogged like oh sweet relief then I'd
roll back over in the middle of the
night very unfortunately I have to rely
on my a friend to help me out in that
respect it's sad well we're not gonna
we're gonna focus too much on our
biological deficiencies when it comes to
the material plants make and eject into
the air weaker members of the species we
probably would have been bred out of
existence if we were more Darwinian uh
we've got some some great stories to
talk about there's there's a ton of news
going on actually some some pretty
mobile folks politics that we're gonna
have to take a look at and of course
Google i/o
all of the big announcements coming from
the developer conference and in the the
Android P Developer Preview we've been
taking a look at you're a pocket now
Jules why don't we jump in with some of
the headlines and then we'll we'll focus
the second half of the show all on IO
and Android P well I just wanted to
mention that you you the viewer the
listener can also join in on the
conversation too by hopping onto Twitter
and joining in with tagging your message
or questions with a hashtag P and weekly
and we'll be able to track these
comments in real time as they come along
and if you have questions but you can't
ask them live well you can send an email
to us at podcast at pocketnow.com and
we'll be able to get to those every end
of the month so do that do the Twitter
thing if you're on youtube we'll try and
get to the chat over there it's just
gonna be a great conversation that we're
gonna have
yeah it's always good times and we
already have a tweet coming in from from
Andrew Szyslak is this a permanent
change to 1:00 p.m. Eastern and just a
couple little scheduling issues that we
had last week with Nick gray this week
with myself and some some projects that
I'm working on I'd like to say that all
these podcasts are happening at special
times it's always it doesn't matter when
it's happening it's just a special time
we have scientifically determined the
exact right time to podcast these new
stories in these and well that's just
next week it could be like 4:00 in the
afternoon you know you don't know that's
why you've got a you've got a good
before a.m. yeah that's true for 4:00
a.m. a Singapore time could be the exact
right time to talk about next week's
news stories I I'm gonna keep like D
railing the show if we don't get one by
one because there are four big stories
that I think really poked out I'm gonna
share the the PocketNow website here
what we do that yeah affecting the
industry going on here so ZTE has
announced through Stock Exchange filings
that it has basically ceased all major
operations and they're still getting
their workers to work they don't have
much to do apparently according to
sources to Reuters and that's I was just
covering this this morning so I'm sorry
that you'll have to switch over but
Telstra from Australia as a result of
these cessations has announced that it
will stop carrying ZTE phones at least
temporarily so this is a big news 19
smartphones three mobile hotspot devices
pulled from store shelves and just it
could roll on into other regions so what
do you think is at this point because ZT
has said previously that this would be
dangerous
nelle - it's a company and this again
all stems from imports ban issued by the
US Commerce Department yeah I mean the
for the entire organization top to
bottom this is this is a disastrous turn
of events I mean originally when we were
covering some of the the first law
enforcement advisories I think for
myself personally and for a lot of the
people that are listening to our show or
watching our show we were probably
focused more on the the consumer facing
handset market I just I was very much
anticipating an axe on 9 this year after
spending some time with the axe on em
and how much of a fan I was of the axe
on seven so I mean initially it was like
oh well that's a bummer we're not gonna
get a phone and then it just seems like
with every every successive story that's
come out reporting on the state of ZTE
it's like a new economic impact a new
trade impact another partner falls falls
by the wayside and I think this is one
of those areas we want to be real
careful because how law enforcement can
act and how punitive some of these
penalties are for engaging in business
practices which the United States is
currently frowning on we definitely want
to be cognizant of that but then also
III question whether or not we should be
looking at business practices that
completely eradicate a company and
whether or not ZTE can actually walk
itself back from from the brink on this
or if it's going to be able to find
alternative manufacturing partners
outside of the United States that's
still going to be such a substantial hit
to the company that now we're just going
to be playing the game to see if they
can recover at all or if this is going
to be a company that's carved up for
parts and patents in the next year or
two because it's not just smartphones
they also do a lot of telecommunication
equipment before I'm sorry I've
completely forgotten there the number
four in the sector or telecommunications
infrastructure could be number four but
one of the top ones I guess but they are
far behind Huawei but you know they
still major player out there
and that's where most of their business
is held not in smartphones but you know
telecom equipment so and they rely on us
parts for those items as well it's
someone can starting to see that these
actions are are having this much of an
effect I know that they have said that
this has basically stopped them from
doing anything that is well the headline
of the article we wrote up is actually
kind of funny though ZTE employees
reporting to work have nothing to do and
it's gallows humor but I mean that is
kind of a sad state of affairs what I'll
be curious to see now is do we think
that our current Justice Department and
the investigation surrounding Huawei are
going to lead to similar import bans and
trade sanctions and again I'm putting on
a tinfoil hat here but it makes me
concerned to see our law enforcement
agencies responding to these kinds of
situations I think they should be
responding with punitive actions but I
don't know that I completely believe
that they should be so punitive that the
companies are absolutely wrecked in in
the following actions after you know law
enforcement gets involved for this well
they see this as issuing is issuing
denial orders issuing these import bans
is one of the tools that they have and
one of the most effective tools to you
know address these concerns about
national security and again especially
in this administration and the Trump
administration where tensions and trade
and other topics such as cyber security
have very strained between the US and
China where Donald Trump has voiced very
voracious support in favor of a trade
war with China this is just one of the
complicating factors in the overall
characteristic of our relationship and
it's it's not really going to change
this is this is
the symptoms unfortunately yeah now I
agree with you there and and I think
it's probably gonna get uglier on all
fronts both political and business
corporate hostile actions taken by a
number of different interests involved
it's just um again I that that little
spark of is is this fair play and and
because we're not being given enough
information at the consumer level and I
mean like our our show probably could
file a Freedom of Information Act
request for more info on what it is what
exactly is is transpiring between these
countries and these countries in these
companies I it still kind of it makes me
anxious it makes me anxious
that were wielding this kind of
influence without delivering evidence as
to what the actual transgressions might
have been and and again I'll be very
curious to see how this befall is Huawei
now Huawei I think is the next company
that DOJ has in their sights and if we
see something similar I'll I'll be very
concerned over what happened was ete cuz
i don't even think that ZTE s major sin
was the the business they were doing
with iran it was not complying
completely with the original penalties
that were laid forth for ZTE the
executives who were supposed to see jail
time the fines the penalties and and how
they were continuing to do business
after the fact now let's say Huawei is
is implicated in similar business
practices up front are they going to be
given the opportunity to comply with the
original slate of penalties that ZTE
faced or are we again gonna go straight
to some kind of sledgehammer style ban
and and that's where I don't have a lot
of confidence in this current
administration to act with proportion to
the actual crimes involved Yazidi legend
x yeah as ZTE had its second chance and
apparently it broke that but whether the
whatever litigation or investigation
that the Justice Department wants to go
against qua way that is being reported
at this point
that may or may not be more stricter as
the Justice portrait tends to really lay
that hammer more than the the Commerce
Department in vine this is actually a
pretty good question and I just want to
get your opinion on this Jules this is
from Renato Laporte using the p-n weekly
hashtag my biggest question what will
happen to companies that have ZTE
products deployed everywhere CTE if ZTE
goes wrecked our ekt this will be such a
pain in the butt and I would imagine and
I don't know if you would if you you
would agree with this I would imagine
that if ZTE goes bust it is just like
craters that ZTE s infrastructure is
gonna get carved up and sold to other
companies so that infrastructure is
gonna be sold off managed and deployed
further deployed by other existing
players in this space it would make
sense to me that it's not just gonna
leave infrastructure high and dry it's
just gonna be a little kind of shell
game of moving parts and pieces around
until everything gets sold off well
let's talk about the short-term I mean
they still have the resources and the
people and the current assets to be able
to supply support to existing
infrastructure and existing clients but
as we go further and further along if we
find that there is a deterioration in
ZTE state then well I guess already you
people if people are watching the news
and people are able to budget out any
potential moves that they want to make
well you know maybe a month or two from
now would be the time to do so but until
that happens and in you know in the
cases where people aren't allowed by one
way or another to make these certain
changes in their systems what we're we
might see is kind of a crisis situation
of just being able to find other vendors
other gap measures that they can take
already ZTE has trouble finding gap
vendors and other suppliers for what it
wants to do as a business Taiwan has
ordered and basically
this order that prevents all
manufacturers from shipping to ZTE
unless they get a and exports permit and
it sounds like other businesses and
other governments are expressing just
general skepticism in addition to just
their practices but also just their
viability from all of this pressure so
yeah it's a hard situation is the cynic
in me too that wonders like what if you
just gutted ZTE and sold off all of the
parts to another corporation like tze
and you just changed up some of the
Board of Directors you know like what
Cambridge analytic assured all their
offices but not really because a more
data is gonna be taking over for
monitoring all of your Facebook activity
I would like there's a part of me that
that hilariously like maybe that would
be a totally different comedy well it's
a completely different company where I
mean we bought all of the parts of ZTE
and we restructured and we've got a new
CEO and so everything's kosher
I mean Chinese government very
protective of its industries in its
players and wants to see them succeed
and you know I mean that's totally
possible yeah it's true I mean I think
it might have happened before and it
could happen again sure it has yeah
let's move on to Google but not i/o we
got some future to talk about here with
the fall Hardware event that they've
been a tradition for the past several
years
apparently in addition to your pixel
three pixel three XL smartphone and also
a second-generation pixel buds
apparently those will be coming back all
new and improved but it's unclear what
those improvements will be we're talking
about a pixel watch not an LG watch
style or or you know something like that
that seems Nexus like but isn't we're
talking about a full-on pixel watch and
three of them according to win future
and
quant it seems like we'll be looking for
Leng Triton and sardine for these code
names that are coming up here and all
them as per Google are referring to fish
because I don't know they they like
their fish over there
it will apparently be sporting they will
apparently be sporting new Qualcomm
Snapdragon where 3100 processors and if
he digs into the main parts of it not
much change from the 28 nanometer cortex
a7 cores on the 2100 but it will have
all the radio Suites GPS Wi-Fi LTE with
vo LT supports bluetooth the apt X codec
support and he also goes into why this
project has been delayed apparently
there was a contractor that was
commissioned for test samples and they
were apparently not up to snuff and
there was also the fact that Qualcomm
has been struggling to make these
improvements to its processor
specifically in power management which
will be one of the key pillars and
bringing the 3100 up from the 2100 so
yeah this is a this is something that we
can keep watch on literally but yeah the
I don't know because L like we don't
consider LG to be Google and LG have had
a long-standing relationship in terms of
building these products and being
together on even the pixel of the pixel
to excel but what I don't know what's
happening here and I don't know if this
stands as a challenge to Apple watch or
I I don't believe so not not in its
first generation you know even for
Google's relationship with manufacturers
like LG I don't think we've seen them
really figure out
each individual piece of hardware to the
same refinement I mean that that kind of
manufacturing that kind of acumen still
requires the practical experience of
printing putting products out into the
market and getting feedback on them and
I think the perfect example of that is
looking at in one year
we've got apple with air pods going up
against pixel with pixel buds Google
with pixel buds and one product feels
significantly more refined polished and
attractive than the other i from what
brief time I've shown with the pixel
buds I thought it was a disappointing
experience considering the price tag
affixed to those III I didn't care
enough to be in the pixel ecosystem on
all fronts to to pick that up but I
would have faith that a
second-generation pixel buds should show
the same level of refinement that we saw
going from the pixel 1 to the pixel 2
now with pixel 3 I think we'll have a
much severe competitor for the phone but
we'll be looking at Google's first
entrance into delivering their own watch
the buck stops with Google we made it
not someone else made it and we just
kind of slapped a label on it so I'll be
curious I'll be really curious to see
what this comes out with because I think
we're also in a holding pattern for the
technology a holding pattern for the
technology there are a number of issues
that I've got with where I don't think
where OS has aged very gracefully from
where Android wear 2.0 to where OS I
can't say that the experience has really
improved and I'm finding a lot of bugs
and and study or stuttery performance on
my Huawei watch III think if we were
talking about a significant process
improvement to that chipset like they
got down to a 14 nanometer build as
opposed to sticking with the 28 would be
seeing some more substantial
improvements but I'm very I'm very
skeptical that this this pixel watch is
going to be the direct Apple watch
competitor we've been hoping for it'll
be the first step in creating a product
line that eventually can compete but I
don't think it's going to compete right
out of the gate Google has all the
incentive to
at least show competence in its platform
and it's hardware for this first
generation and you might not have like I
have made them argument before to the
chagrin of many other people that Google
the Android wear was not and was not
being driven by Google that was being
driven by OEMs and to at that point I
mean you know in reference to its pixel
phones and its pixel buds like how much
agency Google wants to put in to its
efforts depends on how much it invests
and hardware and software and look at
where we were with pixel to pixel to was
an improvement over the first pixel but
the initial launch was a little clumsy
and Google had to do a significant
amount of PR work to kind of hide behind
some of the manufacturing issues you
know I hide behind the main like LG on
display performance hide behind the HTC
team on some of the the smaller pixel
build issues it gets bigger the speakers
and also just on support on actual
hardware support so and they weren't
able to fully own that phone problems in
all now I have every confidence that
Google has in iterative
manufacturing has addressed some of
those concerns that the pixels gonna be
a better phone now than when it
originally launched in that pixel 3 will
be another iteration improvement on top
of that but I don't think we've seen
Google really take the ball and run I
think they're still in this
transitionary phase from we supply the
software and other people make the
hardware to we make this product we own
this and we'll support it because we're
the only name on the box that matters so
I think it's just a culture shift that's
happening at Google which we haven't
seen them fully realize the potential of
that complete ownership of the ecosystem
yeah everyone's expressing their doubts
in the hashtag P and weekly on Twitter
Steve Becker can Google fix Android
watch OS in time for the release date of
the new watch
Peter Hayden
do you think the potential of such a
watch from Google could be the beginning
of a new platform after Android winner
given that it hasn't remained as
competitive as had been intended or do
you think that this will represent a
relaunch of Android wear I would say at
the ladder at this point if there was
some note of Android we're back in 2015
it was like oh yeah that was a sort of
cool and then it it was I'm not sure if
it was allowed to die out but it was
more more it just dropped from the earth
all of a sudden what so and this is from
your teleport PN weekly Google is too
late with this pixel watch like a year
or two too late even the LG watches at
Google sold on its website that was an
LG watch not a Google watch with the
special Google magic and I think that
lines up with where I I would hope
Google will go and this is kind of in
line with what Peter Hayden was asking
do you think the potential of such a
watch from Google could be the beginning
of a new platform after Android wear
when you changed the branding from
Android wear to wear OS you've got
potential now to put an operating system
into other things you wear maybe they're
visual maybe they're audio maybe they're
just tactile maybe they're just a
collection of sensors that communicate
with other devices in a personal area
network I would love to see where OSB a
complete from head to toe ecosystem of
poehler strap style chest heart rate
trackers and maybe mechanical implements
that can track hand movement for VR and
AR applications not just building a
circle on your wrist that you look at
with your eyes but building sensors into
your shoes building fibers into
compression gear workout clothing so
that you you not only get steps but you
actually get muscle activation and
stretching information so that you can
properly I adjust your workouts to be
working out healthier to focus on
certain major muscle groups I think
moving moving
we're out of the notion of this is our
SmartWatch os into this is our wearable
technology ecosystem could be the
perfect way to combat Apple and the
Apple watch because we I don't believe
Apple is going to have the the resources
the ability to flesh out an ecosystem as
quickly as Google could and they could
set the trend especially like they've
got relationships with clothing
manufacturers they had the smart jacket
from Levi's Google has those resources
and they could capitalize on that with
software custom bill to interact with
the body as a total organism not just
your eyes and fingers and that would be
a very clear and direct mission that I
would like to see Google publicly adopt
for Android wear OS by I'm sort of
concerned just by the inclusion of
Android things because you know there
there is that kind of Venn diagram
overlap between what wear OS and Android
things might you know include in terms
of products and if they get confused and
and start to blurred lines in terms of
that mission then they become all for
naught isn't isn't this what always
breaks our heart though is being able to
see some potential in all the chaos is
you know you've got Android things but
why not have things OS where OS and
Android you know like you could have
these little modules that then express
part of the ecosystem so where is the
operating system for stuff that's on
your body things is the operating system
that interacts with you know smart home
IOT in your phone and then you've got
Android which is sort of the brain that
helps you manage all the apps and
services that coordinate with all this
stuff I like again I see that as being
pretty clear potential and it's
something that Google at i/o could have
just led the discussion on you know
we're going to you know draw a line in
the sand now we're going to say this is
our mission and we're going to lead this
market and we are the only company with
all of the resources the machine
learning the operating systems the
developers the apps that can truly push
body and home computing into the next
gen
creation of products and services but I
think there's still I think they're
still licking their wounds from Google
glass and I think they're gonna be
ridiculously conservative which
unfortunately means other players in the
space will have huge opportunities to
take them out I think you're right in
that and that the whole Google i/o thing
for them was that they've announced a
whole bunch of stuff but they felt like
it was sort of flailing around as per
usual I guess I mean a lot so anyway our
because we're gonna get to i/o and to
your point right there I think you're
absolutely right there have been years
where Google seems much more focused but
the last couple major announcements
coming out of Google have felt fairly
scattered and there are some significant
omissions that I think we should talk
about when we talk about i/o but we
should probably let's just wrap up these
next two stories really quick because I
don't think we need to spend a lot of
time on I'm gonna go back into screen
share here so yeah FCC finally
announcing the the due date for the
repeal of net neutrality to take full
effect on June 11 apparently the office
of budget management's finally got
around to approving some of the changes
that need to be needed to be made to the
what was it the restoring Internet
freedom order so yeah there you go
June 11th well and of course it's not
the end of the story because there is
already a procedural or a procedural
action in place for a committee review
which requires one additional vote from
the GOP it's got 49 Democrats one
independent and no Susan Collins 49 49
Democrats and an independent and the
independent and one Republican they just
need one more Republican to force this
committee review and then from there
that would pass to the house and that's
super unlikely that it'll get passed in
the house but it because in a two-thirds
right no it's when this committee review
is
only a 51 i more than higher than its
50% plus one vote so you don't need to
have the two-thirds it's not a bill
it's a committee review and then a
committee repeal and if it passes both
the House and Senate then it has to be
signed by the president who can veto
this this review action too so there's
really no hope that the current
implementation of the Ohio as it
pertains to title to regulation of the
Internet is going to be the open urban
order you have the open Internet order
sorry I've been deep in the weeds on
this for all I know I just feel like I'm
like broken record now because we are in
a lot of bureaucratic procedural
slow-moving congressional actions right
now but there's really no hope that the
the open Internet order as we know it is
going to be preserved but it forces a
record vote on the GOP who are voting
against net neutrality and I think this
will be one of those side tangent issues
which is going to be brought up during
the the midterms that these are the
people who sold you out to major
corporations who are gonna make your
Internet services more expensive or
throttle your connections and you know
it's overwhelmingly conservatives who
seem to be against protecting this kind
of consumer protection so it's it's
still a moving target net neutrality is
still on the books even though we're
pretty confident that this FCC is not
enforcing and he that regulation but
we're still in that phase where I think
it's it's worth contacting your elected
officials to say you know whether or not
you support this because the
conversation is still is still ongoing
the conversation is still happening and
I think the most important battles that
will be fought will be again whether
they're the federal government and the
state governments that have supported a
difference
net neutrality legislation yeah what is
that we would flip-flop in like one one
presidential season for liberals now
trumpeting states rights states rights I
like all those conservatives man they
just seem to hate when states
have control and their own autonomy and
their own agency over how they want to
conduct business
well they've supported states rights
when it was convenient for them were
supporting statements whole areas
playing politics on this it only took it
only took one trigger issue like this to
completely flip the principles I don't
know what but I talked about this on my
own like YouTube stream on Monday but it
was it is really interesting to think
that if California and New York are able
to both pass the same net neutrality
style protections what they're looking
to pass does even stricter than the open
Internet order that the FCC would have
would have used for its title to
regulations and it would represent
one-fifth of the population of the
United States so that would be a clear
shot across the ISPs that are trying to
support gutting this type of regulation
which means now for that fight is gonna
get phenomenally ugly between who has
the authority as the FCC is trying to
get rid of the authority to regulate the
internet but they're still gonna try and
supersede the states that are looking to
regulate the internet again the the mind
games that you have to play the sort of
1984 doublespeak that you have to engage
in or double think that you have to
engage in is it's kind of hilarious at
this point that anyone's entertaining
this as being a good idea is just really
sad in the current state that we find
ourselves with all right well you talk
about California in New York I mean
California is the fifth I think its
largest economy in the world and New
York is somewhere it produces 1.5
trillion or something and GDP so yeah I
mean the that's where business is that's
where the internet is if anywhere is its
most needed then those are the places
and those I think are gonna be pretty
important
benchmarks and that's why I think the
federal fight is gonna get rural a Glee
because this administer
does not seem to react kindly to the the
political moves made by those coastal
elite state coastal elites fact is
business gets done there so unless you
want to change your I don't know
let's said I want to get away from this
completely I want to put my phone in a
different room so that I don't have to
pay attention to it that's a good idea
in fact I would I would probably say
there's there's likely some scientific
data to support your desire to get away
from your smartphone and use it less and
not only use it less but keep it as far
away from you as you possibly can so
there was a study published last year in
the Journal of the Association of for
consumer research a few of these
researchers are looking to see how the
presence of a smartphone being with you
know all the notifications you see if
receiving the day and the Fantom kind of
vibrations that you get in your pocket
or your bag or whatever like you we know
that smartphones are taking a certain
toll on our social behavior now what
does this mean for our basic skills like
cognition and and fluid intelligence
well apparently if you put on a desk
it's pretty I mean the effects are there
and there is a strong decrease in a
certain testing for these cognitive
skills and memory mathematics pattern
intuition you do get an increase in
impulse which is you know you take the
good for the bad of whatever that is and
yeah I mean there are certain effects to
it if just even have it in the pocket or
a bag then it's still quite negative
result there so only when you start you
know putting your phone in another room
do you see full attention
skills your full abilities to process
basic tasks is really at its best yeah I
mean there's just so much information
coming out on cognitive development for
children as to what kind of exposure
they should have to this type of
attention-seeking technology we still
have a number of practical concerns when
it comes to things like smartphones and
automobiles
you know operating phone distracted
driving campaigns we had a conversation
on pocket now with a clinical
psychologist who focuses on addictions
talking about how smartphones enable
different types of addictive addictive
situations I had a conversation with an
audiologist about smart phones and
hearing health again through the ability
to overuse the style of technology we
have not sure if this correlation I'm
not sure if this correlation would
surprise you but it turns out that phone
owners who have identified as more
dependent and more emotionally attached
to their phones like much like a parent
to a baby's cry are more likely to draw
extreme negative effects into extreme
negative metrics in the test that they
have done so oh no in in I think we've
had some some some decent anecdotal
examinations especially singular in
one-off cases of individuals who have
made claims about the emotional the
emotional state the emotional impact of
utilizing this type of technology but
especially when I when I sat down and
spoke with the audiologist at UCLA I
this impact on our society is so
aggressively fast I think think about
the differences in mobile computing
today versus where we were ten years ago
versus where we were 20 years ago and
for comprehensive studies on the impacts
of a new technology 20 years is not a
long time to study and unravel the
implications and the effects of this
technology as the technology
Marya ggressive li iterates and evolves
so by the time you're done conducting
your long-term study the technology has
changed dramatically from when you
started doing your long-term study and
it's you're kind of back to square one
again with trying to focus on one
specific aspect and it's gonna take us a
long time to study each of these
individual components addictive behavior
sleep impact and again the science on
sleep is horrific the Joe Rogan podcast
just recently had a sleep scientist on
and your your your ability to fight
cancer if you're not getting at least at
least seven hours of sleep a night your
ability to operate a motor vehicle to
fight cancer to perform in your job
functions it's like everything is
decimated and only point zero zero zero
one percent of the population has a
brain capable of sustaining prolonged
work activities with less than six hours
of sleep well that's a huge point zero
zero one percent of the population if I
talked to certain people I feel like so
many people pride themselves on the car
I can do just fine on five hours of
sleep and you're like yeah but your your
risk of getting a terrible disease or of
a coronary issue or some kind of brain
problem
are are substantially impacted by that
and we don't know the full effects of
utilizing modern technology as it
influences our sleep habits and that's
one data point right so we need to have
studies on computers TVs laptops cell
phones in total in this digital
lifestyle that we've created and we need
to look at that over a long period of
time with a good sample size of a
population just so that we can unravel
that one point on sleep and then we have
to do that for every other aspect of
Health over probably two or three
generations of people before we'll have
a good handle on what's good and what's
bad this these early indicators are not
looking super great for the way that our
society currently consumes digital media
especially when on the go yeah there is
no placebo for that kind of thing really
so how do you
trol group for something like that I
mean the entire process by which we test
this okay so it's like we're gonna have
to increasingly rely like well we took
another 20 people from Amish country
study their behavior again as a control
group because they're the only people
you know that don't have smartphones and
even some of those Amish people are
starting to have to adapt to the
situations where they have to rely on
you know even ride-sharing or like
something like that a Steve Becker
hashtag PN weekly I'm gonna start
leaving my phone in the fridge so that
it always stays fresh just like there
was um there was like a really good
urban legend like if your microwave is
leaking radiation put your cell phone in
the microwave and try and call it and if
you get a call through the microwave
then it's not properly sealed and I
don't think that's actually that's how
it works but yeah so I mean again I I
think we are I think I am the generation
of people who discovered that food could
be terrible for you my parents were of
the generation that had just figured out
that smoking wasn't just bad for you it
was awful for you and then eight grand
grandparents are just finding out that
labor conditions are actually bad didn't
have three-year-olds in manufacturing
manufacturing economy no um but but
moving forward I think will be a
transitionary generation that starts
developing better habits best practices
for how to more in a more healthy
fashion incorporate technology into our
daily lifestyles the last 10 years have
just been an explosion of novelty and
now we've got a number of etiquette
issues health issues and society issues
and legal issues to hammer out what the
the best way forward will be for how we
use these apps and services and it's
going to be a long journey and along the
way unfortunately it means that some
people will probably be impacted by this
this technology in very negative ways
information age more like indoctrination
age
oh now on that note let's move on to
Google i/o 2018 we have had plenty of
topics to cover just from the keynote
itself and some other conversations that
we can have offline about other features
like Google pay which has had its own
improvements happen but let's focus
first on Android pee and I feel like
we've come over this every single year
Wi-Fi battery big focus is here being
able to track the processes that take up
all the battery life that you have yeah
it's in the connectivity is just being
able to connect to a network I think
from from Oreo to whatever P is I've
been calling it Android Pi in my head
and I keep waffling back and forth
between Android piee and Android P I I
actually have been very positive because
Google keeps saying on Android were you
know this version of Android is gonna
run smoother and it's gonna run more
efficiently and you're gonna see better
battery life and that never really fully
comes to pass but Oreo and especially
8.1 I've seen process improvements
stability and battery life improvements
over running phones on nuga so I'm
willing to go with them forward because
I like seeing Google get stricter with
their initiatives things like project
trouble and forcing manufacturers to
play ball with updates with bug fixes
with security patches you know making
manufacturers more responsible for that
kind of stuff and delivering some really
good benefits like killing background
processes Android getting much more
brutal about what's allowed to run in
the back of your phone that kind of
stuff I think is going to be a very
positive step moving forward there are a
couple other things to that I'd like to
see though if if you're gonna push
phones with AMOLED screens and you're
going to talk to us about battery life
why not give us a dark theme you know I
that it's gonna be a very minimal power
save but every little bit helps and I
hate especially using my phone at night
even with the brightness all the way
down and blinding white notification
shades and settings menus is literally
the worst so it would be a huge step if
you could finally give us the dark theme
that's been buried in your developer
preview since Android 5 Android I mean
it's something that everyone wants and I
don't think he who has demonstrated a
good reason for that to not really
happen but maybe I mean we've seen more
things on the app side in relation to
night nodes and such but awesome it's
great it looks phenomenal and it
provides a very high contrast look which
even in the middle of daylight in bright
direct Sun it's easier to read for me
anyway it's easier for me to read light
text on a dark background I don't get
why Google can't figure this out for
their overall system settings when it's
something that's appealed since holo
theme you know the holo theme on Android
devices Windows Phone did this really
really well and instead now we're going
towards this let's use the most power we
can from the screen just to show basic
UI elements has never made any sense to
me and it's something that I still think
is a glaring hole in androids just
general UI behavior I don't know
whatever testing that they have done in
terms of readability or whatnot like
just having black stuff as opposed to
like a dork you know accent in color and
how that would affect their design
guidelines or whatever like they have a
lot of things to consider and something
trivial something not so much but so um
before we move on to the next IO story
this one's from from og Vinnie madrix on
Twitter with the p-n weekly hash tag I'm
still trying to figure out how adaptive
battery in Android P is different than
doze from last year in Oreo and correct
me if I'm
off base here but it seems to me that
adaptive battery is more of an
evolutionary step for more aggressive
background services control than what
doze was if it is I mean it's a whole
suite of things and I mean whether the
the cool things that I've seen a couple
of OEMs I can't recall their actual
names but is that you you know when I'm
going down at the end of the day at like
30% or Sarah but the phone will actually
notifying me that at this rate you'll be
your phone will die out at 12:30 a.m.
and would you like to turn on battery
saver like it's why there's it's more
disclosure and it's more being able to
fit in sir Taylor the parameters of the
battery battery saving mode and such so
yeah I sort of like what I'm seeing so
far yeah me too
and again also sort of I like it when
this is like what I like about EMU I on
huawei phones when Google starts pulling
things at work that work really well in
manufacturers skins and then just starts
incorporating them into Android and I
think the next phase will be like better
garbage collection better predictive
resource management especially with AI
units being built directly into
coprocessors on our chipsets that I
think will also go a long way towards
shoring up some of the holes that we
still see in Android yeah and I - one of
your big paradigms that you've always
referenced in terms of touch square get
at I see that there's more distribution
in terms of where that happens in terms
of specific tasks like ab actions where
I mean developers allow all they have to
do is get in a actions XML file and
they'll be able to you know inserts
certain tasks like they want to get if
someone's searching up tickets for
infinity war they can get those tickets
or watch the trailer on YouTube or you
know get those tickets on Fandango or
slices
we're actual tasks like being able to
book a ride on lift to your home or to
work whether it's line or or the uber XL
or something like that
like those things are just accessible
just by typing in okay here lift and
then whatever the heck that you want to
tab it out
so I mean that those are nice who's
going on there now Android P in terms of
access is is changing up here because
thanks in part to Qualcomm which has
upgraded its board support packages for
the Snapdragon 820 five six thirty six
and six sixty we're seeing eleven
devices seven them not Google OMS
participate in the Android P beta from
this point the public beta so and some
of them from Oppo some of them are from
vivo oneplus even essential which I I
guess it's more of a credit to their own
accord of being able to update software
quickly because they're running the
Snapdragon 835 so I mean but yeah this
is a good news overall I guess well in
and like a another another data point
towards those those system improvements
that Google has been trying to showcase
for several generations of Android like
reaching out to manufacturers and trying
to make it easier for updates to happen
and now we're starting to see the fruits
of that when we can see developer
previews on more than just Nexus and
pixel devices so again that that gives
me a little confidence in some of these
manufacturers that are that are building
their products in a way where it makes
this type of software transition easier
the software support faster that's a
huge step in the right direction because
like Android n is still under five
percent market adoption in the billions
of cell phones out there running Android
like a good thing they made it up to
double
digits but Android Oh Leo's still kind
of is is 5% and that's not good so this
is definitely yeah going going yeah
you're right going from end oh oh but
but it's still like that's that's not a
great place to be again how quickly this
stuff cycles how quickly threats are
detected
how many consumers get left out on the
cold for basic support let alone full
operating system updates to be able to
see these tools immediately utilized for
a Developer Preview and hopefully that
means we see similar interactions
between Google and manufacturers for
when the the actual update is ready the
named PI whatever the P name is the
named update is ready for general
release would give me a lot more
confidence for Android moving forward
yeah and I'm also pretty pleasantly
surprised at how popular the Android one
program has gone out we just saw BQ a
European manufacturer do a couple of new
devices as well and chummy's doing a
couple new devices reportedly and
spreading Iran and I think there's good
sauce to be taken there if even if
they're on lower powered or you know not
necessarily the most fast-tracked
development boards you know they are
still able to get fast direct Google
updates just for the fact that they are
running fairly clean software so I mean
it's a you know all these steps that
Google's taking might be seen as a
closing of the gilding of the little
lowly but i think it's far past time
that there's some competition between
Google and Apple in delivering fast
software updates as universally as
possible truth very very true now
alongside some of those operating system
updates this this one I thought was just
kind of a cute little moment in the
actual i/o keynote where they were
talking about smartphones creating this
culture of FOMO fear of missing out and
so there
placing their Google is trying to
replace fear of missing out with the
jomo joy of missing out by introducing
this dashboard which tracks your
behavior on your Android device shows
you what you're doing how you're doing
it when you're doing it and might be a
data point for some consumers to alter
their behavior if if they're not
necessarily engaged in the healthiest
relationship with their phone getting
back to the story that we talked about
in our news block I this this kind of
stuff I feel is is made with the best of
intentions but for the people who
actually do care about their behavior
with the phone I think this is just
gonna stress them out that they're not
getting their their steps in on their
fitness tracker like they should be
they're not putting their phone down
like they should be and for the general
mass population of people out there this
is something that they'll likely just
ignore and continue using their phones
the way that they always have yeah they
really have to get in to the dashboard
and set the app timer so that they and
the set up the notification setup shush
which in reality is a pretty good idea
you just flip the phone over and that's
it do not disturb
but yeah it's a yeah well it depends I
mean if people are really that invested
they might actually dig in and figure it
out but then again this is also you know
again I I'll be curious to see what we
can do in the technology space which
might actually impact consumer behavior
there seems to be sort of just a
momentum at play as to how people use
this stuff like I look at Facebook as
being a perfect example of this no one
seems to like Facebook everyone seems to
hate this service it's it's developed a
really terrible reputation but you know
it's where everyone else is so I should
keep my Facebook page to like there's
just this weight of momentum keeping
Facebook alive outside of the the
numerous apps and services that they've
acquired like Instagram and whatsapp you
know this is a nice gesture on Google's
but I don't think that it'll move the
needle on actually influencing consumer
behavior it's just something that's
that's kind of neat for them to show off
that they're making a good-faith effort
to give us the tools to alter our
behavior and I don't think that's really
gonna change anything I don't think
that's yeah I think one thing that has
been made clear is that Google will be
Google they will do the privacy policies
that they must and if they come against
any opposition it will be dealt with in
court and they'll have to sort things
out after that so it's it feels like you
know this is all data labor and it's all
free on the part of you know the
company's just being able to grab it and
deal with it as they wish
so I don't know how we change that
dynamic but it is certainly one that has
a lot of people worried yeah definitely
uh moving right along oh we already
talked about that
my my stories are out of order sorry um
I wanted to touch on this one a little
bit just because I think it's just such
an interesting gimmick that seems to get
people lit up but it's the notion of
utilizing celebrity voices on our on our
gadgets and electronics now the moment
John Legend like he shot his what was it
is the music video for some song on the
pistol - JC superstar I thought he was
pretty good as Jesus Christ and JC
Superstar am i back in theater
production and dance I thought he did
well um but no it's the big story is
Google assistants gonna get new voices I
think we've all had that experience on
our phones where you've got this really
great voice assistant thing happening
and then on Google Maps you just take a
random turn and something locks up and
you get robot boys forward to directions
and then it goes back to being normal
again
so improvements there I think are really
great but again they've got to showcase
it by by utilizing you know a celebrity
to get people excited and you're like
this is something that we keep dipping
our toe into and pulling back out like
Tom Tom
you had all of the novelty voices for
TomTom navigators and you could get Yoda
or an owner Arnold Schwarzenegger
impersonator my favorite was John Cleese
where he would actually be wondering
this is really John Cleese I can assure
you it is because I need the money you
know like hilarious for your
turn-by-turn navigation but they're um
there is an interesting black mirror
issue at play here where that kind of
celebrity voice sampling with new tools
coming out like Adobe's ability to
sonically capture someone's voice and
recreate elements of that voice and make
that voice say things that it didn't
actually say we are pushing towards how
do we verify the truth how do we verify
reality and for as neat and is fun and
is light-hearted as this is that they
can sample John's legend John Legend's
voice and use him as your Google
assistant voice it brings up a number of
security political and news reporting
situations that I think we're woefully
unprepared to tackle right now yes I
mean the moment that Vocaloid gets
acquired by Google I mean that's it's
gonna be one hell of a bride and we'll
be all left behind in terms of trying to
catch up so have you seen you Dobby demo
though I think who is it is it I've seen
their other demos of you know like
Donald Trump like they even have the
footage matched to the speech pattern
and he's using for a fake speech yeah
and and those still look really rough
like there's the one with President
Obama - and and yeah there's enough
uncanny valley but the one that really
freaked me out was the live stage demo
Adobe did with Kegel keegan-michael key
and they just well and you say this one
sentence and then we can cut this word
out and put this word in and completely
change the meaning of what you said and
then and like I know it's just a staged
demo
like that's polished under the best
situation Adobe is is showcasing the
best but how that
process could function in a couple years
based on a very limited swath of audio
sampling is is literally terrifying like
that is ridiculously scary how much
better that's going to be over the next
couple years and again I'm sitting there
watching Google i/o like oh cool new
voice assistance Oh John Legend a
celebrity I'm watching them doing the
recording then they do the sample output
of John Legend and you're like oh oh
this could be bad that's good get real
bad real fast well I mean if we could
replace all of the Eurovision
competitors which is happening right now
with all this this new voice technology
and then maybe that'd be great I don't
know maybe maybe we won't have a lot of
fantastic lines or like that bearded
lady that that that one the thing one
time anyways let's talk about some of
the other Google assistant features that
are coming up like continued
conversations and multiple actions this
is all just realizing the context being
able to hold a natural conversation not
having to listen out for hey Google
every single time you're just able to
talk back
once you're done apologies if you have
your speakers on we just through the hot
word on your phone hey Google I hope
you're wearing earphones
hey let's subscribe to the pocket now
weekly more phones just lit up on my
desk no results but it did it did send
him the stitcher so I that's a good
start I almost got us an extra
subscriber hashtag sponsored kids well
just like in with Alexa they'll there's
a pretty please mode yeah yeah that's
pretty nice
delivery like connecting third-party
BOTS via assistant for delivery services
such as Domino's 7-elevens Starbucks all
these all these things are
pretty nice smart we got an update on
spark displays apparently they'll be out
in July or June and more that's coming
our way and then there is a duplex and
this is a kind of a new territory that
we're going into here obviously when the
demo happened it wasn't a live demo but
it was recorded and it sounded like it
was a pretty good piece the 7000
audience members that that developer
competent conference were kind of like
standing up and cheering and the demo I
mean we know that this is using Google
assistant to actually communicate with
people it's using those voices which
we're talking we were talking about yeah
so your Google assistant will go and
make a phone call to a restaurant to a
car rental service and will be your
assistant
well we'll tackle the communication with
a living breathing human being in a
conversational fashion even including
ohms and Oz as you know those like sort
of human markers in a conversation uh
well yeah we're looking for a table for
seven around 3:00 p.m. you know like
trying trying to actually manage that
this is one of those like I really
wished I was able to have seen hi Mays
response to this because he's been he's
been so critical of voice assistance
because it's like well they're not
really my assistant if I have I'm trying
to do my Honduran bravado if I have an
assistant I tell my assistant go and
book travel for me or go and get a
restaurant reservation or try and make
sure that you know my hotel is taken
care of and I can't do anything with a
voice assistant and now it's looking
like oh holy crap like we're getting to
that point radically fast what what did
you think of the creepy factor like if
you have Google assistant making a
restaurant reservation on your behalf I
feel the assistant should disclose up
front that this human being is talking
to a machine well yeah I mean that's one
of the things that Google is trying to
you know incorporate as best
possible and like but in terms of all
that like they're working on that
they're working on future applications
there were also but one thing that I
should note from the chairman of the
board at alphabet which is Google's
parent company is that he says that this
this whole duplex thing passes the
Turing test but only in terms of making
a reservation it doesn't pass in general
terms but it passes in that domain and
that's really an indication of what's
coming and given that all the stuff that
we have mentioned before I think even
without even with disclosure even within
the bounds of what Google is you know is
limiting this to at this point I think
for this is one of the few things that
Google should keep proprietary as best
as possible
because who knows who else will get this
hands-on this thing if it this becomes
open-source and we start talking know I
agree with you the Google's actual
actual implementation of this will
hopefully be copyrighted and trademarked
out the wazoo with an army of lawyers
ready to defend it and that it stays
proprietary to google internal
technologies again for the privacy
implications for the data collection the
behavioral implications and just for
this being another instance of
technology interacting directly with
human beings I can only imagine other
companies working on similar projects
because you know Google's showing this
means that it's gotten to a point where
they feel comfortable showing it but
that that that means that there are
probably an army of other startups and
larger corporations that are working on
similar styles of human technology
interaction and just wait until you get
a programmed voice AI or programmed
voice bot that's all about robo calling
for a campaign season you know just just
how much more effective and how much
more weaponized that's going to be and
spreading disinformation or
um trying to gin up controversies or I
or just how obnoxious that poorer
versions of this are going to be you
know like when you try and call your
bank or try and call your doctor's
office to set up an appointment and
they've gotten rid of their secretary
because we've got this great voice
assistant that works even better and is
indefatigable and 24/7 and you don't
even need to have a person manning the
phones as a job anymore but they don't
have Google's tech and it's gonna be
terrible and we're all gonna hate it
we're gonna be in for a number of
startling transitions like that but tell
me like Jules that you didn't get to the
end of that demo especially the one
where they called the the Asian
restaurant and there's like this great
crazy miscommunication as to what
they're trying to do and they eventually
still get to the desired result but at
some point and very very soon I would
imagine in the next couple years that
like my voice assistants just gonna be
talking to other Google Voice assistants
carrying out all of these business
transactions for me and I won't be
involved in any of it and eventually
they'll let me know like just what I
need to do like it's like we're already
getting to that point of it'll be
machines talking to machines we won't
even need to pretend that like calling
people on the phone is a worthwhile
activity it's the personal concierge
that we've always wanted and until
everyone connects their BOTS up to the
main Googlebot well we're still gonna
have to use phones and vocal
communications in some ways you know
just outside of reservations at all so
you know being able to you know express
a clear concise message at points where
this is needed then we're working our
way towards that until then this is kind
of the stepping stone that sorta needs
to be taken oh and this is a we've got a
number of tweaks on this using the PN
weekly hash tag but this one this is why
I'm both excited and a little creeped
out for this technology from renato
Laporte pianned weekly if I have a
business I don't care who is booking to
come and visit my place be it a machine
a person or a parrot I don't care but
what I care about renato is a major
corporation like google is using
voice eh I technologies to interact with
other corporations and businesses who if
they don't know they're talking to a
machine then there is a problem with
disclosure because I would have to
believe just like with Google Voice and
voice translation for my for your
voicemails your voice your employee
interacting with that voice assistant is
probably being recorded analyzed
dissected that interaction being
compiled into a successful interaction
or an unsuccessful interaction and that
I do believe should require some kind of
disclosure if I talk to a voice
assistant and it's a nefarious or a bad
actor and they take my voice recordings
of my voice and they start analyzing
that data or replicating that data I
should have some disclosure that that's
something like that is occurring
yeah and just even by some of the scams
like one of them you know they ask a
question right from the start of the
call and they you know the recipient
says yes and then they you know use that
clip of yes to basically you know have
them somehow
agree to was you know these stupid
contracts that yeah it's just it's
stupid so and and it's been hilarious
like the evolution of robocalls to
because we're seeing a humongous uptick
in robocall scams happening right now
one of those that you just detailed this
like we can record you saying yes and
apply this to anything and you now have
to fight it and prove that you didn't
agree to this
to this contractor to this arrangement
but even just how annoying some of them
are where you pick up the phone and you
hear though hello
I'm sorry oh hey sorry about that I
think we just had a bad connection
anyway I want to talk to you about a
reverse mortgage
hi I can't hang up fast enough and plug
that number dang it
yeah well that stinks yeah we should
probably wrap up these last couple
points here because we've got some
Google photos news and some Google Maps
news what do you want to hit I think
well Google photos but if only for one
thing which is the colorizing of black
and white photos because that I feel
like has
it Turner like a feature piece about the
art of colorizing these black-and-white
photo it's not just you know you know
willy-nilly you use algorithms like you
have to actually look into a film and
you have to actually you know see the
color space that was being able to
achieve like it there's a whole bunch of
stuff and just to have this you know in
the palm of our hands I mean it's one of
those it's one of those moments where
it's you know it's like it's interesting
yeah
you know I agree like I'm I'm not super
positive on this because I have a deep
love of black-and-white photography and
I there's so many I know there's we were
looking at old photos it was a
limitation of the time that people
weren't shooting in color but that also
men those early photographers were
looking at how to compose their shots
and balance light and contrast and
exposure for the medium that they were
working in and I'm not particularly
excited about the notion of just
slapping some color on one of those
photos in in much the same way that I
sort of I disagree with altering films
you know when George Lucas testified
before Congress about what Ted Turner
was trying to do in colorizing movies
and then George Lucas turns around and
just kept tree editing Star Wars over
and over and over again until it was a
very different movie than what he set
out to originally create I feel that
there should be some some respect of the
preservation of what old media really
resembled that and I didn't even think
that their example the the the photo
that we just showed if you were watching
the YouTube stream of you know a woman
and a kid on a bench I don't even think
that looks good that looks like a
terrible Instagram filter to me and it
didn't think it was a good example to
showcase what Google was trying to
accomplish by putting colorization tools
into into google photos like that that
doesn't look good
that's not what I would want to show and
then you look at the black and white
photo that they took it from and that
has character and it has a feel to it of
the time that it was created and this
just looks like you put a sepia filter
but you only in Picasa it doesn't it
doesn't really to me reflect like what
what this should have looked like if it
had been shot on film so why are we
playing this game why are we playing the
why are we messing with this media
already even like HDR tools I find way
too aggressive in juicing up photos more
than they need to be and now now we can
do the same to your black and white
photos too and like no I shoot black and
white when I want to capture the look or
feel of something dramatic or high
contrast and and I think we lose
something when we alter our media that
way I guess part of that may be coming
to it like coming from the methods and
being able to identify objects and
whatnot and just assigning colors as
opposed to the traditional kind of
palette matching methods and whatnot so
I mean different products for you know
different methods but yeah I think it's
cool but this is actually gonna be
pushed into I I think it's already
rolling out to select handsets running
using Google photos as a tech demo I
think what you're saying is really cool
you know the ability for algorithms to
scan a scene and apply information in a
really novel way not just oh well you
know we made the grass green and you
know you just added like a really bad
color palette or sepia palette or
something like that
as an example of machine learning
technology I think that's cool but as an
actual consumer facing product I just it
makes me sad like I go back and I look
at my old family photos and we have
black and white photos and film
negatives and slides we actually had a
slide camera my grandfather had a slide
camera and so scanning all of those
negatives and scanning all of those
slides and having really high-quality
digital archives of our
existing film and slide archives is
really cool I don't look at those
black-and-white photos and think oh but
if only we could make them in color like
no that's that's actually preserving my
family's history and I don't want to see
family members just running off and like
oh well look now we made like you know
if your great-great-grandmother here's a
an HD are super colorful and pop low
look at the Reds on this that's that
that doesn't that doesn't move you know
well you don't what you well you don't
want to be able to at least see your you
know relatives of that era in at least
some sort of color no I'm not III I'm
not interested in altering the the
history of my family's media just
because it's gonna look kinda neat now
when it's not even gonna look good like
again I look at some of those old photos
and you know like they have an H well it
wasn't like we kept our film negatives
in archive quality containers what
Google will do to those photos I think
will look bad and it's gonna a lot of
people are gonna be convinced that that
looks good just because it's novel and
its new and it's hip just like really
super aggressive HDR looked interesting
so people started to conflate that with
this is good color for photography
that's not true it's just it's novel and
it's fresh and it's exciting that you
can do it as easily as you can that
doesn't necessarily mean you get a good
photo you just get a really colorful
photo like saying you know Sunny D is
good for you because it's thicker than
orange juice and has more sugar I that's
not that's not what I want to see happen
to media it's you know like that's your
pick no I mean you look at like the
working with an Ansel Adams and you're
like would any of that photography be
improved if we could slap color filters
on it and no no because he was crafting
an experience that was that the depended
on the medium that he was creating it in
I that that to me is what I feel we kind
of Lou
when we make everything sort of the
auto-awesome approach greenbox
everything's on the rails the computer
does all the heavy lifting for you and
you just generally vaguely point the
camera in one direction with no
technique and no examination and no
quality discussion on what makes an
image interesting we we lose out on this
and now we're having all these tools on
the back end to try and fix problems
that don't really exist black-and-white
images are not a problem
and they look good and they they are of
a time they preserve a history so that
that to me is is disappointing that it
got as much play in the Google Photos
discussion as it did yeah Muhammed Islam
on YouTube chat leave my black and white
photos alone they told a lot they took a
lot of time to compose and it was done
in one shot so yeah definitely some
concerns over there speaking of no
technique no skill
what about navigating because I'm not
sure how often you go underground and
you take the subway but for the likes of
me and Jaime and the rest of us at York
I wish I could do more of it but
California is not really known for its
public transit that's starting to and
you know if I ever go there then I might
have to rely on that as opposed to uber
or or anyone anything else basically but
gods of I'll try visual positioning
systems are becoming a new thing for
Google just by using the camera google
lens and identifying businesses as they
pop up you turn on your camera and you
come out at the subway and your GPS is
not really doing its thing you turn well
there you go you've sparked a business
over there oh now you realize that
you're facing north instead of this
general direction we're even
you're even located at a place where you
really aren't supposed to be like five
blocks from here or something like that
so it's a it's a great improvement for
you know having to be able to remember
which direction which orientation your
train
came out of and what the northwest
corner of this street is designated as
an exit of or you know it's it's better
that's great well I think this is an
excellent example of a are and machine
learning improving something that that
was kind of annoying this wasn't like a
tragic I can't use this device all uh
tur failure of Google Maps and walking
directions it's it's hilarious that
every single time I'm in San Francisco I
do that thing where I have walking
directions up after I get out of get off
the BART and I start walking in one
direction and it's almost a guarantee
like 99% of the time I'm walking in the
wrong direction and it takes fours
couple steps before you know Google Maps
catches up and points me it the right
direction or it looks like you're
walking backwards because it's telling
that you that you're facing what
direction and what exactly other yeah it
especially is the compass in our phone
can can get pretty confused so instead
of trying to instead of trying to pry
into user information like we saw when
Google got tagged for using people's
Wi-Fi as place markers in Google Maps AR
and machine learning to analyze the
scene with the incredible amount of data
that Google has on location information
and being able to match what you see
with their archives of businesses and
stores and streets and stuff like that
this to me is is a significant consumer
benefit that we can see from an early
implementation of AR and this is this is
exactly what I helped we build the the
backbone on for future services because
imagine having just very simple arrow
pop-up heads-up display tools for your
car and being able to navigate that way
off of you know a camera on the dome of
your of your hood looking at streets and
locations and and intersections and
being able to better guide you through
tricky navigation situations so this
this to me is is
humongous step forward which is in a
very subtle fashion the the service that
I hope to see iterate on for
improvements moving forward I'm just
wondering when wearing a our headsets
will be a socially acceptable thing in
public loved about vine you know like I
would totally rock some hipster nerd
glasses you know nerd frames the big
although I don't think they would be BC
best fit for this purpose because
they're more intended to be out of the
way then no but I mean like heads up
what we're saying for that is an
implementation Vance was the first
generation of this type of system that
had actually made it into a functional
prototype if we could have built off of
that
and we could have learned from that and
we didn't have to build in huge
batteries because you have active
powered displays instead of your instead
you're using these little like laser
projectors that can maybe also track you
to different quadrants like maybe you do
want to look up into the right for a
certain piece of information maybe you
do want to project when you're looking
straight ahead just a little arrow pops
up into your field of view and it
doesn't have to be super high res or you
know so what you're looking at pop-up
sort of like fashion pieces and oh
here's the look that is available at
Target right now do you want to buy it
you look at buy now and that's that then
suddenly you have in your hands or
you're looking at a YouTube video
superimposed in front of something that
you just searched up from looking at
this like brick wall or something and
Pink Floyd starts popping up so yeah I
just mean like avant was the first step
in what could have been the perfect
solution for how twitchy people are
about having funky goggles or Google
glass Borg screens and you know like
face computing in general and it's just
it just sucks because that could have
been a really discrete way to handle all
this but this is what's exciting about
the service moving forward Google Maps
actually improving their eye I hope that
we see some some better refinement
because I've actually personally been
having a lot of problems with Google
Maps on phones that have been updated to
Oreo it's been running really flaky for
me trying
get around la which has been a bummer so
I'd like to see that just you know get
some new features and now that we see
some new features Google lens is going
to be coming to a handful of phones over
the next week I'm gonna be playing with
it on the g7 hopefully next week and
maybe share some thoughts on that as I
walk around la that uh that kind of
improvement then now that we have the
new features what I hope to see is that
we'll get back to a couple iterations on
just fixing bugs and improving stability
yeah yeah and we hope that all these
features be at Android P or all these
other services that Google is offering
me now get those improvements and maybe
not we don't have to wait until the next
year for certain little features to pop
up and just saying Google I'm just
saying well um on that I think we've
we've covered quite a bit of what went
down and obviously if you think we we
missed anything I hope you'll reach out
and drop us online hit us up on the
emails podcast at pocketnow.com where
we'll collect a handful of messages at
