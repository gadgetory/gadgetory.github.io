apopka calm and this is another episode
of the android application weekly in
which we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started this
topic is called fatty booth and it costs
one dollar ninety-nine cents on the
android market what it does is it turns
your friends or whoever into a rather
plump character so i'm going to start by
choosing a photo in my gallery so once
I've chosen a photo I have to do is
click run face detection or crop man you
letting it run face detection and now I
move the eyes over to where the eyes
need to be and I move them out and hit
start and now we have a rather chunky
lady gaga so I can just shake it to make
her thin again or shake it to make her
fat moviefone is a free application
available in the android market that
shows you pretty much everything you
need to know about the upcoming movies
that are coming out and the ones that
are already in the theater so i can view
upcoming movies by clicking on this tab
I can get a little blurb about the movie
if I like just go back i give you the
theaters in my area so let's say I
wanted to pick on pick this theater I
can view the movies that are playing and
the showtimes I can also view trailers
so let's say I want to click on this
trailer right here and I can also get
movie news plug players great
application that cost four dollars and
ninety-nine cents on the android market
what this allows you to do is play
videos music and view pictures over a
Wi-Fi connection on your media server if
you have that setup on your computer or
through an external hard drive so let's
say I want to watch this video here I
just click on it wait for it to load and
you'll begin playing you may need to
install the player on your android
device in order for certain encoded
videos to play and I can add things to
my playlist browse and set up various
devices spaghetti and marshmallows is a
really fun game in which it was combined
it marshmallows using these pieces of
uncooked spaghetti so as you can see I
need to go up to the top to put the
marshmallow in this circle that I have
up here and I need to build a structure
all the way up to the top so what I want
to do is click up here try to do it with
one string probably won't work and
marshmallows of course are already
toppling but the object of the game is
to get a structure built all the way up
to the top where your marshmallow sits
in the circle wolfram alpha is one of
the best computing websites out there
now we have it available on android
market for about a dollar ninety-nine
cents so the cool thing about this is it
will calculate practically anything from
conversions to to anything you could
possibly think of so let's let argue the
indefinite integral of x squared plus 4
or something like that let's c plus 4
and we'll just hit enter or go and now
we'll compute it if we want we can view
these steps on how to calculate this
equation and we can do that exactly
right here so this is that another
episode of the android application
weekly and if you like our videos make
sure you give thumbs up and I'll sleeve
some comments down below the name of
this live wallpaper is called flowers

version available on the android market

download information for all these
applications just visit the link in the
description to be directed a Pacquiao's
website where we have the QR codes i

goggles or some other QR code scanner
and it will install directly to your
device thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
