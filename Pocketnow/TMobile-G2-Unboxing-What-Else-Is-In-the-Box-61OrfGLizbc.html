unboxing of this device this is the new
g2 from t-mobile HTC and Google open
that up and like I showed you in the
last video here is the device it comes
out very nice very easily I've already
taken off the protective screens the
protective films on that which there
were several so we'll move out of the
out of the way and see what it comes
with now I didn't cover this in the last
video because it's probably the typical
stuff but just to show you anyway
there's a little hole here that says
there's a start guide down there can
open that up on the bottom a little bit
tricky to get into it looks like opening
it the top way would have been easier
but you know let's go ahead and keep
going this way now that we've started
and that's all there is just a couple
books so the getting started guide terms
conditions return policy limited
warranty a new sim now i don't know if i
need this sim or not this is an hspa+
phone but i should already have an hspa+
sim in my other phone that i'm just
going to move over and then that this is
a return merchandise label for your
handset recycling program so you can
take your old phone and pop it in any
box and slap that on there send it back
to them so kind of cool idea they're
moving along we've got a wall work that
I'm opening off camera here very slim I
mentioned the Samsung version was very
slim and very small this one looks like
it's a little bit slimmer and smaller
that usually means better power
consumption as well it doesn't need as
much power just a little USB port right
there not grounded indefinitely for the
u.s. HTC branded moving all along next
we've got a USB cable I know because it
says so on the bag we will open that off
camera and I'm just tearing into these
they're sealed not taped shut the nice
little things got a rubber band around
it it feels pretty good
rounded edges on everything including
the the standard USB connector right
there feels really nice see what it
looks like when you plug it into the
phone just like that so there is a
little bit of a gap they did not mold
this to fit the phone which is a good
thing if they did that then you wouldn't
be able to use this on any other phone
but as it exists right now you just plug
that into any phone or any device you're
good moving on to the last item in the
box and that is the stereo headset has
another bag inside of it that I'll come
back to again with a little rubber band
on it these are just traditional earbuds
you know nothing nothing to write home
about nice thin in-ear buds it does come
with little squishies and a clip I don't
need to show you that in detail but this
also doubles as a headset a hands-free
set rather with your play pause phone
track necks and whatnot right there on
the on the wire it's in the middle I
don't know if I like that all that much
most of them that I've seen have been up
here on one side or the other but it
does its job not terribly long so it's
not going to get in the way and a very
elegant-looking plug we plug that in
there just so you can see it again it
doesn't fit all the way down in there
but it's very solid and it looks really
nice so that's the stuff that comes in
the box from the with a t-mobile g2
you're sure to see more videos coming up
soon so stay tuned subscribe to our
video channel to make sure that you
don't miss anything these are exclusive
first-look videos so come back very very
frequently to see what else is new so
for pocket now and showing you the
detailed unboxing of the g2 I'm Joel
