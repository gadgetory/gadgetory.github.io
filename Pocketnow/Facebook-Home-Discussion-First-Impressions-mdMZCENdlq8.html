pocket now live here we're talking about
HTC know or now we're talking we're
talking about facebook home we tried to
do this hangout and there was a Google
server error which is kind of crazy and
so everything that we did is now erased
into the internet interwebs stratosphere
thing yeah good animation Steven so
we're going to do this again this is
going to be a really quick round table
discussion we're talking about facebook
home which of course is a new launcher
effectively from facebook that replaces
your android home screen and gives you
updates kind of been a big immersive way
of what your friends are doing it's kind
of like your news feed on your home
screen and it also is this concept of
chat bubbles cue the graphic okay you
catching me off guard man the chat
bubble thing is kind of a really cool a
really cool way the launcher sort of
flows out of the operating system are
out of the launcher and it allows you to
I want to click over here Taylor looks
pretty bad video is a different all
right there we go so there there as you
can see is a little chat bubble which is
basically a persistent picture of
someone's face that follows you
throughout the operating system whether
you're in your email your calendar your
Twitter or whatever and with one touch
you tap on the person's name and the
kind of chat box opens up and those
little chat bubbles the chat heads are
stuck to the corners of the screen you
can't put it in the center so it kind of
messes up what you're doing it kind of
floats all around so we're trying to
figure out here if we are actually
excited about facebook home if it's
something that we would find ourselves
personally using and and and all about
oh these guys here we've got I'm a
Steven and Taylor we are all probably a
different demographic than what facebook
had in mind for facebook home because
we're we're older we kind of gotten to
the Facebook thing in college meaning we
didn't grow up with it from middle
school to high school like the
generation before us did but
nevertheless we are still low tech
so we care a lot about this stuff so to
start things off just to get some
context dear I want to talk about how
you guys use Facebook so that we can
kind of paint the picture here so let's
start off with Stephen how do you use
facebook I do not use Facebook and I
used to it's sort of you know trailed
off over a few years and I think I
haven't even logged on in about a year
and a half now so for me facebook is a
thing of the past alright that's quick
count canceled not cancelled like it's
the river the password alright that's
that's good and it's good that we have
you here Stephen to represent the person
that doesn't use facebook for for
various reasons Taylor what is your
facebook usage look like i use facebook
primarily and actually only for friends
and family and that's personal friends
not really people i meet online or even
really old high school friends or on
there but i just kind of ignore them
I've hidden most people from my newsfeed
so I log on every day but I don't really
use it all that much so you this every
day after your morning cup of coffee
when you walk down the hallway and well
you know where it goes from there yeah
facebook is an awesome way to pass the
time when you are on the bathroom in the
back okay I may how do you use how to
use Facebook how often you use it same
is taylor i use it pretty much in the
bathroom or coffee just to keep up with
family and old friends I I live in a
city where I don't have all my friends
are in my hometown or all my brothers
and sisters are out of here so that's
the only way I connect with them and
that's the only reason why i use it so
even if i have a ton of friends I all
the people that I have accepted our
people that I actually know but still
you know I don't keep up with everybody
I guess I'm i'ma I've been a bad
facebook user for the past year you can
see it that's all right there are all
different kinds of facebook users the
most common of course is the stalker
variety those that just sit there with
the stream open and see what other
people are doing but never actually
participate themselves so the question
now becomes really don't admit it
mark might be watching he's gonna take
your account offline you must
participate be part of yet it must be a
social person sorry suck sorry so the
operative question here and the reason
we're having this roundtable discussion
is to talk about whether we would use
Facebook home meaning whether we would
replace the launcher that we have right
now which probably contains stuff like a
link to your email link to your calendar
maybe a widget showing you twitter
updates or whatever if you want to
replace that with a completely immersive
facebook experience and I guess we'll
start off with Stephen I guess the bush
ever used even is this something that
would make you go back to Facebook you I
really can't see that happening from
what we've seen of Facebook home it's
impressive it's it's great that
someone's finally done something like
this I don't think it's going to be
enough to personally draw me back into
to everything that Facebook is I still
think it's an important piece of
software though because while the
alternate launchers have been available
for the longest time now it's kind of
been like a techie thing to do we
haven't seen a commercial company really
release a product like this that for a
mass appeal so even if you know I
personally are not going to be jumping
on the facebook-owned bandwagon here I
really am intrigued to see what other
companies do with it you know if we see
other social sites or just sharing sites
release their own spin on this I think
that could be really interesting yeah
and and that's a really good point we
were talking about earlier which is that
this can open up this new space of
launchers I mean the techies know that
for the longest time since the beginning
you've been able to replace your android
launcher when you hit the home button
what's happening on your phone is that
it's launching an application that is
your launcher and and you use your
launcher all the time people call it
your home screen or whatever and the
glorious thing about androids that you
can change your launcher now imagine
having a launcher from amazon or from
ESPN Oh label I mean autoroute
go broke yeah you should go you would go
broke but imagine if imagine event
amazon created a launcher where if you
have this thing on your home screen it
would send you deals or free things or
in exchange for using it you could get
like coupons for ten dollars off of your
mouth or something this facebook home
thing is opening up his possibility of
all of these different third-party
launchers beyond apex launcher a nova
launcher and an ADW and all those
awesome existing launchers will go back
to you Taylor do you see yourself as
using Facebook home for your full-time
launcher on your android phone probably
not as I said the first time around i
use facebook primarily for family and my
sister at a child last week and if it
weren't for facebook i probably wouldn't
have known that um because we just don't
stay in contact too closely and I don't
need a home screen dedicated to my
sister's awful as that may sound but but
if you had facebook home if you had
facebook home and your sister had the
baby you turn on your phone on the lock
screen you'd see this information well
I'd probably end up seeing something
else that we don't want to talk about my
friends post terrible pictures what do
you think I get but if there were you
like I said Google+ as a Google+ home I
would totally use it I wouldn't I star
when he was home I totally would you and
use a google plus home what about You
Jaime would you use a Facebook home or
even a google plus some what do you
think I'm definitely gonna try it um the
problem with facebook home would I think
it's a bold move just a Stephen I feel
that it's a full boob that Facebook is
doing I feel that the launcher is kind
of it's a different way of doing Android
there's no widgets here it's like a an
immediate launch or photos where you can
do messaging but I'm a little skeptical
first of all because the facebook
application has never been good on
Android oh yeah it's tough it's it's
always been terrible you don't know what
native did you notice how they went
native and you thought it would be asked
iOS but it's not it's still climbing no
it is still clunky and so I'm really
skeptical that this launcher is just
gonna be a clunky launcher so but I
guess my first thing would be I'm gonna
give it a try if it's good then I'll bet
it'll depend how smart is this is this
launcher because I have a thousand
people on my facebook but I don't want
to Steve farmville updates or photos of
their new farms or stuff like that I
want to see updates of people that I
really care about so it depends on how
smart this launcher is to know what I
want that's two and the third thing is
their messenger sucks it still sucks so
even if you get the bubbles it is still
something that I avoid because it's just
terrible it's just always clunky and
never updates on time it always forgets
to alert me and so therefore i'm more of
a whatsapp guy and so i don't know i'll
obviously give it a try but if on day
one it won't you know make my experience
with my galaxy note 2 any better than
i'm just ditching it that's the way it's
gonna be yeah something to mention about
messaging is that with facebook home
they integrate SMS and Facebook
messaging and facebook like just likes
to act as a facebook Messenger is like V
thing but it really isn't there's
there's whatsapp there's email there's I
message there's so many messaging
platforms that facebook is just just
another one in a sea of many um so I
guess I guess I just felt but I just
wanted to say basically for it to be
great like facebook wants it to be
you're gonna have to be your own curator
yeah you're gonna have to sit there and
sift through all the crap and hide it
from your newsfeed and then it will look
decent unless they have some
intelligence built in which I don't
think they do because I think like hi
May most people have stuff in their
stream that they don't care about and if
Facebook got smart and understanding
like what stuff you actually care about
and what stuff you don't and and they
kind of leave it up to the user like you
can easily unfriend there's an option to
hide things from your new stream but
most people don't want to do that
especially those of us who have had like
five years ago went gung-ho with
Facebook and added 500 friend
dear Aunt Sally who you've never even
met in your life for some reason you're
friends with her um if Facebook home had
some filtering ability that was better
than what you get in the app and I think
that would that would be compelling kind
of kind of like Pandora if if something
showed up on your cover feed and you
just gave it a thumbs down it doesn't
let that person know your thumbs down it
but it doesn't show up again that would
be something like that would be great
but they don't have that there's no
curation it is your newsfeed that was it
was on the video that I watched it's
just straight news feed yeah yeah I
think that there's something interesting
obviously facebook is very clear on
their demographic um that's the reason
why the HTC first is a cheap phone it's
it's a mid tiered a kind of an ironic
phone because you get a terrible camera
5 megapixels not ultrapixels 5
megapixels for a phone that you're
supposed to take photos with to show on
facebook um but you know it's clear that
Facebook is clear that what they want is
to tailor to teenagers and you know it's
obvious that they're gonna start there
sadly teenagers are more moving moving
into the iphone group than android or at
least that's my personal impression i
see more teenagers with iphones then
with android phone so it's gonna be kind
of interesting to see what goes on
because i'm not sure a teenager is gonna
be it's gonna want to be stuck on that
HTC first we keep hearing the teens are
moving away from the Dai phones aren't
cool anymore or not it's a it used to be
an aspirational advice expensive thing
that mom and dad only had then the
iphone came down in price and they left
the old model and they kept doing that
and I think that I I think you're right
Steve and I think now that they want the
galaxy s3 they want the they want the
HTC One they don't want the distinct an
iphone anymore and I can or jump this
okay gorilla case let's something time I
was saying earlier about Facebook being
clunky on Android we've only heard about
this coming too I mean the first maybe a
mid-range device but it's got you know a
modern ship on there and the bones would
be the phones we've heard that the app
is going to come out for our you know
talk to your phones from this year with
last year's it's ever going to be
available for the galaxy yes to what if
you don't have a relatively moderate
phone we never be able to use
you got a great man upgrade to the HTC
first but you gotta get the HTC one son
I mean I should be there marketing
message yet the HTC One soon again I
think that it's a very bold move from
facebook I I want to give it a try I I
will obviously give it a try but you
know it's not something that I'm gonna
forgive and wait for software update
it's either gonna be good or it's gonna
go back now they do have a rigorous
update schedule that's a monthly they
were saying every month is they have a
monthly update cycle for their apps the
Android app on facebook still sucks even
though it gets updated every month so i
don't really i don't i don't think that
that's really bad come hell yeah well
now i mean i agree to that sucks but who
knows so stuffy so i'm gonna i'm gonna
say a couple things and then we're going
to quickly talk about the HTC first and
then we're gonna wrap this up but we
want to keep it short so to answer to
answer my question about whether i would
use HTC home the answer is no because it
doesn't play to the way that i use my
phone I I use my phone as a tool as a
Productivity tool to get news and
information and do email and I need that
stuff front and center and I need
widgets to be front and center and I
need the versatility of the android home
screen to bring all of this stuff into
my launcher so that when i turn on my
phone boom email boom calendar facebook
is like a small portion of what i do on
my phone it's entertainment I don't want
entertainment on my phone but I could
definitely see people that would want
this front and center like the people
who whose lives are their friends
everything that they do is around their
friends my my wife's cousin 13 year old
girl she spends so much time on Facebook
I think it makes me cry because I just
think about all the time I think about
all the time should be spending reading
books or like doing chores for her
parents and um and it's just it's
ridiculous so sort of this 1990 okay we
need that we need to bring back
the 90s man yes we do those were good
years is good years they're forgotten so
they're not forgotten all right I'm
still listening to him to be party to go
hey send me that on Spotify sure no prob
but still good guys the wrapping things
up here we've got this new phone the HTC
first which I think it's gone under the
radar a little bit because we've all
been fantasizing about a 4.3 inch phone
that has a high resolution screen we're
at 720p and it's got the qualcomm
snapdragon 400 which as i recall is the
it's a dual-core chip so it's I think
it's the successor to the s4 vs for the
s4 vs 4 so it's not quite the s4 pro
it's probably a little bit weaker than
the s4 pro and of course the 600 and 800
are the best of the best so this is a
really fast phone and I'm kind of
thinking you take that phone you put
cyanogen mod 10 on it or even you take
the phone and you install apex launcher
so that Facebook home was gone you've
got a darn cool little phone what do you
guys think about the the first then the
voice isn't bad before 50 off-contract I
mean that's no Nexus 4 but that's a lot
better than you know galaxy s4 is
something or 50 not bad but here's
working I mean you can get a nexus 4 for
a lot less money yeah I know that there
are two things about this phone first of
all apparently you can turn off facebook
phone a facebook home and you can run
stock Android on this thing which is
interesting but you know you can it you
can turn it off really yeah apparently
you can obviously it's it's still it's
still in rumors but apparently you can
which is which is cool I mean it's a you
get stock Android on this thing but then
you've got the nexus 4 so it makes you
wonder I mean why are you gonna spend so
much money on this phone will you go for
a much cheaper better phone what
criticized the no te that the nexus 4 is
is 4.7 cuz I'm a so you got a good point
there what LTE and and also the phone
it's not that thin it's it's think it's
got soft touch plastic I think it's
going to be one of those phones it's
like yeah I feel so good in the hand
whereas the nexus 4 even though it's
cheaper and has a better processor I
don't think that's the most comfortable
yeah it's got a carbon fiber on the back
and then it's amazing there's the trash
now um as far as the chips that goes I
think the thing it's built on a smaller
nanaman nanometer process which means
it's a more fast or a faster more
efficient ship than like the s4 pro so
it's only dual cores but it's probably
faster as far not maybe clock speed but
its enemy it's gonna be fast and it's
it's only 720p res and it's it's it's
gonna be a good phone and if you can
turn off the facebook home thing and
just use it as like a sense 5 phone I
might be knocking on some doors to see
what's up I'm so stock it's totally
stock yeah I said you would have to hack
since fine on it oh snap I'd do that son
you know how we roll alright so we're
gonna we're gonna end this hangout here
we've got another hangout coming up 2
p.m. today pocket now live were you guys
who are watching and by the way thank
you for watching can come on and talk to
all of us and see what's up michael
fisher will be on Tony will be on uh who
else see you guys will be on Tommy nah

be me me up those other guys and Michael
will be here to answer your questions
and now follow these guys on social
network we've got Taylor at casper tech
follow him he demand we've got Stephen
Stephen shank he demand to what up and
then we've got high Maat Jaime Rivera
with an underscore in the middle and i
am brandon minimun like cinnamon minion
yeah listen listen just before we go
just one closing question for all for
you Brandon do you think that Mark
Zuckerberg made a point in that phone
shouldn't be about apps and instead
about people because yeah we do we do
want to can I in my opinion we do want
to connect with people yes true but
that's not the only thing I mean there's
life beyond facebook and i think that
when we grown up we've learned
you know there's life beyond facebook
can I stop you oh wait a second and the
last thing the last thing you forget the
second thing that I hated about that
phone is that apparently within those
software updates there will be ads on
Facebook home at some point yes when I
was getting too Zuckerberg can say it's
all about people but all this was about
this whole entire thing was how to get
ads straight on your home screen it's
pretty freaking smart exactly what it
was if I were a facebook an investor I'd
be pretty pretty excited by that news
totally but this is not about people
this is about ads on your whole money
it's about believers in it's about
Zuckerberg yeah but but what
philosophically jaime proposed a good
question and we ask ourselves this all
the time what should be the center of
your phone experience you've got android
which puts apps at the center you've got
windows phone which kind of tries to go
away from that and does information and
then of course iOS is is back to the
apps thing I don't know I i like apps i
I don't like going in and out of apps
constantly but there's really no better
way yet there's widgets but they don't
always work so good thing that there's
still potential in this industry to
actually innovate we're going to end
this hangout now we will see or I will
see and some other guys from pocket now
we'll see the rest of you in just a
couple of hours 2 p.m. eastern join us
for pocket now live gentlemen thank you
for joining joining us here and we'll be
getting an HTC first in for review very
soon yeah so the provider ciao yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
