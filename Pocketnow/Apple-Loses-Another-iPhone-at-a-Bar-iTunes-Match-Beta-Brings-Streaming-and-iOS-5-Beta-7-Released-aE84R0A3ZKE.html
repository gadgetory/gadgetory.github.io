never loses another iphone prototype at
a bar iOS 5 beta 7 gets released the
developers and I tuned match also got
released in beta and it includes
streaming all this and more coming up
right now hello everybody I'm hi Madame
iveta and welcome to the pocket now I
review the show we go through all this
week school and the not-so-cool inside
the world of Apple's iOS devices let's
talk this week off with a cool okay so I
debated whether to include this in the
cooler not so cool so bear with me here
it seems that Apple again has lost an
iPhone prototype in a tequila bar in San
Francisco and well rumors have it and
seen it's been reporting that Apple's
got the police crazy looking for their
invaluable device that they can't find
now we're going to tag this as a rumor
for now because first of all where are
the images of the device there's no
really rear confirmation that this is an
iphone or probably just anything it
could be anything there's no real
confirmation that it is an iPhone and
well this is what i hate about sending
zenith to do gizmodo's job if gizmodo
was there they would have found it
already now the biggest question is
what's this about iphone prototypes
being lost at a bar it seems like an
apple does this on purpose now now
speaking of iphone prototypes the front
panel of a code name and 90 for iphone
prototype was sleek recently but sadly
it's the spitting image of the current
generation iphone 4 no changes aside
from a small sensor hole at the top now
remember that the end 92 codename was
used for the rise and iphone so that
only leaves the end 93 coat open but
remember that back in February we were
covering of this n93 prototype which was
even talked by The Wall Street Journal
and they were mentioning that this would
be a smaller iPhone now the big question
is would this be a smaller nano iPhone
or would this be a slimmer than her
iPhone time will tell well iTunes Match
was recently released the developers in
itunes 10.5 beta 6.1 which is by the way
now 7 and there are good things and bad
things to talk about first of all it's
only available
developers in the United States and it's
in limited quantity so you guessed it I
was one of the ones that bit the dust
here but the really extremely cool thing
is that itunes match ends up screaming
content to both your iphone and mac even
if Apple didn't mention anything about
it now this is not like Pandora Spotify
where you can stream any content for
specific amount of money you can only
stream the music that you purchased but
think about it if you have an eight
gigabyte iphone 3gs or the feature
topped up iphone 4 that will apparently
only have a gigabytes of storage you can
pretty much go for the cheap iPhone pay
the 25 books of itunes match with it
which ends up being a bargain if you
only stream the content that you don't
have on your phone and you keep the rest
of the music on your phone kind of
really cool because you can actually
play the music or even downloaded from
the cloud from your iOS device you don't
really have to connect to itunes anymore
really cool now iOS 5 beta 7 was
recently released the developers and
aside from doing a couple of things for
iTunes Match rumors have it that it also
allows you to sync with in multiple
computers that you've approved with just
one itunes account so that's really nice
because in the past you can only sync
with one computer and period and well
exception that it brings a couple of bug
fixes now the newsstand developer kid
was also released so hopefully news 10
will be working in the future and it's
just it really interesting to see that
Apple is now being releasing their
Iowa's virgin just a week or two apart
so does the scene that Apple is moving
fast hopefully we will be getting the
gold master candidate soon and iOS 5 s
final release really soon and before we
head on over to the mat so cool news
rumors haven't that Apple will not be
releasing a 4-inch display for the next
generation iphone and so the honest with
you I'm actually kind of tired of these
rumors I mean some people say it will
some people say it won't I wish people
would just make up their minds and well
aside from that the Sprint employees
have just been receiving a memo from
their management telling them not to
speculate with customers about the
iphone 5 release now not speculate and
receiving a memo kind of means yeah we
will be received releasing a device
because if you don't really
you have plans on releasing anything why
would you send memos to people most
probably spring will be getting it and
hopefully getting it soon and well
decide with these are big news about 80
not being able to buy t-mobile because
the government blocked it we wonder if
Apple really got prepared for releasing
a t-mobile version of the iphone 5 or
iPhone 4s or whatever will be released
in the future time will tell okay so
that doesn't for the cool let's continue
on with the not so cool bad news
recently has comex working for apple and
comex came on record on this reddit
interview over the web and he talked
about his new gig at Apple and what we
could expect from the feature from him
and well it was just seriously being
direct saying no I'm not going to be
yelled breaking devices anymore I'm only
going to be working for apple and this
internship it looks like if it was love
at first sight when he got there so
sadly we've lost comex which was really
important for the jailbreak community
not sure if he passed on his tips to
anybody else he says he's expecting for
jailbreaks to continue because he is
interested on jailbreaking his device
but we're not really sure what to expect
from this in the future he did talk
about how much money he made in
donations from jailbreaking but
apparently it wasn't enough because he
simply chose to take the gig so sad news
for the jailbreak community comex is out
hopefully some other genius would come
out because hey man it's just one man
for how many trillion people in the
world somebody else has to come out
there and show some talent man that's it
for today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm Jaime to be better remember
to give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
