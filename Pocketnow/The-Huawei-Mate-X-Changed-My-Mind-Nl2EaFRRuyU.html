repeating the same thing that I don't
believe in multiple products that I
consider them to be a solution in search
of a problem but that was until I
actually had the chance to play with one
that happened to me yesterday I'm high
humidity out of a pocket now and I spent
some time with the huawei mate X
so perfect I was actually brief like
most people before the event we were
shown the product and I prepared a video
for it but the reason I didn't push it
live at the time is because we didn't
have all the information we didn't know
how much the product was going to cost
so I was gonna wait for the event to
push the video live and then we learned
that it was going to cost 23 hundred
euros I was like no I'm just not going
to make the video but yesterday I was
given the opportunity to play with it
for a little I was given the opportunity
to use it and I'm not trying to justify
the price in any way this is going back
to my thoughts originally of if these
foldable products or a solution in
search of a problem or not my experience
with the mate X was awesome but let's
begin with a few basics this device has
a 6.6 inch screen on the side a 6.38
screen on the other side and it unfolds
to an 8 inch display when open they're
calling this their huawei foldable full
view display and full view in all views
compared to the small screen and the
knotch screen on the Galaxy fold unfold
that it's just five point four
millimeters thin thinner than the iPad
pro and it's got this ergonomic
curvature for a firm grip that reminds
us of the Kindle Oasis it actually helps
you hold the product easily their
breakthrough really is their falconwing
hinge design which they claim as made of
around a hundred parts it's an outside
curvature which means that you can
actually truly fold the device the
problem when they fold through the
inside is you can't fully do so or it
has certain limitations and even when
you fold it completely the device is
still just 11 millimeters thick which is
nothing this is a 5g product it brings
the Vallon 5005 G chip was the cure in
1980 with quad 5g antennas it has 4.6
Inca bits and download speeds a 4500
milliamp hour battery it has a 55 watt
huawei super charger included meaning 30
minutes of charge will give you 85
percent battery and sadly these are all
the specifications we know so far
the focus functionality actually allows
for better selfies because if you think
about it there is no selfie camera it
actually
uses the primary cameras and it also has
this lead trick where you can actually
show a person the portrait photo you're
taking of them if you fold the device
it's actually really genius and then
there's also a fold cover case that
covers the second screen it gives you
access to the 6.6 inch display during
the process so here's the thing the
reason why my mind has changed so
dramatically about foldables is because
this device feels like a smartphone and
once you fold it completely it feels
like galaxy note 9 which in my opinion
is one of the best designs of last year
there's a button to unsnap it to allow
it to open at the bottom and it feels
dramatically solid the design in the
back looks very elegant and you only see
colors shifting when you're folding it
but it adapts afterwards
best of all I played with the software
and it feels finished there are no
stutters no issues the product folded
and adapted and extended and adapted
just fine
even if they were very clear that this
was an unfinished product overall I have
to admit the huawei mate X is probably
the coolest device that I saw at MWC
2019 again I'm not justifying the price
tag and I feel that companies really
need to drop it truly I get it this is
new technology there are a hundred parts
in the hinge and everything but the
price tag is seriously not realistic or
probably I'm just not the demographic
whatever the case may be I do find it to
be cool if the product can't feel like a
phone when I fold it and it can feel
like a tablet when I don't I feel that
that is the most genius approach to a
foldable but that's just me this is my
opinion let us know in the comments down
below what you think about the huawei
mate X and while you're at it make sure
