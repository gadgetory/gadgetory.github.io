rear-mounted controls and vibrant
flamenco red paint job the LG G flex 2
is one of the most distinctive Android
smartphones on the market today but it's
more than just a showboat it's also a
testbed for the newest silicon from
Qualcomm and for now it's LG's top-tier
smartphone I'm Michael Fisher let's find
out if the G flex 2 belongs in your
pocket now like it's 2013 4 runner the G
flex 2 is a boastful smart phone and not
just in terms of the person likely to
buy one from the 700 radius full HD P
OLED display - the curved 3000 milliamp
hour battery - the high-density advanced
self-healing coating on the back and the
chemically enhanced Gorilla Glass 3 on
the front this is LG showing off its
manufacturing prowess and it's an
incredibly effective showcase from the
second you pick it up while it's a
little light weight for my taste I still
find the G flex to one of the most
comfortable smartphones on the market
because it makes very smart use of its
curved construction while other phones
use flexible displays to enhance the
user interface LG focuses on making the
phone itself more ergonomic it hugs the
cheek during voice calls it conforms to
the palm during one-headed use it makes
movie watching and gaming ever so
slightly more immersive and as its
smaller than its predecessor it's also
more pocket-friendly the curve is
pronounced enough to make it perfect for
back pockets but not so pronounced as to
be uncomfortable in the front and if
you're worried about bending it with
your skinny jeans don't be true to its
name and its forerunner it flexes by
design when stressed combine the
curvature with the rear key which sits
right on the sweet spot for a finger and
the DoubleTap to unlock and lock feature
and you get a phone that's as fun to use
as it is to look at a rare double win in
a market that often makes you choose
between one or the other even the glossy
static cling dust magnet finish is
forgivable here because it needs to be
glossy to make its self-healing
technology
we'll cover that more thoroughly in a
future piece and the phone's high
technology isn't confined to the
exterior beneath the spent hairline
finish set two gigs of RAM on our demo
device a three gig model is also
available and you can choose between 16
or 32 gigs of storage with microSD
expansion up to 2 terabytes the real
star of the smartphone is one of the
world's newest processors Qualcomm's
64-bit 8 core Snapdragon 810 this is the
next generation of Qualcomm silicon and
based on reports we've seen around the
web its performance on big chunky
reference hardware is very good but like
fate miniaturization is a cruel mistress
within the confines of the G flex 2 the
Snapdragon 810 doesn't have as much
space to dissipate heat so some pretty
aggressive thermal throttling kicks in
that means the phone runs very slowly at
times now while there's been a lot of
back-and-forth in the press about the
severity of these temperature issues
that's too broad an issue to tackle in
this video all I can do is tell you what
it feels like to use this phone in the
real world and on our unit the answer is
not great the combination of the new
processor with Android lollipop means
there's more lag stutter and hesitation
in the G flex - it's not just animations
sometimes even a simple text-based
website is enough to slow the built-in
browser to a crawl and often that
performance lag goes hand-in-hand with a
big dive in battery life even at 1/2
screen brightness with no other apps
running in the task manager I once
watched the G flex 2 lose 20% battery in
less than an hour when I was doing
nothing more strenuous than reading a
newspaper website with almost no
graphics strenuous games like asphalt 8
do play smoothly but only once you close
other running apps first
these performance issues only get worse
if you're running an app like Spotify or
Google Maps Navigation in the background
on a budget device I might consider that
an acceptable trade-off on a very
expensive flagship I don't there's no
reason to think these problems can't be
solved in future hardware releases or
with improved software and in fact LG
has released this statement to that
effect so to be clear we will retest the
x2 in its North American trim when it
arrives but there are some specs which
won't be changing when it comes to
America so we'll use them to help decide
whether to recommend the phone as a
daily driver the five and a half inch
display is a market improvement over the
six inch panel of the first G flex with
full HD resolution and none of the
burnin issues that plagued the earlier
phone there's still a bit of a textured
quality to grays and whites they bear a
slightly modeled look that's been
compared to wet newspaper but it's much
better than it was on the first flex and
it's only noticeable in some lighting
conditions as I mentioned before using
the G flex 2 feels a lot like using the
g3 the stock keyboard is excellent with
a persistent number row adjustable
height and precise cursor positioning
knock code remains a pretty quick and
convenient way to secure the phone and I
still love the option to toss in a short
cut at the bottom to trigger the
notification shape glance view is new
with the G flex 2 just tap and drag on
the screen to display the time and your
notifications and it works well other
features are more disappointing dual
window is here again to let you run apps
side by side but its app compatibility
continues to lag behind Samsung's multi
window LG's smart notice personal
assistant still isn't as versatile or as
useful as Google now and you can also
switch over to Google messenger or your
SMS app of choice if you don't want to
put up with the comical graphics of the
stock offering but if you do you'll miss
out on the full window pop /
notifications whether that's a plus or
minus is up to you also familiar from
the g3 the camera the viewfinder is
almost identical and so is the hardware
an optically stabilized 13 megapixel
camera with laser assisted autofocus
jumping into the camera the snapshot is
as easy as holding down the volume key
and focus times are indeed very fast
thanks to that laser the results
produced are well pretty average the
autofocus is fast but it's not immune to
drifting a few of the outdoor photos I
took don't seem to have a defined focal
point possibly because blowing snow
confused the camera
most outside shots are nice enough
though with the kind of crisp detail and
high quality I expect from a high-end
smartphone camera in 2015 but saturation
is a little on the low side and that
problem gets much worse indoors this
fire extinguisher is much more red in
real life than the pinkish hue displayed
here same with the red LED on this
communicator which is so washed out as
to look almost white there's also quite
a bit of digital noise in medium to low
light if you do any zooming at all
most of these were shot at 10 megapixels
with wide screen settings but even
amping it up to the 13 megapixel maximum
that strange oil paint look just doesn't
go away LG makes much more noise about
the 2 megapixel front-facing camera here
shooting selfies with a fist pump is now
easier to do and it's also easier to
immediately review the results you just
bring the phone closer to your face or
down to chest level and it'll
automatically jump into the gallery the
pictures themselves suffer from the same
processing distortion as the main shot
but they're certainly serviceable as far
as selfies go with a wide enough frame
to fit all your friends in and a beauty
face slider to tame your acne or
overgrown facial hair while sort of
making you look like a wax figure aim
finally let's get the phone out of our
face and up to our ear testing it on
t-mobile us over the course of six days
in the Greater Boston area
I found voice quality on par with the
competition and also got no complaints
about the way I sounded from the other
side again the curved construction makes
talking of the G flex 2 more comfortable
more natural to those old schoolers who
grew up with banana phones the
speakerphone is unfortunately hidden
away around back and not as loud as some
I've tested but it's loud enough for the
occasional call game or YouTube video
and the included quad beat 2 earbuds
offer pretty nice sound for an inbox
headset if you want to privately listen
to your media instead
so the G flex 2 comes home with a
somewhat mixed report card it utterly
dominates as a showboat
there's no smartphone that combines
great looks with a comfortable build and
innovative materials like this but as a
showcase for the Snapdragon 810 it
stumbles no doubt due to that very ship
it throttles itself very quickly and
very often and the resulting lag is
frankly very frustrating for such a very
expensive device so as a daily driver
it's only half recommendable at this
point we'll let you know if that changes
in a follow up video review when the
u.s. versions land hopefully later this
season if you're looking for details on
