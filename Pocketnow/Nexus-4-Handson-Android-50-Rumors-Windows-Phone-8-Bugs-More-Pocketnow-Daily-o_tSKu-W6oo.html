8.9 and nexus for android 5.1 and why is
Windows Phone neighbor setting itself
constantly I'm hi madam ivetta back
after a crazy weekend this time for good
and this is out daily now
Amazon's attempt for world domination in
the tablet space continues even though
they leave their flagship products for
last minute and then launch them
silently such as the case of the amazon
kindle fire HD 8.9 I hate that long name
but it's now available in the store in
our review unit has just arrived so far
our impressions are quite good even
though this is just a larger version of
the Kindle Fire HD 7 with another long
name that we already seen before make
sure you watch Brandon's video in full
details and expect our for you coming
soon speaking of launches after one of
the most cumbersome experiences ever
pre-ordering a device our LG Nexus force
finally in the pocket now labs and well
Brandon took the time to give you a full
walkthrough with the unboxing and first
impressions the device is great a lot of
the things that we expect that are there
but obviously I think it's best if you
catch this video in the links and then
obviously wait for our full review which
is coming very soon speaking of Nexus
devices even though Android 4.2 is
barely reached the Nexus 7 and some GSM
Galaxy Nexus devices that don't include
mine aside from the nexus for the Nexus
10 obviously we've already been hearing
rumors of android 5.0 being tested on a
sony device that's a cousin to the
Xperia T though sadly there are no other
details from this we don't know how the
benchmark came out but hopefully project
butter is now going to be called project
milk or something like that we'll see
eventually now let's talk iphone
everybody complain to the past about
apple taking too long to refresh their
iOS products once a year and now
everybody's complaining about the fact
that the ipad 4 is barely eight months
older than the ipad 3 will understand
some people but now it seems that apple
is already working on the iphone 5s to
be tested this holiday season and be
launched early next year and I wonder
how Apple plans to pull that off if
they're barely able to meet the man's
with the iphone 5 and I wonder what
comes
with the iphone 5s also and finally for
the weird news of the day even though
Windows Phone has always been
characterized as being a very reliable
and smooth operating system people are
already complaining about Windows Phone
8 randomly resetting itself out of the
blue and Microsoft is still not figured
it out they haven't still detected why
it happens but that leads it to the
question of the day are you having
resetting issues with your windows phone
8 device why are you simply on Android
and iOS my nokia lumia 920 is still not
here but leave us a comment down below
now if you want an early or scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet well make sure you
follow us on parking now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm high never be better
thanks for watching
