special edition of the oneplus 60 in the
next few days we get some CAD renders of
the sony xperia x z 4 which will be
sony's first triple camera phone
it looks like Microsoft will be
refreshing the surface keyboard in the
design of the tablet finally I'm high
metal Iveta and but I go through the air
like a spaniel for those of you that
speak Spanish don't forget about the
giveaways in the Spanish Channel
this is parking out daily sponsored by
swap up the official news today begin
with things that Apple should have done
a long time ago I mean I've always
complain about trade-in programs for the
Apple because they give you very little
money but clearly because the 10 are and
the 10s aren't selling very well the
company is now giving you $100 more for
your tradin it starts with the iPhone 6
you can't trade in an iPhone 8 8 + or 10
but yeah you get $100 more depending on
the condition of your product you learn
more about the list and the money in the
description now let's talk about project
5 which is now being dubbed Google Phi
it's no longer a project that's now an
official product and even if the money
doesn't change and the plans and
everything the benefits are still there
and the cool part is that a ton of
phones are now being supported including
iPhones including Sony phones
essential-1 plus devices Samsung there's
a full list for this in the description
I am a huge project Phi customer so I'm
liking this now let's talk about
Microsoft as one of the biggest
complaints about products like the
surface pro is the fact that it still
uses USB 8 it still looks like if it was
from four years ago because that's how
old the design is and well there's
really no innovation in the hardware
there are some patents where that's
gonna change it's gonna get slimmer the
track ten of the design of the keyboard
is apparently gonna change what are we
getting this we don't know but it mimics
a lot of what we see what the surface go
only slimmer just great that was will
the spotlight over to Sony as a yes I
still have a sony xperia x z 3 there for
review I'll get to it soon I mean we've
been trying to get done with these
reviews for a while but now we see the X
Z for the companies being very
aggressive about their launches I mean
this year we've had the XZ 2 XE 2
premium XZ 3 XE for is triple cameras
according to the cat renders no notch
headphone jack but a larger display yeah
I mean Sony seems to be finally waking
up and smelling the coffee of design and
finally the hottest news today I have to
do with oneplus and the new special
edition for the 60 I mean we've seen
special editions in the past for Star
Wars for example they're different color
options but now we've got the company
partnering with McLaren in a salute to
speed according to the slogan set your
calendars for December 11th apparently
we're not just getting a different coat
of paint there seems to be something
different about this phone and I'm
really curious to see what let us know
in the comments down below what do you
expect to change for this phone do you
expect that to just be another coat of
paint as most people believe or do you
think that it's gonna be something
different I think that this is a good
opportunity for one plus to show us
something new but that's just me leave
