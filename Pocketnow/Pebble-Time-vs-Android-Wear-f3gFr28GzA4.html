to smartwatches the basic principle is
to bring notifications from your phone
to your wrist but of course like
everything else in this industry it's
not that simple
I'm hi out to use them in the pocket now
and let's compare pebbles timeline you I
found on the pebble time against Android
wear let's start with the basics Android
wear is powered by Google and runs off
of a backlit touchscreen interface with
additional input methods like voice
commands and hardware buttons depending
on the manufacturer its UI is based on
Google's material design with bright and
colorful cards for writing information
like weather stocks and fitness along
with notifications from your phone there
are plenty of Android wear offerings to
choose from so if my motor 360 isn't
your style you can pick up a ZEM watch
or an LG watch urbane instead switching
over to pebble timeline UI is a complete
rethinking of the philosophy of a
SmartWatch shifting from notification
portal to personal assistant you'll
still receive notifications on your
wrist of course but a large focus is
placed on scheduling pressing the up or
down buttons will bring up a
chronological breakdown of upcoming and
past events and show important
information for the day like the weather
and time of sunset right now timeline UI
is only available for the pebble time
and pebble time steel but it'll make its
way to older models soon so you won't
have to spend money to upgrade just for
the experience
pebbles timeline UI and all of the
corresponding hardware are known for
outstanding battery life getting up to a
full week and sometimes even more on a
single charge
that's something the Android wear just
can't match with most watches seeing a
day of use at most most of that can be
pinned on the touchscreen displays which
are considerably larger battery drain
versus the egotist on pebbles on the
other hand there's so much more that you
can do with that touchscreen display the
pebble has four buttons and is therefore
limited to only four input options
excluding the microphone but Android
wear can handle input from anywhere on
the screen meaning effortless scrolling
and easier navigation through multi
directional menus then again take both
watches into water and that fancy
touchscreen is rendered useless while
the pebbles physical buttons remain
fully functional there's also the
ecosystem of each platform both pebble
and Android wear have well established
at Marc
with hundreds if not thousands of watch
faces and apps to choose from pebble has
an edge in number thanks to its longer
tenure in the field and the quality of
apps for both platforms is pretty good
I found the watch faces for pebble more
playful and they always on eating
display means you can actually enjoy
them for longer than a few seconds
without having to worry about battery
drain when it comes to the apps
themselves both pebble and Android wear
largely focused on augmenting your
smartphone with media controls and
settings toggles and there are quite a
few games on each as well then there's a
small and annoying nuances things like
Android wears more than an occasional
lag though in my case that could be
pinned on the older hardware at the Moto
360 or how timeline UI doesn't
automatically dismiss some applications
on my watch when I view them on my phone
the way Android wear does I wish both
platforms were less animation heavy and
that's especially the case on timeline
UI where you can't even skip or
interrupt the animations and it gets to
be tedious when you're just trying to
quickly scroll through a menu but then
again the animations make timeline UI
charming it's a little cutesy for some
people sure but I think most users would
rather see too many animations than
endure a lifeless device without
transitions I've come to really enjoy
both platforms but battery life
notwithstanding I think Android wear
makes more sense for most people using
an Android phone pebble has some great
offerings in its Timeline UI and the app
ecosystem is larger than that of Android
wear but unlike other modern
smartwatches
using a pebble just doesn't feel all
that futuristic anymore maybe it's the
hardware buttons and the display of
yesteryear maybe it's the sort of retro
chic design of the interface and even of
the pebble time itself none of this is
to say that timeline UI isn't worth
while your time and in fact if you don't
mind operating the watch entirely with
physical buttons the trade-off and
battery life might make a pebble of a
better buy for you but like Michael
Fisher I've just become accustomed to
putting my Moto 360 on the charger at
the end of every night
with all things considered I think I'll
probably stick with Android wear for a
little while longer if you enjoyed this
