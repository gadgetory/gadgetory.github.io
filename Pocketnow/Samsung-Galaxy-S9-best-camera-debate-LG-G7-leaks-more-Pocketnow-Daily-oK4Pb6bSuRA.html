considered the best smartphone camera
only to try to be debunked by another
publication those of you waiting for the
new Nokia's to arrive in the United
States might be limited to a few options
let's see that the LG G 7 was showcased
privately here at MWC I'm Jaime Rivera
the show floor is wrapping up this is
actually the last day but we've got more
videos coming up this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
IPOs as Spotify has filed its own the
company is evaluating itself at 1
billion dollars and it claims to have
double the subscribers of Apple music is
that true or not I guess it is and I
have to say I mean Spotify is
significantly superior at least in my
opinion but hey I would love to know
what you think in the comments now let's
talk about the LG g 7 obviously we were
disappointed because we didn't get
anything but it be 30s Plus think you
hear at MWC but it turns out that
apparently LG's G sevens were showcased
privately to somebody else not us and it
seems that there's a notch involved in
this design I hope that that's not the
case it seems the code name is neo we
should expect something probably in the
summer I hope that is going to be the
case as LG needs to get back on track
now for those of you that have been
wowed with Nokia it's great sales last
year and it's product offerings like the
8 Sirocco and the Seven Plus this year
well it turns out that the United States
is not going to get these units
apparently it seems that the company is
only planning to launch the update at 6
and that is going to be it
that's really sad Nokia please get us
something else now let's move the
spotlight over to the samsung galaxy s 9
and s 9 plus as display made has just
brought its verdict it considers the
galaxy as 9 to be the best display in
the market and you know what of course
it is display made I mean I've seriously
been using this phone for I don't know
ever since after the launch and
obviously Samsung leaves its best for
its own the display is gorgeous and it
says that it's only first over the
iPhone 10
I would highly suggest that there's
actually a significant difference not
saying the iPhone census plays bad it's
just Samsung makes gorgeous displays and
obviously it also makes the iPhone
display and finally the very interesting
news today have to do with an email I
got this morning from the XO mark
claiming that the Samsung Galaxy has
nine plus is the best smartphone camera
in the market rating it at ninety nine
going over the pixel to at ninety eight
and going over the iPhone ten and Huawei
May 10 Pro at 97 the most interesting
part is that a couple of hours later
Consumer Reports comes over and says
that know that the iPhone 10 is the best
smartphone camera and this is just funny
because obviously these companies have
their own tests I would like to know in
the comments what you think what would
you consider to be the best smartphone
camera because you could sit down with
any of us in any podcast in all of us I
mean listen to our mobile tech podcast
the one we recorded yesterday the Google
pixel to excel and most of the
industry's opinion is the best
smartphone and these are this is not
coming from guys that you know we just
play with the phone for a week and then
we put it down and go back to our
iPhones no we actually actually use a
pixel to excel by choice because of its
camera and I have every other phone to
choose from but we would love to know
your opinion and the comments down below
