editor here at pocketnow.com with a
browser comparison for you on the
blackberry storm and the HTC touch pro
or in this case the AT&amp;amp;T fuze so let's
go ahead and get started tilt the camera
down here to you guys can see I've got
the backlight turned down pretty far on
both and they are queued up to
everyone's favorite pocketnow.com so
let's start right here with the HTC
touch pro so this uses a resistive
screen meaning it's makes the connection
from two layers pushing together kind of
like that so you feel a little bit
squishy but let's take a look notice it
rendered the website in full HTML just
as it will look on your computer and get
the ability to scroll around nice and
easily with your finger find something
that you want to see can double tap and
you'll zoom right in and I said it's
scaled itself right for the window which
is really nice automatically will just
text and very easy to pan around
double-click will zoom you right back
out most your navigation is done from
this little arrow right here it looks
like in a jet button almost if you go
ahead and click that pulls up all your
menu you can go back there's a star push
it again right there stars are your
favorites it is full tab browsing that
right they will show you where you are
and pull up your main menu bar up top
and this right here will go to your
settings downloads page info history
saved pages and help I really do like
the tab browsing experience I think it's
really very helpful you can scroll
around here again on any page at your
app and it really is a very seamless
experience and the HTML rendering is
quite fantastic so let's take a look now
at the blackberry storm and here we are
again now on the pocket now homepage you
know it's sort of gaming the ability to
scroll around but not by much and
actually didn't render the website
correctly which is uh quite surprising
see it one more shot let's refresh it
one more time here will go to pocket now
calm this is actually a pretty common
problem with the blackberry storm the
browser does render pages in full HTML
and it's supposed to be just as
fully capable as the HTC touch pro which
I should mention is running opera mobile
9.5 it does ship with pocket internet
explorer but it does not use as a
primary browser fortunately opera mobile
is far superior so we're going to give
the blackberry storm another shot to
load paw canal and there it goes so it
is now letting me scroll around which is
very nice and it's showing everything in
one column now just like the touch pro
if you want to zoom in you can double
tap the screen and I didn't push the
screen actually in like I did right
there I just double-tapped on the
outside of it using its capacitive
touchscreen which means it's use it
makes its reactions from transfer of
electrons on the glass surface now
notice it zoomed in but it did not scale
itself like the touch pro did you have
to pan around to read the text a little
bit on the annoying side this much to my
chagrin does not have tabbed browsing
you've got a menu right here which pulls
up your website you most viewed and
which ones you want to go to this right
here will change your view from column
to full web pages this little arrow here
will replace almost your finger with a
little bit of cursors you probably can't
see it there's a curse you're falling
around my finger helps me select items
and you can zoom in and out like I
mentioned with your finger or you can
use these little plus and minus arrows
right there to make your zoom in just a
little bit easier I find tapping to be
much easier if that's what I'm used to
but you may prefer something different
and you can find a format that works
really nice for you you can see panning
is relatively easy this is definitely
the most fully featured browser that
BlackBerry's ever put out even more
fully future than that found on the
blackberry bold so I did give them
credit for moving forward with their
browser it certainly is a step in the
right direction and a step forward from
I suppose where they where they were so
let's go ahead and compare the two now
and I'll give you guys my take on it so
I'm loading up pocket now again here on
the touch pro and there it is and just
looking at the two even back on the
homes
in here zooming out is sometimes a pain
it does always register double taps go
back here even just looking at both
pages you can see that the HTC touch pro
and opera mobile 9.5 really make it much
easier to use mobile browsing experience
I've really enjoyed using actually opera
mobile 9.5 and recommend anybody who has
a windows mobile phone go ahead and give
it a download certainly worth it it does
handle javascript perfectly and it does
handle some flash content but you cannot
view youtube videos unfortunately on
either devices although the HTC touch
pro does come with a integrated YouTube
player low it is a little bit hidden
flick scrolling on each can certainly do
find your finger keep scrolling on the
blackberry storm it'll scroll as long as
your fingers on the page so it really is
a personal preference there move the
camera back up here so if I had to
choose one that browse that I prefer
hands down has to be Opera Mobile 9.5
especially optimized for the touch pro
everything works perfectly at the
accelerometer to you can rotate it it's
all right there everything works turn it
back recognize everything really quickly
and easily and it makes for a seamless
PC like browsing experience so in
conclusion if you have to pick a 2 when
browsing experiences your big
determinant stick with Windows Mobile
stick with opera mobile 9.5 you will not
be disappointed so guys i'm jon
rettinger and guest editor here for
pocketnow.com hope you enjoy it i'll see
you the next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
