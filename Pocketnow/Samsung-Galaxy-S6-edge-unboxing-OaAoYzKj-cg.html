and the trend continues with Samsung's
latest dual edged phablet the galaxy s6
edge+ I'm high out so huge from the
pocket now and let's take a look at what
comes in the box if you watched our
unboxing of the galaxy note 5 from
earlier today then you're already pretty
familiar with the packaging here Samsung
is staying fairly modest in its
presentation with the symbol box naming
the phone and storage option and giving
a handy list of specs around back of
course less modest is the phone hiding
underneath the box which we'll get to in
just a minute
setting the phone aside reveals some
paperwork including a welcome guide
warranty info and information on some of
the other products Samsung has to offer
there's also a sim ejector tool which
will help insert a nano SIM card and a
few accessories for the phone namely the
adaptive fast charger micro USB cable
and Samsung branded headphones
moving back to the s6 edge+ and freeing
it from its protective film the design
is remarkably similar to the s6 edge
proper in fact the larger size is just
about the only difference the SX edge+
shares the same Exynos 7420 chipset as
its smaller sibling but it does upgrade
the RAM from 3 to 4 gigabytes and the
bump up to a 5.7 inch display puts it in
line with the galaxy note 5 unlike the
note 5 there's no S Pen on the s6 edge+
but Samsung has added a p-- edge a new
feature that follows the lines of people
edge and gives you quick access to up to
five of your favorite apps there's a lot
to love about the galaxy s6 edge+
and we'll be testing it over the coming
weeks to find out if it's worth your
money
like the galaxy note5 michael fisher
will be doing our full review on the
galaxy s6 edge+
