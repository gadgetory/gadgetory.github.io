from our friends at Nokia and AT&amp;amp;T and
inside is the first Nokia tablet to hit
the market in quite a while and the
first one I've ever laid hands on
personally I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow let's unbox the Lumia 2520
from Nokia inside the satchel we find a
very familiar sight the AT&amp;amp;T carrier
packaging kind of no frills here the
product name on the bottom we'll flip it
over it's pretty heavy box
there's the Lumia 1020 edge the Lumia
2520 rendered in the back in black silk
the only color currently available for
18 t believe Verizon is gonna have the
red one just go ahead and pop the cover
off here very exciting one of our only
tablet unboxings featuring an AT&amp;amp;T
package and as we said in the intro our
first nokia tablet in quite some time my
first one personally very cool Quick
Start Guide a little notification
letting you know that Microsoft Office
and Outlook are free and preloaded on
this tablet makes sense because it runs
Windows 8.1 RT as the nokia side puts it
go ahead and pull up the tablet tab here
here's the device itself in a nice pouch
keeping it safe from the elements we put
it aside while we see what else is in
the box usual corrugated cardboard here
alright I'm clumsy
alright nothing else in the box itself
what's included in this packaging look
at this big old power charger this may
have something to do get a little
tighter strap this may have something to
do with an interesting charging
capability of this device which allows
it to charge up to 80% in an hour
presumably from full empty so that is
awesome I'm looking forward to trying
that out because he hate running out of
power not much to the rest of the
packaging have just got a sim removal
tool welcome to Windows and the warranty
guide product and safety information to
assist you in not exploding while you
use the tablet and removing the tablet
from its protective enclosure
gives us our first view of the product
as we expected the tablet is all black
silk black 8.9 millimeters thick big old
screen protector on the front why don't
we go ahead and take it off there very
nice so just taking a closer look at the
corner here we can see some of the
interesting things that that Nokia has
decided to do with the hardware here
these volume keys the volume and power
standby buttons are basically taken
right from their existing Lumia
smartphone line they feel like metal
they're cold to the touch they have a
really nice feedback to them this is a
six point seven megapixel Carl Zeiss
lens I believe as well as there's your
NFC tap target this material is not
quite soft touch it's not quite as gummy
as all that but it's definitely not
smooth and not glossy feels quite
premium actually we accidentally hit the
power button while we were messing
around there so we'll take it out
already got some fingerprints on the top
of the screen there unfortunately
here is our Windows 8.1 Start screen so
we're gonna check that out in our first
impressions video which I'll tell you a
little bit more about at the end of this
video it's at the power standby button
let's get used to where it is flip this
back over this is by the way a 10.1 inch
display at 1080p which is pretty awesome
8,000 milliamp hour battery within the
device here there is a 32 gigs of
on-board storage the whole thing is
powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
under the hood
so there it is just a quick tour of the
Nokia Lumia 2520 and here's some more
details on the coverage we have planned
for you over the next few days folks if
this kind of thing is right up your
alley we have another video for you our
first impressions video after a day
spent with the Lumia 2520 go check that
out is available at pocket now and here
on youtube right now be sure and like us
before you go anywhere though like this
video subscribe to our youtube channel

again follow us on social media and stay
tuned for our full Lumia 2520 review and
the usual array of comparisons coming
