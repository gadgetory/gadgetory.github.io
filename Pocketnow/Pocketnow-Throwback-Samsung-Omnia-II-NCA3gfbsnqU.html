pocketnow.com and this is another pocket
knife throwback with the samsung omnia 2
let's get to it so previously we did a
thorough back with the HTC touch
diamond2 touch and aemond was and sort
of still is a very important device in
defining smart phone history it really
brought to the forefront touch friendly
interfaces that were previously
characterized by stylus input the iPhone
came around it changed everything it
showed the world that you don't need a
stylus to operate a phone we started to
see a shift away from the stylus into
touch friendly operation so this was
about this came out in about June 2008
and then the omnia 2 came out about a
year later in June 2009 then the Verizon
version hit in about December 2009 which
is funny to think that just about three
months ago or so when it was December
2010 this device which you're gonna see
feels very old had come out just one
year before kind of amazing so this
device was very important because it
showed off the best that Samsung had to
offer in the smartphone area this is
before they had the Galaxy S smartphones
this is before they really got into
Android and so they put their best
effort forward to customize this
interface to do some interesting things
with Windows Mobile so let's talk about
the device and sort of the
characteristics of it we've got an
AMOLED screen here of course Samsung has
been leading the pack in doing Super
AMOLED Super AMOLED plus and started
with the omnia here when they did the
AMOLED screen which was just beautiful
in comparison to the standard LCD we
were seeing on other devices so the
resolution is 800 down by 480 across
it's a resistive touch screen of course
so again if we tilt it in the light just
too right you can actually see the
screen press in see if we can get it
there we go you can kind of see it's a
little bit mushy so it's not as
sensitive as a capacitive screen inside
we've got an 800 megahertz processor
with 256 megabytes of RAM that was
actually pretty impressive and then back
in 2009 the Qualcomm Snapdragon 1
gigahertz didn't make it to the scene
yet
and so 800 megahertz was fast for a
smartphone now when we reviewed this
phone we reviewed both the Verizon
version here and also the European
version we thought it was pretty thin
but while taking it out of the box this
thing is a tank in fact let's compare it
to one of Samsung's thinnest devices the
captivate Wow it almost seems 2 times as
thick it's quite remarkable let's go
around the hardware here we've got a
strangely placed 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the left side of the
device got a volume up and down rocker
this looks to be a dedicated ok button
of course Windows Mobile allows you to
program various buttons on the bottom we
have a microphone on this side we have a
dual action camera button with a lock
button that would lock the screen plus a
port for microUSB which is great Samsung
Samsung start to move away from the mini
USB to the microUSB also on the front
we've got these buttons that are very
reminiscent of the first omnia the first
omnia was a huge seller that you might
remember the samsung omnia and we've
also got a proximity sensor and a light
sensor there at the top and on the back
we have this really cool red design
which is was different from the European
version they kind of spurts this up a
little bit when they brought it to the
US got a 5 megapixel camera can do 420 p
video or actually 480p sort of they call
it a DVD quality not really HD plus a
flash which was pretty unique for a
device like this if we pop off the back
battery cover we will get if we can take
it off here you'll see the micro SD port
there so you can put some expandable
memory in there so let's turn on the
omnia 2 and talk about the software
offering that that they offered here
so when press the lock device or the
lock button here we're gonna do a slide
to unlock and this is one of the first
windows mobile phones to do a sort of
unlock mechanism like this and I'm not
even sure how this works touch to unlock
ok there so now now Samsung what they
tried to do here is emulate Android a
little bit and it's kind of funny how
poorly the execution was carried out so
we've got multiple home screens here and
of course Windows Mobile wasn't really
intended to have multiple
homescreens you know we have touchflo 3d
which sort of brings that idea to the
table but in a totally different way
Windows Mobile had the today's screen
which was just a screen with information
your next appointment
so HTC innovated on that today's screen
and so did Samsung although Samsung did
sort of a poor job at it
in terms of performance and here's the
lockscreen again there we go so what we
have here are three home screens it's
really choppy to move between them and
it this the phone's not even responsive
it seems that there's a delay after
doing everything as you can see here
that has to do with probably the process
or the software and the sensitivity of
the screen but it was cool to see how we
could actually add widgets and by the
way I'm going to use my finger for all
the input because the stylus that came
with the omnia was a little appendage
that you had to dangle off the edge of
the the little lanyard loop so here we
can add a variety of widgets and let's
go through these NC we have the widget
manager we have the time you can slide
these over again this was really cool
back in the day to be able to add these
widgets and customize your home screens
but now of course we have Android which
lets you do that to a very full extent
going down we have shortcuts new message
music player being early days of being
there weather bug myspace Facebook so I
mean what you can do here is take them
drag them and maybe even slide them to
other screens you couldn't even do that
actually you would have to slide over to
another screen like so open up the app
drawer again slide it over and and land
it on the home screen so here we've got
what looks to be a little gallery so you
can flip through pictures and so on and
so forth so this interface was kind of
clunky not that usable there weren't
that many good widgets and there was the
promise that developers third-party
developers could add their own widgets
they never really did okay so let's talk
more about what we have here
here is the cube and this is where
Samsung probably went to a conference
room and said let's do something awesome
with the graphics but hey if it's not
usable that's okay this cube thing is
indeed cool and it's shows off the the
processor and the GPU well but it's
totally unusable why would you ever want
to use this cube
in our testing of this phone we found
this to be the most useless thing
imaginable because no one's gonna take
the time to go into this cube thing spin
around a 3d looking figure just to land
on one of these things randomly only to
open it it might not even be the thing
you want to open so again this is sort
of like a task switcher if we tap on the
globe it spins around and we get some
shortcuts some cover flow of websites
right I mean this is this is not the
most efficient workflow if you're using
your phone so that was the cube now if
we went into the Start menu and by the
way this is running windows mobile 6.5
we've got Samsung's sort of customized
menu system here so again we can swipe
and once again when you swipe there's a
delay swipe it moves swipe it moves it's
not instant like phones of today and
we've got a lot of applications here
let's go into the web and see what it
was like they included the Opera browser
because of course pocket Internet
Explorer just didn't cut it and because
again this is a resistive touch screen
you're not gonna be able to pinch to
zoom or do any of those fancy things
that you can on phones of today so let's
see we're gonna try to enter an address
here we get swipe on the screen which is
a nice keyboard a little bit difficult
to use on a resistive screen because you
got to apply a little bit more pressure
than usual
so here pocket now is going to load this
has an accelerometer so we can jump into
landscape eventually and so it's going
to load up or over Wi-Fi right now and
we'll see we'll see how it does
so we're gonna stop it right there it's
been about 45 seconds I cut back in on
the video here and it's gonna finish
loading so let's move around on the page
see what scrolling is like not too bad
actually we get some checker boards
there it's trying to reload certain
elements of the page but I mean this was
pretty good web browsing for the day and
although you can't really see it on the
video the super-mo web screen looks
pretty darn good it's not even close to
a Super AMOLED the Samsung has today but
compared to the LCDs of 2009 the the
AMOLED was definitely something to write
home about so let's go back to the main
screens here and this should actually
work in landscape let's see no no it
doesn't work in landscape okay so let's
see what happens when we press this
button that should just take us to our
program list and so we can against white
side to side there are some things down
here like the task switcher so Windows
Mobile could multitask right but they
wanted to add a new interface for
multitasking sort of these live previews
let me show you how that works
if we open up another program let's say
we open up Bing let's go back to this
the program list alarms and let's open
up something else my files okay and now
we'll go back to the test switcher we
should see a bunch of programs open
there we go with live previews this was
really cool and then you can kind of
switch between your programs from there
you get this animation I mean this was
again really cool stuff for the day and
then we can go down here to edit we can
rearrange the items in the program list
is very customizable very cool this is
how you access settings and then you get
this interesting sort of almost Motorola
Xoom like honeycomb interface with the
blue and sort of the fluorescent look
and from here we can change all of the
settings on the phone most people
couldn't tell that this was legacy
Windows Mobile I mean Samsung skinned
this so heavily that it became
unrecognizable let's see what else we
have in here so we have the Microsoft
Office suite File Explorer you get the
point so to wrap things up Samsung is
really on the cutting edge of UI design
back in 2009 they were competing with
HTC to try to make an awesome interface
before they really had adopted Android
and they they used Windows Mobile as
their platform and even though Windows
Mobile is relatively restricted and what
you can do at the end of the day they
skin the heck out of it to make it look
like almost android looks today
in a lot of ways which is really
commendable and very interesting to see
