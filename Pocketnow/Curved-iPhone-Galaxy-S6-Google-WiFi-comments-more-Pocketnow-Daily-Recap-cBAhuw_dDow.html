don't you just listen faster I mean can
you use your wizard powers to get Samson
to make the s6 do its stock Android and
I think that's a job for iron man AKA
michael fisher wait when did you become
gray and these are just my natural
highlights man that's right it's that
time of the week i am hi natalie then
this is pocket now and this is the
bargain out daily recap for last week so
on monday asks you if you consider the
galaxy s6 to be a success as the company
is sold 45 million units and a quarter
we have 800 1 comments out of which
Joshua says regardless of what the sales
say Samsung makes better phones then
Apple any day in my opinion I'm glad
that's your opinion man then another
commoner says so now it seems apparent
that copying iphone 6 design help
Samsung sell more s sixes then s5 well
that's not going to last long and yeah
it did look like a quick copy but there
were some cool things about this samsung
phone you don't see in the iphone and
I'm not being sarcastic the Naboo says I
don't think it is I live in New York
City and I can't leave my house without
seeing an iphone 6 or 6 plus the same
can't be said about the galaxy s6 or
galaxy s6 edge you have to remember that
the iPhone 6 has been in the market for
far longer than the galaxy s6 so it's
really hard to measure the galaxy s6
right now when it comes to user adoption
then on Tuesday ask you if you prefer a
capacitive keys or hardware buttons as
the rumors are that Apple is about to do
away with the home button we have 705
comments out of which one of them says I
prefer software keys they can have more
functionality and I do agree with you
that's the whole reason why the iPhone
revolutionized things but we're actually
talking about the home button and still
there you do have a point and andrea
says no buttons at all the photo should
be controlled by gestures or at least
software buttons hardware buns just make
large devices less comfortable to
operate i'm looking at you iphone
six-plus and i do agree with you it just
adds more bezel which is extremely
uncomfortable and reduce says having for
such function as a home button seems
more like a cumbersome gimmick then
useful feature i prefer physical buttons
for that and you have a solid point here
particularly force touch I hate it on
the Apple watch because it's extremely
unreliable you have to like really force
such a display and that could just lead
to a very
comfortable experience for something
like the home but which you're using all
the time on once they asked you if you
would care about project fine more if
Google would give you free Wi-Fi in
cities as a that's the rumor that is
going to happen apparently google is
working on that in New York City we have
290 comments out of which AK 27 says yes
sure looking forward to a worldwide by
you make a good point even the sarcasm
is intended there is no project fly
everywhere else and Timothy says
considering on based in new york city
area google Wi-Fi seems pretty
compelling I know it probably use it and
be fast anyways yeah that could be the
case but again it would just be
something we would have to try and
Wolfgang says free Wi-Fi sucks
everywhere at least in Australia and
that is the major case for a lot of
countries except Romania so yeah google
can figure it out sort of like what they
do with that google fiber than sure then
on Wednesday ask you if you would like a
curve iphone as the rumors are the
company will bring that but sometime in
2018 we have 681 comments out of which
tyler says no apple please don't make a
curved phone and a lot of people like
your comment for some reason that jared
williams says no but i would give it to
apple if they find a way to implement
better features on the iphone than
samsung they can't then they probably
won't use it uh I agree with you Apple
sometimes gets it right but then again I
don't see that there should be a feature
for a flexible display again for me the
best option would be like what the g
flex can do you can flex it and not
break it that there is a point for that
another commoner says when Samsung does
a curve display all you say is no
benefit and gimmick when Apple does it
you say it's revolutionary and no I
haven't said it and finally on Friday
asks you what do you think about
smartphones with dual lens cameras as
reports claim that Apple is working on
this for some reason we have four and 39
comments out of which Kalyan says
Doolin's cameras are like 3d cameras
cool but useless for the majority of
people and I'm not even going to say
anything you can probably make the best
comment of the week dude and Jesse black
says so we're getting dual lens cameras
and curved displays on the next iPhone
should Samsung HTC get their lawyers and
because HTC sort of works with apple and
a sort of collaboration on design I
don't think that's going to happen
and then there's the settlement with
apple design as well so I don't think
that's going to happen either and
finally Savio says it doesn't matter
I've Apple releases dual lens camera
phone people will christen it as
groundbreaking that is the power of
Apple and I think that these powers wear
off even if Apple would figure out some
way to make this useful it does come to
the case of what is the point of a dual
lens camera they improve image quality
cool but if they just add new features
that people would rarely ever use then
it becomes pointless in my opinion
that's out of the pocket out daily recap
