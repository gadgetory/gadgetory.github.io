events of the year as Evelyn's just
didn't build its iPhone 6 iPhone 6 plus
an Apple watch but even though some of
the things are hot not everything is
perfect so I am Jaime Rivera this is
PocketNow and these are our things that
we loved about Apple September 9th
events and some of the things that we
feel that Apple could have probably done
better let's begin today with what we
liked obviously we get new iPhones and
that's the hottest ticket here first of
all because this is probably one of the
most beloved smartphones in the United
States in part of the world but also
because instead of just getting a new
design and no spec bump like we usually
get this time we get bigger and better
iPhones in every single way you'd get
4.7 inches on one 5.5 inches on the
other and you get a choice you can pick
the bigger or the smaller one and both
phones are actually better than the
current models that we have in the
iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c in addition to
that specifications have change we get
the new AAA chip we get the m8 cope
processor that will allow you to get
more fitness information as well you get
new displays that actually finally abide
to a standard you get 1080p on the
bigger 5.5 inch model and you get a
little more than 720p on the smaller one
though both of these are Retina display
standards you also get new cameras but
that's something that we're actually
going to talk about on a later segment
as we do get the same eight megapixels
but this is not the same sensor this
will be apparently a better one and well
we have yet to test it but so far the
hottest news today is that we get new
iPhones that these are better and
obviously we can't wait to have it in
our review table to tell you exactly how
well they perform compared to everything
in the market right now including
Apple's existing iPhones another thing
that we liked about this event is Apple
pay and you'd say well androids been
doing payments for the longest time and
sure they have but Apple has done it in
a smarter way instead of just launching
a standard out there for people to
choose to abide to it or not Apple has
decided to partner with everybody first
so yes you get American Express
MasterCard and Visa among major banks
and also retailers stores restaurants
all these companies are going to abide
and adopt the new Apple pay standard as
of October at least most of them and
it's not just pay
yes sure you get enough see on the new
iPhones and the new Apple watch and you
can just pay with that and you do get
the secure features of touch ID which is
great you don't have to be adding
passwords which anybody can steal but
what's most important is that number one
Apple doesn't keep your information and
number two well you can actually use the
same system for other things like for
example you can use this for open table
you go to a restaurant you order your
food and you can pay from the
application through Apple pay without
the need to get up and go pay for
something or give somebody or thumps and
pay for things obviously there is a lot
here to test we have yet to see if Apple
has figured things out but so far I
think the partnerships were probably the
smartest way to go so let's see how that
goes in October now let's go through a
couple of things that we didn't like
from this event number one we thought
that iOS 8 was going to be launched
today but no you'll have to wait until
September 17 which is good you don't
have to wait for the iPhone 6 to get iOS
8 that's great fine the problem is that
even though you have a bigger canvas on
both these new iPhones the biggest
problem is that you still get the same
row of icons and surely Apple is using
this new landscape mode on both phones
where you can use the phone and more
ways you can get more information on
your canvas that's fine but that doesn't
change the fact that even though you can
rotate the display and get your icons on
a different order that doesn't really
use the display any better and surely
you will get widgets on the notification
center but why not have widgets in front
you know on the home screen where they
actually matter why don't we have some
options to use by swiping to the left on
the home screen sadly yeah this is part
of what Apple announced in June not much
could be changed but we did believe that
a bigger canvas on a new smartphone what
allow Apple to use it up a little more
but sadly that's not the deal today
another thing that we didn't like about
this iPhone 6 is mainly the fact that if
you want a better experience you have to
buy the bigger iPhone meaning even
though both phones are almost identical
in design and specifications you get out
to the limit stabilization but only in
the bigger iPhone you get a 1080p
display but only in the bigger iPhone
you get better battery life in almost
every way
but only in the bigger iPhone and the
problem is that not everybody in this
world wants to use a phablet and 5.5
inches is a very big phone so if you
think of it why don't at will make it a
thicker iPhone 6 you know the regular
one why didn't they make it a little
thicker which actually the 5.5 inch
model is a little thicker why didn't
this happen to the smaller one in a way
to bring optical image stabilization to
bring the better battery I feel that
people care more about these features
than the fact that this phone is just so
thin people don't really care about how
thin a phone is people really care about
the features that they're getting and
surely it is important for a phone to be
thin I'm not saying that it's not but
I'm saying that I would rather have a
phone be a little bit thicker and give
me all the features and then it just be
a question of size you want a bigger or
smaller one and not necessarily the fact
that you would have to cough up an extra
hundred dollars and actually buy a much
bigger phone if you want to get these
added features that was in today's video
with one thing that we are mixed about
and that is the Apple watch starting
with the name Apple watch we haven't
heard Apple used the brand Apple in a
product in years I think it's been like
20 years odd we'll probably get used to
it I watch would have sounded so much
better but okay there are a couple of
cool things here starting with the
design you get so many options and you
can easily change these watch fans with
just pressing a button sliding them out
that is genius the design is also genius
you get options from stainless steel to
18 karat gold if that's your thing or
aluminum fine there are so many
watchbands the user interface looks
great you get sapphire in the display
all these things are great there is a
watch for him and her you don't have to
put up with it and the user interface
looks very intuitive obviously we do
have to test it it doesn't look a little
convoluted here in there and you know
obviously we will have to test it and
tell you about it but one of the things
that we are concerned about well first
of all you'll have to wait until 2015
to get it if you wanted to use it now
forget about it 2015 early that is a
long time in tech years a long time it
would be enough for competing companies
to figure something out
but then again okay that's the first con
the second con is you have to use an
iPhone there's just no other way for you
to use it
and that's actually not a good thing
meaning for example there are some
Android wear smartwatches out there that
you can now use the storage in order to
carry music and not have to carry your
smartphone your smartphone which is
great we're still not sure about this
with the Apple watch and obviously we
would have to check this but probably
one of the most concerning problems
about this Apple watch is apples not
good reputation with battery life Tim
Cook kind of said that it would only
last a day and find you get wireless
charging that's great but one day of
battery life on a watch is just terrible
companies need to figure this out and
again you get great sensors great
fitness tracking a lot of things are
coming with this watch but that leads me
to the question of this video what
products do you like what things didn't
you like and what are you mixed about
with this Apple September 9th event
again we love the iPhone 6 we're not so
happy about iOS 8 and the fact that it's
not enhanced then we are still mixed
about the Apple watch but we will tell
you more as we get more information
coming soon that's it for the things
that we love then we hated about apples
September 9th event we will have our
editorial roundtable happening between
