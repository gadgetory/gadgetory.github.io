download it before you can't sony
expects its water results to quadruple
and losses due to its smartphones and we
should be just a month away from new
iPads I'm hi Natalie then I am no I am
NOT doing crazy trying to download iOS 8
I know that's not going to happen today
this is parking out daily let's begin
today with what's official and a lot of
it has to do with Apple starting with
iOS 8 which is now live for almost
everyone if you're rocking an iphone 4s
or above and iPad tour above or an ipod
touch 5th generation you can download
iOS 8 today and there are a ton of
features coming here like health kit and
just about everything listen trigger for
full details as some of these features
are not available yet especially
continuity since you do require a mac
with OS 10 Yosemite so stay tuned as
that should be very soon tell us what
you think about iOS 8 in the comments
down below now that we have new iPhones
what are the biggest questions left this
when are we getting new iPads and the
rumors claim that apparently Apple is
preparing Prince event to have an on
october twenty first one it will
announce new iPads and apparently we
will be getting these tablets and 10
days later now it's very hard to predict
exactly what we're getting we know that
there is a new iPad air 2 a new iPad
many as well but there are some rumors
out there that there is an iPad pro and
even though apparently this will just be
bigger we are hoping that this runs OS
10 let's see what we get now that we
know a lot about the Apple watch some of
the questions that are left are pricing
and mainly because all we know is that
it will start at 349 we don't know
exactly how much it'll retail in other
editions and remember some rumors from
early this year there were claims that
it would cost thousands of dollars and
now that you think about the fact that
there are 18 carat gold Apple watches it
seems that that's true and junk Gruber
is actually predicting that some will
cost between five and ten thousand
dollars which is crazy I mean who would
pay that much for a piece of technology
that will be worthless a year from now I
don't think anybody would I think that
there is a problem with this gold
edition of Apple watches but let's see
how Apple plans to figure that one out
Ellis although Microsoft is the company
CEO Satya Nadella was recently on a
meeting with the Chamber of Commerce
and Seattle and when being asked what he
was planning to do to lift all the
market share issues they have with
mobile according to nadella and listen
to this he feels that the success in
mobile has nothing to do with market
share according to him the fact that his
products are being used is a clear
example that mobility is working for
microsoft the problem is if your
products aren't being used by many
people because you don't have the market
share then clearly there is no success
here but apparently nadella is not in
concurrence with that statement so leave
us a comment down below and tell us what
you think about nadella statement and
more details in the links of description
and finally for the very interesting and
disappointing news of the day sony is
already preparing for its quarter
results call and as it turns out that
company is already forecasting that it
will lose a ton of money and apparently
all that money that they're losing is
due to their mobile strategy it turns
out the company's expecting something
below 1.7 billion in losses only from
the mobile division because of
everything they're trying to do to sell
their mobiles which is really
interesting I mean you see Sony's Xperia
z3 their z2 these are great smartphones
sony has innovated with a lot of things
like what a proof technology on a phone
that doesn't look like a tank and you
would think that these products would be
enough for the company to succeed but
that leads you to the question of the
day if you use a sony xperia phone tell
us what you like about it and if you're
not does why you haven't bought it what
do you think sony needs to do to regain
its market share because in my case i'll
be honest with the biggest problem is
that they're completely ignoring the US
market the market where they should be
strong especially what the whole
reputation sony has but leave us a
comment down below what do you think
Renzi asked you know the drill if you
want to get that was earlier before this
video is Phil mushy follow us on fire
now calm and scrub change the channel as
well it also follow me on Twitter hi now
Josh watering better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hanging out any better thank
you very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
