camera Bobby S&amp;amp;G 6 HTC one mini
comparison time now the reason we are
comparing a 2014 phone with the 2013
phone on the left here is that they are
both mid Rangers they're not top of the
line phones and they have another thing
in common we have an aluminum bag now
this is the standard design used by HTC
on the one on the one max in under one
minute and this is hua based aluminum
with a look which is very rounded on the
bottom edge and everything I should say
and of course HTC's look of having that
curve which makes it sit well in the
palm of your hand now now in terms of
specifications obviously the HTC One is
a little bit on the higher end among the
two it also has the signature boom sound
while the guava phone only has the
speaker grill on the bottom and it is
back facing so it's the old-school
speaker we got the four megapixel
ultrapixel camera on the back on the HTC
one mini 8 megapixel backside
illuminated BSI sensor with the same
flash on the huawei phone we're talking
quad core versus quad-core ram is
approximately the same but we have 8
gigabytes of storage on the huawei phone
and we have 16 gigabytes on the HTC one
mini though you will be able to expand
it under huawei phone with the micro SD
card well that's a pretty pretty quick
look at this while still talking about
the camera there's also a 5 megapixel
camera on the huawei phone and who are
they is happy to announce that other
phones don't have 5 megapixel cameras on
the back either which is also the case
of the HTC one mini so that we have a
5-megapixel front face or on the guava
and a 4 megapixel ultrapixel camera on
the one mini will have a much more
in-depth comparison of the two and will
have the g 6 in our labs I am still
sweating but this is all for the good
for the better good Jaime behind a
camera
Anton fear from Barcelona lobby booze
thank you very much for watching thumbs
up for this video and for the sacrifice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
