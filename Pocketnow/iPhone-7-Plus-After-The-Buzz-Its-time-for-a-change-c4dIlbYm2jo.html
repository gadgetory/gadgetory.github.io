story every single time the media goes
crazy over every hot new device but
after that review period wears off so
what is the bus behind that new tool you
might still want to buy but that now
faces new competition the thing is in
the real world things don't really
happen that way for most of us aging is
just as important as the moment you
unbox your product for the first time
it's how that device performs after
extensive use that really matters down
the line so let's do something about it
let's have a second look at what Apple
decided that the word plus should stand
for in the smartphone world i'm high-
atwood pocket now when this is the
iPhone 7 plus after the buzz the iPhone
7 plus marked the first time that I ever
chose the larger iPhone I mean previous
variants were just blown of iPhones
whereas this one was the only way to get
extra features like a dual camera a
larger battery and more ram in theory
this was the best iPhone you could buy
but after nearly nine months of using
one I've learned that even more features
can be deceiving the hardware even as
uninspired as it is has not only aged
very well but it has clearly spun a
trend of look-alikes and competitors the
display has a few scratches here and
there since I'm reluctant to use screen
protectors but that's because even the
solutions at the Apple store looked
terrible given the 2.5 beat glass oh and
as is customary with iPhones that
oleophobic coating on the screen wears
off at around 2 months of use I'm still
not a fan of IPS LCD s but the p3 color
gamut provided by this display matched
by the black bezels and the stereo
speakers continued to make this one of
my favorite phones for consuming content
the matte black finishes fill the color
that I recommend most I mean look at it
it still looks pristine even though it
is prone to smudges about the only
things you'll notice is minor lip marks
from the thin case that I've been using
from spigen and you actually have to
look closely to see them though and
before I get called that over why I've
been using this phone with a case and
you all know that I usually don't that's
because this is the second iPhone 7 plus
that I've owned yep I broke the first
one in a horrible fall onto concrete
back in January a little pebble
shattered the glass and it dented the
aluminum so badly that I had to use
Apple Care Plus to replace the whole
phone because the dents even compromised
the water resistance but the reasons why
it fell are more important this phone is
not easy to handle even for my large
hands reaching the power button is a
chore basic things like sliding down the
notification shade require a hand
maneuver and given how slippery this
finish is using this phone without a
case has proven to be an accident
waiting to happen
iOS 11 beta has been powering the show
ever since it was announced back at WWDC
we have a separate video going through
most of the features and sadly the best
ones are focused mostly on the iPad my
favorites are really little things like
making the keyboard smaller when
operating this giant phone with one hand
or the fact that you can now customize
control center even if I still don't
like it visually I also like this new
translation feature on Siri mostly
because it responds not just with text
but also showing you how the
pronunciation should be on the spot and
the rest of the features are either
still not ready or simply things I don't
really care about after my extensive
period using this phone
now even with beta software one of the
highlights of this phone is how snappy
it is and it mainly has to do with the
fact that these internals simply haven't
aged slide through menus launch apps
play your favorite games and you'll
notice that there is really no stutter
to be found one of the main benefits of
owning an iPhone is that they're usually
supported for up to a crazy four years
in software updates and those are
instant for everyone about my only
complaint with iOS 11 is that most of my
favorite games are retro games and it
seems that these might not get updated
to the 64-bit architecture that's going
to be really sad and about that whole
amazing battery life that most of my
friends praised about plus iPhones in
the past well it's either that I'm too
much of a hardcore user but I'm going to
call performance to be underwhelming
sure it ends the day in most cases but
this is not what I dub amazing battery
life and the beta is really just making
things worse for obvious reasons and
then there's the case that charging this
battery can take forever now if we talk
about the camera there are things to
praise and things that I don't praise
Apple's choice to adopt a wider aperture
have finally made me return to using the
iPhone for photography if you follow me
on Instagram you'll notice that I love
photography and I've taken some of the
best photos on that account using this
phone it doesn't matter if it's during
the day or at night the iPhone 7 plus is
seriously up there with competitors like
the galaxy s 8 now what I can't say that
I use like at all is the secondary
telephoto lens first of all the lens
doesn't work at night given the low
aperture and then the whole portrait
mode while nice is really terrible in
low-light or just to fake looking at
times whenever there is light
I will still praise iPhones for their
video capabilities and it's awesome that
this phone now supports h.265 video in
order to be more efficient on storage
what I won't praise is the selfie camera
as the extra megapixels are just
pointless if this field of view is so
terrible for both photos and for video
to conclude I guess that it's clear that
my experience has been mixed with the
iPhone 7 plus I've been an iPhone user
since the 3GS and as a platform and an
experience I have to admit I still love
using iPhones the thing is that my
experience going plus has been a bit
disappointing the main reasons why I
decided to pony up extra money for this
phone didn't really prove to be worth it
in the end I've never used a telephoto
lens the battery isn't really stellar
and the giant vessels make this phone
really uncomfortable to use and I still
don't understand why such a large phone
does not have a headphone jack
like seriously Apple next that with the
fact that 2017 is full of phones that
are far more ergonomic while still
providing a larger screen and are also
more practical in what that secondary
camera can do and seriously just
choosing the iPhone 7 plus over any of
its current competitors is just too
difficult if you're in the market for an
iPhone I suggest you wait as rumors have
the iPhone 8 addressing all of the
complaints or at least we hope folks
just like this we've got more episodes

media and subscribe to our channel for
more videos like this one you can also
