hit some manufacturing issues no reports
revived the LG Nexus 5 is the device
that's at the FCC and if you want the
HTC One and blue well you'd better like
Best Buy I'm hi Mary vera and I wish
OEMs would know exactly how much I hate
the word exclusive this is pocket out
daily letters day off with the official
news motorola CEO has now confirmed that
the company is working on a tablet yeah
I know I know it's not hot news I mean
none of their tablets I've ever been
really compelling but obviously this is
a new Motorola and we are expecting them
to finally get this right and aside from
that google is so proud of their own
assembly plant for the Moto X that
they've actually featured it on street
view so this is the description down
below if you're interested in seeing
this dallas-fort worth assembly plant
and speaking of Google you remember
those reports of the Nexus 5 at the FCC
at first we thought it was and then the
tipster confirmed that it was a cdma
variant of the g2 and not really the
device that we were waiting for well as
it turns out if you read deeper into the
documentation at the FCC it turns out
that this is a gsm-only phone so it
couldn't hold water that this is the
variant of the Nexus fact that we're
waiting for from the LG g2 and judging
by the specifications of this phone it
better be because this phone is going to
be as hot as can be of the specs are
what they are right now so stay tuned
for the rumors now let's talk about HTC
as we've been waiting for their phablet
HTC One which is that the HTC One max
and as it turns out if you're interested
in that phone apparently it will be
launched but it will be a sprint
exclusive oh yeah I know that's terrible
news and speed of exclusivity of you're
interested in the blue variant of the
HTC One well you better like Best Buy
because its historic sluicin for Best
Buy but you can obviously buy it for the
other carriers it will cost you the same
amount of money so again if you're
interested in that color best buy is
where you're supposed to go and for all
17 of you that are interested in the
amazon kindle fire HD revamp well we've
got some league photographs of the
tablet already and it has this chromatic
redesign which we can understand since
the previous one actually kind of looks
better than this one but again these are
just leaks we haven't really
in the final product and prototypes
could be common still this tablet is due
for a that very soon and we know that a
lot of you're just waiting for it to
root it's so stay tuned for that and
finally for the interesting news of the
day those of you that are concerned
about the touch ID sensor on the iphone
5s well there is an article there is a
video there's a lot of documentation
about why this feature secure and how
Apple plans to keep your fingerprint as
a device only thing meaning that it will
not share your information with anyone
even though pretty much every entity of
the United States already has your
fingerprint anyways but aside from that
in the case of the iWatch apparently low
manufacturers have kind of landed the
sort of a problem because pally jony
ive's design is so complicated for the
iWatch that's been rumored and digitize
reporting that these companies are
having a hard time breaking even and
being able to build this watch so yeah
this will probably be a 2014 this shoe
but anyways that means using the
question of the day you know judging by
that galaxy gear that we already saw is
the iWatch still a device that you're
waiting for in my particular case
honestly the galaxy gear Sally does not
answer any of my particular needs so far
I definitely don't need a smaller camera
or other things that the galaxy gear
brings to the market so I am waiting for
the iWatch probably Apple can figure out
a better use for the iWatch still leave
us a comment down below is the galaxy
gear your device or are you waiting for
something better friends of course you
know the drill if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone it's our world mushy
