first league parts of the iphone 6
Motorola sends out press invitations for
an event in time for Eva and new leagues
bring us the specification of the galaxy
note 4 i'm high memory that I and if you
had a look at my breakfast you know I
need the cooking lessons help anybody
this is parking out daily the official
news today are hot as Motorola's just
sent out press invitations for an event
to happen on September fourth though not
in Berlin it's happening in Chicago and
have a look at this the president by T's
is an ex a G a SmartWatch and something
in the year which could be another
bluetooth headset but love God those
things never really took off but yeah we
are getting the new moto x we are
getting the new Moto G and finally the
Moto 360 hopefully leave your
predictions in the comments down below
is this is one thing that we are looking
forward to now let's talk about HTC as
what we reported yesterday just happened
today the company has just launched its
Zoe application as part of the HTC
creative labs expanding into other
smartphone territories any device
running Android 4.4 and above can
download this application though it's
still in beta will help you create
videos in a sort of a social network
style like the description watch Michael
Fisher's full video of what you're
getting it is interesting speaking of
HTC an even hotter piece of news or
rumors should we say is that apparently
the bootloader that's going to be
shipping on the HTC One m8 for Windows
will apparently be compatible with
certain versions of Android now we're
not really sure which versions these are
it's really hard to predict that we will
be able to dual-boot these devices
easily or of HTC is intending for this
to happen but it would be a great way to
sell this phone an option for Windows
Phone on one side android on the other
or to give current HTC want to make
customers the option would be amazing as
well let's see what we get in the end
i'll talk about apple and specifically
the iphone 6 says we get the first
leaked parts of the final assembly line
and the reason why we say these are the
final assembly line parts is because the
device is already going through
validation testing meaning it has
already started mass production and
apparently these are the parts that are
going to be part of whatever the Vice
you purchase if you do and then we get
the front panel which is interesting it
has the curves that we saw in previously
so apparently this will be a design
element and then we see buttons that
look exactly like what we see on Apple's
current generation iPad so yeah there is
some standardization happening there but
those curves up interesting we wonder
what Apple is planning with here though
we don't know this this place made out
of sapphire or what we'll see and
finally for the very hot rumors of the
day we get some leaked specifications of
the samsung galaxy note 4 should be
launched at Aoife in the next couple of
weeks we will be covering it live but so
far it seems that we're getting the octa
core chip that we saw on the Galaxy
alpha which we reported up today in
addition to an option for a Snapdragon
805 we are getting a 5.7 inch quad HD
display which is the same screen size as
the Korean galaxy note 3 only with
better pixels in addition to storage
options expandable storage the metal
trim the new design etc etc links in the
description read everything to know
exactly what you're getting but it does
lead me to the question of today would
this make you switch to a phablet if
you're not currently using a phablet
with everything that you see on the
Galaxy Note 4 make you want to switch
because in my case I would tell you that
I would I had great experiences with the
Galaxy Note 3 so far galaxy note 2 as
well and I am looking forward to this
phone even though I am enjoying newer
phones this year like the HTC One m8
we'll see which one is better in our
comparisons in the feature leave us a
comment down below tell us what you
think Renzi asked you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video with snow machine follow was
on par cannot comment subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well it also follow
