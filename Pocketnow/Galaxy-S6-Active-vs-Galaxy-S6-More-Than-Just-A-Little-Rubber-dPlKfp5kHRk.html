and its new active counterpart might
seem at first to depend only on how
active you are but there's more to it
than just a little rubber cladding i'm
michael fisher with pocket now and let's
find out which is the better fit for you
in galaxy s6 active versus galaxy s6
let's get the most obvious difference
out of the way first yes the galaxy s6
active is a much more rugged smartphone
than the standard s6 how much more
rugged
well the active is rated to ip68 for
complete protection against dust and
water resistance even beyond 1 meter of
Total Immersion
on top of that it comes packing a mil
standard 810g certification for among
other things temperature extremes and
shock resistance when dropped from a
height of 4 feet or less how does the
standard galaxy s6 fare under the same
conditions we have no idea and we're not
keen on sacrificing our own device to
find out suffice to say the s5 active is
by far the more durable of these 2
phones and our review device spares the
scuffs to prove it but you can learn all
that from a spec sheet in real life
these phones also feel completely
different in the hand thanks mostly to
the added mass and thickness of the
active wear the delicate glass ingot of
the s6 feels like an expensive fashion
accessory the solid block of the active
feels more like a piece of military
equipment the active is also much easier
to hold onto than the standard s6 whose
all glass construction is very slippery
by comparison there's a shift in buttons
here to wear on the stock s6 a pair of
touch sensitive capacitive keys flank an
integrated home button and fingerprint
scanner the active brings a row of
rubberized physical buttons with no
fingerprint sensor in sight that's a
plus if you're on a dusty jobsite or a
wet work boat we're finicky touch
sensitive buttons aren't always a great
fit and Samsung has also added another
button alongside the volume rocker on
the active by default it takes you to
the activity zone a hub of outdoorsy
apps like compass barometer and s health
and you can also set it to launch any
app you want which makes it a very
versatile and handy
addition while most of the important
specs remain identical across these
siblings
Samsung has reshuffled some internal
components between the two the
speakerphone has been moved from the
bottom edge to its erstwhile location on
the backside of the active that's good
for gaming because you're not as likely
to block the port with an errant finger
when playing a stressful title but we
wish Samsung had found a way to put it
up front instead speaking of gaming the
s6 active doesn't get quite as hot in
the hand as its glass sibling thanks to
its construction and you also won't run
into the problem of squeezing the phone
too hard and activating the front side
capacitive keys because there aren't any
back to the spec changes while the s6
comes in capacities all the way up to
128 gigs the s6 active for now at least
comes only in a 32 gig version
considering only about 24 of those are
available to the user out of the box
this is something to keep in mind
especially when you take into account
the lack of microSD the final component
change is the biggest one the embedded
battery the galaxy s6 active ups the
capacity by an impressive 37 percent
over the standard s6 which makes a huge
difference in day-to-day endurance while
it's always a struggle for us to get
even four hours of screen on time from
our stock s6 the s6 active delivered
five-and-a-half hours of screen on time
over 13 hours off the charger on our
first day and that's with heavy use of
the battery intensive game ingress over
the same period while there's a small
caveat here our s6 active is on AT&amp;amp;T
while our stock s6 is on t-mobile
there's not a significant enough
difference in coverage or network
architecture here in Greater Boston to
make us question the end result with
such a massive power pack the s6 active
is a much longer lasting phone than its
non active compatriot just keep in mind
that it also takes slightly longer to
charge even with the adaptive fast
charger included in the box if you want
to charge wirelessly both G and PMA are
supported just like the standard s6
there's one critical availability
difference to touch on here in the
states the galaxy s6 active is an ATT
exclusive so if you want one you'll have
to be cool with you they're moving to
big orange or unlocking it for use on
t-mobile without band 12 you'll also
lose ATT HD voice service in that case
which by the way is really nice more on
that in the full review any other
differences are extremely minor the
display on our active looks a little
greener than its counterpart but it's
not a big enough difference to show on
film the metal encased camera lens on
the s6 active is more protected because
it's more recessed but the cameras
produce very similar if not identical
and results in their photos and AT&amp;amp;T has
chosen to bundle ear buds with the stock
s6 but not the active for some reason or
some because the active actually costs
$10 more at full retail so obvious
conclusion first the straight-up galaxy
s6 is the smart phone to get if you're
looking to impress in the looks
department and you want a gadget that
feels more like a luxury item or you
absolutely need a fingerprint scanner
the galaxy s6 active is the phone for
you if you're a roughneck a boat captain
or championship klutz of the first order
now sure you could just slap the stock
s6 in a protective case but you wouldn't
necessarily get the milspec rugged
ization or water resistance and you
definitely wouldn't get the beefier
battery of the active personally I carry
a pocket external battery most of the
time I'm pretty careful with my gadgets
and I love a phone that looks and feels
great so I'd probably go for the stock
s6 if this were my decision but if
you're the type who pushes a smart phone
to its limits in more ways than just
durability and you don't mind some limit
pushing aesthetics to go with that
lifestyle the s6 active will certainly
be the better call
