this is the Galaxy S 9 plus the taller
more in charger variant of Samsung's new
flagship lineup what the company calls
as the camera reimagined sure it looks
like the Samsung Galaxy s8 plus but
that's just visuals tucked inside there
is a lot and it's time to take a look
I'm Jaime better with pocket now and
this is the samsung galaxy s 9 plus
brought to you by invisible shield the
Samsung Galaxy S line plus is not
necessarily the smart phone reimagined I
mean visually it follows the same design
language that we've seen for the past
two years still it's hard to deny that
the process of refinement has continued
and that this is another gorgeous
iteration of what smart phone should
look like we've got a beautiful finish
of curved glass and aluminum that very
few companies get well and now four
color options midnight black coral blue
lilac purple and titanium gray one of
the most interesting parts of this
unpacked keynote is that Samsung wasn't
really specific on specifications at all
even the press release lacks details but
we do know that this is a qualcomm
snapdragon 845 processor or an Exynos
9810 processor 6 gigs of ram 64 gigs of
expandable storage there's a 3500
milliamp hour power pack that hasn't
changed the same quick charge
capabilities through USB C and the word
fast extends to wireless charging again
just like before oh and it's also IP 68
water-resistant just like before as well
really Samsung made this event more
about what the phone can do and not
really what it brings the fact that we
finally get stereo speaker stood by AKG
to complement the gorgeous 6.2 inch
AMOLED panel during content consumption
yes the expected combo of the loud
earpiece and the redesigned bottom
firing speaker are in charge of
delivering
the fact that the camera is now a
variable aperture and this is no
software trick the camera actually
adjusts between F 2.4 aperture for
bright situations and F 1.5 for dark
scenarios the brightest we've seen on a
smartphone the fact that the camera now
supports super slo-mo and this is not
your typical 240 frames per second no
we're talking about an insane 960 frames
per second at 720p and with motion
detection software that knows when to go
slo-mo and when to go fast the fact that
there is now an AR emoji and this is not
just a mimic nanomolar Mickey Mouse or
The Incredibles but even to create an
animated avatar of you and your personal
preferences for clothing and style the
fact that Bixby continues growing up now
supporting AR features like being able
to translate a sign or real-time object
detection through the camera really the
only thing that separates this phone
from the galaxy s 9 is the telephoto
lens for portrait photography and
zooming into subjects what's most
important is what separates the spoon
from the galaxy si plus and that's a lot
of common sense a fingerprint scanner
word should have been in the back an
intelligent scan feature that blends
facial recognition with the iris scanner
the rest of the essentials will have to
be proven in our review like for example
battery life for now this is the samsung
galaxy s 9 plus this is what Samsung
believes is the best smartphone money
can buy and you know what from the looks
of it I do have to agree the biggest
question is do you agree chime in the
comments and while you're at that here
