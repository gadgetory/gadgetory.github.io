pocket now calm and this is a pocket
knife throwback to the HTC ozone a
windows mobile 6.1 standard phone let's
get to it so this phone was released in
June 2008 so it's almost two years ago
now that we saw this phone it was
actually released as the HTC snap in
Europe first and then it came to the US
on Verizon as the ozone and then it went
to sprint as the snap so the really cool
thing about this phone is the keyboard
this was one of the last front facing
QWERTY keyboard devices that HTC made
right now they're doing a lot of side
sliding QWERTY keyboards and also of
course the slab form factor with the
on-screen display but a lot of people
really appreciated having this really
nice on-screen keyboard sort of
blackberry style so let's take a tour
around the device here we've got a tiny
2.4 inch QVGA screen so that would be
240 down and 320 across it was capable
of displaying a mere 65,000 colors so
not the best display on the planet it's
obviously not touchscreen we've got a
lot of hardware buttons down here we've
got the d-pad with a selection button
we've got a tap and hold to access
microsoft voice command we've got the
power button soft keys it's really
cumbersome to actually use this today
because I'm so used to using
touchscreens I keep wanting to touch the
screen and it's almost frustrating
having to operate everything with the
hardware keys but as people from the
Windows Mobile days knew using hardware
buttons to get around in the operating
system actually could be very very fast
with keyboard shortcuts and other things
built in to the operating system we've
got an LED notification up here to tell
you if you've got a missed call or a
voicemail the device was actually pretty
thick even though it had not much to it
inside it has a Qualcomm processor
running at 528 megahertz it's got 192
megabytes of RAM so definitely nothing
even close to what you get today and I
mentioned the thickness because look at
the thickness of the ozone compared to
the desire hd it is thick
than a device that is many times more
powerful and of course it has a larger
screen but very interesting to see this
was definitely a thick device so I've
got the volume up and down rocker over
here on the bottom we had HTC's EXT
proprietary USB port fortunately this
also worked with many USB chargers if
you wanted to get headphone audio output
you'd have to connect an adapter which
is really annoying around this time the
HDC started to make all of their phones
with 3.5 millimeter headphone jacks and
limiting the need for that annoying
adapter over here on the right we have
nothing and it is completely blank on
the top on the back we've got a 2
megapixel camera no flash we've got a
speaker kind of a nice-looking silvery
backing and if we pop off the back
battery cover you'll see the 1500
milliamp hour battery really good
battery life on the snap and the ozone
and underneath the battery you will find
a SIM card slot because this was a world
capable phone for business users perhaps
ok so let's talk more about the software
here again we're running windows mobile
6.1 standard the non-touchscreen version
of Windows Mobile they they went on to
do windows mobile 6.5 standard and then
they killed it so this is sort of almost
towards the end of Windows Mobile's
lifespan what we have here is kind of a
nice looking sort of pane interface
where you can select slide the pane down
select different things and swipe
right-to-left I say swipe but I mean hit
the d-pad right to left see your new
messages you could scroll through
pictures you can see your emails you can
scroll through them in this pane without
having to actually jump into the email
application we can look through text
messages we can go into the weather
application and select a city let's type
Philadelphia go and there it comes
weather for Philadelphia
there we go nice little forecast there
and if you tap on that you should get
some more information a nice little
forecast this is an HTC addition they
kind of added their own tweak to windows
mobile 6.1 down here we've got favorites
which you can flip through any of the
favorites that you want down here you
can change your profile and then some
things like getting started but then you
can remove this if I remember at the end
remove getting started and it is gone
after it reloads the homescreen so let's
talk about how you actually use this
device up here at the top we've got a
place where you see your notifications
you see your system indicators you can
see that there's a new email of course
because this is not touchscreen you
can't reach up and touch the picture of
the envelope to access email you'd have
to get it to it in another way so we can
go to the Start screen and we can see
all of the programs this is a really
ugly way to see the programs and you can
add speed dial which means that you can
actually use the keyboard to launch
certain programs if you correspond say
Windows Media Player to three you open
up the Start menu you press three and
then you're there now going down here
we've got Internet Explorer really
probably the most poor internet browsing
experience of any device that we have
around here can be found on this device
and let me show you why so I'm gonna go
to go to web address and it's hidden in
a menu we can do a little backspace here
to delete everything let's just go to
pocketnow.com very good keyboard by the
way that was definitely one of the
shining points of this device and we can
click go and we're over Wi-Fi right now
so it should be relatively fast it's
gonna load up the mobile version so we
get this a little mouse pointer thing
that lets us move around on the page we
can zoom out to get a sort of zoomed out
view let's look at the desktop version
see how it fares with the full heavy
graphics version of pocketnow.com
now there are a lot of third party
browsers for Windows Mobile Skyfire
being one of them which actually worked
really really well on the standard
devices the nine touchscreen windows
mobile phones but for some reason that
I'm gonna show you this in a second you
can't access Skyfire anymore you'll see
why so it's loading right now it can
actually load some Flash content which
was pretty cool I think this is based on
the ie6 engine and right now it's not
responding because it's loading a pretty
heavy page this was a big problem with
Windows Mobile would slow down and
freeze a lot um yep we are frozen here
the thing has stopped spinning let's go
back to the home screen okay so we had
to get out of that and now maybe if we
go back into internet explorer who knows
what will be there up here it is Pocket
nails back so we can move around on the
page you can see the microscopic scroll
bars on the right side there I'm gonna
hit stop and so that we can actually
zoom out and see the page in its
entirety so here we go so there you go a
reasonably good view it took a while to
load but if you want to zoom in on a
particular spot you press zoom in here
you are and you can go from here in
terms of the menu options we can of
course go to a web address add to
favorites go to your home page check out
your history and then you can switch
between mobile view or desktop view you
can also go fullscreen which helps a
little bit when browsing these web pages
so anyhow let's go back to the home
screen and talk about the other built-in
programs of windows mobile 6.1 standard
so we've got the default stuff calendar
and contacts so go into calendar we can
switch between week view and month for
you kind of a very plain interface which
is why a Microsoft scrapped this in
favor of Windows Phone 7 Windows Media
Player which with a lot of finagling
would work with your desktop software
but it it wasn't as easy as for example
Zune is today where you download an
album you send it to your device you can
do it wirelessly on Windows Phone 7
we've got office mobile here and some of
these let you actually edit and most of
them don't so they're mostly readers
let's go back to the previous screen
we've
the settings via the list view of
settings and there's no other way to
look at this really ugly and if you
wanted to get to a setting that is on
the third page you'd have to go to the
right to the right to the right just not
an intuitive way to adjust settings
there
it's click done see what else we have
here
Adobe Reader so you could view PDFs
voice command which is always helpful so
you can you know let's try it what time
is it so Microsoft boys command always
worked really well in Windows Mobile and
of course today on Windows Phone 7 and
Android and iOS there are tools that you
can use to get voice recognition here in
albums it's just kind of the built-in
album program this is actually skinned
by HTC so a little bit of an upgrade
from what you get in stock windows
mobile 6.1 so there's the the goldfish
you may recognize from other devices we
can zoom in from here although it's a
little bit imprecise without a touch
screen certainly so let's get out of
here go back see what else we have
active sync of course the way that
Windows Mobile would synchronize with
Outlook and with your tasks and
everything Microsoft ActiveSync right
now I've got it hooked up to exchange so
it just says connected we've got the
camera application Bluetooth Explorer a
lot of other stuff file explorer which
of course Windows Phone 7 lakhs now get
applications for that's just a shortcut
to get some apps and b3 trimmer modem
links so you could tether there wasn't
an app store on this particular device
it wasn't until windows mobile 6.5 when
you could access they call it the
windows they caught them the windows
marketplace for mobile and right now
it's still in existence it doesn't have
that many apps maybe 2000 apps many of
which are pretty expensive but certainly
Microsoft has done a pretty good job
with the Windows Phone 7 app store which
is now on every device and hooks up with
Zune very nicely so that was pretty much
it and then you got the games of course
whoops if you went to games you'd
probably recognize Bubble breaker and
solitaire of course the quintessential
window
mobile games of the past and the email
experience was very good on this device
so if we jumped into email go back to
the home screen to do that and here we
are in the email application it's very
easy to use with the keyboard it was
fantastic if you wanted to search I
think they had that you start typing now
if not in this version but speaking of
just type one of the greatest parts of
windows mobile 6.1 standard is sort of a
Palm webOS like feature which is the
just type so here I'm on the home screen
I want to call Matt I'd type ma TT boom
instantly there's Matt's information I
can call him right from here really
quick and easy to do that in Windows
Mobile standard so the HTC Ozone was a
really cool device kind of modeled out
off of the BlackBerry kind of form
factor with the QWERTY keyboard below
the non touch screen it was a cool
device it wasn't that popular in 2008 we
were seeing the transition from non
touch to touch and today you'd be really
hard-pressed in fact you wouldn't be
able to find a smartphone running on
Android or Windows Phone that didn't
have a touch screen so this was pretty
much the end of the line in terms of the
non touchscreen interfaces and you know
a lot of people were sad to see it go
because after a lot of practice you
could become extremely efficient and
fast with the non touchscreen interface
so if you like this throwback please
give us a thumbs up and thank you for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
