pocketnow.com and today we're going to a
special feature we're going to show you
how to route the kindle fire these
instructions just came out so we thought
we'd do a video feature and show you how
it's done so sit back relax enjoy the
show so the link to the instructions and
to the files that you'll need are going
to be in the notes here on the video and
also at pocketnow.com with the news post
we're already at the link here in XDA
and we're ready to proceed there's one
step that's out of order in my opinion
in this listing here and namely that is
right here to go ahead and go in and to
the kindle fire and set the ability to
install from unknown devices so if we go
in here to the gear and then we hit more
and then go down to device and then
right here make sure this is set to
allow installation of applications this
option right here when you get that done
then we can go back up here to the next
steps which is first we need to edit the
adb USB file you need to make sure that
a TD is already installed and you've got
the SDK running so it can take a little
bit of knowledge and understanding of
that before you get started so if we go
in here to the android folder there's
the adb USB ini file here and then if we
look at that a TB USB ini file you can
see I've already got this here the
detail here coded into this file and
I've saved it the next step is we go
into the USB Driver folder I'm sure
where that is so in my case it's under
the root of the c drive and then android
sdk and USB driver it's going to be
wherever you launch your a DB file from
and then when you look at that
particular file you can see here
I've got the text here that's selected
here put into the proper places so
there's an google NT x86 and there's a
google NT amd64 both of them need to
have the same code put into both and
then the file saved as well so once
you've done that then you can plug your
kindle in if you haven't done this
already and what you get is a beep like
you're just heard and now it's ready for
USB connections now if you've already
got 80 be installed you can see here i'm
going to go ahead and just type in adb
devices it's going to show us here that
the device is connected right here so
right here this is the amazon kindle
fire ready to go so now we're going to
go ahead and move into my folder here
where I've got the super one click go
ahead go ahead and open it up you drag
it down here where you can see it you
don't need to change into these settings
all you need to do is click the root
button right here it's going to take a
few seconds let's go to kill a DB and
it's going to run through some steps and
you'll see some more information over
here when it gets finished it's going to
ask if you want to install busybox can
go ahead and say yes and when it gets
done with that piece it's going to ask
you if you want to run a test and you're
going to say yes as well so you can see
it's about a path crunching crunching
it's going to work away it doesn't
really take too much time so it's
restarting as root give it just a couple
of seconds for the device to recover you
want to run a test we say yes it's going
to send an su command and down here on
the device it pops up a little message
down here to say that it's been routed
and then says yes you want to do which
like donate now
why not go ahead and donate if you like
to so now the device is in fact rooted
so at this point what you can do is move
on to the next step which is actually to
go and grab the files from the next link
in the list which includes all of the
files for installing things like Google
Mail and the Google market etc etc
there's a link in there as well as the
XDA to show you how to do those pieces
look at excuse me and then because
you've got roots you can set the market
to the proper permissions and be able to
launch that as well now should you do
this it depends if your tech person
likes a tinker I certainly like to do
that sort of thing and if you go in here
you can see on my device I've already
got to go launcher ii x which is
required if you're going to use the
market because otherwise it won't launch
won't show up as an icon so here's the
google market as you can see I've also
got Google Reader installed google music
we go into apps you can see I've got
google + installed I've also got gmail
installed google maps installed all part
and parcel of this routing although you
can install some of these apps without
rooting but why not have root as well so
you can get the the part of the market
as as part of this process so if you
have any questions or comments or need
some help on this pop out to
pocketnow.com to the news post that
you'll see for this routing tutorial and
leave us a note and we'll be happy to
help otherwise thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
