now calm and this is the hardware review
of the HTC Thunderbolt on verizon
wireless let's get to it okay so let's
jump into specs before we actually do a
tour of the hardware of the HTC
Thunderbolt we're running on a Qualcomm
Snapdragon single-core 1 gigahertz
processor it's basically the same
processor that you get on the htc
inspire 4G but it's it's different than
the processor that you get on the HTC
EVO it's a little bit more advanced it's
faster and it performs very very well as
we're going to see in some benchmarks
coming up in the next video it's running
with 768 megabytes of RAM that is a lot
of ram you can multitask very capably
with the Thunderbolt and of course with
the inspire 4G we have got 2.5 gigabytes
of on-board storage plus a plentiful 32
gigabytes included with the micro SD
card very impressive the HTC and Verizon
included 32 gigabytes of extra storage
that is quite good and really the best
that you can do on a phone there are no
microSD cards that are bigger than 32
gigabytes right now so very appreciative
of that the screen is super LCD 800 down
by 480 cross this resolution is getting
a little bit outdated the bump to qhd
which is 960 down and 540 across is
happening this year it's likely that the
next high-end phone from HTC is going to
have the qHD resolution it's time for a
resolution box now the super LCD screen
is 4.3 inches it's the same exact screen
as you get on the inspire 4G so let's
actually compare them and you'll notice
something interesting these are both set
to automatic screen brightness if we can
turn this on sometimes this standby
button is difficult to operate okay and
here's two websites compared side to
side same web page and yet as you can
see right on the video the Thunderbolt
seems to have whiter whites just a clear
display they're both on automatic screen
brightness so everything should be equal
but the Thunderbolt has
I sir display then the inspire 4G so
definitely points for that turn it off
here let's kind of walk around the
device here up here we have some chrome
who doesn't like chrome there's an LED
notification light inside the chrome
strip here which will inform you when
you have a new email a new message so
you don't always have to turn on your
phone got a 1.3 megapixel front-facing
camera the inspire 4G doesn't have this
truth be told most people won't ever use
this except to take a picture of
themselves once in a while it's just a
kind of a novelty feature it's nice to
have but you'll probably agree that most
people aren't going to use it up here on
the top we've got kind of a difficult to
feel for standby button on the right
side of the device then a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the top and what's
that second hole there that is a
secondary microphone used for noise
cancellation so this phone has no
cancellation there's always a great
feature if you find yourself in a loud
situation outside and windy park or if
you're you're out at night it really
helps to cut down on noise down here
we've got the android buttons capacitive
when you tap on them they vibrate a
little bit have a little design element
here kind of like this rubbery strip
going to the side we can start to see
the thickness here the Thunderbolt is as
thick maybe slightly thicker than the
evo 4g i'll just keep that in mind
compared to the inspire 4G it's about
two millimeters thicker so that's
something you want to keep in mind if
you're sensitive to a thick device
although you know the trade-off here is
that you're getting a 4g modem and a
little bit a little bit thicker of a of
a width here not that big of a deal it's
not remarkably thick it's just pretty
thick in terms of other devices that are
landing on verizon that can do 4g the
revolution from LG and the stealth from
a samsung the stealth is going to be the
thinnest the LG revolution is going to
be the thickest and then the Thunderbolt
is kind of right down the middle so if
you leave the microSD port for syncing
and charging on the bottom you see the
primary microphone over on the other
side we've got the volume up and down
rocker now over on the back we've got
really no metal to speak up compared to
the inspire 4G
just that nice unibody metal
construction that feels great in hand on
the back of the Thunderbolt you get this
soft touch plastic which feels nice but
not as high-quality as the inspire 4G
also interestingly although this is an 8
megapixel camera it's not written around
or near the camera lens if you look at
say the inspire 4G again we're comparing
a lot to this phone because they're so
similar you can see in the light it says
8 megapixels right around the camera
sensor they're not advertising that on
the on the Thunderbolt which is kind of
strange dual LED flash which actually
seems quite capable at illuminating dark
subjects without making that big white
splash that is characteristic of these
very powerful dual LED flashes you can
do a 720p video recording here we've got
this kickstand it's made out of metal it
seems very resilient and there's
actually the speaker underneath the
kickstand and yet you would think that
when the speaker was on it would be
muffled with kickstand down it's not the
case at all kind of strange so this
serves the purpose of of course tilting
it something the device slightly whether
whether you use this will be determined
by how many movies having how much video
you watch although I've been finding it
very useful to say read an article on
the new york times app because the stand
is sturdy enough to where I can sort of
manipulate objects on the screen and
swipe and what not without the device
sort of moving away from me so that's
good to see we've got the nice 4G LTE
logo here let's pop off this this
backing back here we've got a 1400
milliamp hour battery that's bigger than
the inspire 4G so far it seems that they
have about the same battery life
although it's only been about a day so
it's tough to test battery life in such
a short time will have full battery
tests coming up in the full review so we
can pop off this battery here and reveal
some fun things back behind the battery
we've got the 4g verizon card again it's
funny to see Verizon with a with a sim
card of course Verizon's dual-mode world
phones would have a sim card so perhaps
it's not that unusual and of course up
here in the upper right corner kind of
in a little sneaky place we've got the
32 gigabyte class
or micro SD card that is a huge amount
of storage coming from the factory which
is very much appreciated so pop this
back in and go like this so over all the
hardware on the HTC Thunderbolt is is
quite good it feels a lot thicker I've
got to tell you then the then the
inspire 4G it also feels a little bit
lower quality because it's not built
with that metal with the unibody
construction although at the end of the
day it's an HTC device you know what to
expect it still feels good at hand it
has nice fit and finish with the chrome
accents with a nice little design
element down here it looks good from
across the room what can you say it's an
HTC phone so overall high marks to HTC
for building another good high quality
sturdy device here we've got a lot more
coming up on the HTC Thunderbolt we're
going to run speed test bench marks a
lot of comparisons so be sure you
subscribe to the pocket now video
YouTube channel to see when the next
video hits thanks for watching and
that's it for now
