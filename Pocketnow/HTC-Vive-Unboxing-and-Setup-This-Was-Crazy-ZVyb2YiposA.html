to do this video hey everyone it's time
everybody front pocket now and so doing
a video about VR it's complicated on its
own but when you're talking about the
HTC vive when video is definitely not
going to be enough so let's get started
just like the case of the average gaming
computer there is nothing simple about
the HTC vive I mean the FedEx guy needed
a trolley to drag the box to my doorstep
not because it was heavy but because it
was huge cutting through the external
cardboard you're greeted by a large dark
package that's held in place by foam and
plastic protection the added padding may
seem a little overkill but it starts to
make sense when you dig within the Vives
box is nothing short of elegant
reminding us of the retail packaging
you'll see when you buy an expensive
suit or a dress uncovering the goods is
yet another experience each individual
product that makes the vive possible
arrives in separate containers that are
also protected by thick dark foam every
one of these houses all the accessories
needed for the specific unit to work so
where you see the controller's you'll
find the necessary USB chargers and
adapters where you see the base station
you'll find the mounting brackets and
screws in addition to the necessary wall
adapters where you see the hub you'll
find the HDMI USB and power cables in
addition to a pair of headphones the
vive sits alone on a separate section
along with an extra visor padding for
those with a thinner face
now setting up a vibe is one of those
things you don't want to do twice
because it's rather daunting we've
actually had the vibe for weeks but none
of the max was powerful enough to run it
thankfully AMD hooked us up with a very
nice Falcon Northwest Radeon tikki
that's as beautiful and red as it is
expensive and powerful for the vibe to
work you need to connect the HDMI cable
from the hub directly to the GPU so your
monitor has to either sit on DVI or any
other port the hub then connects the
power source in addition to USB and then
you connect the same wires on the
opposite end to the vibe the bundled
headphones resemble the high-res
headphones that HTC brought with it HTC
10 which is awesome make sure you
connect them through the slot on the
vive like the headset the controller is
unlike anything I've ever seen before
these are actually wireless so make sure
you use the bundled adapters to charge
them before starting gameplay the
biggest question I've received this can
you play with the vibe without any room
and you actually can there's a special
way to mount the base stations for that
to work if you can make the room you can
set each base station facing each other
on opposite directions
I'd suggest you don't mount them on the
walls and instead use cheap tripods as
that adds versatility whenever you want
to change your gameplay area the base
stations make a very interesting noise
within hinting to fans and there are
some indicator LEDs that turn green
whenever both sensors are in sync and
one will say a B and the other a see
anything to synching whenever these
don't you can actually use a sync cable
as if there weren't enough cables
already there's an application that
installs both the vive software and
steamvr but if you're new to steam make
sure you create an account before you do
all this work during the setup you're
required to then tell the vibe about
your room this involves setting the
controllers on the floor for calibration
and then walking around to define the
boundaries of the room
once that's done the dashboard will
indicate when base stations are actually
tracking the controllers in the headset
and even when there are objects that are
obstructing the area once you start
digging within the software you'll
notice that there are a ton of
applications already available but the
size of these is rather significant some
of these are actually up to 5 gigabytes
so make sure you start downloading even
before the setup process begins if you
can and now the moment we've all been
waiting for the actual experience of
using the vibe the wires on the back can
be a little annoying but you'll be
surprised at how easy it is for you to
know that they're there so far my first
impression is that it's a bit heavy for
prolonged gameplay but trust me I will
be happily testing this thing for the
next few days to tell you more about my
experiences so far I've spent the last
hour or so playing a game called the lab
and I swear that it is extremely
addicting I highly recommend it
but again the challenge is to see just
how comfortable it is to actually use
the vibe for a long period of time so
yeah that's how long it took to set up
the HTC vibe so now you understand why
one video is not even enough we've got a
ton of coverage coming very soon and
I've got a lot of questions for my
friends we've also love to know your
