really only scratching the surface the
Samsung gear s is physically more
bracelet than wristband and functionally
more smartphone than accessory does it
deserve a spot on your wrist in the new
year
i'm michael fisher with pocket now let's
find out the gear s is larger than every
other SmartWatch we've tested this year
but it's also surprisingly lightweight
there's nothing really special about the
band or clasp but each does its job the
metal snaps into place with a reassuring
click and the matte black rubber of our
sprint review device is soft and
comfortable different colors and a
bangle design are also available in
daily use it's definitely present you're
not going to forget it's on your wrist
especially when typing but it still
slides beneath the cuff with relative
ease the real centerpiece of the
hardware is the removable
water-resistant core module and the main
focus there is the 2 inch Super AMOLED
display we've often said curved displays
would be most at home on wearables and
this screen proves the point reducing
the apparent footprint of the gear s
while also bringing just the right
amount of futuristic flavor the display
is big and vibrant and adjusts
automatically based on ambient light if
you can get around its super reflective
cover glass it's plenty readable in most
lighting conditions the single key
beneath the display functions as both
home and power standby a very clever
implementation that we'd like to see on
more devices pressing the button fires
up the Tizen based operating system
which runs smoothly enough on the
Qualcomm processor as long as you don't
mind a pretty sluggish animation frame
rate this being a gear device
interaction is by bezel based gestures
swipe down from the top for system
settings up from the bottom for the app
tray swipe in from the left for
notifications and in from the right to
access different home screens inside
apps you can go back one step with a
swipe down from the top if it seems a
little elaborate while it is remember
what I said about this being more
smartphone than SmartWatch there's no
camera here but otherwise almost
anything you can think of doing on a
handheld device you can
- in miniaturized form on the gear s
from simple calculators and clocks to
full-on web browsing if it's not built
right in you can probably find it in the
third-party marketplace which isn't
quite as robust as other ecosystems but
there's still plenty of cool stuff here
to keep your wrist buzzing unfortunately
all the complexity makes for a pretty
cumbersome timepiece if you set a
countdown timer while you're cooking say
don't make the mistake of clicking home
to check the time if you do you'll be
three or four swipes away from the timer
when you want to check how much time is
left this is one of several things that
simpler competitors do better the
inclusion of a cellular radio means the
gear s can do more than just forward
notifications from your smartphone it's
got its own sim ID and its own phone
number and calls automatically forward
to the watch if you leave your phone at
home on purpose or otherwise this is
probably where the gear s shines the
most brightly the speaker is just loud
enough to be heard over even moderate
background noise and the noise
cancellation on the outbound side is
great too one caller said she could hear
us loud and clear even when we were
shouting over the roar of a nearby
motorboat engine we were also pleasantly
surprised by Sprint's Network
performance in the boonies and the city
alike whether we were browsing headlines
or navigating to the nearest gas station
the network had our back even if it kept
us waiting a few times get tired of 3G
data speeds and there's a Wi-Fi radio
here too because of course there is and
yes you can also text from the gear but
s voice dictation isn't great and the
tiny keyboard is frustrating even for
the smallest fingers if anything the
gear S will have you making and taking
more phone calls because of how well it
handles voice and if you're not into the
Dick Tracy thing don't worry you can use
a Bluetooth headset
probably the most apt standalone use is
for fitness scenarios where the last
thing you want is to be toting a
smartphone around the gear s comes
packing a heartrate scanner bundled Nike
running Plus app and GPS to track your
progress and you can also transfer music
tracks to the watch using the Samsung
gear app sit still for too long and
s-health will give you a kick in the
pants remind you to get up and move
around a bit this feature can be turned
off if you find it more annoying than
inspiring but I like it it all adds up
to a sense of Independence notably
absent from most other smartwatches
reading news articles or browsing the
web on your wrist isn't comfortable
really but it's nice in a pinch if
you're taking a break during a workout
or on a quick grocery run when you've
accidentally left your phone at home the
only downside is battery life while the
watch will easily last two even three
days when paired to a smart phone that
shrinks to just about 24 hours in
standalone mode in our experience all
that edit capability will exact added
cost in the form of a monthly bill from
Sprint or whichever carrier you choose
and while there are certainly affordable
plans out there paying a separate
monthly fee for a watch on top of the
equipment cost definitely won't be for
everyone the question is does it bring
enough utility to justify the price now
if you're someone who just wants a
simple accessory executed well then the
answer will be no the gear s is not for
you it's pricey and it's complex and the
software sometimes gets in its own way
get a pebble or an Android wear watch
instead and this is also true if your
smartphone was built by anyone except
Samsung since the gear S will only work
with a Samsung device but if you do
carry a semi on the regular and you're
the kind of gadget geek who loves raw
capability irrespective of elegance the
gear s is bound to be a very enticing
option Samsung's kitchen sink mentality
has made it the most powerful wearable
we've ever reviewed pair it with a
Galaxy Note 4 and you've got one of the
most feature Laden mobile combos out
there just make sure you can use all of
those features before you buy if not
there are certainly cheaper more refined
options out there for you with even more
coming in the new year for more wearable
coverage folks be sure to check our full
reviews on Android wear pebble and other
manufacturers here on YouTube and at
pocket now till next time this has been
michael fisher with pocket now captain
to phones on twitter reminding you that
just a couple decades ago devices like
this were pure fiction
so stop for a moment and enjoy our
futurist modern world we'll see you next
