m9 and even the 109 + 1 plus also alerts
of a price Club and its smartphone for
Europe and can we blame tag heuer for
wanting to build its own SmartWatch I'm
hi Mary vetta and for all of UFC
Barcelona haters and sorry to disappoint
this is parking out daily brought to you
by Squarespace at its new seven-point
know you I the official news should I
have to do with Microsoft as the company
has made a lot of Windows 10 changes
official in addition to the fact that it
has just partnered with new companies to
build more windows 10 smartphones we're
talking about lenovo and see Ali which
is a great considering the fact that
right now what we mainly see our Lumias
a great news to come we just don't know
exactly when we're getting products
other official news are not necessarily
positive but have to do with 1 + + 1 + 1
obviously it's only smartphone the
company has just made it official that
it's gonna raise the price of the
oneplus one in Europe because of the
Euro price drop or valuation drop should
we call it right now the urine the
dollar are very close to each other so
it's going to raise the price at 300
euros for the base model and three
hundred and fifty euros for the upper
level smartphone which is a sad news we
wonder if this is going to be permanent
especially when one plus is made it
official as well that they are selling
that phone on a loss in Europe now let's
move the spotlight over to HTC as the
company has made it official that even
with the delays of the 109 in Taiwan we
can expect it in the United States on
April 10 the same day that we should
expect the galaxy s6 great competition
numbers but even more interesting
apparently the one m9 + and that's a
plus sign after the m9 by the way like
the old one x+ days is a going to be
ready sometime within late march or
april we expect it to be announced by
then we just don't understand why HTC
would steal the thunder of the one m9
because apparently this new smartphone
will bring a quad HD display in addition
to other specs that make it on par with
the galaxy
six let's see what we get up next let's
talk about war way and wearables the
company has made its Huawei watch
official at mwc we covered it live but
interesting the company doesn't seem too
happy with Android where they love
Android up to the point where they ditch
Windows Phone but they claim that the
lack of customizability in Android wear
makes the product a little boring dull
and pretty much not interesting for them
to continue building products up we
don't know exactly what to expect the
Huawei watch is a beautiful timepiece
but we can't wait to review it even
though they're right we're just gonna
review the hardware pretty much and
finally for the very hot news of the day
if the spending ten thousand dollars for
an Apple watch is crazy for use just as
much as it is for us a tech heuer thinks
that they could offer something better
the company is working on its own
SmartWatch and apparently it's
partnering with Google for this product
and they're using the Carrara design so
we're expecting a five-thousand-dollar
watch here but we wonder exactly how is
a google going to partner here because
uh we don't think this product is going
to run Android where there's a lot on
the table that we can expect but it
leads me to the question of the day this
is interesting would you be willing to
spend on a tag heuer SmartWatch because
this is a luxury brand that's willing to
invest in making their products smarter
in my case I wouldn't be willing to pay
five thousand dollars for a watch
regardless I mean regardless but if i
had the cash then i think that would be
the smarter approach for rolex tech here
in all these companies to come up with
their own smartwatches but the
fragmentation could be an issue leave us
