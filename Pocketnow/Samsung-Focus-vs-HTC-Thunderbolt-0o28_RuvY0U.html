pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to compare the HTC Thunderbolt
with the Samsung Focus running on
Windows Phone 7 let's get to it so
previously we had compared the HTC
Thunderbolt with the iphone 4 and with
the inspire 4G will put up links on the
video right now so that you can jump
back to those videos or if you want to
watch this video all the way through
you'll see links at the end of the video
as well if you want to see the other
comparisons again our reason for
comparing all of these devices is to
help you make decisions we know it can
be confusing there are a lot of
smartphone choices and hopefully we're
helping to make it a little bit easier
as all of these new phones are coming
out okay so let's talk about these
devices the samsung focus here is kind
of representing all of a tease windows
phone 7 devices because at the end of
the day they operate about the same they
have the same specs so the other devices
on ATT that you can choose from are the
HTC surround you've got the LG quantum
and now you've got the HTC hd7 s which
is the t mobile hd7 but with a super LCD
screen and of course on ATT it's coming
out later this spring we don't know
anything about pricing although it's
probably going to be about ninety nine
dollars maybe one hundred and forty nine
dollars speaking of pricing let's
compare these devices in terms of
pricing the Thunderbolt is definitely
more expensive than the focus it's two
hundred and forty nine dollars whereas
the samsung focus is ninety nine dollars
pretty inexpensive their comparatively
for data plans on the Samsung Focus you
can opt for the twenty five dollar per
month two gigabyte data plan with the
Thunderbolt you can pay thirty dollars
and get unlimited data and of course the
Thunderbolt is rocking the 4g LTE modem
so you'll get much faster data speeds
about three to five times faster maybe
even more than that in optimal
conditions so if you want the fastest in
data speeds a thunderbolt is no one to
go with although the samsung focus is
the more economical route okay so let's
talk a little bit about hardware the
screen on the Thunderbolt is 4.8 three
inches diagonal which will be the same
size as the
coming hd7 s on the focus you get a
smaller screen four inches but it's
super amoled meaning that the contrast
is really really good as we're going to
see when we turn these on and start
comparing one screen to the other now
inside the focus has 512 megabytes of
RAM the Thunderbolt has 768 megabytes of
RAM both have a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor we're going to see again how
they compare day to day operation once
we turn them on the focus is much much
much thinner than the Thunderbolt it's
probably half as thin or at least it
looks half as then and on the back here
we've got an eight megapixel camera over
here on the Thunderbolt and a five
megapixel camera on the focus both are
capable of 720p video both take really
good photos and really good video now
with the focus you get the dedicated
camera button which is very very handy
and of course you get that windows phone
7 feature where even if the device is
turned off or in standby if you tap and
hold on the camera button it will turn
on the camera and there is the camera so
that's a really cool feature of Windows
Phone 7 the Thunderbolt doesn't have
that because well it's not a feature of
android the Thunderbolt doesn't even
have a button on the side for the camera
which is kind of annoying but some
people probably find it to be no big
deal at all alright so of course the
Thunderbolt has a front facing camera no
camera on front facing camera on the
focus windows phone 7 doesn't yet
support front-facing cameras so let's
turn on both of these devices and talk a
little bit about the software we're kind
of comparing apples to oranges here
they're totally different in terms of
the interface paradigm but we're going
to do our best to try to compare them
here so let's unlock the screen there
unlock the screen here so the home
screens are vastly different on Android
you scroll side to side you get live
widgets over on Windows Phone 7 you get
these tiles and these tiles can show you
information like the email count counter
and if you have the calendar widget it
will sugar the widget the live tile is
they caught it will show you information
but in terms of home screen versatility
Android definitely takes the cake in
that respect although if you want
something simple and very clean and just
knowing
sense you may really enjoy what Windows
Phone 7 has to offer now right off the
bat you can see how how sharp the
contrast is on the focus I mean look at
the blacks on the side there the blacks
are true black and they just look
fantastic okay so on Windows Phone 7 to
access your program try you swipe to the
right over on an android of course you
hit the application trail you get this
big listing which is sortable windows
phone 7 is a little bit more cumbersome
to navigate because you get this really
long list of applications that really is
just sorted alphabetically you can't
sort it by date or anything like that on
the Thunderbolt and an Android in
particular the sentence interface you
can sort these by date alphabetical or
by oldest which is kind of handy when
you've got lots and lots of apps in
terms of apps right now Windows Phone 7
has about let's jump in the marketplace
real quick has about 10,000 apps and
Android has about 150,000 apps so you
definitely get a more mature app
marketplace on Android although of
course windows phone 7 is getting better
each day they're starting to hit all of
the the sort of basics like New York
Times amazon and that's really what's
important some of the off-the-cuff apps
aren't as important because there's a
lot of those in the android market which
really helps to almost artificially
boost the number of applications in the
market most people are concerned with
the major apps like pandora I'm New York
Times amazon as we talked about and both
of these devices have that covered so
very very strong marketplaces on both
again Android has a higher number let's
go back to the home screens let's
compare web browsers we're going to
bounce into the browser we're just going
to load pocket now right away here we've
got a live tile or a tile on the home
screen so let's stop this and go to
pocket now we'll do a speed test and see
how they compare now right now you can
tell the big difference between super
LCD and super amoled super is a very
popular work we've got very white whites
here dark blacks over here on the super
LC
scream the whites are almost milky in
color it's not that crisp and clear by
itself the Thunderbolt has a great
screen but when you put it up against a
super amoled screen the story kind of
changes okay so let's scroll down let's
zoom in very smooth scrolling and
panning on both of them let's go to the
desktop version both of these are over
the same Wi-Fi network let's see which
gets there first
ok so the Thunderbolt finished first and
Windows Phone 7 is lagging a little bit
which is surprising because Windows
Phone 7 is one of the best browsers and
with the mango update of Windows Phone 7
coming later this year they're going to
bump it up to ie9 which should have an
even faster rendering engine so kind of
slow there we're just going to stop it
there obviously the focus loss let's do
a speed test in terms of rotating the
screen ok so definitely the Thunderbolt
beat the focus and the other way that
was perfectly tied again the Thunderbolt
one in the landscape and in portrait
that are pretty much tied that's kind of
interesting ok let's a double tap to
zoom in double tap to zoom in both are
again very very very smooth and here's
another video we did the inspire 4G
versus the Thunderbolt so let's tap on
that see which gets there faster of
course you'll get flash elements in
android whereas in in Windows Phone 7
you don't get flash at all you don't get
silver like you really don't get some of
those major web technologies so you'll
see down here there's a little green
arrow which means that if I tap on that
that will load the youtube video and
well actually oh yeah I thought there
might have been a plug in here but it
says you will need to upgrade your adobe
flash player the pinch to zoom is just
so buttery smooth on Windows Phone 7
it's really remarkable it beats even the
iPhone in terms of just refinement of
moving in on a particular element on the
on the web page and let's zoom all the
way out and let it continue to load it's
still loading let's go to another
website let's go to engadget to see how
we do with checkerboards would end
gadget because that's a particularly
long web page now in terms of on-screen
keyboards you can compare them right
here windows phone 7 is one of the best
on-screen keyboards but then again
android is no slouch either this is
htc's sense keyboard which has big
letters you can change it to the t9
style you can change it to the short
type style a lot of choices there if you
like choice androids better if you don't
mind giving what you've been got that
the
make any sense if you don't mind getting
what you've been given windows phone 7
is the one for you because you can't
change the keyboard okay so let's get
engadget going on both of these devices
dot-com got it right here let's try to
get the same time perfect okay so
they're off and gadgets a very long page
so we're going to do the the flick test
to see which loads faster so that
actually went right to the desktop
version or enough to change that went to
the mobile versions we could go to the
desktop and here we go it's going to
load it up it's pretty amazing how far
web browsers have come just in two or
three years it used to be that there are
lots of scroll bars it was difficult to
see things but now it's almost like
browsing a web page on the desktop so
again it's finishing the loading process
here on the samsung focus and again we
want to stop this it's just it's taking
too long in the last few seconds so
let's do the flick scroll test going to
try to hold the device steady and move
very quickly down the page ok it's
blankets blankets filling in as I go
down okay so a little bit of
checkerboards what probably has happened
is that it's now cached and so if I do
it again it should be better really fast
maybe not okay so we get some of that
blank spot although as you just saw it
filled in let's try it out on the on the
Thunderbolt here let's move that aside
let's flick down the page okay so no
checkerboards whatsoever we'll do it
again very smooth on Windows Phone 7 the
first or second time through you get
some of that blank space as it tries to
sort of catch up with the speed so over
on web browse and we'll say that the
Thunderbolt is definitely faster if
you're really looking for a phone that
browses the web as fast as possible now
in terms of data speeds if you get out
there you're you're driving your car
somewhere or here you're on the bus or
what have you the Thunderbolt if you're
in a 4g area will get much faster data
speeds in terms of numbers we're looking
at between seven and ten megabits per
second down the upload speed we're not
really sure of because the testing
mechanisms that we're using are giving
us crazy results
we're getting like 30 up which doesn't
make sense we'll say it's probably about
half the download speed so you're gonna
get three to four to five megabits per
second up on the samsung focus on ATT 3g
network you're going to get about two
point five megabits per second down
which is not bad at all and 1.7 megabits
per second up another thing to consider
here is that you cannot tether right now
with Windows Phone 7 but you can with
the Thunderbolt now there's a tethering
plan that you have to pay for it's about
twenty dollars per month which only
applies in this situation to the
Thunderbolt so if you're looking for a
device that will allow you to share the
internet connection with several
different devices your iPad your laptop
the Thunderbolt is the one to go for and
finishing things up here maybe
navigation is very important to you
maybe the maps application so we're
going to jump into the maps application
on both of these devices and just see
how they compare in terms of general
performance so we're going to wait for
location here that is not where I am
this is no mount a bunch okay so we've
got the approximate location here and
let's turn off aerial view so we can
kind of get a similar sort of view and
let's clear the map good okay so let's
move around let's go up to New York City
you can kind of see these in real time
as I move around zoom out so we're using
Bing Maps over here google maps over
here of course you'll get the same big
maps on every Windows Phone 7 you'll get
the same google maps on every android so
really this is just taking kind of a
look at at the google maps at the
different mapping application so let's
go into New York so we've got sort of a
different style of matte purple roads
here you can kind of see how long it
takes for it to clear up Google Maps is
now vector based so things show up a
little bit faster then you would expect
on an older sort of mapping application
this Bing Maps is not vector based its
kind of based on little images that have
to load but if you're a fast Wi-Fi
network that's okay so if we zoom in a
lot here on the Google application
you're going to see
buildings pop up if I'm on the right
spot yep there I am buildings papa very
cool that doesn't happen in bing maps
and then you can do the two finger tilt
and the pivot this is probably one of
the coolest things that Google has done
which will really let you navigate and
be very precise when trying to find your
way bing maps looks a little bit archaic
in that respect when you get really
close it automatically turns into aerial
view and you zoom out a little bit
obviously two fingers doesn't do
anything but it's very smooth it's very
capable it certainly lets you find the
nearest starbucks or the nearest Burger
King whatever you happen to be looking
for so in terms of mapping applications
the default built-in mapping
applications the HTC Thunderbolt excels
in this area and if you get out there if
you're in New York City where they have
4G and you're moving around on the map
things are going to load super fast
because you're going to be over that 4G
LTE network whereas on the focus here
running on the 1880s 3g network things
might be slower in that respect so
hopefully this video was helpful if
you're looking at a windows phone 7
device versus an HTC Thunderbolt or an
Android device obviously there is a lot
more we could compare we just wanted to
do sort of an overview about pricing and
hardware and software to give you a
little bit more information again we've
also compared the HTC Thunderbolt with
the iphone and with the inspire 4G the
links should be up on the video right
now so you can jump to those if you want
if you like this video please give it a
thumbs up and thank you for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
