timepiece and Swiss watches but have you
heard of a Swiss SmartWatch I'm Michael
Fisher for PocketNow day two of Aoife
checking out the new micro nose
SmartWatch out of Switzerland let's
check it out so the first interesting
differentiator about this watch is you
can actually pop it out of its cradle
and leave the band separate and this
unit is entirely self-contained it is
not immersive it is water-resistant but
so you can you know you can wash dishes
within things like that but you can't
exactly take it with you first win but
that's okay because you can put it in
your pocket and leave it in your bag or
whatever use your power standby button
volume rocker there this is micro USB
it's how it charges microphones on this
side on the other side we've got
probably a noise cancelling mic not sure
about that but this is the speakerphone
so yes you can make and take calls right
on the watch via the Bluetooth
connection or it connects to your
smartphone three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack up top which we don't see
on a lot of these in a lanyard hole in
case you want to dangle it from your
wrist by the way make your notes also
carries some other products you can see
them down here in the case these are
earlier iterations of their SmartWatch
concept and there are ladies variants to
which are across the booth at the moment
so we can't show them to you immediately
but if we go ahead and turn the unit on
you can see they're using a resistive
touch screen for this and I'm not sure
if we can blow the frame there there we
go this is the the setting screen but if
we go back this is the home screen we
have access to your settings remote
control of your device the watch can be
set to remind you if you get too far
away from it sort of the standard suite
of features were used to seeing from
some Bluetooth devices it compared to
any Bluetooth enabled device they are
telling us they say without an app we
kind of have to check in on that and
make sure that is the case
earlier iterations could only let you
know if you were getting a call this
version will send the text message issue
as well and you can also if I can hop
back into the dialer here since it's
resistive you really have to stand on it
together to get it to go so in order to
show you the dialer we have to be we
have to be paired with a phone and
unfortunately it's not paired at the
moment but you can dial directly from
the watch we're just looking at a price
of about a hundred and twenty nine euro
on this model I believe the earlier
models are down to 269 these days but
it's interesting to see another take on
the SmartWatch concept this just
announced here at Aoife from Mykonos I'm
Michel with pocket now that's an tom
denote behind the camera once again it's
stay tuned for more coverage on this
other smart watches and other technology
