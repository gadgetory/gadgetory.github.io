Android your time is coming very soon
but there's apparently a catch
it seems that Samsung wants to change
its focus very soon as losses for the
galaxy as Lyoness nine-plus continue
we got hands-on videos of the dummies of
the iPhone 9 and iPhone 10 plus I'm hi
mary vera and definitely our podcast is
live remember to follow that in addition
to our spanish shell where pocket now
header goes live every day this is a
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals that lenovo smart
display has a relief shown that it's got
a lot of potential particularly with its
whole approach to a different version of
android just the functionality it's
extremely practical for those of you in
the market if you've got a Costco
membership you can get one right now for
$50 off and if you don't the Costco
membership at 60 bucks and then you can
get it so make sense you learn more in
the description now for those of you
liking what's happened I know that in
the United States it's not very popular
but outside the United States it's huge
everybody uses it videoconferencing is
now available for up to four people you
have to start a video call with one
person and then you can join the
conference with other people after that
definitely whatsapp has proven to be so
versatile in everything that it
continues adding just say that it's a
Facebook company now let's talk about
the iPhone 9 and iPhone 10 plus
yesterday we saw photos today we see the
dummy units on video these are probably
the worst 3d printed dummies that I've
ever seen I mean one of them looks even
curved but it just proves that the
design language of the iPhones and will
continue up to the point where it will
be really hard to distinguish one phone
from the other I think that's actually a
good thing if we're thinking that there
is gonna be an iPhone that's gonna be
more affordable let's just see what we
get in the end now let's move the
spotlight over to Samsung the company's
quarter results are in and the hudley
they're not good we're just a few days
away from the galaxy note 9 I hope that
fixes things because the company is
reporting up to 4 percent losses yet
again and bear in mind this is
definitely not the cycle for the phones
to sell the best in the case of the
Galaxy S line so it makes sense but this
is actually below the expectations so it
just proves that the company definitely
needs to spruce things up when it comes
to design we're the foldable displays
you're gonna play a big
whereas they tend for that and finally
the hot new says they have to do with
fortnight on Android we were skeptical
over it being exclusive to the galaxy
note 9 it seems that it will obviously
the company is not mentioning that but
it seems that we're not gonna get
fortnight on Android into a month later
but the list of phones is what worries
us follow the description there are
phones like oneplus devices that are not
being mentioned LG devices as well even
the Sony latest flagships are apparently
not on the list and we don't know if
this is a certification process where
we're just gonna have to wait for the
list to be updated but right now we only
get Galaxy devices in addition to
another list of phones that you can get
and follow in the description let us
know in the comments what do you think
are you looking forward to fortnight on
Android are you not in my case I'm not
really a gamer not the best one but the
Nintendo switches made me a believer and
for tonight on the switch is really cool
at least in my opinion I know you
experts are gonna be like oh my god this
guy likes fortnight on the switch but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
