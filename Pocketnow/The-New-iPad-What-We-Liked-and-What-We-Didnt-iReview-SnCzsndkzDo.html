number the new apple ecosystem now
supports 1080p and iOS 5.1 finally gets
released for us mortals all this and
more coming up right now hello everyone
this is Hyneman from pocketnow.com and
welcome to the pocket now I review the
show we go through all this week school
and the not-so-cool decide the world of
Apple's iOS devices call this a special
edition for the new iPad so let's start
talking about it that's right Apple has
just released their new iPad and they
decided to get rid of the number it kind
of makes sense since none of us carry
the ipod nano 6 or the macbook air three
but i guess we just got accustomed to
the number so now it kind of feels weird
the new ipad is no slouch though it
packs the retina display that we've all
been waiting for ever since the iphone 4
got released it's got quad core graphics
LTE support dual core hsdpa aside from
hspa+ a new 5-megapixel isight camera
and the optics that we all love from the
iphone 4s the price points don't change
with the original ipad or the ipad 2 and
you can expect the device to be shipping
and available as of mar 16 even though
under pre-orders it kind of gets a
little tricky because they're already
slipping to March 19th with all the pre
orders that have already been done so we
could recommend that you also visit
radioshack those are the only other
companies that are offering pre-orders
for now so stay tuned for your new iPad
now a bold move from Apple was to leave
the old iPad 2 in the market for 399 you
get the ipad 2 1 16 gigabytes and Wi-Fi
and for 529 you get the 16 gigabyte
model with 3g now best buy and apple
have pretty much dropped the prices of
all the current leaving ipad tools that
are available in stock so if you're out
there for an old 64 gigabyte ipad 2
would 3g well now's the time now how did
the ipad 2 in the new ipad compare well
both devices are the same height and the
same with but the ipad 2 was only point
33 inches thick and the new ipad is
thicker at Point 37 inches the new ipad
is also heavier since the old ipad to
wait only one
point 33 pounds and the new iPad ways
one point 44 pounds and add an extra two
grams if you want to compare that
between 3g and 4g the ipad 2 had a
screen resolution of only 20 24 x 768 at
132 pixels per inch or a new generation
ipad now doubles that at 2048 x 1536 at
264 pixels per inch the new ipad has the
a5x processor we're still waiting to
compare since they touted that it's even
better than Tegra 3 with the 12 cores of
GPU so it's kind of interesting to see
that performance may not be that
different with the ipad 2 when it
pertains to multitasking if there is
multitasking there but obviously
graphics are supposed to be better now
the ipad 2 only had 512 megabytes of ram
in comparison to the new ipad which has
one gigabyte storage hasn't changed and
well connectivity wise things have
changed dramatically since the old ipad
only had three GM this one has 4g LTE
hspa+ and dual carrier hsdpa let's not
even talk about cameras because the old
ipad 2 only had point 92 megapixels in
comparison to the 5 megapixels in the
new isight camera which is now decent
and battery wise even though we still
have the same 10 hours on both devices
there's a big difference here see the
old ipad 2 only had a 25 watt hour
battery in comparison to the new 40 2.5
watt hour battery included in the new
ipad now even though these specs don't
surpass in any way the old first
generation ipad the new ipad is better
in every way to which predecessors but
it's kind of curious to see how the
device will feel at hand because i did
feel that the first generation ipad was
a brick and comparison to the ipad 2 so
it'll be interesting to see how Apple
manages to handle the weight
distribution on this new device Apple
has also changed the game for iTunes and
all of their content ecosystem now
supporting 1080p in both iTunes movies
videos and just about everywhere I
believe in launched the new Apple TV
that we were expecting supporting 1080p
now they haven't mentioned if that has
an a4 a5 or whatever chip they have
we're not even sure if it's just the
same Apple TV with a software tweak that
tells the device have a new device here
so give me 1080p and the old devices
will still stay stuck at 10 7
EP but we'll see how it stands in the
future because obviously one of the
biggest questions that we have is how
the ipad 2 will scale 1080p content with
a screen resolution that has more pixels
kind of interesting to see once we have
our hands on review now iOS 5.1 was also
released to the market even though it
received very little buzz from apple it
doesn't lose the enhancements that we've
been waiting for in the iphone for us in
the ipad 2 but we found a separate video
to tell you everything about it and well
so far the changes have been quite good
they'll remember you're going to be
risking your jailbreak if you upgrade so
watch our video and think about it now
since we came about and then tell you
about how the battery life ended up
being let me just tell you there's no
big difference the iphone 4s is still
sadly not having the best battery life
ever okay so that does it for the cool
let's continue on with the not-so-cool
and let's begin talking about the
predictions that pretty much didn't make
it first of all iOS 6 was not released
and even though was expected well we
were expecting that Apple will finally
bring us some sort of UI changes with
the new iPad and their new Retina
display and sadly that was not the case
we're still stuck with the tad load of
icons and the old iOS UI and aside from
that we still didn't get Siri on the new
iPad and this is probably the biggest
question that everybody has now serious
a gimmick to many people it's useful to
others I only use it for task and just
to give me reminders for calendar events
people were waiting to at least get Siri
on this new device and we only get
dictation now if Apple's excuse was the
fact that you really need a device
that's permanently connected like the
iphone 4s has always stuck the data what
happened to the 3g or 4g ipad not
getting Siri there was no excuse for
that that's it for today show thank you
very much for watching I'm hi memory
data front pocket now and well don't
forget to leave us a comment down below
for anything you liked or didn't like
and also don't forget to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
