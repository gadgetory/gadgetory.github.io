number the new Apple ecosystem now
supports 1080p and iOS 5.1 finally gets
released for us mortals all this and
more coming up right now hello everyone
this is Hyneman from pocketnow.com and
welcome to the pocket now I review the
show we go through all the sweets cool
and the not so cool inside the world of
Apple's iOS devices call this a special
edition for the new iPad so let's start
talking about it that's right Apple has
just released their new iPad and they
decided to get rid of the number it kind
of makes sense since none of us carry
the iPod Nano 6 or the MacBook Air 3 but
I guess we just got accustomed to the
number so now it kind of feels weird
the new iPad it's no slouch though it
packs the Retina display that we've all
been waiting for ever since the iPhone 4
got released
it's got quad-core graphics LTE support
dual-core HSDPA aside from HSPA+ a new 5
megapixel iSight camera and the optics
that we all love from the iPhone for us
the price points don't change with the
original iPad or the iPad 2 and you can
expect the device to be shipping and
available as of March 16th even though
under pre-orders it kind of gets a
little tricky because they're already
slipping to March 19th with all the
pre-orders that have already been done
so we could recommend that you also
visit RadioShack those are the only
other companies that are offering
pre-orders for now so stay tuned for
your new iPad now a bold move from Apple
was to leave the old iPad 2 in the
market for 399 you can get the iPad 2
and 16 gigabytes and Wi-Fi and for 529
you can get the 16 gigabyte model with
3g now Best Buy and Apple have pretty
much dropped the prices of all the
current leaving iPad twos that are
available in stock so if you're out
there for an old 64 gigabyte iPad 2
would 3g well now's the time now how did
the iPad 2 and the new iPad compare well
both devices are the same height and the
same width but the iPad 2 was only point
33 inches thick and the new iPad is
thicker at point 37 inches
the new iPad is also heavier since the
old iPad 2 weight only
1.33 pounds and the new ipad weighs 1.44
pounds and add an extra two grams if you
want to compare that between 3G and 4G
the iPad 2 had a screen resolution of
only 20 24 by 7 6 8 at 132 pixels per
inch or a new generation iPad now
doubles that at 2048 by 1536 at 264
pixels per inch
the new iPad has the a5x processor we're
still waiting to compare since they
touted that it's even better than Tegra
3 with the 12 cores of GPU so it's kind
of interesting to see that performance
may not be that different with the iPad
2 when it pertains to multitasking if
there is multitasking there but
obviously graphics are supposed to be
better now the iPad 2 only had 512
megabytes of RAM in comparison to the
new iPad which has 1 gigabyte storage
hasn't changed and while connectivity
wise things have changed dramatically
since the old iPad only had 3g and this
one has 4G LTE HSPA+ and dual carrier
HSDPA let's not even talk about cameras
because the old iPad 2 only had point 92
megapixels in comparison to the 5
megapixels in the new I side camera
which is now decent and battery wise
even though we still have the same 10
hours on both devices there's a big
difference here see the old iPad 2 only
had a 25 watt hour battery in comparison
to the new 40 2.5 watt hour battery
included in the new iPad now even though
these specs don't surpass in any way the
old first generation iPad the new iPad
is better in every way to its
predecessors but it's kind of curious to
see how the device will feel at hand
because I did feel that the first
generation iPad was a brick and
comparison to the iPad 2 so it'll be
interesting to see how Apple manages to
handle the weight distribution on this
new device Apple has also changed the
game for iTunes and all of their content
ecosystem now supporting 1080p in both
iTunes movies videos and just about
everywhere at will even launched the new
Apple TV that we were expecting
supporting 1080p now they haven't
mentioned if that has an a4 a5 or
whatever chip they have we're not even
sure if it's just the same Apple TV with
a software tweak that tells the device
have a new device here so give me 1080p
and the old devices will still stay
stuck at 10
but we'll see how it stands in the
future because obviously one of the
biggest questions that we have is how
the ipad2 will scale 1080p content with
a screen resolution that has more pixels
kind of interesting to see once we have
our hands on review now iOS 5.1 was also
released to the market even though it
received very little buzz from Apple it
does include the enhancements that we've
been waiting for in the iPhone for us in
the iPad 2 but we filmed a separate
video to tell you everything about it
and well so far the changes have been
quite good though remember you're gonna
be risking your jailbreak if you upgrade
so watch our video and think about it
now since we came about and then tell
you about how the battery life ended up
being let me just tell you there's no
big difference the iPhone 4s is still
sadly not having the best battery life
ever ok so that does it for the cool
let's continue on with their not so cool
and let's begin talking about the
predictions that pretty much didn't make
it
first of all iOS 6 was not released and
even though it was expected well we were
expecting that Apple will finally bring
us some sort of UI changes with the new
iPad and their new Retina display and
sadly that was not the case we're still
stuck with the tad load of icons and the
old iOS UI and aside from that we still
didn't get Siri on the new iPad and this
is probably the biggest question that
everybody has now serious a gimmick to
many people it's useful to others I only
use it for tasks and just to give me
reminders for calendar events people
were waiting to at least get Siri on
this new device and we only get
dictation now if Apple's excuse was the
fact that you really need a device
that's permanently connected like the
iPhone 4s has always stuck the data what
happened to the 3G or 4G iPad not
getting Siri there was no excuse for
that that's it for today's show thank
you very much for watching I'm high
memory data from pocket now and well
don't forget to leave us a comment down
below for anything you liked or didn't
like and also don't forget to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
