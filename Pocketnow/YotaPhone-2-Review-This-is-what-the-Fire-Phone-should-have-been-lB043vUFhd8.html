with e-readers for a long time but the
latest from yota devices aspires to be
much more than just a Kindle bolted to a
smartphone so let's see if it succeeds
i'm michael fisher with pocket now's
video review of the yotaphone 2
the yotaphone 2 is a very comfortable
smartphone it's just under 9 millimeters
thick
smooth like an old pencil case and it is
choose modern edginess in favor of a
soothing rounded design that reminds me
of the old Nexus S it's tall but it's
also narrow making it very easy to use
with one hand branding is tastefully
confined to a small lower back tattoo
and casing penetrations are limited and
logically grouped with the speaker's
sharing a bay with the USB port and the
volume rocker doubling as a SIM tray
smart topping it all off beneath a
single sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 the 5
inch AMOLED screen is plenty vibrant and
at full HD also plenty sharp to see what
really sets the new Yoda phone apart
you've got to turn to the back except
there is no back there's just another
front this is Gorilla Glass 3 as well
except here it bears a matte finish and
protects an ePaper display or EPD that's
both smaller and lower res than the
front panel and offers 16 shades of grey
instead of 16 million colors it doesn't
have a backlight and like most ePaper
screens it also has a fairly low refresh
rate but in exchange for these
sacrifices yota says it offers up to 7
times more power efficiency than the
main display good for 18 hours of using
maps or 100 hours of reading and it's
approximately 4 zillion times better
than the AMOLED screen for reading and
bright sunlight citation needed that's
all well and good but what can you do on
the backside besides reading well pretty
much anything you can do on the front
side really just swipe up to enable
mirroring flip the phone over and voila
you're using Android on the EPD
naturally it's a much rougher experience
than on the frontside I kept looking for
ways to boost the contrast or somehow
speed up the experience but no such luck
fortunately yota thought of this and
provided software specifically designed
for the epd yota panel offers simplified
widgets for simple functions like
telling the time or checking the weather
and the beauty of ePaper is that it only
uses power when it
changing state so a panel like this with
very few moving elements is extremely
energy-efficient the only thing more
frugal is a screen that's entirely
static and that's where Yoda cover comes
into play you can throw any graphic you
want on the EPD to decorate it as you
see fit with no power penalty whatsoever
notifications are displayed in a variety
of eye catching animations and you can
also send screenshots immediately from
the front screen to the back with a
simple swipe handy for movie tickets
among other things
Yodas use of its extra canvas here is
very creative and in a field that can so
often seem stagnant it's also very
refreshing even in the most conventional
and predictable ePaper application
reading books it excels I devoured an
entire novel on the yotaphone zpd in a
single day on a single charge and it was
the best reading experience I've ever
had on a smartphone . that's not to say
there aren't rough spots the custom
software isn't the most intuitive and
it's also kind of inconsistent several
times I've used the yotaphone for
extended periods without realizing that
an old web page or calendar reminder is
still stuck on the EPD telling everyone
around me that I'm late for my and Bo
Jitsu match or whatever it seems to
flicker when refreshing notifications
which makes for an annoying desktop
companion at times and all the custom
software is bound to slow down the
Android update process as you can see
we're still stuck on KitKat here with no
firm timetable for a lollipop update the
camera isn't bad but unless you count
the alternately funny and creepy EPD
decorations that accompany it it's also
nothing really special you're shooting
with the stock Google camera app which
is fine bright indoor lighting and
daytime photos are also fine they're
fairly authentic and sharp enough
assuming you can get proper focus
low-light shots are prone to significant
noise and color accuracy problems but
for what it's worth I have seen worse
one bright point selfies are awesome
because you can use the EPD as a
viewfinder which means you can use the
primary camera and its LED flash if you
more camera samples in our full review
at pocket now for all its innovation the
yotaphone 2 is kind of uneven when it
comes to the basics the Snapdragon 800
processor is plenty capable of running
3d games and delivering a slick stock
Android experience but there's a pretty
bad keyboard lag that makes fast typing
very frustrating and that delay persists
even if you install an alternate
keyboard like Swift key and even if you
opt to use the EPD over the main display
voice quality is also just ok
I tested the yotaphone 2 on AT&amp;amp;T over
six days in Greater Boston and I almost
always wanted the earpiece to be louder
same goes for the speakerphone and the
included earbuds but kudos to Yoda for
tossing those in the box
at any rate LTE support is confined to
bands 3 7 &amp;amp; 24 now so I was stuck on 3G
for this review the high point in
performance comes in battery life
assuming you use the epd to its full
effect if you totally ignore the
backside and just use it as a typical
Android smartphone you can expect about
4 hours of screen on time with moderate
use a bit more if you use yoda energy
make the most of the ePaper though and
you can expect a lot more after I
switched my browsing tweeting and
reading to the backside I hit almost 8
hours of screen on time after 15 hours
off the charger and I still had 20%
battery left that's the day I read the
whole novel on the phone and then I
recharged wirelessly because of course
this phone features qi inductive
charging it's too cool not to is it cool
enough though to justify its price tag
at press time US carrier release details
were still muddy so for now with an
import price of 555 pound sterling that
makes this an eight hundred forty five
dollar smartphone yeah the battery life
can be awesome but you make a lot of
sacrifices to get it and other
smartphones offer similar power savings
without as much compromise
so the yotaphone - isn't for most people
or even for every hardcore geek there
are just too many cheaper options that
are both more practical and more
consistent for someone bored of the
conventional or looking for a clever way
to save on battery life it'll be a cool
if extravagant trinket but the real
market here is someone who loves reading
someone who's always juggling their
smartphone with their Kindle Nook or
Cobo for that person the yotaphone 2 is
the best combo since Percy and Mary
Shelley that's a narrow category of
consumer probably narrower than Yoda is
gunning for but it's the only one that I
think is likely to make the most of this
very special device at least in this
incarnation at least at this price point
we've got more in-depth Yoda phone
coverage here on YouTube and at
pocketnow.com stay tuned also for a look
at how the ePaper display on the back of
the phone works in an e-ink lesson next
