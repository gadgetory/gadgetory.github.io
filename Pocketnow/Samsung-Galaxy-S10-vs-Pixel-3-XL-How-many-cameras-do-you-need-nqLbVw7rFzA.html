Google and Samsung its stock Android
versus Samsung one UI it's a notch up
against the Infinity Oh display and it's
one camera versus three
hey this is PocketNow and I'm Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody
it's time to take a look at the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 plus against one of its main
competitors the Google pixel 3xl in
terms of design I'm sure everyone is
going to have differing opinions when it
comes to the display of the pixel 3xl
though I get it there is that notch
there and I kind of wish it wasn't there
either but now we have the alternative
to the notch in 2019 and that is the
hole punch or the hole in display what
Samsung calls the Infinity o in either
case the cutout is nestled in the
notification area so it's not like it
really gets in the way of anything
unless you expand your content in that
case you have to decide if you want a
hole or a frown cutting in aside from
this small loss in screen real estate
the s tens displays just so good it
renders colors vividly and Samsung one
UI looks great on it
the pixel 3xl display isn't bad in
comparison but it has one major flaw of
low brightness you have to really crank
it up in broad daylight the rest of
these phones are basically glass on
glass and I honestly can't really knock
either phone when it comes to looks they
both feel pretty light and easy to
handle aside from their larger size so
one-handed use takes a hit no matter
which one you pick a quick note on
design this glass on glass white Samsung
Galaxy S 10 plus looks really dope but
it can slip about in the hand a bit too
easily in order to give it a little bit
more texture a little bit more grip if
you will and also a completely different
look you can check out some D brand
skins they have them available now over
on their website along with a new
pattern called swarm you can check those
out in the links in the description down
below it's no surprise that Samsung
gives you a lot more to work with on the
hardware front there's a headphone jack
wireless and reverse wireless charging
expandable storage and even an extra
button for big speed on the other hand
you can squeeze the pixel to trigger
assistant and then use the phone like a
little Google home when it's sitting on
a pixel stand wireless charger I do have
to admit that the ultrasonic fingerprint
reader underneath the screen of the
galaxy s 10 is good but I found that the
rear mounted reader of the pixel 3 XL
and other phones that have it there are
more reliable in actually reading my
finger
thankfully the face unlock of the
Samsung phone is pretty quick despite
not being the most secure way of
unlocking the device if you have the
fast unlock option enabled performance
wise obviously the Galaxy S 10 plus is
going to have the top-notch
specifications as it has the most
updated specs as well the pixel 3 XL is
not really a slouch though but that 4
gigabytes of RAM is starting to feel
pretty outdated and honestly it's
getting tested by a lot of power
multitaskers games on the galaxy s 10
plus last way longer in the background
for example and even then they run
beautifully speaking of power users
though those looking for long battery
life definitely will want to go for the
galaxy s 10 plus which sports 4100
milliamp hours over the 30 for 30 in the
pixel 3 XL with the pixel I've had
plenty of times where I needed to plug
it in or do wireless charging before the
end of my workday but with the galaxy s
10 plus I've been able to recreate over
eight hours of screen on time on a
number of occasions stock Android is
properly feature packed and has all of
the tools that pretty much any user
needs for a good daily experience not to
mention the inherent benefits of using a
Google device like unlimited storage in
Google Photos but credit where credit's
do Samsung one UI is a leap forward and
what we used to call TouchWiz it has so
far been a good daily experience even
with redundant applications like
calendar for calendar big speed for
Google assistant gallery for Google
photos and so on it's not actually a bad
thing that Samsung makes their own
versions of these experiences as a
matter of fact on the galaxy s 10 plus
you might need to use a mixture of the
two in order to get the complete and
full experience
for example Samsung keyboard gives you
access to AR emojis the smart selecting
the edge panels grant customizable
screenshots and gift creation and
honestly the way that Samsung handles
full screen gestures is simply better
than the new stock Android mix of
presses and weird swipes stock Android
is dope don't get me wrong but my time
with Samsung one really shows me that
the OEMs can definitely add in features
that I didn't even know I wanted until I
use them and finally we have the cameras
there are some obvious differences
between these two packages with the
pixel 3 adding just a wide-angle selfie
camera on the front and the Galaxy has
10 plus totaling 3 on the back and two
on the front via and added depth sensor
now here's the thing we all know that
Google is all about the software
processing of its
and it leads to great results this is
true for portrait cutouts contrast and
color in all photos including ones from
the rear shooter the pixel can snap
better photos with one camera on the
rear then most phones can do with two
but the galaxy s 10 plus it puts up a
proper fight what the Galaxy S 10 Plus
provides way more than the pixel is
versatility you get a telephoto and a
wide-angle lens on the rear with the
wide-angle providing quite literally a
whole new perspective the only huge
omission here is a lack of a proper
night mode the pixels Knight sight is
almost like magic and makes something
out of pretty much nothing so let's put
it this way the pixel 3xl is simply a
beast for good looking ready to post
photos the same can be said for the
galaxy s 10 plus but you might need to
put in a little extra work to get the
final desired result but that's the
point
with the Samsung contender you might
have more than you might end up using
but that also means you probably have
everything that you would need the
Galaxy S 10 is also a great tool for
videographers as you can use any of the
cameras to great effect because the
video processing leads to sharp vivid
video there's even a super steady mode
that makes super stabilized but
ultimately much softer video the pixel 3
isn't bad in its main camera for video
but the front wide-angle lens gets
stifled by a lack of stabilization and
subpar video quality alright there you
have it
pixel three owners are you feeling the
galaxy Envy Samsung had to nail it on
phone number 10 and I really think
they've hit almost all the marks the
galaxy s 10 line sets the bar for 2019
but that doesn't mean the pixel 3 isn't
still a viable tool especially for
shutter bugs I want to know what you all
think about this comparison which one of
these two phones would you choose get
into the comment sections let your
voices be heard and let's have that
discussion for now though I'm gonna go
ahead and call it on this one thank you
so much for watching oh and subscribe to
both of our channels you can subscribe
to pocket now right here where you're
watching but also you can head over to
youtube.com slash Josh or Vergara so you
can see what else I'm up to as well but
from there thank you so much for
watching once again and I will see you
in our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
