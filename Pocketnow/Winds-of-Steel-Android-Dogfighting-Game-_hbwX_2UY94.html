I've got another one of those time
passing apps this time it's a game
called winds of steel and it's very very
addictive so you've been warned
winds of steel is an airplane flying
game more or so it's a dogfighting game
so let me fire this up and show you it
uses classic airplanes rather than new
and modern ones and the version that you
get from the market is a demo you can
unlock additional levels by of course
purchasing the deluxe version but it's a
fully playable single level game that is
really addictive and has an awful lot of
replay value to it so we're just going
to jump in here to instant action and we
are going to play and using the gyro you
can control your plane and you can see I
was too close to the ground and crash
there so we're going to play this again
this time I'm going to get some more
altitude and you do that just by pulling
back on the phone you can see right here
in the middle I've got some radar that
shows me where my enemy is and I just
have to swing around and try and get him
in my crosshairs and then I can fire at
him we'll let him go for a minute and
I'll show you this you can do all kinds
of cool aerial tricks you can do a loop
to come over this way you can do a
barrel roll for some elusive flying now
this is really cool it's addictive like
I said showing you on camera doesn't do
it justice so I really recommend that
you go out and try it it gets relatively
difficult when you get more than one guy
coming at you trying to shoot you down
as you're trying to shoot him down hey
we got him and he's he's going down in
flames so single player game also a
single level in this version but very
very fun very addictive go out and grab
a copy play it if you like it
great you can come back in here will X
out of this see what the Buy Now options
are can buy it in the Android Market or
through Dec 11 mo version is free and
that's all I've had and it's been plenty
fun you're looking at three euro which
is going to run you right around five
five-and-a-half bucks if I'm doing my
math right so give it a try let me know
what you think and if there are any
other flying games out there that you
like more than wins of Steel I
absolutely want to know about that leave
comments below if you like World War One
World War two style fighting let's let
me know in the comments give the video a
thumbs up and head on over to
pocketnow.com website so you can see all
the latest articles and tips and tricks
not just on Android but the majority of
the mobile devices out there so for
pocket now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
