today i'd like to show you something a
little bit different doesn't have
anything to do with android but it does
have everything to do with how we get
android content onto the site so today
i'd like to show you my server closet
like to show you my computer monitor and
keyboard you might get a kick out of
that and then my laptop where i render
most of my videos let's go take a look
at the closet did you ever wonder why
they call a server closet a server
closet well it's because you put your
server in a closet it doesn't need to be
out where everybody can see it just
needs to be tucked away so there's my
server but we'll get to that in just a
minute over here you see my comcast
cable modem how I bought this so I
didn't have to pay a five dollar a month
rental fee for it and I haven't had a
lick a problem with it since I got it
years and years ago moving over I've got
a buffalo 802 11 and gigabit router
which has served me very well I like it
quite a bit but between these two
devices it gets kind of hot so i hacked
together a nice little hundred and
twenty ml case fan hook that into a USB
connector and it spins nice and slow
sucks down just a little bit of power
and it blows right across my buffalo
router so keeps things nice and cool it
doesn't take up too much power so it's
really nice this buffalo moving to my
next device has an ass feature so i can
plug in a USB hard drive which is what
i've done here and have network attached
storage so kind of nice it's only 30 gig
but this is the drive that i pulled out
of my zune 30 when i upgraded my zune to
a 100 gig zune back before the 120s were
available so i had 100 gig zune in the
spare 30 gig drive laying around so i
bought this neat little enclosure hooked
it up and look at that now i've got a 30
gig nas sitting there for whatever I
want to do with it now this has Gigabit
Ethernet on it which is really important
when you're doing any kind of
high bandwidth stuff like uploading
videos for example but I ran out of
ports quickly that's okay I got this
little 10 100 switch gives me an extra
five ports so it's pretty good and it's
good for my low bandwidth stuff and when
I say low bandwidth what do I mean well
right next door I've got this neat
little linksys VoIP box tried to
standardize on linksys and then i went
with buffalo and I've been really happy
with the Buffalo so and what can I say
but back to this this is a VoIP bak now
in brandon's video you heard that he had
vonage for voice over IP I did too and I
loved it but then I heard about this
Canadian company called les net le s net
and they are wholesale VoIP provider and
I found that for about five dollars a
month I can get virtually everything
that vonage gave me and I could have my
own box so in fact I don't even need a
box i can type my my sip settings into a
sip provider on my android phone for
example and use that for my phone
provider it's really cool but this
little box hooks up to my houses phone
lines in fact it wherever that cable is
it's hooked up somewhere and it just
looks on into the phone line so the
whole house can talk through that box
over the internet and it's great so
let's move down here I've got a little
terabyte hard drive right there for
backups and it stays on all the time
connected via USB so the drives sleep
and it takes a very little power except
when it's doing backups so I really like
that a lot now I've cracked the case
open let me see if I can turn the light
on here for you light up the inside I've
cracked the side panel off so you can
take a look inside I run it with it on
all the time for better airflow what
I've got here is a machine I built
myself this is a quad core processor I
have we're going to go diagonal or
sideways here I've got two sticks of two
gig ram so total of four this is a
64-bit system you'll notice something
interesting down here I've got a good
video card that's a sound blaster and
then above that I've got a
high-definition digital hauppage video
card so this is my media center pc but
you'll notice i don't have an extra
video card in here i'll get to that in
just a second move it on out I've got a
whole bunch of hard drives right in
there only one of them is hooked up it's
a terabyte drive all the others are just
standbys I'm going to raid those up one
of these days I've got my DVD burner
right there I took my power button off
because I was always bumping that
accidentally multi card reader a zip 250
drive from back when will you zip sand
the throw back to floppies because you
never know so that's the server now why
don't I have a video card well the video
adapter in there is pretty high-end it
outputs 1080p without a problem so I
don't have any problem at all of that
and if you look over here on my UPS I'm
pulling 92 wats right now recording
high-definition on two different
channels and running everything in this
closet so for basically a little bit
more than a light bulb I'm running my
entire server closet not too bad and
that's what I was shooting for the less
power you use the cooler things are the
cooler things are the longer your
equipments going to last so that's the
server closet now let me go out and show
you what this is all hooked up to okay
so i won't here in the living room we
have this connected to my TV and I don't
even know how big that is anymore 50
some odd inches but the nice thing about
this is it's connected via HDMI so I can
go right off of my motherboard into this
TV and right now I'm just doing video
though technically I could do audio over
that hdmi port as well but I get full
high-definition screen you can see here
we've got pocket now up full width and I
still have enough over on the side of
the screen to to show you my system
information so kind of nice now how do I
get stuff into that computer well that's
where I have my logitech keyboard in
fact I think this is called the dinovo
mini what this is just a little
bluetooth keyboard various
small in fact to show you side-by-side
with my nexus one just how small this is
it's not bad the keyboard itself is
about the same size as the on-screen
keyboard on the Nexus and it's got this
little track pad on the side that
functions either is a mouse or let the
flip of the switch over here it can be a
directional pad which I actually switch
between those two quite often over here
I've got my logitech 5.1 surround sound
and I've got my subwoofer in the back
over there I've got a Microsoft
bluetooth mouse charger right next to it
and are we and then over here we have my
laptop this is a dell 11z i believe it's
a dual-core processor it doesn't have an
awful lot of power but this is where I
do most of my writing and also most of
the rendering of the video that i showed
in the uploading one thing I found is
802 11 n not reliable if you want to
upload half a gig with a video so i take
this and i plug it in right over here to
one of those at gigabit ethernet ports
and it works just fine takes a little
bit of time but it works great so that's
the setup it works really really well in
the future i'm probably going to get a
little bit more hard drive space right
that together so i've got more than a
terabyte of space on the media center
but you can tell I'm there's the closet
that the computer is in and there's the
cables that transfer out all of the
video and audio to the 5.1 surround it
works great so i can watch netflix on
there i can watch DVDs i can stream
stuff in from TV calm and i can watch
all of the pocket now videos in high
definition right there from the comfort
of my own couch so taking a look at the
hardware that powers pocketnow.com I'm
