you've ever told us I know right I need
to start repeating it more Hema it would
be really funny of you call yourself
James rivers on the Spanish videos
alright I'm actually gonna take that
into consideration after a long time yes
we're back that is right the PocketNow
daily recap is back I know you guys have
been asking for this it's really hard to
push as many videos as we do now that we
have the Spanish Channel but we figured
out a formula that's gonna work so here
we go again
hey meta we got on with pocket mail this
is the pocket out daily recap your
comments for last week so on Monday the
topic was Sony's new 48 megapixel camera
sensor on mobile phones I asked you do
you think that this is the depth for
point-and-shoot cameras we had 214
comments waiting shoot cameras have been
dead I thought you know it's funny I
thought so as well but no actually
Sony's been pushing out some really nice
point-and-shoot cameras from the RX line
these are more oddly prosumer cameras I
guess some of these could even replace
the camera that I'm currently using for
this video but definitely those old 200
$150 cameras yeah might as well buy a
smartphone
could you imagine a pixel phone with a
Sony sensor oMG pixel phones actually
have Sodhi sensors pretty much every
single OAM with the exception of
companies using Samsung's ISO cell
sensors and I do believe there are a few
others that are using some other
proprietaries but then Sony pretty much
dominates this market can't wait till
Apple buys this from Sony and Apple fans
think they made it
newsflash I believe Apple is the biggest
Saudi customer in this department and
it's one of the things that I've been
personally speculating imagine an iPhone
that has this 48 megapixel camera sensor
playing a part I think that that's
really what Apple needs to bring or else
competition will do so on Tuesday we
were talking about the Samsung Galaxy X
the rumors that this will be a gaming
phone tablet and I asked you what do you
think do you think that it's a good idea
for gaming phones to be foldable we had
354 comments I can't wait to see all
those soccer moms out there playing
candy crush on a 1k phone
okay soccer moms have you ever seen that
do says yes all right fine
you know I can't either particularly
because it's a gaming phone and candy
crush can be played anywhere really
gaming phones are useless I mean most of
these Android and Apple games can't even
be played with a controller just by a
switch or a PS Vita for portable gaming
you know I totally have to agree but
that doesn't mean that phones don't have
the power the thing about it is I feel
that playing with the display is
probably the worst user interface
available if you can't really feel any
buttons I have to totally agree the
experience just really sucks so I
totally understand the purpose of a
foldable phone and you have to display
on top and then you have the control to
the bottom the problem is or the
question will be can you feel these
controllers or is there some sort of an
adapter that brings the controller
functionality we'll see lol gaming they
don't run smooth or have high graphics
best example is Infinity Blade trilogy
yeah Infinity Blade trilogy is rather
old a lot of things have evolved since
then but I do have to agree that Unreal
Engine from back in the day it kind of
needs an upgrade totally right about
that then on Wednesday we talked about
the drama of the core i9 MacBook Pros
how Apple sent the software fix and I
asked you what do you think I mean Apple
is charging 3000 plus dollars for this
computer do you think that it's fair for
the company to charge so much and give
you an undercut product we had 168
comments Apple are smart they did it for
free publicity you know I do get it
there are certain even politicians that
use even negative publicity to be in the
limelight I just don't think that
negative publicity is the kind of
reputation that a company like this
would look for throttling solve still
runs close to 100 degrees yes I totally
agree I even believe that aluminum is
not necessarily the best material for a
laptop I do love the Dell approach with
carbon-fiber I don't like how it ages or
how smudgy it looks but yeah definitely
companies should consider other
materials to help out with the heat as
well but on Thursday we talked about
fortnight's back then the rumors were
that it was going to be an exclusive for
the Samsung Galaxy Note at night and I
asked you do you think that it's a good
idea for it to be an exclusive do you
like the idea or not we had five
59 comments the game will look amazing
on the note 9 I don't even like for
tonight but I might download it and get
the note 9 I do have to agree this is
probably gonna be one of the best
displays on a smartphone the problem and
as I mentioned previously is just gaming
on phones is cumbersome in my opinion
there we've had this discussion with
Diego my son over you know just how much
controllers make things easier how
fortnight doesn't really even make sense
with the typical controller you actually
need a keyboard and a mouse with a lot
of buttons to take full advantage of it
so we'll see I'm not buying a Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 it's too damn expensive
you know what I do have to agree for 950
plus dollars with those specifications
dude buy yourself a 1 plus 6 I think
you'll be better off with that and that
display is great as well I would buy the
note 9 anyway but I'm sure that it won't
be an exclusive for long anyway yes
anyway anyway I do agree and we also
have rumors coming further where we
learn that it's not going to be
exclusive for I believe more than a
month it's still I just I don't like it
when games are exclusive to a particular
phone and they force you to buy it I
think that's not the best practice of
anything shoot buy yourself a Galaxy
Note 9 and you'll get the battle pass or
something like that you get that for
free but not limit people to enjoy the
game and then finally on Friday we
discuss the rumours that Samsung might
bring its new unbreakable panel that
they showed off two devices like the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 and the fact that it
might also bring this technology to
foldable smartphones and my biggest
concern of it being plastic to a certain
degree and how this could scratch we had
236 comments I would love an unbreakable
phone I hate having to keep my beautiful
phone in a case but for clumsy people
like me it is necessary you know the
biggest problem is that I feel that
smartphone materials are not the best if
you think about it aluminium dents worse
than anything stainless steel not
necessarily but it scratches really ugly
so even if your display is unbreakable
the dents and the dings on aluminum are
gonna look horrible
anyways so it's not that I'm saying that
I prefer plastic I just feel that there
are better materials out there that they
could probably consider that would age
better that's why we have the hole after
the bus say
that we just rebooted right now I'll
believe it until I break it oh my god
true you know what this is going to
definitely warrant the drop test by her
buddy Joshua Vergara definitely
unbreakable that's just gonna be a rumor
I just want a solid display that can
withstand the fall of at least ten
meters of height or get solid points
from jerry-rigged everything oh my god
Zach Nelson is awesome a jerry-rigged
everything also a great friend I have a
lot of admiration for his work and his
jokes every time that he's tearing
something down or breaking a phone apart
but yes seriously I
I'll have to prove it yeah that's gonna
be my opinion definitely and for me it's
not just going to be if the product is
unbreakable for me what's most important
is how does that glass or plastic age if
it scratches then for me it's gonna be
an epic fail I mean we already have that
technology from Motorola we've seen it
from companies like the Samsung Galaxy
s8 active they scratch horribly so for
me I don't think that's gonna be the
best solution
we'll see friends again thank you so
much for watching and for your comments
and funnier you make them the better but
if you want some tips to get them to the
top first of all keep them short stick
to the point and s we'll try to get some
thumbs up it helps us spot them a lot
easier now to follow me on social media
hi manager Scooter get on twitter or hi
meta leave it on Instagram
please give this video thumbs up if you
like what you saw I'm hi Emily better
see you next week with more content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
