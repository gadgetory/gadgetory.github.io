of the android application weekly in
which we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started this
application is called bonsai blast and
it is free on the android market we have
two at game styles of imply either
adventure or survival so i'm going to
play adventure right here and it's a
pretty simple game all you could do is
make a chain of three or more objects
and then the objects of the marbles
disappear so we can start this game and
here we go all i have to do is aim at
the marbles and hit the screen and it
will launch one of the marbles under the
settings we can change the sound on
music on and vibrate on miss call is a
free notification utility the lodge to
customize each notification for each
specific person or application so right
here I have calendar service so I have
to just click on here and change all of
these settings I can change vibrate
sound and so I can go back and let's say
I want to know who I'm getting a text
message from without even having to look
at them well all I have to do is go here
and let's say that Brandon's sent me one
I can customize a vibration pattern or
sound file so that I can know who is
texting me before even after what you
might both across a tool pro is a free
photo sharing program that allows you to
search for photos as well as upload your
own photos so this application is free
on the android market and it's partnered
with google so all you have to do is log
in with your google user name and
password so let's say I wanted to search
for a photo I've just click here and
search for let's say Hawaii or something
and we'll pick one of these photos and I
can either set it as a wallpaper or
share it I can also go to my picasa web
albums and view all the photos that I've
uploaded to remove the ads it does cost
four dollars and ninety-nine cents so
this application is called tango and it
is free on the android market what it
allows you to do is make video calls
with one of your context so here i have
my sister and i can make a video call
crystal are you there
okay so as you can see I can make a
video call with my sister for free on
this tango application which is pretty
cool so you can also hang up on my
sister if I want I creating mute I can
also invite other context through email
or SMS to install this on their android
devices I can also change some of the
settings tracks trays are free
application available in the android
market and may help you save a little
cash and avoid getting tickets so this
application allows you to view of speed
traps in your area that are either set
up by police or photo enforcement
cameras so I have a speed trap right
here that I actually passed this morning
so I like to do is click on here and
agree with the speed trap and it will
upload to the server which makes it more
accurate you can also set up alerts so
when you approach a speed trap it alarms
