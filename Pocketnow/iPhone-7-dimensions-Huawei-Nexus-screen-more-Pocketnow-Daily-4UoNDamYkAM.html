thin the device might be we get a ton of
leaks regarding both Nexus devices to
come until we plan some major discounts
for its latest and greatest experience
I'm high Meadow iveta and the pocket out
daily will return next week I will be in
Vegas covering TTI a so yeah this video
pretty much came because I had to tell
you guys this is pocket out daily the
official news today start with the
hottest devices that we saw at Aoife
2015 the new sony xperia smartphones if
you are in the market for any of these
in your in europe then you are in luck
because sony's own store is starting to
sell these at a price tag that's crazy
it's almost two hundred dollars less
than the retail price tag that they
hinted which is great that's a great way
to start selling these devices like
hotcakes because they are kind of worth
the money and for those of you
interested in the future LG Nexus 5
which is apparently going to be the
nexus 5x we get some more leaks of the
back and yeah this is probably not the
hottest looking phone ever it actually
reminds me of a very cheap phone but
then again that is the whole scope
apparently LG and Google want to make
this a very affordable device to remind
us of the old Nexus 5 and Nexus 4 let's
just see what we get in the end moving
the spotlight over to the huawei nexus
those of you curious for its display
size we thought it would be just like
the Nexus 6 but we've got two
conflicting listings from trusted
sources that a claim that this device
will apparently be you know smaller
it'll have a 5.5 inch display instead of
what we get on the Nexus 6 which is a
very interesting change I just wonder
exactly why it will be called the Nexus
6 2015 or whatever the case may be but
stay tuned it could be that these
listings are just wrong we will learn
more soon and isn't it funny that we are
just a couple of days away from apple's
event for the iphone 6s and we already
get rumors of the iphone 7 we've got
trusted sources KGI securities they are
very famous for Apple leaks in their
accuracy they're already claiming that
the iphone 7 will be the thinnest device
ever not just from Apple but the
thinnest of isomer we're not exactly
sure how Apple plans to do that or what
the whole ideal will be for this product
to be unbendable because that was
obviously a concern we don't get any
details as to how many millimeters then
that product will be but that makes
sense obviously we don't want
competitors knowing right Apple and
finally for the very hot rumors of the
day the iPad pro is apparently going to
happen and we've got trusted sources
that plane what we are getting
apparently it'll ship with iowa's 9.1
for reasons we don't yet know but it
will have some software enhancements for
that in addition to that color options
will apparently be the same to the ones
we currently see on iPads but what's
going to make this device hot are
actually the accessories as apparently
we are getting a stylus and we are also
getting a keyboard accessory as well and
if this doesn't ring a bell to every
other Windows tablet that's out there
then hey where have you been apparently
you will also get two storage options 64
gigs in 128 gigs which is actually a
good thing but hey it leads me to the
question of the day yes there are a ton
of Windows tablets out there that bring
the features that apple will retail this
iPad pro with so what would this iPad
pro have to do or bring that would make
you want to buy it in my case let's just
be clear about this OS 10 if it doesn't
run a full operating system or a better
version of OS 10 or a better version of
iOS that's optimized I really wouldn't
care about it because it would not be a
productive tablet period but leave us a
comment down below what is your case
frenzied allah drill if he want to get
those earlier before this video was
filmed but she follow us on pine out
