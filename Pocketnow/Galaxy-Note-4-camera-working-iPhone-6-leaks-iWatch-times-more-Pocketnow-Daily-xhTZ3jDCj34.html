galaxy don't for camera can be because
the first reports on what to expect from
Windows Phone 8.1 gdr2 and if you're
waiting for an iWatch make sure you grab
a chair I'm high memory that I am just
remember guys or Aoife coverage starts
tomorrow so follow the first link in the
description for a full fifa 2014
coverage this is parking out daily today
is not for official news that will
actually happen tomorrow let's go
through some Aoife teasers sony has just
sent out a banner on its Twitter feed
showing us two meters of depth inside a
pool and teasing Sony Aoife 2014 so it
seems that the company has figured out a
way to bring us two meters in depth
which is like seven feet deep for you to
submerge their products and be able to
come back with them and still have them
working you know def does have a lot to
do with it for a specific amount of time
so why would you care about this try
dropping your phone inside the pool now
let's talk about Windows Phone gdr2 we
get the first teasers of what to expect
even though ddr1 hasn't really pushed to
every one just yet ddr2 is apparently
going to bring Cortana for every region
apparently we will get support for 2k
displays in obviously the Snapdragon 805
processor but even more interesting and
so much needed the fact that you'll
finally be able to sort your settings
alphabetically and search for things and
not have to go crazy trying to find the
about screen yes these things are coming
we just don't know when but teasers say
to once which is actually great that's
all about apple in the iphone 6 we've
got a leak video showing us the iphone 6
in working condition the 4.7 inch model
but there is a catch this is actually
not the finalized product that it's not
a league-high from from the assembly
this is actually a Russian website that
was able to put together an iphone with
all the leak parts and they have all the
leak parts you could see the video and
even though those cuts for the antennas
are probably not final oh my god that
phone does look elegant that's actually
a cool thing let's see what we get on
September 19 and for those of you that
are waiting for the iWatch be sure to
grab a chair grab some popcorn and watch
a couple of movies as a reports claim
that the product is far from bringing
ready it seems that the company is still
working on its manufacturing stages and
apparently at the stage that it's
currently at you can still change things
so the product is not really final then
it has to enter production stages and
then mass production so apparently we
won't be seeing a product until early
2015 so it's really hard to predict if
we will get the announcement on
September ninth but then again because
some credible sources claim that will
happen we're kind of mixed here and if
you're asking yourself where is the
green screening well long story short
the power went out and if you want the
pocket out daily today I can't wait for
it to come back so where was I oh yeah
and for the hot views of the day if you
look at the licks of the description
you'll notice that there are some sample
photos but these are not necessarily of
the galaxy note 4 these are actually of
the lenovo vibe z2 and the reason why
they're hot is because the phone
actually uses the same sensor that is
reportedly coming to the Galaxy Note or
and optically stabilized I so cell 16
megapixel sensor from Samsung and if you
look at the photos my god they are
gorgeous both in day and night these are
probably one of the best camera photos
we've seen from a smartphone yet
obviously if you move the Lumia 1020
aside but clearly this is a big selling
point for this phone but that leads you
to the question of the day is this
camera and the sample photos is this
really what you want on the Galaxy Note
4 would this make you buy the phone if
you're still waiting to consider if you
want to buy a phablet or not because in
my case I love babbitt's and yes the
camera is one of the biggest reasons why
I don't like the Galaxy Note 3 at times
so this would be perfect leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
thank you for understanding this new
setup and friends you know the drill if
you want to get it was earlier before
this video was finishing follow us on
 outcomes disruptor youtube
channel as well it also follow me on
twitter highlanders quarter iveta let's
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am hanging every better
thank you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
