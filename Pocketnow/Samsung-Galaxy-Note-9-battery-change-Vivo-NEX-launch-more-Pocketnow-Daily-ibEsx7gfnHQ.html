Note 9 might get a bigger battery than
we expected Samsung and LG are
apparently trying to kill both the bezel
and the knotch next year well that would
be LG and speaking about bezels the vivo
NEX was just announced and it is barely
offering any sort of bezels I'm Jaime
Oliveira and you guess that pre
recording is great I'm able to prepare
this video for you guys but I'm actually
traveling today this is pocket out daily
the official news today begin with deals
buy one get one free deals are available
for iPhones iPhone 8 iPhone 10 it all
depends on what combination you pick the
pricing you'll get in the conditions the
iPhones continue to be great phones
believe it or not the iPhone 8 being one
of my favorites even with the bezels you
can learn more about the deals in the
description these are Father's Day deals
those of you that want to send me a
phone I would love it
and as for non deals believe it or not
the snapchat spectacles are now
available on Amazon finally don't know
what took them so long
you know if they would have launched on
Amazon initially I would have probably
bought the first generation the second
one retains the same ugly design $150
god snapchat I would really want to use
these things and I would actually use
snapchat if I could it's just come on
man give us another design and I would
totally go for it now let's talk about
the vivo next believe it or not I
actually could not be part of that event
because of this trip that I'm doing
today it was just too crazy to go to
Shanghai and then to make this other
trip sadly I wasn't able to be there for
the coverage but the vivo NEX is my god
that thing is a beast great
specification squak up snapdragon 845
all the bells and whistles all the
storage you want a huge battery the
advantage that it's got a crazy 93
percent screen to body ratio I think I
got that right correct me if I'm wrong
and best of all if you want a selfie cam
it comes from the top it elevates it and
then goes down and I can't wait to give
it a try I asked them to send me a unit
hopefully that'll happen soon I'll keep
you posted now let's talk about Samsung
and LG more LG as a the
rumors are that the companies are both
working on ways to kill the bezel and
also killed notches I'm talking about
you LG not Samsung we don't have to deal
with that there but apparently they're
working together not necessarily
together but both companies are working
on the same thing meaning they're
looking to implement bone conduction
technology and some sort of a solution
for the selfie cam in order for the
company to offer a full screen and no
bezels I find that to be great whatever
companies do in order to make phones
smaller but give us larger screens is
all great for me let's just see who does
it first
usually it's LG but then Samsung takes
all the credit and finally the hottest
news that they have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 we saw renders of
horizontal cameras instead of vertical
for this phone following what we saw
with the Galaxy Note 8 and apparently
we've got some sources that are claiming
that there's a reason for that it seems
that the battery is not going to be 38
50 apparently we're getting a four
thousand milliamp hour battery this is a
first on the know we've had this battery
size for active smart phones from
Samsung for a while so yeah it would be
great but in today's question let us
know I mean do you mind if the cameras
are vertical horizontal because in my
case I don't really care so long as the
fingerprint scanner is reachable and the
battery is large let's go for it but
that's just me leave us a comment down
