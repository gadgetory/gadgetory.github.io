Beats Audio sony ericsson prepared the
new Xperia Arc HD and what's this about
unreleased phones like the Galaxy Nexus
already rooted all this and more coming
up right now
hello everyone I'm high memory that I
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
android revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
let start this week off with what's hot
all right so HTC is November third event
happened on scheduled and as we rumoured
last week they release their new beats
audio smartphone though the sad part
here is they chose to keep the name
riselle and then it wasn't just a
codename so yeah this is the new name of
their new smartphone flagship because
first of all is the first hcc device to
bring a 720p resolution display aside
from really great specs so a lot of
really good information is available
down in the description where we can
show you all the specs and well as
expected it comes to verizon first
except for everybody else so expect it
on november 14th for 300 bucks on a
two-year contract going through some
other releases motorola has just
announced their new zoom to and zoom to
media edition tablets good specs on each
though the sad part here is our
expectations aren't really that high
because we're kind of underwhelmed with
the zoom original performance so we're
hoping that motorola really puts their
money where the tablet is this time and
though AT&amp;amp;T has also announced that
they'll be offering their samsung galaxy
s2 skyrocket and HTC Vivid devices which
bring LTE to AT&amp;amp;T though remember LT is
really not the big deal right now on
AT&amp;amp;T so we're not really sure you want
to pay 300 or 250 bucks respectively for
each of these devices so again it's
going to be your choice out of this
week's rumors sony which was previously
known as sony ericsson because they
bought the ericsson part it's still
called sony ericsson just brought new
rumors to the table because we are
expecting a new arc HD smartphone as
their new flagship smartphone to come up
with better specs that compete with HTC
and samsung so far they are picking up
the pace by upgrading their current
flagship smartphones to Gingerbread no
matter how old they are so we are
expecting some really good stuff coming
in from Sony we seem to have an
interesting note where the android
market will soon be able to accept
paypal is a new payment option our
thoughts about that is what took them so
long and well finally LG is recently
showing off a you one smartphone with
ice cream sandwich in the future not
really sure we're going to get that but
let's hope it's going to be soon
out of this week's coverage make sure
you catch show Levi's recent article
showing us how to speed up our web
browsing and also our Android Market
browsing with this new dns tweak full
link in the description joe also take
some time to share for great android
applications to help us get in shape in
my case is i'm already round in shape
i'm definitely going to catch that after
i record and finally joe also caught
this Nintendo duck port coming to
Android so make sure you catch the link
in the description on how to get it
because it's cool but sadly the laser
gun won't work or a taser gun or light
gun or whatever was called heading on
over to the dark side it's interesting
to see that Google hasn't released their
Galaxy Nexus and well HTC has barely
announced a renowned and well there are
rumors already that the devices have
already rooted now sadly we can't
confirm that this is true because nobody
has the devices yet so wait for these
devices to make it to our pocket now
labs and will definitely confirm that's
available and how to do it that does it
for what's hot let's continue on with
what's not in while many of us are
definitely disappointed with Android
manufacturers first of all they do a
really good job in bringing these really
great events showing us their new phones
like for example the motorola droid razr
and the Galaxy Nexus but sadly we didn't
get release dates nobody brought out
release dates and we really don't know
what's going on with these manufacturers
and why not giving specific dates as to
when they'll release their devices so
far we already know when the Galaxy
Nexus will make it to town and while the
droid razr is finally making it on
November 11th but still I mean Android
manufacturers really need to do a really
good job and working on giving specific
dates for people to actually anticipate
the devices if not people don't know the
dates and what they do is end up buying
other things like other smartphones
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm Jaime believe
it I remember to give us a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
