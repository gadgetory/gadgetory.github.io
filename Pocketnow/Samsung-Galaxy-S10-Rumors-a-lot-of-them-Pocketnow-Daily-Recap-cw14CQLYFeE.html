friendly reminder that I need to get
back in the gym is it just me or does
Jamie say McClaren weird is it just me
or do you say my name weird what is this
just read it man
hey everyone friendly reminder to
subscribe to PewDiePie the world leads
you that's right it's that time of the
week I am Jaime give it up this is
PocketNow and this is the bye now daily
recap your comments for last week so
Monday the topic was the cat renders
that emerge of the galaxy as 10 where we
saw the infinity Oh display ask you what
did you think about this and we had 532
comments well hope those s 10 renders
are fake it's worse than the knotch
because since it's lower it takes more
real estate and it isn't really small
either you know what dude I am probably
the biggest question I have is what the
Samsung plan to do with the user
interface for that infinity Oh to fit
and actually makes sense and not look
weird
they sit infinity own an affinity oh
yeah buddy lay true I mean like I get
the whole purpose of multicam I just wow
that it's a tough sell it's a hard one
yeah top and bottom bezels with a
gapping big hole in the screen is this
an out of season April Fool's joke looks
more like an in-n-out burger then on
Tuesday the topic war the Galaxy S 10
renders I ask you what do you think
about those primarily for the back
camera we had 370 comments I think that
the S 10 leaks are fake and it's a
possibility or you know their companies
go through different stages of
prototyping so it could just be that as
well I do not know how to feel about
this design yet I'll know once I hold
the phone
fine right the punch hole in the corner
hurts my love for symmetry dude that is
the top comment of the week like
seriously yes indeed there is nothing
symmetrical about this but hopefully the
sophomore compensates for that I
I assume then on Wednesday the topic
were the rumors of oneplus being the
first phone with five g1 plus seven I
guess and well the fact that it's gonna
probably get more expensive so I asked
you would you buy this phone and we had
154 comments I don't need five G and I
think they should do everything they can
to keep the price the same price is what
they built the brand on we are loyal to
them totally agree and bear in mind you
have to understand that the Snapdragon
855 doesn't include 5g on it soon you
require a separate chip for that so it I
assume that what we'll have is a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 model with and
without and you get to pick and you pay
for what you want until 5g is rolled out
nationally in all major cities I have no
plans that grab a phone that can't fully
use its features because of industry
technology limitations true that and if
you're the person that switches phones
all the time then sure that makes sense
for you to wait it out until your next
phone but for people that are gonna be
buying a phone every two three years
it's probably a good idea to get on the
bandwagon early because obviously the
deployment is not gonna take that long I
assume imagine 200 dollars extra for 5g
I'd rather wait until it's a bit more
standard it's not like if the network is
deployed yet anyway in the world true
that that's a good approach it all
depends on your particular needs and you
know what there are certain days where I
actually wonder if I should instead ask
you what do you want to comment on
because like for example on Thursday the
whole topic was the clock of Snapdragon
8c X I asked you if that was the future
of computing and you decided to spend
the whole comments talking about Apple
of 280 comments Apple is struggling with
sales because of competition and prices
I know iPhone so like hot case in the
United States but around the world it is
another story too expensive so fine
let's talk about Apple cuz the whole
topic was Apple sales on the client and
everything and true I feel that price
goes up demand goes down that's just the
way it's a mathematical fact at some
point that was gonna hit Apple for
starters Apple can give away its fast
charging adapter and cable for free with
every iPhone purchased to boost sales
you know honestly from judge
from everybody that I know that owns and
I found nobody ponies up those 75 bucks
I don't think a fast charger in the box
is going to boost sales I think that
Apple really needs to stop cheeping out
its customers with such an essential for
seven hundred and fifty dollars the 10r
should have a 1080p screen I don't care
what any says dude I totally have to
agree like 750 you get really good
screens on the poco phone for like what
four dollars less it's just it truly is
unfortunate that this phone is priced so
high for what you get and then finally
Friday we had other leaks now of screen
protectors with that infinity oh in a
corner not in the middle I asked you
wouldn't you think about this approach
we had 376 comments Sam should offer the
SM option with no front facing camera I
think most don't care about them you
know I don't think that it's the fact
that people don't care it's just that
some of these selfie cameras are like
really bad the problem is how do you use
the primary camera as a solution and
we've seen vivo and Nubia play with the
idea of a secondary display for you to
use the primary which honestly I feel to
be the best approach because sadly and
it's just the way it is in the United
States it's not necessarily the case but
in Asia taking selfies is huge the SN
would look great with one really great
front selfie camera so that the cutout
is smaller you know that's an
interesting point uh the larger the
camera hole from what I've learned from
engineers the cheaper the camera so it's
it's a design thing and I'm not an
expert please if anybody is in the
comments chime in on this so what's the
difference s10 has not in between the
screen I feel the water dropped a notch
by Opel which is more appealing okay I
didn't read that wrong that's how you
wrote it you know the teardrop design is
good the essential phone design is good
I actually like the galaxy approach
where you had minor bezels and all the
modules and there and stereo speakers so
honestly I mean do we really have to
continue this trend I get it Samsung
needs to change this design because
their folks are not selling great I get
that it's time for a change
I just I don't know if this is the best
approach but that's just me that's it
