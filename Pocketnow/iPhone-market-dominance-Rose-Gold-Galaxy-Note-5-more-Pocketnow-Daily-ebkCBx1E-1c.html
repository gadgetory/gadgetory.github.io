reveal how well the iphone is selling in
the united states samsung wraps up his
galaxy note5 options now with new colors
and LG has just surprised everyone with
its speed at deploying Android six title
marshmallow I'm hi meri behna waiting
patiently for AT&amp;amp;T to follow the trend
from LG and update my g4 from AT&amp;amp;T this
is rocking out daily the official news
today begin with Lenovo and cyanogenmod
we thought that the Nova was not going
to launch any more phones but it seems
that there was still one missing the zuk
see one or a souk z1 or whatever you
want to pronounce this thing it's
actually a cyanogenmod powered
smartphone meaning yeah you get all the
liberties you want from cyanogenmod
which is great but the interesting part
is that this is actually more of a
mid-ranger if not an entry-level
smartphone that's being launched in
Europe right now we will see if we get
one for review other official news have
to do with LG the company surprises us
again last year the company was one of
the first OEMs to bring lollipop to its
g3 after obviously the Nexus devices
received it and asset now LG g4 units
are claiming to be receiving Android 6
title marshmallow you still get the same
LG skin but it seems that the whole
partnership between Google and LG is
actually paying off of this company just
like it did for Motorola at some point
so let's see when carrier variants of
the g4 will be getting marshmallow it
should be just the matter of time
speaking of LG you know how that rivalry
is between LG and Samsung and that's we
cover the news of a foldable display
coming to Samsung smartphones next year
we hear rumors that LG is doing the same
up to the point where companies are
actually working on the you know not
necessarily just manufacturing but
actually giving us a product that we can
see and then taking it from there we
even hear the option of an 11 inch
tablet that can fold I remember a
comment of yours back in the daily recap
that mentioned the option of the tablet
which is a really great idea of lets you
see how long it will take and moving the
spotlight over to Samsung what is a
galaxy phone without it trying to look
like some competitor and as of today
there is a new rose gold galaxy note5
option
yeah I know in addition to that we also
get a titanium variant and what makes
this rose gold special is that Valley
it'll be an exclusive 64 gig variant
they haven't been able to confirm that
though so we will keep you posted but
yeah for those of you wanting a note 5
you probably should wait if you want
these colors and finally the interesting
news of the day actually have to do with
the market share figures we talked about
yesterday though yesterday we talked
about worldwide numbers today we have
details only for the United States and
China yesterday we learned that Samsung
is the feeding apple by a major amount
of smartphone sales but then in the case
of the United States and China apple
owns the market forty-three percent of
the United States forty-two percent in
China which is something major to say I
mean China is a huge market and then
Apple dominates it in a way that's a
rather hard to believe though hey it
leads me to the question of the day so
if I phones aren't necessarily cheap
smartphones and they're not necessarily
phones that everybody loves because
they're not customizable or anything why
do you think they're so popular why do
you think everybody and their brother
has an iphone as I've noticed in the
streets in my case I think that it has a
lot to do with marketing and it also has
to do a lot with reliability Apple has
found a good mixture that is not
overbearing but leave us a comment down
below we would love to know your opinion
