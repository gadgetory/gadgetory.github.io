new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it
let's take a look at the device several
months after its release when it's not
shiny and new anymore I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow this is the Google
Nexus 10 and this is episode 18 of after
the buzz released alongside the LG made
Nexus 4 the Nexus 10 by Samsung was one
of the best tablets to hit the market in
2012 it has now been around for over six
months
so how is it holding up against the
competition when it comes to hardware
software and performance really well
actually when it was first released the
Nexus 10 had some of the best
specifications the tablet market had
ever seen particularly its display and
its build quality and design while quite
simple are spectacular besides a backer
cover blow the tacky soft touch plastic
that really allows you to get a great
grip on the device and it only 603 grams
and 8.9 millimeters thick it's
lightweight and easy to hang on to even
only one-handed despite being passed
around through a few hands our Nexus 10
unit has held up exceptionally well over
the last six months and those beefy
specifications have yet to really lose
their luster the 1.7 gigahertz dual core
Exynos while not the most powerful chip
on the market is powerful enough to
muscle through graphic intensive gaming
and push the 4 million pixels with ease
speaking of 4 million pixels the Nexus
10 still has the highest resolution
display on a tablet to date 2560 by 1600
pixels at 10.1 inches for roughly 299
pixels per inch this contrast isn't the
best plex aren't exactly very inky but
the color reproduction clarity wide
viewing angles and brightness are
top-notch around back there is a cover
that is removable for the integrated
cover offered in Google Play
unfortunately the cover on our unit has
trouble staying in place as if the
the clips are worn out but it's rarely
ever been taken off since we don't even
have the cover
lastly the speakers are one thing that
put this device over the top for
multimedia of consumption the large
stereo speakers are positioned on each
side of the front of the tablet and
they're loud very loud and they're
virtually impossible to cover up my
accident as far as hardware goes the
Nexus 10 is still one of the best
tablets ever made
software unfortunately is still a hit or
miss with the Nexus 10 or any large
Android tablet for that matter as
beautiful as the display may be there is
still a lot of content such as apps and
games that do not take advantage of the
extra real estate or extra pixels some
developers have yet to update their
icons and many of the applications and
games simply are not compatible with the
Nexus 10's resolution Facebook for
example still does not have a tablet
optimized Android application agenda
calendar is restricted to portrait and a
lot of other applications are still
phone only on a brighter note this
device is a nexus which means it's
currently running the latest Android
firmware 4.2.2 and takes advantage of
all the new features such as multi-user
support lock screen widgets project
butter wireless display support and much
more and when you find content that is
optimized for the high-res display its
fantastic movies for example look
phenomenal books magazines and optimized
apps and games look great as well
it's truly unfortunate that Android is
still suffering from growing pains in
the tablet realm but it's worth noting
that Google was adamant about developers
adding tablet support for apps at Google
i/o and more and more high quality apps
and content are added each day the high
note for the Nexus 10 is performance
unlike many tablets before the Nexus 10
suffers from very few stutters and very
little lag although it doesn't score as
high as some newer phones or tablets and
benchmarks those tests don't always
translate to real-world performance or
prove a lack thereof the 1.7 gigahertz
dual core Exynos chip has no trouble in
day-to-day performance and it handles
most games and productivity apps
exceptionally well that said not every
game plays perfectly the framerate
dropped significantly in asphalt 7 with
a 9000 milliamp hour battery keeping
everything going the battery life is
great so long as you don't crank the
brightness all the way up
you can almost watch the battery drain
away when it's at full brightness but at
roughly 50% or less
it lasted most of the day if not all day
after six months the Nexus 10 by Samsung
is still one of the highest caliber
tablets on the market its display boasts
a full 1 million pixels more than the
third and fourth generation iPad
displays it operates with few stutters
and holds up moderately well in the
battery life department for multimedia
productivity and everything in between
the Nexus 10 is still one of the best if
not the best Android tablet on the
market and considering it starts at just
399 for the 16 gigabyte model it's still
not a bad deal that's gonna wrap up this
