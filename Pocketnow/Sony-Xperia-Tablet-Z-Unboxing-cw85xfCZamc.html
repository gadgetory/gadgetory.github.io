tablet during our hands-on time with it
at this year's MWC in Barcelona and now
thanks to a rush shipping job from Negra
electronics we have one here in our
Boston offices it was in Hong Kong last
night it's in Boston today so let's get
to unboxing it I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is our unboxing of
the sony xperia tablet z well it has
definitely been a little while since
we've unboxed a tablet this takes up a
whole lot of the frame because this is a
large 10 inch tablet so let's have a
look let's see if we can fight the glare
of our overhead lighting here this is
the the front cover with the device
front and center obviously we'll get to
that in a second take it out of the
frame flip it on over and we can see
what sony is trying to highlight here on
the packaging we've got call-outs for a
whole bunch of stuff there optic
contrast panel which is a 10.1 inch
display which we've seen a second front
surround certified for PlayStation of
course the bravia Mobile BRAVIA Engine
Android X more Wi-Fi all those HDMI out
and all the kind of stuff that we're
used to our Nespresso or I'm sorry NFC
logo USB HD 8 megapixel camera and a
quad-core 1.5 gigahertz processor that's
a Snapdragon s4 pro if you're interested
and we know it's a special moment when
you first penetrate the packaging so
that's exactly what we're going to do
we're going to go ahead and slice this
open somewhat roughly there and there we
are we are now clear to lift the box lid
and there she is the device having
arrived intact front and center in the
packaging wrapped in a very elaborate
bit of plastic sheeting here we'll go
ahead and put the device aside and give
you a look at what's in the box this is
obviously not a US power adapter but
Negri was kind enough to give us an
adapter in the box so we can charge the
device that's nice here is a very
standard micro USB cable and since it
would seem the documentation is the only
thing left in here let's just go through
it very quickly we have what looks like
a user guide here a specification sheet
and a tight shot on those specs for
those interested in what's under the
hood we have model name and number
operating our system is obviously
Android there's that Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 pro we talked about before backed up
by two gigs of RAM we can see 10.1 inch
display like we said before storage
options 16 or 32 gigs and here we have
startup guides in many different
languages and finally some special
offers and Xperia care for your warranty
support and that is all there is to it
coming back to the device let's see if
we can take this out of its protective
packaging as far as the hardware goes
this is a 495 gram device it actually
feels a lot lighter and probably a lot
of that has to do with the fact that it
is ridiculously slim 6.9 millimeters I
think just a hair thinner than the iPad
Mini which is outrageously thin
definitely feels lighter than it
actually is on paper folks this is a
this is quite something to hold
completely unrehearsed observation there
looks like the back cover is not
protected by a by a sheet of plastic so
we're going to go ahead and pop off this
front one here and see if we can get a
nice crisp sound of this at there's a
beautiful thing and there she is
so because of the very reflective front
panel it's tough to get focused there so
we're just going to take a look at the
device on the outside here there's our 8
megapixel shooter up top NFC logo called
out down below and just the expiry of
rending on the back otherwise this is
just a solid very soft plate of a back
oh tablet coming around to the side here
we can see there's nothing going on on
the right side nothing going on on the
top but on the left-hand side here we
have ports for headphone power button
volume up volume down some I think
charging connectors there as well as the
side mounted speaker notice all of this
is without too many penetrations in the
casing because the tablet Z is water
resistant which is an amazing and very
very unique touch and folks just to wrap
up the unboxing we're going to go ahead
and give the Xperia tablet Z its first
boot we're pressing and holding and
hopefully we've got some battery charge
in here boom
we've got enough to show us the sony
logo so that's a good thing
look at that Sony is no stranger to
displaying some rather intense colors on
on its tablets we definitely saw
definitely remember I think this
wallpaper from MWC really really pop in
here in the booth you can swipe up or
down to unlock and here is our initial
setup screen going to be taking a much
closer look at this tablet next few
hours folks but for now that's what it's
like to take the Xperia tablet Z out of
the box folks we're going to spend some
time today getting to know the tablet Z
here in the Boston offices and we'll be
back with some in-depth first
impressions in just a few hours so stay
tuned to PocketNow for that and also
stay tuned for some more unboxing action
it's going to be a busy day a busy
weekend a busy week as always a pocket
