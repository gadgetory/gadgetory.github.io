of the samsung galaxy s4 and Galaxy gear
Motorola plans to sell you wouldn't
variants of the Moto X continue to
surface and it seems that Apple is
finally catching up with their demands
of the iphone 5s I'm hi mera neta and I
apologize for the noise trust me it's
not raining cats and dogs it sounds more
like elephants on lines but this is
clocking out daily those are they off
with some official news as those of you
that are carrying a tmobile variant of
the galaxy s4 will be lucky to be
getting Android 4.3 as of today you know
how those rollouts work but it means
that the variance of the galaxy s4 in
the United States are finally getting
4.3 so this is good for 4.4 whenever
that happens but aside from that if
you're using a u.s. beriant of the
galaxy gear you should also be getting
an update today or probably tomorrow or
in the next coming days that'll bring
you the enhancements that were brought
to the European Galaxy gear which
actually helps you with your
notifications and everything so yeah
very compelling update and speaking of
Samsung we've got more details of the
Samsung Galaxy s5 when it comes to its
timeline and when it comes to
specifications we've got a 64-bit Exynos
processor along with more RAM and
everything and links down below for
details but even more interesting is
that apparently Samsung is planning to
launch two phones and listen to this
we're gonna get one that's metallic and
one that's plastic and more affordable
and if it doesn't ring a bell to you
just think iphone 5s and iphone 5c as
well apparently the time lines will be
somewhere in early 2014 not necessarily
maze so stay tuned for that now let's
talk about Nokia's the company has just
announced their Nokia Lumia 525 and the
reason why this is important is because
this is a very affordable and quite good
phone that's gonna be launched here I
mean for this is pretty much a sequel to
the 520 only this one won't cost you one
hundred dollars on the Home Shopping
Network it'll cost you two hundred
dollars unlock no contract nothing which
is great and the specifications are
quite decent it's a decent bump from the
520 so this is a good competitor to the
Moto G if you want to pay very little
for a phone that's actually good and in
specification so let's description for
details and speaking of motorola please
raise your hands which of you are still
interested in getting a wooden phone
I know nobody but anyways the company is
apparently teasing that they will have
their wooden Moto X by the holiday
season which well should be in the next
coming days but actually is apparently
three weeks from now so if you're
expecting a Moto X with a wooden bag
apparently you will have to pay an extra
amount of money we don't know details on
that just yet but you know the biggest
question would be how about motorola to
give me the wooden back and even charge
me a little more money for a better
camera i'd be willing to pay for that
and finally for the interesting news of
the day it seems that Apple has finally
begun to meet their demands with the
iphone 5s for those of you that are
still wanting to buy this phone
according to surveys and Alice the
company is now being able to meet ninety
percent of their demand meaning ninety
percent of the people that want the
phone now can get it now and not like in
the case of many people that have waited
almost a month to be able to get this
phone but you know I always ask myself
this question and that leads me to the
question of the day do you believe that
all this extra demand of every iPhone
that gets launched is real or just fake
for the company to drive the man for the
phone because honestly in my particular
case I just can't believe that Apple
after so many years cannot figure out
how to meet at the man of this phone but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
