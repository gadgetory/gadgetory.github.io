difference what are the advantages to
both I'm Joe Levi with pocket now and on
this episode of the pocket now power
user we're going to talk about what you
want on it your next smartphone or
tablet when we're talking about 32 vs
64-bit the first thing that we have to
do is talk about bits what are they well
in computers we run on binary binaries 1
and 0 on or off those are bits pretty
simple right so how much or what is
32-bit to to the 32nd is for gig an
operating system that is built around a
32-bit architecture can address up to
four gig of ram there's some overhead
there so the actual number may be a bit
lower than that and I know what you're
thinking hey four gig that's a lot
that's a ton I don't have that much
stuff running I don't have any huge
things video editing software that I
need it so what's the big deal well you
forget your operating system itself plus
any skin or customization you have on
top of it whether that sense or whether
that's you know custom rom skin whether
that's LG's stuff Samsung's TouchWiz any
of that all has to be loaded up into ram
and run from ram it's what you working
all the time so it's got to be in RAM
it's got to be fast so you can see that
four gig maximum capacity is probably
now half that ok you're saying okay then
no no no Joe hey look it's a smart phone
it's a tablet it's for productivity is
for phone calls it's for me doing my job
it's for me reading an e-book and you're
absolutely correct some people play
games and whatnot on it and for them you
guys who don't play games need to be
thankful we've got all these people
playing games and all these game
manufacturers out there writing them and
they're making these beautiful 3d
immersive environments and if you
haven't played some of these games go do
it it's amazing what they're doing with
technology these days they're doing that
from the development standpoint they're
playing that from the end
user standpoint that's your beta testers
they are testing everything that you are
going to get in the future the near
future today your smartphone even though
you might not think it is is a 3d
immersive environment you've got
wallpaper in the background we've got
icons and words on top of that with
shadows on top of those or behind the
text as an extra layer in there you
might have an app drawer that sits on
top of that you might have a
notification shade that you pull down
that sits on top of that even Apple
current stuff has this really cool
tilting thing where you look at it and
depending on how you tilt the device in
your hand it kind of shifts the
background and the perspective of the
icons to the background we've got this
lighting the shadows this does that
sound an awful lot like a game it does
because it's using the same techniques
and technologies so even though you're
not running a game you're taking
advantage of all the stuff that we've
learned from all of the game things what
does that mean means now your OS that
takes up some of your RAM is going to
take up even more of your RAM and since
your operating system is getting bigger
your apps aren't getting smaller there's
only one thing you can do and that's
increase the amount of RAM that you have
but when we're talking 32-bit our
ceiling is four gig we're approaching
that ceiling very quickly so what do we
do to get around it got to go up so
64-bit computing back to bits due to the
64th is like 16 billion gig how do we
get there 32-bit right now is hardware
it software it's drivers and apps to get
to 64 gig we got to start with hardware
apples already got it Android probably
this year within the next calendar year
we got to have the hardware once we have
the hardware we've got to have the OS
you can run a 32-bit app in a 64-bit
environment I don't want to see people
arguing apples doing a better androids
do it better there are advantages and
disadvantages
both we need to be thankful for the
other side for doing what they're doing
because it's pushing our side whichever
sign that maybe to progress to improve
its great 64bit has definitely some lamb
advantages that we've talked about ad
nauseam here there other reasons why
64bit is such a good thing now 64bit has
lots and lots of nuances caveats and
components to it we've just talked about
memory addressing please if you've got
knowledge and expertise in some of the
others because we really don't have time
to talk about all of them here today go
down to the comment share that knowledge
and expertise about why 64bit has
advantages over 32 bit but share your
knowledge and expertise and let's keep
the conversation going down there so
there's what you need to know about 32
bit vs 64 bit at least when it comes to
smartphones and tablets if you liked the
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
and share it with your friends on your
favorite social media to make sure you
