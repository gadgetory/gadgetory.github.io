different with this camera review
Motorola is releasing two new flagship
phones the Moto Z and the Z force and
unlike some other manufacturers there
actually is a difference in camera tech
between these two so we're going to pit
them against each other in a friendly
competition of stablemates
buckle up folks we have a lot of ground
to cover and I'm gonna move pretty quick
first a little housekeeping the Moto Z
features a 13 megapixel shooter with
optical image stabilization laser
assisted focus and an F 1.8 aperture the
Moto Z force increases the resolution to
21 megapixels and adds phase detection
to the focusing system we're unsure
exactly what size these sensors are but
both have 1.12 micron pixels and
eagle-eyed viewers have already
commented on our other videos that the
force camera has a larger lens than the
Z the apse between the two are identical
we see similar performance in terms of
image processing and we'll note in the
bottom left corner which phone produced
which images before jumping into samples
we should point out that this review was
produced on pre-release software and we
encountered a fair number of gremlins in
this camera app the worst in low-light
situations that we expect this should be
addressed in an update once the phone is
actually available for purchase starting
off with exposure and saturation
like most phones these two are trying to
produce bright and vivid images with ie
pleasing color and there isn't a
tremendous difference in how these to
expose meter and finish off a JPEG blues
and greens look vibrant and we mostly
avoid that hyper teal band of sky near
the horizon Browns and earth tones maybe
feel a bit dull or muted we don't want
rust to become orange but the dead grass
here is starting to become gray yellows
are well captured the camera's natural
inclination is to clip brighter and
warmer colors but we're keeping a fair
amount of petal detail here Reds are
always tough for digital sensors to
produce accurately and the Moto falls
for the same trap many others trip over
in overexposing
and over saturating these are two
different colors of Bougainville
blossoms one bush more red one more pink
but pretty much everything here is a
sizzling magenta this is super common
for phone cameras but the Moto lacks any
raw capture we can find too
you better files to edit from lastly
white objects in direct Sun are really
tricky to meet her for properly but I
was happy to see decent dynamic range
here instead of focusing on the pedals I
focused on the middle of this rose and
it didn't completely blow the flower out
well done there though it's difficult to
test dynamic range beyond that point
as mentioned before neither zphone is
saving RAW files for us to push exposure
recovery those finished JPEGs retain a
decent amount of detail though z-force
photos range from around four and a half
Meg to eleven Meg moto Z photos range
from two and a half to six and a half
Meg per shot for video both phones
record around a 50 megabit per second
bitrate averaging under 400 megabytes
per minute of UHD video now checking out
some software Motorola hasn't always
been known for providing the best camera
apps but what the Moto Z delivers is a
revelation compared to my old Moto X -
the basics are well covered here once
you feel out some quirks auto mode is
fairly simple and we have slow motion
and panorama modes as separate options
and a fairly well featured pro mode with
manual controls for those paying
attention that pro mode looks an awful
lot like what Lumias have used for their
camera apps and the zooming action is a
vertical slide instead of a pinch but of
course imitation is the sincerest form
of flattery though we are kind of bummed
that impro mode the longest exposure
setting we get play with is an anemic
half second long so no fun streaking
tail light shots for you now the Z won't
win any awards for macro shots minimum
close focusing distance is a little less
than 4 inches away from the lens and in
shots with busy backgrounds the only way
to get the phone to focus that close is
to set it up manually though even if for
inches we get some nicely softened
backgrounds when you can put a little
distance between your subject and other
items and for how similar these camera
sensors are the slightly larger z-force
camera sensor does seem to provide
slightly smoother bokeh taking a look at
the focusing neither phone is a focusing
champ first of all there's a bit of a
tweak to how the phone locks on a
subject when just tapping to focus and
refocus often the target will miss where
your finger tried to tap what modo
intends for is
tap and slide to really hone in on the
specific object you want the issue with
this is sliding requires a slightly
longer interaction where my fat fingers
block more of the screen so it never
feels quite as smooth or as precise as
competing options from other flagship
phones add to the fact that this
focusing system is a little on the
slower side and our pre-release motos
both locked up on this test refusing to
focus where I tapped and you end up with
a perfect recipe for frustratingly long
interactions for each photo I quickly
got in the habit of really planning
ahead for every shot I wanted to take
and one area where these two did differ
subtly was on white balance on the whole
photos from the Moto Z were a little
warmer than photos from the Z force and
this was exacerbated in some of our HDR
shots speaking of HDR they're
inconsistent but these phones do try to
rein in highlights while boosting shadow
details like the sidewalk here night
shots are even more inconsistent though
sometimes we get great color boost but
in lower light situations sometimes we
get well nothing the auto mode on these
phones actually has a pretty solid night
scanning solution
I don't believe HDR is a
one-size-fits-all panacea for night
photography and I'd be more inclined to
suggest people use the more consistent
night mode here of course moto also
includes HDR for UHD video and they're
just okay again it's just hard to
predict what you'll end up with
sometimes you get a great balance of
light in color and sometimes the
highlights and lowlights are just all
smeared together in a dull mess of
moving footage this isn't a setting I'd
rely on unless you can take a couple
test videos to see what you'll end up
with and how about those panorama photos
in a word awful Motorola limits you to
about half the range of what other
phones will allow you to scan through
and when you do try to line up a good
shot there are often numerous stitching
areas like on this poll how did the
camera mess up a poll this is very
disappointing but what isn't
disappointing is including a decent
flash for the front-facing camera it's
another wise normal flagship 5-megapixel
selfie camera but that little spotlight
can really help in darker situations now
moving to nighttime photos on the
old yzi force outperforms the regular Z
our hypothesis
since the pixel size is the same then
the slightly larger image sensor on the
force might be helping it soak up a
touch more light also the higher
resolution means that images look
sharper and the noise is a little finer
when comparing similar crops in similar
scenes we also see some slight lens
distortions on the Z when looking at the
streetlamp above our creepy tunnel the
lens on our force review unit is just a
little bit cleaner in that regard where
the Z was warmer with white balance and
daylight under artificial light it's
working a lot harder
finding the white of this gate and
ignoring the yellow security lamp which
lights the scene and our walkway also
shows when shooting Auto the night mode
won't exaggerate color as much as HDR
but that also reigns in noise and moving
to video image processing on the force
was consistently better than on the Z
looking at similar scenes often the Z
would feel duller or just not as crisp
of course every now and then we'd see a
mess of over sharpening on the Z force
but overall we preferred the force video
looking at video we can take a closer
look at image stabilization and we're
happy to see that while both phones have
hardware optical image stabilization you
are able to continue using software
stabilization even when shooting UHD
video now results here aren't as smooth
as what we might see on an iPhone 6s
plus but this is one of the only
Androids which will allow us to do this
so kudos for being one of the first
motorola but checking out the zoom range
zooming performance on both phones is
kind of a hot mess the higher resolution
force camera fares slightly better but
while moto is advertising an 8 X zoom on
this phone you probably won't want to
use the full crop very often but audio
capture here is very good even-handed
noise and wind filtering helps improve
the sound of your subject but constant
sounds aren't reduced to that terrible
warbling sound we've heard too often
from competitors
and checking out exposure transitions
moving from dark to bright and back the
image stabilization system did not like
this lateral pan really big chunky jumps
in trying to anticipate my hand movement
the activating it helped smooth out the
scene but this is a pretty twitchy
exposure system rapid and jarring
transitions are a bit distracting
especially when the camera overshoots
and you get a handful of really blue
frames in an otherwise warm scene we're
hoping this is tied to the low light
exposure issues and is fixed in a future
software update lastly looking at some
slow-motion video it's a reasonable 720p
at 120 frames per second at this
resolution we wish we were saving a
slightly higher quality image or that we
had options for 1080p or 240 frames per
second but it's fun to play with and
adjust on the phone so let's wrap this
up where does this leave us with the
camera on these new Motorola's well
hello moto what a nice little camera
system you grown into especially on the
Z force in owning the fact that we
teased this is a versus in the title of
the video
we'd be inclined to declare the force
the winner not just for more resolution
but focusing performance was a little
better and we see improvements to white
balance low-light performance and
overall video quality to be clear these
cameras have some bugs which need to be
sorted out but they are far more fun to
use than on Moto's of years past Z
cameras do a perfectly serviceable job
of covering the basics and with a little
coaxing can deliver some really
photographic images but considering the
competition and the launch prices for
these phones we just can't position them
in the top tier of smartphone cameras a
little software tweaking would go a long
way however so we hope to revisit these
after they've had a little more time to
marinate as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for our full moto Z and Z force
coverage and hit that thumbs up button
for a little extra positive
reinforcement for pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos bag now some gadget guy on
Twitter and Instagram and I will catch
you all on the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
