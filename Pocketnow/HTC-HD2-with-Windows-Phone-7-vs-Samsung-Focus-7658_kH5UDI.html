pocket navcom by now you probably know
that the HTC hd2 can remarkably run
Windows Phone 7 in its full glory but
just how good is it we're going to
compare it to a Samsung Focus a device
that natively runs Windows Phone 7 and
see how fast the hd2 running Windows
Phone 7 actually is so let's get to it
alright and we're gonna bring over the
Samsung Focus here and obviously the
Samsung Focus here has been used a lot
more than the HD 2 there's a lot more
programs in memory so keep that in mind
also keep in mind that we haven't
downloaded any third-party apps on the
HTC hd2 out of the box when you flash
Windows Phone 7 onto the HD 2 you don't
get any of the live services like Xbox
Zune and the marketplace there is a way
around that but it's a little bit shady
so we really haven't done it yet
but we're just going to compare sort of
the built-in applications and the
overall performance so you can determine
if you want to load Windows Phone 7 on
your HD 2 we think you should it's
really cool ok so let's get started
we're just going to move around on the
screens here and check general
performance as you can see right off the
bed in terms of just the fidelity of the
picture now the Super AMOLED screen on
the Samsung Focus makes the black stand
out better but the HD 2 is kind of like
the HD 7 meaning it has an LCD screen
meaning that it's probably going to ship
with the white background because it
doesn't really need to have the black
background since it doesn't have the the
Super AMOLED display so we can swipe to
the right see the built-in apps
performance is pretty darn good let's go
into the web and see how that is we're
gonna launch Internet Explorer at the
same time here and see which goes faster
they're both connected to Wi-Fi and as
you can see pocket now is already loaded
here on the hd2 we're just gonna revert
back to Google so we can sort of have it
have a fresh start here then we'll do
likewise on the on the focus google.com
here we go
all right and here we go and let's check
screen rotation speed run zoom out a
little bit here and let's see which
device can do it fastest Wow the hd2
actually did it fast there remarkable
the hd2 a device not built for Windows
Phone 7 actually is rotating the screen
faster than the Samsung Focus but we
should probably close all these windows
here let's just make sure we're doing it
as equally as possible we're just gonna
try that again see if the results are
different so look HD 2 is faster again
that is really remarkable unmistakeably
faster let's go to pocketnow.com on both
and see which gets there first we should
be able to just dial it in here we're
gonna go to the mobile version first and
then we will go into the full desktop
view with all the images and everything
like that
so looks like it was about equal there
go down to the bottom of the page click
the desktop version boom alright so this
is the the graphic intense version of
the site lots of pictures text really
curious to see there over the exact same
Wi-Fi network see which one gets there
first the hd2 is ahead and here comes
the focus catching up it looks like too
early to tell just watching the progress
bars here at the top of the screen the
HD 2 is definitely ahead up if one the
HD to beat has samsung focus and loading
this website this is really interesting
to see so very very good Internet
performance let's check the sort of
pinch-to-zoom
silky smooth on both they're both
obviously support multi-touch that was
probably my fault that it kind of
skipped around check screen rotation
speed now again the HD 2 is beating the
Samsung Focus that is amazing so let's
move down the page a little bit more
just flick down see if we get any
checkerboards gotta say the screen
sensitivity on the samsung focus is
better it's responding to my touch i'm
having to do some double taps at times
to get it to work so now let's bunt
balance into another application let's
jump into the calendar here and so we're
gonna try to do at the same time
calendar every one two three go okay
they were loaded exactly at the
time so no difference there swipe to the
right let's go into what else can we do
here that's sort of a the same on both
devices let's go into settings and take
a look if there's a difference between
the build version between these two
devices so we're going to scroll down to
the bottom here and go about and it
identifies itself as the lis of 70 go to
more info we're running Windows Windows
Phone 7 seven point zero point seven
zero zero four and over here on the
Samsung Focus we're also running the
same version of Windows Phone 7 so again
it's the same it's the same version
between these two devices let's move
around here on the page here see what
else we can do try not to go into things
that have you know for example pictures
of that as pictures loaded let's see how
long it takes to open up the camera app
so here's the camera button here camera
button is over here so press it at the
same time that the hd2 is slightly
faster unloading the camera application
that is very very interesting so as you
can see here there's no really downside
to running a Windows Phone 7 on your HD
to accept that lack of live services the
performance is just fantastic in fact
it's beating the the Samsung Focus in
most of these tests so again we'll post
a link back to the full instructions
that we posted previously on how to get
Windows Phone 7 on your HD to again we
think that the HD 2 is probably the most
versatile smartphone ever created you
can run Android me go ubuntu Windows
Phone 7 Windows Mobile on this phone as
if they were natively made for this
device and all some devices is turning
out to be even well over a year after
its release so if you liked this video
please give it a thumbs up and thanks
for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
