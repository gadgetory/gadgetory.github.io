launch as many as three iphones this
year we get firm details on the launch
of the galaxy s6 and HTC One m9 in the
u.s. we also learned when we can expect
the next Microsoft Surface I'm hi Mary
vera and fill me as many videos as
possible on a day is crazy but it's
happening this is part out daily brought
to you by Linda calm the official news
should I have to do with sand shaking
other companies as we get the details on
exactly when you can pre-order your new
HTC One m9 and if that is your thing
tomorrow is the day for pre-orders you
will get your phone on April 10 and
according to the press release it works
on all major US carriers so let us know
in the comments if you are getting one
now competition is tough is such as the
case of sam saying as a just like you
can pre-order your HTC One m9 tomorrow
you can also do the same with the galaxy
s6 and galaxy s6 edge again in the
saying you r us retail carriers you can
also get an investor and the Samsung
specialised stores and yes you will get
your phone on April tent as well even
though we are hearing that Verizon might
delay its free orders until April first
we haven't yet confirmed but again
galaxy s6 or HTC One m9 which one are
you getting now what you're interested
in is the new microsoft surface uh we've
got some news incredible sources claim
that it might be ready and mike meaning
very credible by the time of the build
conference which should happen by the
end of april or early may and if it
doesn't happen at this event apparently
microsoft might have its own event for
the new microsoft surface look at this
question is exactly how Microsoft wants
to innovate with this tablet especially
with the launch of Apple's new macbook
there's on the table here and obviously
Microsoft that needs to play good card
here even though the surface pro 3 was a
great tablet at one product that's
slowly climbing our radar is the HTC One
m9 and we are talking about the plastic
variant of the HTC One m9 or are we it
seems that even though this is a
plasticky version of the phone
apparently we are getting the
specifications of the HTC One m9 plus
and not the one of nine and it's really
hard we don't know if we're getting two
variants or what there are some
conflicting rumors here
but the 29 should be available we just
wonder which markets it will be
available on and finally for the hot
news of the day didja times is reporting
that Apple will return to its roots this
year the company is apparently preparing
for the launch of three iphones and we
talked about the iphone 7 mini in the
past we talked about the company working
on a small four inch iphone the typical
4.7 inch and then the 5.5 inch model and
apparently the company is gearing for a
launch of these three phones this year
we're just not sure if they're going to
keep the current sixes as the old models
or if these will be the only three
models and the smaller one being the
budget-minded one or if they three will
be priced accordingly but it does leave
me to the question of the day if you
have to pick between one of the three
the phablet the regular size are the
smaller one which one would you pick
because in my case i think i will stick
to the 4.7 inch model that's the sweet
spot for me but leave us a comment down
below let us know what you think and
folks if you've ever wanted to become a
pro in business cook your own meal or
I'm going to build a cool video like
this one there are thousands of awesome
courses at our sponsor Linda calm /
pocket now that's ly NDA calm / pocket
now for a free 10-day trial you also
know the drill if you want to get the
nose earlier before this video was
filmed reshape photo was embarqmail.com
is a sharp changing channel as well you
can follow me on twitter right now just
go to be better please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
a metal either thank you very much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
