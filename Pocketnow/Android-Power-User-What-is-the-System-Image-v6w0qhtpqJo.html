Android power-user the pocket now series
where we learn less about the frilly
stuff and more about the nuts and bolts
the terminology and the concepts behind
Android we learn the stuff that helps us
understand all of the other cool frilly
things you might read elsewhere and why
they work the way they do today we're
gonna talk about the system image which
is something very very near and dear to
my heart it's something that when we
talk about custom Rahming that's the
thing let's get right to it
Android is made up of a couple different
images now what are images we talked a
little bit about that last time in the
last episode we talked about
clockworkmod recovery and more
specifically the recovery image well
there's also a boot image and a system
image the three of them kind of worked
together to make everything work find
out more about the recovery image go
back and watch last week's episode I'll
have a link for you at the end of this
video today we're going to focus on the
system image what it is what it does why
we have it what it's good for and well
kind of what we have to do with out if
it weren't around so let's jump right
into that what is an image an image is
essentially just a collection of stuff
in a certain configuration you like that
fancy terminology computer stuff files
settings yada yada yada the image
comprises in this case the system image
everything that you need to run the
operating system so let's compare this
to Windows or Mac the system image is
Windows or Mac you boot up your computer
it goes through boot sound familiar
once it's booted up it boots into that
system image then you have windows you
have your kernel you have your programs
you have your wallpaper you have
everything that you've configured on Mac
it's the same thing on Linux it's the
same thing in well since Android is
essentially Linux there you go when you
boot your Android up you're booting into
the system image
that's where all of your settings are so
why do we have it we want to run stuff I
know I had to throw that in there when
you get your device from the factory it
comes with what's called a factory image
it's exactly the way that the factory
wants it to be whose the factory in this
case well that's the OEM whether that
Samsung Motorola HTC LG any of the other
guys or the carrier Sprint t-mobile
orange Oh to any of those guys and
usually they work together to customize
there's my air quotes customize the
image to do what they want they don't
just want it to run they want it to be
able to collect information they want it
to be able to sell you products and
services that you may otherwise not have
known about
we call that bloatware over here at
pocketnow.com and it's the bane of our
lives we don't like it we like to remove
it and hey since we're Android power
users and we know how all this stuff
fits together we can do that so since
all of that is built and kind of cooked
into the system image can we get in
there and remove stuff and change stuff
not easily unfortunately with the right
tools and the right permissions
superuser root we can go in and change
system files we can remove system files
bloatware unfortunately our system files
blows me away that they make some NFL TV
app that you can only watch for one
season a system image that you can't
remove but maybe I'm just odd let me
know down in the comments if you would
thanks great so what we can do is we can
modify that system image with the right
tools the right permissions or we can
replace it altogether that's where we
get into custom roms like CyanogenMod
rom like a okp like you name it let us
know your favorite rump down in the
comments down below at pocketnow.com we
can replace that whole thing it replaces
the kernel it replaces the wallpaper it
replaces the operating system it has
more
we're or less bloatware it has some apps
that you need and some apps that you
might not whatever you want to do
depends on who cooked this ROM and put
it all together for you and you can
replace it that's what it is that's what
it does
that's where custom Rahming really comes
into play and because Android is
separated out into these separate images
all we have to do is flash one file we
can wipe out everything that was there
before replace it with whatever you want
boot back up and you have a brand new
Android experience all thanks to the
system image kind of a short topic for
today but we do most of our work inside
the system image we just didn't know
about it so now you know when you're
backing up stuff that's one of the
important ones that you really want to
backup so you don't lose all of your
configurations otherwise you got to go
back and reconfigure at all so if you
have questions if you have comments if
you want to answer any of the questions
that we posed to you in this episode
please head over to pocketnow.com I'll
have a link right down there if you're
watching this video on youtube so you
can head over to the website and sew it
there we'll kind of keep the discussion
there that's where I'll be
answering your questions we get you
taken care of I hope so so give us a big
thumbs up make sure if you haven't
subscribed to our video channel that you
do that I'll have a link for you at the
end of this video as well for PocketNow
talking about Android and helping us all
understand the nuts and bolts of it I'm
