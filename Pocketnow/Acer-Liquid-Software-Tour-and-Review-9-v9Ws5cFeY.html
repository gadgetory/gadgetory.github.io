pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to take a look at the software
performance and battery life of the acer
liquid s100 we're counting this as one
of the cheaper or less expensive Android
devices that you can buy unlocked right
now it's about a hundred dollars cheaper
than the google nexus one and it will
give you 3g on AT&amp;amp;T in the US so we're
going to talk about those three things
in this video so you can help determine
if this is a device that you want to get
the first thing that we want to talk
about which is kind of unique to this
device are the system notifications on
the top of the device pretty cool so
we've got a new email notification
missed call and over here on the right
you can't see it when you plug in the
device to charge you will get an
illumination here you may be wondering
why would you want to have the
notifications on the top of the device
and not say you know around the edges
here well the way I look at it is if
you're if you have the device in your
pocket and you want to quickly know if
you have an email you can kind of pull
it up so that the top is exposed see oh
I have a new email message and that way
you can turn on your device and begin to
action on it so pretty cool we haven't
yet seen something like this on any
really mobile device that we've tested
so it's a it's a neat change to see so
let's turn on the device and talk about
the home screens and everything else
that comes along with that let's zoom in
on the screen and we can tap to unlock
by doing the the menu button over here
and we are already into the android
interface this is running android 1.6 so
it's not the newest which is android 2.1
as found on the google nexus one the
screen as mentioned is wvga resolution
which is the same resolution that you'll
find on the google nexus one that's 800
down and 480 across which makes for a
very crisp and clear picture you may not
you may not be able to tell in the video
but it looks quite nice it's not using
AMOLED screen technology as the google
nexus one but it's a standard backlit
LCD TFT display and it is it is quite
nice to the eye so let's talk about some
of these home screen widgets that you
can add to the acer liquid that make it
a little bit different than the standard
android device that you would get out
there so over here on the Left we have
something called a media manager
which is quite cool it has to fit on its
own android screen and what it allows
you to do is filter through your
pictures your music and it was loading
there and your videos that you have on
your storage card and so from here we
can kind of flick through see a video
that we want to watch and watch it
there's a little picture of my dog and
likewise we can go to the suit the music
and we can tap on one of these and it
launches into the the acer media player
which is also quite nice you can hear
the music playing go backwards or we can
go back to photos and go into the photo
gallery so here all the pictures I've
taken and we can flick through although
the animations aren't as nice as you
would get on the google nexus one or
even the iphone and we do have
accelerometer support so we can go into
landscape and slide to the right and
slide to the left we don't have multi
touch anywhere on the acer liquid
unfortunately we can double tap that
doesn't do it to zoom in so we have to
go down here so not the most precise
controls for zooming in unfortunately in
pictures but the media manager is nice
to have sort of sitting on its own home
screen you do a lot with multimedia
let's go over to the center and we just
have some standard stuff your program
shortcuts in analog clock to the right
we have a really cool way to look at our
web bookmarks so we can actually flick
through and see little screen captures
of all of my favorites so here's pocket
now calm tapping on it will bring up the
browser and it's in landscape right now
so I'm going to portrait and the browser
works quite fast it's not as fast as the
nexus one probably because it doesn't
have the 4 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor but as you can see it's
loading quite fast and we can zoom out
right now and we can move around on the
screen we can zoom out again lack of
multi-touch is kind of annoying and this
is also annoying you get this kind of
magnification glass instead of just
being able to move down the page so a
little bit of something to get used to
when when using the web browser on the
acer liquid it does a good job at re
flowing the columns and moving around on
a page is generally smooth and of course
it's got pretty fast screen rotation too
if you want to go into landscape so
standard Android browser just without
the multi-touch capability so let's
delete this widget and add a few more so
a tap and hold and I'll go to widgets
and we can see what else we have from
the selection analog clock calendar
media player stuff we've seen so far
media player is kind of unique to this
device like I mentioned and that fills
up its own home screen we have a special
widget for for music and of course it
goes right into G Android multimedia
player and let me delete that ASA really
hasn't added that many things they've
added something called the Nemo player
which is essentially what you just saw
for the multimedia player but it looks a
little bit nicer and right now it's
going to find the music on the device
and if you tap on the widget you're
taken into the sort of Nemo media player
which again brings together all of your
different sort of media so music movies
or videos and photos all into one screen
a nice addition from Acer to help you
manage your multimedia so let's trash
that see what else we have in here
picture frames standard to Android power
control Road sync calendar search
spinlet switch is a built-in social
networking system for the for the acer
liquid as if you need another social
network and let's see what we have here
some other things that I've added such
as tweed droid and a touchdown calendar
web player is just that list of
bookmarks that I showed you a minute ago
and of course we can also change the
wallpapers this isn't unique to to the
liquid we can swipe to the right and say
okay we want that one looks pretty cool
set wallpaper and here we have the new
wallpaper of course we can also add
shortcuts to do various things we can
direct dial someone so one touch access
to dial your you know the people that
you call the most quick quick links to
bookmarks and application
shins and you know things that were sort
of used to seeing in Android by now
something that's really really neat
about the acer liquid is the task
manager that lets you switch
applications of course android lets you
multitask and you can access your
recently used programs by tapping and
holding the home button but look what
acer is done they actually give you full
screen previews of the programs that you
recently use so you can see a little
thumbnail of pocketnow.com up here and
if i tap on that it will reload
pocketnow.com in the browser if i open a
bunch of other applications you're going
to see this in full force so if i go to
thuy droid and that loads let's go home
i'm going to open up another application
let's say camera there's the camera and
go back home and let's open one more
application let's open the say just open
the settings menu and we go back home
and tap and hold we'll get a list of all
of these different programs that we've
opened with a cool little full screen
screen capture that allows you to see
what you've done recently in that
program a really really awesome way to
multitask on the acer liquid something
that you don't see too much on other
android devices so let's talk about
other things that are included on the
acer liquid something that i kind of
have a gripe with is if you look closely
at the system notifications up here
they're a little bit pixelated almost as
if they're not optimized to the wvga
screen they look like they came from a
version of android that went on a lower
resolution display and there are a few
places throughout the operating system
where you see these pics pixelated
buttons that just don't appear clearer
let's just open the program tray and
here we get the standard android program
tray and let's look at some of these
applications we have something called a
search settings which is a quick way to
disable bluetooth or Wi-Fi turn on and
off gps and switch between 2g and 3g and
here's a quick way to access the
brightness control we have alarm clock a
lot of standard android stuff calculator
calendar camcorder and by the way I'll
play for you in a minute a video taken
with the camcorder photo
is quite good it's not amazing it's
probably as good as the google nexus one
which really doesn't take that good of a
quality of pictures email Gmail Google
Goggles a great little application and
really that's it we have a YouTube
player which is standard let's see how
video playback is over the hsdpa
connection right now on AT&amp;amp;T so it is
loading and downloading data all right
so I'll click on just the first one I
see here and go into landscape and watch
some video on the nice crisp 3.5 inch
display so really what we're dealing
with here for the most part is a
standard Android installed with a few
extra programs and widgets let's talk a
bit about performance battery life and
claw quality you already saw performance
when I was tapping around opening many
applications performance is very very
good it's an extremely fast device that
shows really no lag when you open up
screens you can multitask really with
ease and although it only has 256
megabytes of RAM which is about half of
what the next one does it does a really
good job at multitasking let's talk
about call quality call Cody was quite
good it's not as good as a device that
you'll get probably right from AT&amp;amp;T but
I was able to hear the party clear and
they will able to hear me clear the
speaker phone was actually quite
outstanding probably better than the
google nexus one with no really
distortions even at loud volumes and
finally battery life I'd compare the
battery life of the acer liquid to the
HTC hd2 so with heavy use you'll get
about a day and a half or a day and a
quarter without having to recharge the
device which is quite good and it beats
the heck out of the iphone which often
can't get through an entire day without
being recharged and i think that's in
part to the 1350 milliamp hour battery
which is a nice size and to the slightly
underclocked this Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor which I think helps to
conserve on power just a little bit so
at the end of the day I think that the
acer liquid is a really good value it
has great performance good battery life
and good call quality
the only caveat here is that the build
quality isn't nearly as good as the
google nexus one and it's also a lot of
thicker than the google nexus one and
certainly a lot of other slab devices
out there but at a hundred dollars
cheaper perhaps that doesn't matter to
you and perhaps it's really advantageous
for you to have AT&amp;amp;T 3g on an unlocked
android device so again we recommend the
acer liquid mostly because it's a good
value and the price makes sense for a
device of this type you can get an acer
liquid of your own by going to klove co
uk where they're shipping right now for
about four hundred and fifty dollars
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
