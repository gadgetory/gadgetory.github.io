here both Microsoft and Paul Kahn are
claiming that you get insane battery
life in addition to an always connected
profile that's a very tall order and I
decided to test it from the most
complicated city in the world New York
City they sent me a unit they were nice
enough to sponsor this video let's see
how it goes I'm hearing that it will
pocket now and let's talk about the HP
Envy x2
we're starting our test off in Queens we
have a hundred percent on the battery
and we're using the Sprint network for
this video it's been great so far mainly
because well you get three data up until
the end of the year on this computers
that's all great let's see how the
battery life performs throughout the day
as it's always connected
for currently in New York City's Penn
Station I commute by here every day and
so far even though connectivity in this
particular station is not the best
we're still getting full signal bars and
the hattery life is still 100% we began
our journey pretty much nearly 40 to 50
minutes ago so one of the coolest parts
about the HP Envy x2 is literally the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 powering it it
allows for newer slimmer form factors
because you don't need as much machinery
anymore so you can walk around New York
City
my favorite sector of Midtown in this
beautiful sunny day and it feels like if
you're carrying a notepad it's that
light and you have the advantage that
you've got pen input for whatever you
need
currently in Times Square and one of the
busiest sectors of the city lot of
tourism a lot of sights to see and data
speeds have been great and believe it or
not it is 2 p.m. and yeah it's sunny
like crazy but we still have 100%
battery life let's keep going
we are at beautiful Bryant Park another
one of my favorite areas in New York
City and there are other advantages to
this HP and the x2 it's powered by the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor we've
got four gigabytes of RAM there's 128
gigs of expandable storage on this
computer it's got a 49 watt hour battery
and that's certified for up to 22 hours
and again because of the clock of
Snapdragon 835 processor we've got
things like 802 11 AC Wi-Fi in addition
to Bluetooth five from multiple devices
to be connected to this computer so so
far the performance has been great Brian
Park is very crowded data speeds weren't
necessarily that great but it's
understandable given the sector but
we're still at a hundred percent battery
life and it is literally 2:38 p.m. we've
got more places in New York City so
let's go
so we're currently in Grand Central
Station it is 3:30 p.m. we have got 91
percent battery another coolest parts
about the pockets after he made 35 is
this is a bandless operation computer
and it handles heat really well in
addition the speed test so far looks
great on the Sprint network here in
Grand Central Station it is very busy so
definitely very reliable in all the
sectors that we've been at in New York
City
149th Street in a 19th floor in our
office it is 4:30 p.m. and believe it or
not we still get great data speeds all
the way up here on the sprint LTE
network even more interesting this HP
Envy x2 doesn't really cut corners the
screen from me is great 12 point 3 inch
IPS LED at nineteen twenty by twelve
eighty so you get great resolution and
in addition to that it's super bright if
you've noticed all throughout the shoot
we've remained that maximum brightness
since we've begun and believe it or not
we are still at eighty nine percent
battery so definitely very power
efficient and we've got more to go
now for those of you that don't know I
rely heavily on Microsoft OneNote to get
my work done I type in my shot list and
then I use the stylus to highlight every
shot that I'm doing makes my life a lot
easier so far my experience with the HP
Envy x2 has been really positive mainly
because of the stylus it provides very
little latency of any and it's very
smooth with Windows ink probably the
coolest part once you detach this tablet
from its keyboard it just weighs one and
a half pounds and you've got full-blown
Windows 10 here it is 5:00 p.m. we are
still at the office and believe it or
not we still have 79 percent battery
life left
speaking of Windows this computer ships
to you with Windows 10 s out of the box
I decided to take the plunge see how far
it could go and update it to Windows 10
Pro which was free quick and just took a
few minutes so far I am impressed it
plays everything just fine whether
you're using your typical applications
like Microsoft Office or the edge
browser it breezes through many who's
just fine this is not a graphics
intensive game playing computer but it
does play the basic games just fine I do
a lot of content consumption that's my
favorite thing to do so if you're into
Netflix your Spotify cool thing about
this computer has got dual firing
speakers that are very crisp very loud
as well I do a lot of YouTube viewing so
for me this has been a great experience
particularly for that but it is
something as the speed you need and also
the boldest evolution that we've seen
other important details when it comes to
ports and peripherals that keyboard
that's the tangible is also full-size
and back lift and the trackpad is
significantly large the addition there
is one USB C port that provides power
delivery for charging and there is a USB
a adapter in the Box in addition to that
there is a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
on the other side there is a 13
megapixel camera at the back and the
front facing five megapixel camera also
provides Windows hello supports for
biometrics
apparently in the New York City Subway
the last stop of the each train World
Trade Center we decided to come downtown
to test it from here obviously remember
if you're in the New York City subway
data speeds depend on the station and
rarely between stations so definitely
this is what I was expecting from the
performance the most interesting part is
that we're still at 70% battery life and
it is 8:05 p.m.
we are downtown the Occulus station one
of my favorite spots data speeds here
are crazy on sprint LTE network we've
got 60 megabits down upload speeds are
not necessarily that great but that's
understandable in this area most
important 70 % battery life again there
is more to test but so far no matter
where I've taken it in New York its
performed great
it is 8:45 p.m. we are at the World
Trade Center Memorial in downtown
Manhattan and the HP Envy x2 still has
68 percent battery life I have to tell
you that welcome Snapdragon 835 in
Windows 10 and impressed me and our
first impressions but obviously our full
review will come very soon to tell you
more there is a link in the description
if you want to learn more about the
always connected PC my advice to you go
to a Microsoft store near you and check
them out while you're at it make sure
you follow us on social media subscribe
to our channel for more videos like this
one and follow me on Twitter hi now just
go to be better on Instagram a tiny
memory data please give this video a
