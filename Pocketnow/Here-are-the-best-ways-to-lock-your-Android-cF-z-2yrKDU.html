more important in our everyday lives we
use them to store everything from
credentials for social media to our
email and chat services not only that
some of us even use them as our everyday
wallet I'm Joe Levi for pocket now here
are a few ways that you can secure your
Android powered device from unauthorized
users this is my Nexus 4 I'm rooted and
I'm running CyanogenMod 10.2 nightly
which is Android 4.3 so yours may be
slightly different I'll show you some of
the features that this has that yours
may not what you're looking at here is
my lock screen shows me how many
notifications I have some signal status
battery strength who my carrier is and a
lock screen widget in this case the time
and the date what my battery charges and
whatnot now I can slide to unlock and
with this one I can slide it and just
unlock it to my home screen unlock its
messaging to music to my dialer or
right over to the web just with a simple
swipe and that's not just me that's
anyone so if I want to go right over
here there's my home screen and I'm in
there's really no security to this it's
just kind of keeping me from
accidentally dialing someone on accident
or going through messing up who knows
what just by having it in your pocket
and getting inadvertent screen taps so
let's go ahead and see what real
security options we have I'm going to
pull down the notification tray there
and go into settings we'll scroll down
to security now yours may look a little
bit different than this depending on
what version of Android you're using if
it's HTC vs samsung vs. LG or whatnot so
take this information as a starting
point just know that yours may be a
little bit different this is what we're
focusing on right now it is the screen
lock and there's lots of different
things that you can use here you can do
none which means you turn the power on
and it's on you don't have that
accidental but dial protection like I
showed you with the slide to unlock
which is the next one so here is my
slide that's all it does no options you
just select it there it is next one up
is face unlock we're going to come
to that in just a minute pattern pattern
is a really really nice feature you
basically get a series of dots on your
screen you connect the dots and if you
get the pattern right it unlocks your
device your pattern can be relatively
simple it can be very complex it's up to
you the default is a three by three
pattern some devices will let you do a
four by four and as you can tell this
version of CyanogenMod lets me do a six
by six that's crazy so let's do a five
by five you can see how many dots we've
got here we'll go ahead and draw a
pattern and I'm just going to do
something basic and hopefully I can
remember this you set it up once you
come back in here you see I've forgotten
already how I don't remember where that
was tells me that I didn't get that
pattern correct so let's go back we're
going to start all over again come back
in here we're going to do a pattern
we're going to do five by five I'm just
going to come in here do that way just
like that continue that way just like
that obviously not a very secure pattern
but maybe a little bit more secure than
just a 3x3 you can see how many more
dots that I've got will confirm that
there we go
everything's awesome we'll turn that off
I've got a little bit of a timer set so
it's not going to lock for about 10-15
seconds so we'll just pass some time
here and then turn it back on there is
now our pattern so we can do stuff like
that that's not it we can do this that's
not it either
and eventually it's going to lock us out
this is a very basic way of keeping
people that aren't authorized to use
your device from using your device and
still let you do that now there are some
options that you can use here on your
pattern you can make the pattern visible
which is a default or make it not
visible so people looking over your
shoulder are not going to be able to see
what you're doing if you want to see the
pattern error like you saw there where I
scribbled on the screen and it showed me
no this is actually what you swipe to
not the correct pattern but something
else that's what that does I like having
that on just
because sometimes it's nice to know
where you thought you were going and
what it actually did show pattern dots
again this may vary based on your device
so if you don't want to see the dots at
all there you go and then automatically
lock five seconds after sleep so I told
you it was like 10 or 15 it was really
only five and if you want the power
button to automatically lock you can do
that versus just having the screen
timeout if you want the power button not
to instantly lock and have it fall back
to this five seconds right there that's
what that is for next up is arguably a
little bit more secure and to get to it
we're going to have to put in our
previous security to change it now that
in itself is some security but if you've
forgotten your pattern for example it's
going to be a little bit interesting so
the next thing we want to do is a pin
pin is very simple we're going to do one
two three four that sounds like the
combination that somebody would have on
their luggage we're going to go ahead
and continue we'll put the code in again
again not very secure here we'll say
okay
there we go power off we've got to wait
that obligatory five seconds and then
we'll turn it back on and it's asking us
for the pin one two three four and then
enter next up is a password we're going
to choose our password as pocket now and
hopefully I spelled that right because I
can't look at the camera in the screen
all that well but if not will I see ID I
don't even know where I am because I'm
trying to type and talk at the same time
see ket in o/w okay and if I got a right
with great I didn't so let's cancel out
of that let's set it up again do that
really fast we'll choose a shorter
password how about just now for the fun
of it now is too short
let's do cleat that out we'll do pocket
now again and o/w just like that
ock e t and o w okay so there we go now
we've got that set up when we turn it
back on I'm going to turn this so it's a
little bit easier for me to get to
didn't wait the full five seconds so
it's throwing me right back in that's a
nice feature by the way I really like
that where you can set your time out
your screen time out turn it on now
we'll go ahead and put this in here you
can see I do not have my swipe to
complete I have to manually key it in
which is not a bad thing it just takes a
little bit more time to do and done nope
that wasn't it because I fat-fingered it
now you're noticing the letters are
showing up here so someone looking over
your shoulder could see what your
password is and just kind of figure it
out you may not want to do that so keep
that in mind next up is one of my more
favorite now to get to that again we've
got to put in the previous password and
that is face unlock now this isn't going
to work all that great with the camera
will do the best that we can I use this
all the time you've got to use it in
conjunction with a pin or a pattern just
in case your face isn't working so once
you come in here set it up it gives you
a quick tutorial hold it at eye level
we're not going to be able to do that so
I'll just do this and maybe you can see
that you've got this ring of green that
comes all the way around and it's doing
some facial recognition you'll also see
how we got those errors popping up and
down it doesn't like it because I'm
talking and I'm moving so what we're
going to do here's that pin or pattern
we'll do a pattern we'll do a three by
three and we're just going to do that
because it's simple it's going to ask
for that again now if it doesn't
recognize you you're going to have to
put in your pattern to be able to do it
so let's go back in here next thing
you're going to want to do is improve
face matching record a couple of these
guys if you often have some scruff on
your face you'll definitely want to do
this with and without scruff do it in
different lighting do it holding
the camera at different ways I like
doing it in the car and doing it at work
so that in each one of those different
areas it kind of knows who I am
I'm going to try and hold still a little
bit here while it recognizes me and the
more of these that you put in there the
faster it's going to get at unlocking
your device so very very simple we don't
want the pattern visible we're going to
do the same five seconds yada-yada-yada
I'm going to turn this back on for
brevity and I'm going to show you this
here in just a minute so let's go ahead
and turn that off it should have
instantly locked now I'll turn it back
on it warms up the camera looks at me
and just like that I'm in that actually
took a little bit longer than normal
because of the lighting and the way it's
working here on the camera usually it's
a lot faster to unlock than that and if
it doesn't unlock you just put your
pattern in and everything's fine now one
thing one easy way to overcome this
security measure is with a picture if
someone has a picture of your face and
holds it up in front of the camera it
will unlock because all it's doing is
checking to make sure that that face
matches whether the face is actually on
your head or in a picture it doesn't
care that's where this comes in this a
liveliness check so we'll go ahead and
check that we'll lock everything up
we'll turn it back on it's going to try
and recognize us and it's going to make
us blink and it didn't see us blink so
now it's going to ask for the password
we'll go back in turn that off turn that
back on again this is where lighting is
very important and again didn't catch
the blink I don't have much success with
blinking I don't know if it's me or not
but let me rephrase that
I can blink just fine I have a hard time
with this detecting my blinks so we're
going to turn that off just be advised
that if you are turning the liveliness
check off you're adding a little bit of
extra ease to someone's task if they
want to try and break into your device
so as you can see setting up some very
simple security on your Android power
device is not that difficult and it
doesn't add that much inconvenience to
your
day routine the inconvenience that you
do have although slight is definitely
much more convenient than having all of
your social media and maybe even your
wallet stolen and used by anyone out
there who would have access to an
unlocked device if you liked what you
