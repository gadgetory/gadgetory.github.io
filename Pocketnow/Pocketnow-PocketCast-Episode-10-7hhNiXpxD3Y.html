already we should include this beginning
part again alrighty then well it's not
that chefs to get on the podcast at some
point we should we should definitely do
that if she asking about its first
smartphone would yeah well we'll ask
people if they've ever if they if they
knew that Stephen they are aware that
Stephen never had a smartphone until a
week ago is think EF fooled everyone
yeah we'll ask them if that if that
affects his authority in their minds
yeah it's um what's the word it's the
scandal of the century Stephen doesn't
that it is okay in a smartphone world
it's big news well if we're leaving this
part on the podcast everyone's going to
hear so I guess the truth is out what
how we can always cut it out now let's
leave it all right hey everyone welcome
to the 10th episode of the pocket now
pocket cast podcast i am brandon minimun
editor-in-chief of pocketnow.com also on
the line is evan blast managing editor
of pocket now holler back Evan how are
ya good job uh and also on the line is
Anton Dean Agee senior editor of pocket
now holler back Tony well I'm gonna
holler back to but first I'm gonna
please ask you to excuse me if you hear
some strange sounds in the background
it's my neighbors tearing down walls so
I'm sorry for that is that a metaphor
they're tearing down walls or they know
they're redecorating tearing down walls
breaking down barriers that's what we do
yeah very good so a lot of smartphone
news to talk about today um got a big
list here and then we're gonna take your
Twitter questions I was supposed to
inform the others of what the Twitter
questions might be but it's just gonna
be a surprise because it's just more fun
that way so first thing we want to talk
about on april third and someone's
blinking me here april april third we
were talking about the google artwork on
front page which had ice cream and ice
cream sundae which is very strange
usually they use that as an opportunity
to commemorate something they were
commend commemorating I don't even know
that's the right where they are
celebrating the hundred and 19th
anniversary of the first documented ice
cream sundae it just seemed very strange
that they would they would advertiser or
stop sending me im's seems very strange
that they would advertise something like
that unless there was a reason and we're
thinking about the next version of
android um do you guys thinks that think
that this is the first hint no one's
really talking about this I do you do I
agree yeah um so I was looking up some
release dates and it looks like ice
cream should be talked about probably
starting next month I mean so it was
november october ish when we first heard
about gingerbread it was actually
november and Google operates on about a
six to seven maybe eight mother's
release cycle with Android so that puts
us at about May or June which which kind
of makes sense they probably want to
have the new version of Android out in
time for the holiday shopping season
what do you guys think will be the
headline feature of ginger ice cream
well before we get to that I just want
to emphasize a little bit on this sunday
thing because I don't know how many guys
have you out there know that actually
ice cream sundae is a combination of
several other ice creams and recently we
just heard that I mean we knew it that
honeycomb features will come to
Gingerbread and that will be ice cream
so in my mind I think it's really clear
that there's gonna be a mix between
honeycomb and gingerbread just like in
Sunday several flavor mixes and this
should be a pretty strong indication
it's a really good really good analysis
I didn't really think about that I
wasn't the ice cream business after all
you were yes I was previous job huh wow
that's interesting so yeah I think that
that's a strong indication and so what
do you think is gonna be the headline
fee
in ice cream well it's hard to say I
think there will be more touch friendly
features taken from honeycomb band from
tablet and ported along to smaller
devices we can have a very nice email
application the new media player a
improved internet browser so I think it
will be around these you know what you
think Adam um this is just totally you
know speculation and more Hope than than
anything else I I think would be nice if
they really I'm optimized for multi-core
processors you know and Android can
handle it right now but I think with
this newest generations of this newest
generation of phones Android really has
to you know take it to the next level
absolutely so I agree with that one
multi core supports huge a better way to
fast app switcher multitask no more tap
and hold so maybe we'll see the
permanent multi test button come over
from honeycomb on tablets which would be
great and yeah an improved web browser
with possibly a better speed and better
tab management the stock browser of
Android has really cruddy tab management
you have to go into another menu and
it's kind of a slow in her face mmm so
there's a lot there's a lot to do with
Android for phones and it's probably
going to be a pretty exciting update
unlike gingerbread which really was was
a very incremental upgrade that really
only appeased people making games and
people wanting to do near field
communication a man I was just gonna say
that could be the sleeper hit of the of
that version is NFC capabilities you
know do you guys think NFC is the is the
future of payment yeah but the question
is you know when's it gonna happen um I
was talking to an analyst at ctia and he
doesn't think it's gonna it's gonna be a
regular thing for for many years because
there's um there's no incentive for for
retailers to to to implement the
hardware because it's
you know it's another person taking a
bite out of the pie it's just like I
mean it's just like a credit card right
but um you know the way he was
explaining it made a lot of sense
there's there there's no one that that
really is pushing for it at this point
and it doesn't make financial sense for
anyone and it's not even a convenience
for the consumer I mean it's not like it
would encourage more sales when you go
to the local whatever you're gonna bring
your wallet because that as your ID in
it and presumably you you've driven
there and you need your ID I mean you
have your wallet on you anyway you've
got your phone in the other pocket but
it's the same amount of effort to take
out your credit card or cash than it is
to you know take out your phone I think
it will be just an additional option I
mean yeah it definitely will be a
feature for the future but I don't think
it will be for the near future maybe mid
term or long term future it will be just
another option to purchase some things
this way I feel like it'll be used
mostly for micro payments you know like
say you're you know you just want to buy
like one subway ride right now it's sort
of a pain because you have to go to the
Machine buy a ticket overlap you know if
you could just do with your phone you
can swipe it right at the turnstile yeah
that's a good point situations where you
have to go to a kiosk to pay like a
parking garage or transit system that
could be an interesting use bearnaise on
a side note i'm sorry who did I
interrupt okay on a side note talking
about features we've seen that recently
Android got some business oriented
features do you think that ice cream
sundae or sandwich or whatever its name
will be we'll have some business
oriented features in the future or at
lunch because currently Android is a
little bit lacking on the business part
i guess i guess rim still has sort of
the the market therefore for business
users and obviously that's a very very
very profitable industry in fact one of
the reasons microsoft took the took the
release path that they did
windows mobile was to capture the
business market back windows mobile 5.0
David trying they were trying to be
blackberry and then they realized how
big the consumer market is and it's as
big if not bigger than them business so
yeah you know hopefully as a consumer
and not really business user hopefully
Google's focusing on consumer friendly
features and not trying to make it more
secure and you know remote management
which would be nice anyway but yeah I
could see some some business friendly
features being thrown into ice cream
well you know what we're saying we're
starting to see now is I'm a push
towards making phones on dual purpose
dual use meaning that they have on you
know two distinct profiles 14 I'm
personal and one for business and you
know you can sort of sandbox those two
different usage cases and you know so it
allows people that to have one phone
instead of carrying their blackberry and
their Android or iPhone or whatever else
it is so I think that's something I
could get an embedded into the OS
eventually yeah back in 2008-2009 as if
that was such a long time ago it was
very common for me to see at least out
out and about somebody with a blackberry
and then they take out their iphone and
they're been carrying two phones and
then iphone has improved in the
corporate security department although
not to the extent of blackberry yet and
yeah I think there's a desire for people
to carry one device and I think Google
knows this and they're gonna try to make
that one device an android phone
absolutely right we'll all right let's
move on let's talk about these windows
phone 7 updates uh if you look at the
the window the Windows Phone website
where's my update and you click on
international you'll see that the vast
majority of phones have gotten their
march copy and paste nodo update now but
then if you flip over to the United
States it's like has been unchanged for
a week I mean the hd7 and the venue pro
and the menu pro no one has that now the
hd7 is really the only phone in the US
have gotten odo the surround the quantum
the focus are still in
testing so this is like molasses
although it is interesting that in the
United States the updates are a lot
slower which really says something about
probably the carriers that are taking
their time now they arrived on that ship
with no dough right right and I would
assume that the hd7 s will do the same
yeah and the trophy whenever that comes
out on verizon verizon trophy i was
thinking about this the other day guys
we've got to see a new wave of Windows
Phone 7 hardware um you know for for the
holiday shopping season I mean the
launch devices are just their lingering
and you know we're gonna see the that
the trophy on verizon is that right
there is the Mozart yours yeah the troll
you know we also saw those renders of
the ignite and the Prime hmm oh yeah
that's right so some new HD phones then
the ignite and the prime which might
actually be announced tomorrow and we're
going to talk about the HTC event
tomorrow although if you're listening
this podcast after you already know what
has been released but the way I look at
it is these launch devices are just
being milked I mean we're going to see
another version of the hd7 whoop-dee-doo
so when do you guys think we're going to
see a fresh wave of Windows Phone 7
devices and what kind of innovation or
changes do you think that they will
print well I think we won't see any
fresh windows phone seven until at least
the third quarter because we first need
to hear from Microsoft on the second
chassis specifications and the new
minimal requirements and we have so far
not heard of those and I think it's
normal that Microsoft sets out the new
requirements and then OEMs and
manufacturers come out with new devices
and announcements I think we might or
might not i no see or hear something at
this year's mix which will start I think
this week but I don't think we will see
any fresh windows phone 7 s until August
September or october
ya got some time there and the next wave
let's call it generation 2 of Windows
Phone 7 devices do you think we're gonna
see dual-core I mean is that even
necessary the windows phone 7 it's
already very fast and very fluid sure
you know your you always want hardware
to you know encourage software
developers to push the envelope even
more do you guys think we're gonna see
windows phone seven support higher
screen resolutions and generation to
higher no lower yes lower really yeah
because what we heard about Cathy to
hvga that's that's kind of congruent
with the you know the garner an hour
analyst report that said one of the one
of the ways that Windows Phone 7 is
going to take market share if they're
right is by reducing the price point of
these smartphones and really you can
only do that by using lower end
components like hvga screens that would
just be kind of depressing though to see
you know that the nice looking windows
phone 7 interface on a you know
resolution screen that's half basically
what you get on on the phones down I
mean imagine I I wonder if that means
that the Live Tiles you only get to see
for you know instead of eight I think
everything will be scaled down and the
experience will be just the same it's an
interesting thought very good well why
don't we talk about yeah the the event
tomorrow HTC is holding an event in the
UK we're pretty sure it's going to be
the HTC pyramid called the sensation
what other what other surprises do you
think we're going to see well think
there'll be any surprises I think we'll
we'll see the evo 3d gsm version
probably so the evo 3d gsm the sensation
and do you think the that won't be the
pyramid is a separate device right so do
you think tomorrow they're going to talk
about the pyramid or just the evo 3d
I think we'll see both tomorrow because
we we started to see the the evo pop up
there retailers so you know I think
there's some information out there that
it's it's coming how about the the prime
in the ignite that I don't know I mean
anytime you see you see renders of a
device like that you know there's
there's a good chance that it's coming
up pretty soon and those came out at the
same time as the the pyramid render so I
would expect to see those you know if
not if not tomorrow then then within the
next month probably they took the
pictures down of the prime of the ignite
for those that are unfamiliar they are
windows phone 7 devices one is kind of
like a desire z and the other one was
the other one it's just a slate just
asleep and a lower end that one I have a
lower end slate kind of reminds me of
the mozart and the trophy but maybe I
like the Mozart he was a good composer
i'll be on a more pessimistic note and
i'll say we will if we are lucky only
see the evo 3d gsm version and the
pyramid AKA sensation but we might also
see a new version of sense because the
evo 3d obviously has a new version of
sense and we might see that on the
sensation too yeah that's that's
probably very likely i mean the new
version of sense is probably only tuned
for the qhd display which of course the
sensation and the evo 3d have good point
daughter thank you very good let's move
on to some apple news so a new patent
was was awarded to Apple to extend the
functionality of their 30-pin connector
to support the Thunderbolt not to be
confused with the verizon phone by the
way I'll run there any trademark symbol
with the Thunderbolt device and thunder
board the connector Evan do you know
about any trademarks uh there there
maybe you know it
and as far as i know it's that's still a
code name or means that has that been
finalized as the retail name or the
retail branding of this technology i
think this is the standard name and it's
the final name of the technology yeah it
is if you go to the apple website
they've you know it is called yeah they
could absolutely run into trouble and
you know it's in the same general uh you
know classification of you know
communication devices i think it does a
disservice to the Apple technology
because when I think a Thunderbolt
Thunderbolt the HTC Thunderbolt i think
was talked about a good bit before
Apple's Thunderbolt technology so it's
gotta there's kind of a perception
problem i think brewing a little bit as
a verizon continues to aggressively
promote and advertise the HTC
Thunderbolt so this 30-pin connector
would allow you to do faster data speeds
with USB 3 and Thunderbolt but I'm just
wondering when they're going to get rid
of this 30 pin connector we've probably
talked about this before and not and
just go with micro USB the 30 pin
connector is is big and if you look on
the new ipad 2 you can almost see how
they're they're reaching the the
threshold of thickness to be able to
actually use the 30 pin connector it's
sort of rounded off on the side and it
doesn't it doesn't snap in as nicely as
it did on the EV iPad 1 yeah that's true
but I think the problem is that there's
such a huge ecosystem of third-party
products that use that connector that
there's just no way that they could get
rid of it anytime soon I think more
likely we would see a micro USB port
added you know so that you could you
could be charging while you have
something connected to the 30-pin that's
and I I concur here and I'm not sure if
you guys heard but in Europe the
European Union and the European
community came up with a standard that
all smartphones will be using micro USB
as a standard connector so in case apple
doesn't want to get into issues banning
them or that won't that won't allow them
to sell the iphone 5
Europe I think they might as well add a
micro USB port you I can I couldn't see
them banning the iPhone because it
doesn't have the micro USB I mean Apple
does whatever they want well i'm not
sure if it will be compulsory or if
there is a date to which up to which
everybody should switch towards micro
USB but for sure the standard agreed is
micro USB in europe and that it's not
clear though if that's voluntary or it
you know there was a law passed right
right so um and just another another
thought I'm sorry I'm this Thunderbolt
thing with the higher speeds now I'm
always into new technology and improving
but USB 3 and 10 gigabytes per second
would you really take use of that speed
I mean take a normal day to day scenario
when you copy pictures or you sync music
from your PC to your iPhone will you see
any difference between Thunderbolts the
connection and your standard USB 2
connection I mean there's certainly
indefinitely a limit of reads and writes
on the flash memory of smartphones which
is embedded they have a limit and once I
don't think it will reach 10 gigabytes
per second which is the standard for
Thunderbolt well it wouldn't it the
bottleneck the the standard sounds that
way and and the thing about these higher
data speeds is that the use case
scenarios are so limited I mean I just
bought a new computer which has USB 3
and I didn't even hook it up because I I
don't see I mean USB 2 is very fast
unless you're moving like 30 gigabytes
of data um you know those speeds are
just almost unnecessary and Thunderbolt
does 10 gigabits per second and and as
you imply um I don't think that a flash
memory can even take advantage of that
although presumably they they tune it up
make it a little bit faster so it can
work with that yes but how much data do
you move from your iPhone to your bc and
vice versa on a day to day basis no I'm
few gigabytes and it's almost a step
back because we want wireless sync we
want
sink we want we don't want to plug in
any more I mean it's kind of like a step
backwards um maybe transferring movies
but then you're just gonna download it
straight to your phone you know yep we
need us p for that also all our problems
uh-huh which will be Wireless yeah oh
yeah remember wireless USB whatever
happened to that hmm still kicking
around they found that it might cause
cancer all those wireless I think the
coolest things gonna be when we have
wireless power not just inductive
charging but real wireless power yeah
and then we'll have our routers and
their bluetooth devices and our wireless
keyboards and mice and everything will
be Wireless around then and our heads
will explode yeah you gotta wonder about
that um anyway sort of a tangent here do
you guys remember before micro SD there
was mini SD yeah I have a bunch of those
me too that that was around for
literally one or two generation of
phones and then it was killed very
quickly so hopefully no one bought any
what sounds like Evan did any mini SD
cards oh yes it's just it on the same
note that i don't think that SD cards
regular big as the cards will disappear
in the near future because they are
definitely the standard and digital
image capturing in cameras and
camcorders I think the mini SD was a
step towards the micro it was a midst
that the question is will we see a man
OST which will be even smaller than the
micro SD I think they can get any
smaller I mean these are already like
you can they're difficult to manipulate
they are you could swallow on and be all
right in fact I tried and memory
extension yeah I thought now I have 32
gigabytes of memory inside of me so
everything everything you guys say to me
just stored away in my micro SD chip
don't forget to defragment oh well
actually we flash memory you shouldn't
defragment right
um hmm very interesting I what do things
start making phones with compact flash
slots wouldn't that make them bigger
yeah I know it's a job although the I
packs of the of the past headaches those
expansion sleeves that allows you to you
know use compact flash memory what
happened to that lineup oh well it got
replaced by more modern equipment anyhow
very good so let's move on talking a
little bit of webos a little bit of
everything today so we knew that there
was a keyboard list HP webos device
coming i mean it's it's been in the
making and everyone once one because if
palm thinks or HP thinks that everyone
wants a hardware keyboard they're kind
of wrong and so there's this there's a
there's a leaked image of potentially
the HP stingray from precentral and it
basically looks like it's got the lines
of a webos device a little bit blurry it
has an iphone like look it kind of
actually looks like a touch HD where did
you say so Tony Nexus S a good point
Nexus S cuz of the camera on the front
but it also has a you know generic look
to it um why do you think that it's
taken HP or palm so long to I mean the
palm pre was launched two years ago or
so why do you think it's now that
they're finally starting to extend the
form factor to something I think
tradition I mean from what I know when I
don't know that many palm or HP devices
because they're not so common here in
this region of the world and living in
but from what i know it's tradition
every bomb recent bomb device had a
hardware keyboard I mean it was a
signature and yeah I'm sorry no go on
because I would like to know I'm the
whole trio line I mean well you know
first of all Thomas has always been sort
of reticent to to to change faster than
the industry or to keep up with trends I
mean you know you you they really
started resting on their laurels
after the the treo 600 and 650 and and
you know up through the the trio 800
treo pro there wasn't really much of a
change in the form factor or in the
features you know bumped up camera
resolution a little bit screen
resolution here but you know it really
weren't that many features added or that
many risks taken and and that's you know
that was the ethnos of the ethos of the
company for for many years and it led to
you know them needing to get bought by
another company it's so funny because
that that used to be okay you know
taking their time to perfect a keyboard
and having release cycles there were a
year and and that's sort of the what
palm continued when they came out with
the the web OS operating system and the
and the pre line of devices and pixie
but now it just can't be that way it's
almost to the detriment of the customer
because these companies can't really
perfect and take their time you've got
to innovate as fast as possible well on
this or hand i'm not sure that palm was
big enough to be able to I you know put
out you know a device every six months
right I just wanted to ask one thing on
the same no do you guys remember how
long it's a blackberry to ditch hardware
keyboard and come out with a touch only
smartphone and it's sucked it was
horrible so I think it's it's mainly
tradition I think when the um it's the
name that black right when I'm blanking
storm of course when the storm came out
I think a lot of people were under the
impression that they came out with this
dynamic screen that would actually mold
here almost feel like a keyboard and
we've been talking about a futuristic
technology where the the screen can
actually become porous or something like
that and they came out with this thing
that was basically a clicky mouse pad
and it was insulting and it was horrible
to use and then they you know for the
storm to they added four sensors which
made it a little bit better but most
people I talked through that have a
storm just don't really like it or they
send it back at our now using an iphone
or something yeah have you guys have are
used a storm
yeah have one I I rescued it remember
that story where my friend got a new
phone and offered him ten dollars you
know just to be able to play around with
the storm you wouldn't take it because
he wanted to he wanted to destroy it and
I had to offer him twenty dollars in
order to to get the phone hmm so it's a
first gen yeah yeah so it's actually
sort of worthless to me I didn't realize
this at the time it doesn't have Wi-Fi
and since you know I don't have cell
service on it there the only way to get
an internet connection is to tether it
to a computer it's not worth the effort
obviously have you ever used a storm
Tony and no actually the only BlackBerry
device I've used is the bold which I'm
currently using first generation 9000 I
think speak speaking of the boat how
about that uh that bold touch another
thing it took a long time for forum to
do was to couple the they're awesome
keyboard with a touchscreen you know the
boat for many generations now and the
curve and the many other key boarded
blackberry phones don't have
touchscreens um you got the torch now
but you know that was sort of hand yeah
that's a little bit a little bit
different um but to take this
traditional blackberry device and add a
touch screen I think it's going to be
pretty cool and I want potentially
rejuven eyes the line a little bit very
good well alright let's move on speaking
of webos it looks like the the pre three
is is headed heading to verizon this
summer there were some pictures again
from precentral showing a pre three with
verizon a sort of branding in the in the
cellular status area which i guess would
make sense although i'm a little bit
surprised and maybe we still have to
wait until to see this but i would think
that sprint would be the first with the
pre three because they were first with
the with the palm pre but then again
verizon was first with the pre plus
and of course then verizon gun so maybe
their relationship HP palms relationship
is best with verizon at this point in
time what do you guys think about the
the pre three mmm not too much I mean I
you know I use a pre plus for a little
while I wasn't too too impressed with it
I think it had some potential and you
know so with them with webos three-point
Oh perhaps you know it'll it'll live up
to that potential but ah I just I didn't
like the the direction that that palm
went in with these these devices and i
think that the pre three is just sort of
a bigger pre plus or pre to which is you
know itself basically a pre and a pre
plus they're all the same yeah i mean
that's that's the problem i have with
with webos at this point they're all the
same and i think that webos has evolved
to slowly and everyone acclaimed it's
multitasking prowess and how smooth it
wasn't fast it was yeah that is true but
that doesn't mean that the operating
system can still look the same almost
exactly the same two or three years
after its release you know after coming
from an Android phone it would be hard
for me to use a pre three um even though
there are changes to webos three-point
oh because you got this home screen that
you can't do anything with you can add
50 or 4i counts to the bottom you can
multitask like a champ but that's it
when you get back to your home screen
you get a wallpaper in a you know a
search field at the top it's not very
versatile for for my needs on this
coming from from a guy like me who has
never used never a webos device i cannot
really judge on the operating system i
can only judge on the aspect on the
authoress aspect of the smartphones and
the bri free looks just like the breach
you and the pre 2 plus and debris so
it's it's a line which i think it's
getting old yeah and what's interesting
is when analysts look at market share of
the smartphone operating systems they
don't even include palm
it's kind of kind of strange but I think
pretty telling and pretty accurate it's
webos devices are sort of niche devices
now they have a they have their
following they've they've got their
crowd of enthusiasts but you just don't
have that mass-market appeal for some
reason but hopefully that'll change with
the palm pre for four distinct ray or
the Stingray yeah exactly gotta have
that sexiness stingray might happen hey
those tablets do maybe that will be
their future the tablet the the touchpad
takes that idea of a useless home screen
to an incredible level because you have
all this screen space to work with right
what is it 1280 x 800 pixels or 1024 x
768 and all you can do is click on a row
of icons on the bottom it's worse than
the iPads lack of versatility and if
we're late a lot yeah that is saying a
lot I mean it's it's it's almost an
extreme opposite of a say honey comb or
you can have widgets on the home screen
or shortcuts or whatever you want but
that said the the touchpad does have a
really cool level of fit and finish once
you get into the applications that is
probably a little bit cleaner and more
modern looking than the iPad anyhow so
let's move on speaking of ipad iOS is
the iphone 5 getting a capacitive home
button 52 Mac posted a picture that
could very very easily have been faked
um do you guys think it makes sense for
the iphone 5 to have a capacitive home
button in a word no because um users of
the iphone were always so reticent to
capacitive buttons they were always so
proud of the clicking button which makes
you feel that you're actually clicking a
button and this is also my experience I
I kind of hate capacitive buttons
because you yes you had that vibrate
feedback but you don't actually get a
sense of the button if it was up to me
all the smartphones would have Hardware
clicking buttons but hopefully it's not
up to me
yeah I think it depends on you know from
from whose % from whose perspective
you're talking about it making sense
from the users i agree with Tony I don't
like capacitive buttons you know
especially ones that that don't light up
until you touch them so you basically
have to hit the wrong button in order to
find the right button it's just
ridiculous but from from hackles
perspective it does make sense because
the clicky buttons are one more thing to
break you know so so less clicking
buttons equals less returns equals you
know greater profits and and not to
mention having a lack of a button would
not only save cost but it would also be
more versatile so maybe they could have
a capacitive button on both sides near
and this doesn't even make sense but it
could be maybe a dynamic capacitive area
so all you have to do is tap in a
general vicinity so that when you rotate
the phone to landscape and then rotate
to landscape on the other side you're
not constantly having to say okay the
one buttons on the right now it's on the
left you could say okay it's always on
the right it doesn't matter where I
press can always get back home it's
funny that we're talking about a
capacitive home button because I thought
recently we were talking about no home
button at all with gestures um that
would be probably even more extreme than
going capacitive well didn't apple just
patent that that smart bezel for the for
for a device which which would actually
be similar to what you're talking about
you know using gestures on the side of
the screen to perform you know whatever
tasks they decide yeah and and that
smart bezel would pave the way for you
know and ipad 3 that hopefully doesn't
have a home button because that's it's
even worse in that case because you're
constantly flipping it over to landscape
and the button changes location with
honeycomb of course your home button is
always in the bottom left corner and I
think they did a really good job with
that so perhaps iOS devices are going in
that direction uh-huh is like I roll my
are you sound like he starts out to
sound like me
nice so let's move on talking about the
droid x squared and Evan do you like I
said square not too yeah that's that's
what we're thinking now is that it's
gonna be called squared but you know
that's that's a speculation on our part
at this point yeah um so it's funny the
droid x squared how it's gone through us
these periods of time where we thought
it was going to be just a faster droid x
with the same body and then and and now
after seeing some some benchmarks it
looks like it's got some pretty big
upgrades in terms of the specifications
qhd screen Tegra 2 and presumably that
means a lot more ram than get on the
droid x right now do you guys think that
this is going to come out to be a
significant upgrade of the droid x in
the in the two respects that you said
yes it's going to be no faster and have
a better screen but otherwise I mean the
camera is gonna be the same it's going
to have the exact same body style you
know they were probably shipped with the
gingerbread I have a couple more sensors
but it it'll be a you know a pretty
pretty significant I would say I'm
mid-cycle upgrade that that makes sense
it does make sense but that's very
confusing because why would they do a
significant upgrade and not change the
body style I can't think back to any
other device where they they up the
number of the device to the two or the
three and they kept the body style
exactly the same the accessories I think
of one thing you know there's there's a
lot of accessories out there for for the
droid x they want people to pick up an X
to you know possibly um you know pay
more for it earlier in their contracts
you know to renew the contract I don't
know also keeping the same form factor
and the same outer aspect could
dramatically reduce the production costs
and destroyed x2 or squared as you call
it them might be a cheaper high-end
device that's a good point they've
already got all these droid x
pacings you know they've got the the
manufacturing setup for them so why not
just change the internals and save maybe
make it a fifty-dollar hundred-dollar
high-end smartphone I mean that would
get a tremendous amount of attention
could be but then how does this how does
this sort of line up with the droid
bionic the droid bionic has a how big is
the screen on that it's four inches
right for or 4.3 and that also has tech
or two that also is qhd so I guess this
makes sense they need a they need a
high-end you know big 4.3 inch display
the droid bionic isn't that phone the
droid bionic is sort of a smaller more
petite pocketable is LTE maybe the
difference is does the x squared have an
LTE modem I was hearing no but that
would seem kind of ridiculous but that
could be a to just the so the droid
bionic has ltd right yeah that was one
of the the launch devices they've got to
be doing all their phones their higher
end phones with LTE now so which oh yeah
the kyocera echo is one of those rare
instances where it's a high end big deal
phone but they're not putting the
highest speed potential in there with
the 4g very good so droid x squared
could be cool device especially for
those wanting wanting that bigger form
factor and just in a more powerful
package let us move on so t-mobile
announced and it's very interesting how
companies are using Twitter and Facebook
to announce things guess that makes
sense announced that the g2x and the
sidekick 4G will be available on april
20 which is in nine days from now i can
there no take pre-orders on the on the
fifteenth of april the g2x we know about
it's an optimus 2x we've seen it before
it's going to be it's going to have the
4g hspa+ connectivity no surprises there
I'm kind of
somewhat infatuated by the sidekick 4G
because the sidekick brand of course
used to be very strong especially with
teens and those teens have since
probably gone into their 20s and now
they're all using android phones and now
they're coming out with the sidekick 4G
which of course runs Android has that
same crazy form factor and I just gotta
wonder if the timing is a little bit off
here well I sort of look at a different
way I think instead of going after the
ex you know the former sidekick users
market this is sort of an entry-level
Android device to get people you know to
get younger kids teenagers sort of
acclimated to the the whole new android
operating system and then you know move
them into a galaxy s or you know God
forbid for samsung motorola or HTC
device marketers are our kind of crazy
in the way that they think they try to
segment the buying population into
different groups and they and Microsoft
did this with the Kin right and it it's
not right they said that there's a group
of people who have these very active
lifestyles and they want to be cool and
they're young and they want to post to
their wall constantly and the truth is
that these people want a high-end
awesome phone just like a 25 year old
just like a 40 year old does so these
sort of very targeted devices like the
sidekick 4G I don't think are going to
be successful because they don't they're
not going in there you know I mean yeah
but I tend to disagree a little bit I've
been a bit big bit because I think the
sidekick 4G will be a huge hit first of
all because it's got a tradition and
tradition often means a lot and second
it's got that cool way of sliding out
the screen to remove the keyboard and
and it's what I think teenagers and the
young people will dig it's your typical
texting social networking smartphone
which happens to run the world's most
popular operating system
the it's it's on tmobile so I think it
will be huge it runs windows 7 ha it
looks like a toy though and this
keyboard can be that usable well we will
review one and we'll try to have an open
mind of course and I thought it looked
pretty good in my hands on to be honest
with you yeah how did it feel the
quality it felt good that's why I'm
saying it it was um it you know samsung
I've put together I you know a nice
product it does is they usually do yeah
it does make me feel a little bit better
than it's a Samsung product and nada
sharp not a sharp sorry sharp oh uh yeah
okay so we wanted to end up here
answering some Twitter questions we
asked for questions and we got some we
got many so let's pull up here Twitter
dude you have to listen to my annoying
humming um oh here's from one from
nijiya no Jack no he's asking so no app
for Windows Phone 7 yes no maybe um we
are looking into apps for all the
platforms unfortunately or fortunately
depending on your perspective it's hard
for us to commit to one operating system
say we're just going to do an Android
app we have to do at least three so
we're thinking about it there might be a
surprise this year with a pocket now app
we've been talking about it a lot so
let's go with maybe next I mean do
people want apps for every single one of
the websites that they go to well let me
let me put it this way the mobile
version of pocket now MDOT pocket now
calm gets a lot of traffic well yeah
that's because people browsers are
redirected towards it yeah but they
could they could bookmark the desktop
version which is linked to by the by the
bottom of the page I think people in
general prefer mobile formatted stuff on
their mobile phone and this has been a
debate for years
I mean the truth is when you're out and
about you don't have time to let a full
page load with flash advertisements and
full images you just want to see
information and see it fast so I think
there is a place for uh but have it like
on the iPad say you know what would a
pocket now application on the iPad offer
that that the the regular site couldn't
well I be hesitant to think about an
iPad app because we don't cover tablets
but in that example without giving way
to form a too much information about
what we're thinking we could customize
the interface we can make it make drop
down so people can see our most recent
review we could have advanced sorting
options things that the website could do
but have that touch interface
everything's customized around the way
we want it is kind of compelling and
it's always cool to have a dedicated
application yeah it is cool so here's a
question from b16b que OS tas i can't
read that oh i don't know the answer to
this do we know how many languages will
be added on windows phone 7 for mango
and if there will be Greek how many
languages does windows phone seven
support right now those either you know
I think it's seven it's a English German
it's Elian Spanish French I think it's
five okay so so that makes sense so he
wants one released in Greek do you know
if there's going to be additional
languages added there will be yeah but
I've heard that there will be some Asian
languages a Japanese Chinese and I don't
it will be and it would make huge sense
to add some European languages too but
it all depends on what the marketing
strategy is I mean just take a look at
China it's the world's biggest
smartphone and phone consumer in the
world so getting a priority on a chinese
input and language support will be i
think higher priority than greek no
offense to anybody so i think it depends
and yes there will be language is added
just that we don't know how many and
which ones
work with android does that support more
languages out of the box I think yes I
think because I have a friend who is
living in Israel and he's obsessed about
about Hebrew localization and he so
found that Android has that ah very good
the next question is from hyacinth 718
this probably good question for evan is
there anything you can come up with to
explain the delays for verizon's windows
phone 7 device um testing I guess and
you know probably when they were
originally testing it they you know it
was the the pre note you know the
original on shipping version of Windows
Phone 7 and then you know they they had
to test it with no dough and that I mean
I don't think there is a great reason
you know sprint was was able to push it
out obviously and of course you know the
gsm carriers were able to get it done on
time so I I don't know verizon you know
all it never ceases to amaze me I mean
look at look at all the phones that that
we've seen you know leaked for months
and months and they just never come out
like the merge and the the Samsung jam I
mean yeah we we saw those phones last
year and you know now we're four months
into this year and they still haven't
been released I think a lot of it as you
implies to do with testing um you know I
spent I spent time in verizon's testing
facility they there's a reason why they
have the most reliable network and I I
really feel that they do they test every
phone so tremendously much that it
starts to sort of impact their release
cycle a little bit but I guess that's
the that's the compromise that they have
to make in order to give you but I think
that testing a smartphone for three or
four months is just ridiculously too
much we've been hearing about the
verizon trophy since when December I
think when it was the first offer for
Microsoft employees and the here we are
it's almost middle of April and it's
still we're still hearing that it will
be delayed too may so come on
it's five months into 2011 it's how many
months november december and it's seven
month into windows phone 7 since lunch
not only verizon will lose ground but
microsoft will be hugely impacted by
this we were thinking of course that
they are holding it back because of no
dough because that the rollout schedule
is not finished but we get we got the
sprint arrived it's out there with no
though I know though is rolling out two
devices what's holding them back good
good point so maybe they can't decide on
whether to call it the trophy or the 7
trophy haha maybe it's something HTC
related who knows I mean we're pointing
fingers at verizon and Microsoft but
maybe it's something on HTC side d
alright let's move on to the next
Twitter question I think I'll take this
one it's from Surya Sen del send deal
asking which phone is better the desire
s the incredible s the Nexus S those are
the three choices all the s devices well
let's for a minute basket together the
desire s and the incredible s because
they're very similar the desire s is a
little bit smaller more pocket friendly
than the incredible s so so we're
looking at sort of the desire s
incredible s and the nexus s my vote is
for the nexus s and i say that because i
really like the the screen the super
amoled i like the curved display
although it's kind of a novelty it looks
really good on a tabletop it's got this
kind of very dark stealthy design when
the phones off you can't see any buttons
it's very fast probably as fast as the
the desire s in the incredible s um and
yeah I'd say the Nexus S it's a really
good really good phone it just move on
um duty to do that's too general okay
how about this one no not that one
okay yeah well okay going okay so from
pocket pro 115 uh it's always always
good to ask this question every every
few weeks if you could have any phone
what would it be and why so Tony why
don't we start with you any phone in the
world what would you have out or not yet
out uh let's say phones we know about so
it can be a phone that's not out yet hmm
well of course getting past my dell
venue pro fetish which is behind me now
i'd say i go for either a LG optimus 3d
or an EVO 3d not because of the 3d
gimmick but because they seem to be the
hottest smart phones out there at the
moment very good what do you think Evan
yeah I would also have to say the evo 3d
um I I spent a little time with it and
you know it just looked like a really
tight device you know everything we've
been waiting for from HTC for for you
know over a year now finally there I'm
gonna go the route of the sensation
because I think without the 3d screen
you're going to get a thinner form
factor the Thunderbolt the evo 4g they
are thick phones I can't get over it you
know the desire HD is probably going to
hat is probably going to be around the
same thickness compared to the the
sensation so my my focus for the
sensation but I think we could all
settle for the iphone 5 prototype which
is out there somewhere yeah that would
probably be cool too well only if there
is new software on there of course iOS 5
iOS 5 yeah well I have no other
questions in my queue that data we we're
gonna answer here so i think that old
coot conclude the 10th episode of the
pocket now pocket casts podcast thanks
again for listening we really really
really appreciate you listening in your
support and we will talk to you next
time but i right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
