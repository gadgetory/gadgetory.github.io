changes into standard hardware the
oculus rift ghosts live for consumers
with a few retailers in tow and LG has
decided to change the way we approach
fingerprint scanners I'm hi mera leave
it and I still don't understand why so
serious this is out daily the
official news today start with Amazon
those of you interested in deals buying
your kids a tablet or your little
brother or whatever well the Amazon fire
tablet is now for 39 bucks if you go for
the eight gig bottle ten dollars more
for the 16 gig the HD model is for $69
and then the HDX is somewhere around
there as well a lot of really good deals
it seems that either the company is
planning to revamp the tablets that we
were expecting for it to do so a couple
of weeks ago or they just want to sell
them for cheap another official news
those of you interested in more VR the
oculus rift is now available for
consumers it's actually arriving to
people's doorsteps starting today those
of you interested it's available on
Amazon the Microsoft Store and best buy
it will cost you six hundred dollars
includes two very good games in addition
to an Xbox controller sensors and
everything not the typical vive headset
and controllers move around I have a
thing but it's still good even though
six hundred dollars a six hundred
dollars and then the computer starts at
1500 if you want something that's
compatible with it some very interesting
developments have to do with contact
lenses that are smart it's funny google
glass never took off we're still waiting
to see when it's coming back but we saw
Samsung panting some of these and now we
see Sony doing the same thing we don't
know exactly what these companies are
planning to do with smart contact lenses
especially at a time when not even the
glasses were able to make the mainstream
but we'll see and for those of you that
were not happy with Samsung retaining
microUSB with the galaxy s7 Galaxy s7
edge we've got some trusted sources
claiming the USB type-c will make a
debut in the note 6 now most people
believe that the reason why Samsung
stayed away from USB type-c had
everything to do with the gear VR which
is weird all they had to do is give you
an extra adapter for the
but yeah us bc apparently comes to the
galaxy note 6 and we'll see what other
changes come with the phone as well and
finally the very hot news that they have
to do with LG as the company has just
announced a new type of display that now
includes fingerprint scanning pretty
much everywhere or at least it doesn't
really define in which part of the class
since you no longer need a cut out for
it so it could just be in the part of
the bessel or it could just be in part
of the class we need to get more
information on the way this product is
going to work but this show is that
things like whatever Apple was
envisioning for touch ID everywhere
could probably happen this year as you
know that LG is one of the largest
partners for apple with the launch of
the iphone but anyways it leads me to
the question of today when you buy a
smartphone how important is the fact
that it has or doesn't have a
fingerprint scanner I will admit in my
case I have products like the Moto X
peer that i love but i just don't use
because of the lack of a fingerprint
scanner leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your case friends you
