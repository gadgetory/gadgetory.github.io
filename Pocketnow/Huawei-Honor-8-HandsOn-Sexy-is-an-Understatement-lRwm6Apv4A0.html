say it again but 2016 is shaping up to
be an incredible year for mid-range err
phones attending the lunch of honors
latest the manufacturer didn't
disappoint bringing some of our favorite
features to a four hundred dollar price
point and here's the honor eight getting
it out of the box we've got a fresh
approach to packaging pulling the phone
out of a slot and peeling off the
plastic it's a sexy looking gadget in
blue glass also in the box we've got a
charger and cable and of course those
papers will totally never get around to
reading and taking a quick look around
the hardware if this phone looks
familiar then you've been keeping up
with our coverage on the Huawei p9 it's
a nearly identical hardware layout
swapping a metal back for glass
specifically 15 individual layers of
glass to play with light and reflections
and in this sapphire blue color it
really does play with light in a fun way
I guess blueglass is this year's rose
gold the rear of the phone is home to
the dual camera system from the p9 here
in all its photography glory to 12
megapixel sensors one color one
monochrome capture fantastically
detailed photos with incredible dynamic
range you can watch our p9 real camera
review to see this bad boy in action and
it really is one of the best cameras
currently available on any phone for
still photography for no good reason
here's a photo of my room service
cheeseburger taken from the honor eight
and yes it was delicious also on the
back is the fingerprint sensor new for
this phone is a button built under the
sensor which is not a power button
that's still on the side this is an
action button which will act as a
shortcut for your favorite apps through
a single double or a long press now the
front face holds the 5.2 inch 1080p LCD
and above the screen you'll find an 8
megapixel selfie shooter by the earpiece
the phone is dual SIM or you can pop in
a micro SD card to add to the 32
gigabytes of built-in storage in the
bottom of the phone is home to the
speaker USB C port and headphone jack
and hello what do we have here on top of
the phone why it's an IR blaster to use
this as a universal remote a feature not
found on the Huawei p9 and one all but
extinct on other manufacturers offerings
now internally the honor 8 is packing a
Kirin 9 5 0 chipset with 4 gigabytes of
RAM and this combo delivers performance
somewhere in between phones that use a
Qualcomm 6 v 2 and a Qualcomm 820 again
looking back at the p9 you don't have
any concerns over this phone handling
daily driver tasks and in the past it's
performed well as a mobile gaming
solution thankfully all of this hardware
is backed up by a 3000 milliamp hour
battery and honors proprietary quick
charging technology now looking at the
software our old friend emui
is onboard this software heavily
customizes the look and feel of Android
arriving at something which almost
completely resembles iOS but with
support for widgets one of the more
polarizing aspects of the honor line
some love this UI but if you like having
a separate app drawer to keep things
tidy you might want to look at replacing
this with another launcher and we've got
a handful of gestures and knuckle
actions and a new power saver mode which
will reduce the screen resolution to
1280 by 720 all handy features for a
phone that's heavily focused on
lifestyle and courting a youth
demographic this is an exciting move up
the food chain for honor after this
year's honor 5x at around a $200 price
point the honor 8 will sell unlocked for
399 for a 32 gigabyte model and 449 for
a 64 gigabyte phone that's an aggressive
push offering up similar experiences to
the Huawei p9 while adding an IR blaster
and quick action button and setting
their sights squarely on one plus Z te
and Alcatel we've got some incredible
options to play with in the mid-range
these days and honor just added another
one to make our purchasing decisions a
little more difficult how does this
phone stack up to the competition stay
tuned for our future coverage on the
honor 8 and our full review coming soon
