pocketnow.com and this is the hard work
toward the acer d x 900 and again this
is one of the very few devices in the
world or ever made do you have two sim
card slots so you can actually have two
phone lines on this device at one time
and in the next video we're going to
talk all about how you actually manage
to phone lines from one device what is
it like when someone calls you on one
line what happens if you want a
conference what happens if you want to
make a call from line one or line two
we'll talk all about that but before
that let's talk about hardware so let's
talk a little bit about specifications
this device is running windows mobile
6.1 professional it has two sim card
slots but each sim card slot has
different radio frequencies associated
with it so the first sim card slot is
the 3g slot so it is hsdpa in UMTS with
the 850 nineteen hundred and twenty one
hundred bands megahertz bands and this
will actually work with 3g in the u.s.
i'm using AT&amp;amp;T right now and in my area
850 850 megahertz is the band that is
used for UMTS so i am getting hsdpa on
this now that first sim card slot will
also do quad-band gsm and edge with 850
900 1800 and 1900 megahertz now the
second sim clock sim card slot does not
do 3g it has just GSM tribe and so only
nine hundred eighteen hundred and
nineteen hundred megahertz on that the
processor is 533 megahertz it's a
samsung processor it's got 256 megabytes
of flash ROM but it has microSD
expansion as we'll see plus it has 128
megabytes of sdram we'll talk more about
specifications on pocketnow.com we make
the post but that should give you an
idea of what we're talking about here
this device also has an accelerometer so
that in every screen there is screen
rotation and we're going to talk more
about that in the software review the
design of the acer d x 900 is not very
progressive and it's not very sleek it
actually looks like a device that may
have been released a few years ago
it doesn't have the clean lines of you
know the touch of diamond to or even the
touch HD and also it feels quite hefty
in hand it is not a thin device it's not
a I wouldn't call it a sexy device you
may disagree but let's let's take a tour
around the device see what we have here
on the front here we have the light
sensor next to the front-facing video
camera here's the earpiece and as you
can see a little blink there there is a
status indicator light to tell you if
you have a new messenger if you're
charging the battery or something like
that going down here we have a call
start and call end button and now you
would think that you may have two sets
of these instead of one since there are
two phone lines but it's all done
through the software and then we have a
d-pad here a nice predominant d-pad up
down left right and center going off to
the other side we have a volume rocker
here next to a record button and the
jack for not this is in 3.5 millimeter
this is 2.5 millimeter actually which is
kind of annoying its non-standard not
many people use that smaller adapter but
I guess it's better than nothing going
to the bottom we have a mini USB port
that is used for syncing and charging on
the other side of the device we have a
camera button a dual action camera
button so it has autofocus a microSD
slot which is external and thus
hot-swappable that's good here's a soft
reset hole and to the right of that is
the power on and off button flipping
over to the back we have the autofocus
camera which does indeed have a flash
that's good and then we have two holes
which make it look like this device has
dual speakers but I doubt that's
actually the case now the camera is
three megapixels this is a kind of
rubbery coating so it feels solid in
hand again it feels thick in hand though
if we take off the back battery cover we
see the battery which is up sighs 1530
milliamp hours and that's pretty much it
for the hardware tour of the acer d x
900 again the design isn't very
progressive and not very sexy but beauty
is in the eye of the beholder you may
disagree on that front the really
interesting thing about this phone is
that dual SIM card functionality which
we're going to talk a lot more about
coming up in the next review where we're
actually going to test it and show you
how it works that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
