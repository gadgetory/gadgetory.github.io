that's not related to a drum solo wait I
do one afterwards um so bag and I'll has
been around since 2000 and I've been
around doing pocket now stuff since 2002
and it's changed a lot from what used to
be kind of like this hobbyist enthusiast
blog type site to a real thing and then
a little bit after that it turned into
this real thing with real like extremely
high caliber people so the the fact that
we're able to hire Taylor
uh is just it's unbelievable and uh you
know I feel lucky that we can do this uh
I don't make your eyes look I'd cry
right now I find that's your white
balance setting um but I mean you know
we are we are poised for some cool oh
whoa i just said the Esper just drop
this bomb with no come on tagging this
video's just it's coming out it's coming
out from here we're poised for some
really cool stuff and uh I'm very happy

whoever closing salt will go to in and
out burger with all of you whenever I
see you next time yeah Oh God knows you
got not cut yeah you had a good time I
me and Tony hold on a sec I i'm not
going to in out burger again until Tony
comes the United States and goes with us
that's what else okay no pressure can go
boys Tony yeah but I don't get it the
caliber of a guy that you want to take
to in-n-out burger I mean seriously you
give him those for me patties and the
guy is gonna be happy as hell are and
he's happy he's probably you're only
gonna walk in with this model of jack on
under his arm are you gonna be like give
me the biggest thing you got you may
never get her bag you like yeah okay
gentlemen before Brandon hits us with
his drum solo thank you very much for

excited about this as we are we're

Taylor with the new colleague Adam dealt
with Michael Fisher in his new position
