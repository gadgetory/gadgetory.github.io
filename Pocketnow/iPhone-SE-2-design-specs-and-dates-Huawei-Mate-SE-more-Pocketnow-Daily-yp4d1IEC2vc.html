very close to a launch but we shouldn't
expect visual changes Google pay goes
official since third time's a charm for
Mountain View and I guess we
underestimated how curvy was curvy when
it came to Sony's offerings for him WC
I'm Jaime Rivera and before we begin we
would love to give a shout out to
Squarespace for sponsoring this video
whether you're looking for a domain
website or online store Squarespace is
my favorite option they've got beautiful
designer templates Squarespace is pretty
much an all-in-one platform that's also
got award-winning 24/7 customer service
head on over to squarespace.com slash
pocket now for 10% often get started
this is bogging out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for a great smartphone and
great headphones the icon acts 20:18
continue to be some of my favorite all
wireless headphones and well right now
if you go for a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 or
a galaxy s 8 you pretty much can get
these in the box obviously it makes a
lot of sense for this to happen now that
the galaxy has nine is around the corner
at least for the s8 I wouldn't recommend
that option but the note 8 oh yeah I
would go for that one now let's move the
spotlight over to Huawei we're expecting
something major to happen from the
company soon but not necessarily at MWC
or could it we've got some certification
documents that show us the huawei mate S
II and it looks pretty much like the
honor 7x which is actually great we've
got the honor 7x that arrived this
morning to our doorstep expect the video
coming very soon this phone is really
pretty really beautiful looking and red
it looks gorgeous
and yeah Huawei wants to take a stab of
that design as well why not now let's
talk about Google pay I mean that
service was announced a few weeks ago
it's going to replace Android pay not
exactly sure if it's gonna replace
Google Wallet which just came back from
the dead as well but yeah it launched
today it's got some conveniences like
the fact that you can just get close to
the reader and not open any app or
anything just get close to it and it'll
pay for whatever you want obviously you
have to see the approval on the device
but yeah hopefully Google figures this
one out
now let's talk about Sony we're
expecting something major from the
company at MWC and we saw some leaks of
curves and thing about it is we saw
those curves today and some leaks of the
sony xperia eggsy compact and oh my god
that thing is chubby and don't get me
wrong I mean I'm the first person that
says hey why don't we get thicker phones
that bring better batteries
it seems Sony took that a little too
literal let's see what we get and
finally the very hot news today I have
to do with the iPhone se - this is one
of the markets favorite iPhones it's the
least expensive it brings a design that
you can use with one hand and that we
had so many rumors that it was gonna get
a notch that was gonna look like the
iPhone 10 yada yada yada but I think you
could put that to rest I've got some
trusted sources claiming that we are
getting an iPhone se to either by end of
March or at WWDC but the design won't
really change apparently what is
changing is that we get less bezels on
the display apparently it's the same
form factor in everyway 4.2 inch display
is the change in addition to that two
gigs of ram we've got the 810 fusion
ship and not the AE 11 bionic most
important apparently the price tag is
staying but ya don't expect many changes
at least we to the question today do you
think it's smart for Apple to keep that
design for I think that's seven years
now or do you think that it would have
been awesome to get an iPhone se to that
looked like the iPhone 10 in my case
