we're going to take a look at opera 9.5
mobile beta first stop this on the HTC
Titan too and I have the keyboard slit
out one thing I really like about
Windows Mobile is that you can control
everything with the keyboard so here i
go i'm just going to press Start
programs and then let her go for opera
and we're launching opera
now right away you notice some problems
there's no soft key menus here so if I
press my hardware soft key button
nothing happens left and right nothing
happens star mini still works that's
good ok button work if i use my arrows
I can go to different links but can't
really zoom out or access any of the
menus items can't access the address bar
either can't access the favorites so I'm
going to have to look for my stylist or
I can use my finger but problem with
using finger I mean this is covering
twenty or thirty percent of screen right
now let's try it anyway
this is a really excellent figure see it
as I'm typing it predicts what website
i'm typing based on size that i've been
in past so i can just click that
this is on a Wi-Fi connection
right now I have the fit to screen
option turned on so although everything
is jumbled together you actually have to
access this button right there to access
the options it's not labeled on anything
so it's kind of hard to understand
I turn off fit the screen maybe
where's my stylist
it's going to load like it what I'm
desktop so all the way zoomed in right
now double tapping zooms out there's no
way of knowing how to do that unless
there's a hope file somewhere I don't
know and double tap it again zooms in
but as you can see the type doesn't rack
so pretty useless I have to scroll all
the way we're here to read that line and
it will all the way back over here to
read that line not so great but I guess
is good that you can see the whole
screen now this has automatic full
screen mode on so if I want to access
other stuff I have to press some kind of
button
there's an spur and none of these
buttons down below are accessible from
the keyboard so you're going to have to
use your finger or stylus this one shows
separate tabs or windows whatever do a
new tab and we can type something else
mobile.live.com doesn't actually go to
the mobile site so we can't really do
much there
Google does go to the mobile site
and that actually works pretty well very
nice there's no zooming though this
already isn't and there's no scrollbar
so you can't really jump all the way
down to the bottom you have to scroll
like this since pretty tedious
to spin we don't know what that does
lots of unlabeled icons we can't read
them beginners I can understand them
difficult to learn this button like this
does back
and here you see two tabs and out the
house I guess would go home
and oh miss Appa page
what else we have in here transfers
nothing here I guess don't know what
that does
it's pretty nice history
apparently have to double tap those
and apparently after double tap this too
so that's pretty nice another nice
features at the tap and hold menu and
you can send the image or save the image
that's excellent I cannot select text
however
I don't have to save the page I guess oh
here we go text selection huh
beautiful
selection off where is that
it would be nice if all of these options
were accessible with the keyboard but I
guess opera is mostly designed for touch
screen devices only so you're going to
have to use your finger or stylus
nothing I don't like is that this is all
black whereas my theme would be nice
blue
let's look at the settings again
can change your home page there
change some display options there
these password management
alright nice now there's a check mark an
X at the bottom it would have been nice
if those were words that people can read
because I'd rather haven't okay and the
hardware buttons normally associated
with those areas of the screen don't
actually activate those functions so
could be better
and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
