get announced along with the new Nexus 7
android 4.4 point2 rolls out to the
Nexus 5 with a couple of changes and
quoc them takes a stab at its first
64-bit processor I'm hi Mary that I and
all we need now is a google edition
iphone don't we man this is clocking out
daily let's stay off with some official
noodles as android 4.4 point2 will
surprisingly launch for nexus devices
last night and if you're thinking that
it's a minor update I suggest you think
again this brings the patch for SMS bugs
that allows hackers to take control of
your phone so yeah hit the Update button
he'll probably take you some time to get
it but it's really important now another
concerning news customers have now been
complaining about losing photographs
from the Nokia photos application on
their Lumia devices and as it turns out
the way this happens is they're editing
a photo on the application and then they
multitask on to another app and then
when they come back their photo gives
them an error and they can't claim the
photo anymore and this is most probably
a buck their photos are probably still
there they just need a patch or
something obviously it'll take some time
for nokia to deal with this but
hopefully they will we'll keep you
posted now let's talk about welcome as
the company has just taken a stab at
their first 64-bit mobile processor
which is love the Snapdragon 410 and
even though we can't really understand
why they chose to go below the
Snapdragon 800 moniker it turns out that
this processor brain 64-bit operation
but it's kind of limited as it always
enforced 13 megapixel cameras and 1080p
displays maximum so obviously we will
see phones coming out with this next
year but if these are going to be the
mid-tier specifications I really want to
see that 810 processor now raise your
hands all of you fans of the pocket now

the day Believe It Or now we get to new
google edition products because one of
them is a phablet the Sony Xperia Z
ultra even though we didn't like it that
much we now have a glitch in version of
it and we also have the LG G pad 8.3 and
it's google edition variant which ends
up competing with the nexus 7 in a way
speaking of the Nexus 7 we also get a
white variant of the Nexus 7 as of today
which is awesome so it's great to see
that we have more google edition
products even though there is a
substantial difference in price between
the Nexus 7 and just about everything
else including the Nexus 5 as well so
anyways that leads me to the question of
the day what do you think about these
new google edition products do you like
any of them because in my particular
case I do love that G pad 8.3 for me
it's one of the best products out there
for a google edition option I just again

xperia z ultra i would have loved to see
the z1 but anyways leave us a comment
