One Nokia sends out press invitations
for its future Lumia lineup event and
Apple is now pending dual cameras to
make smartphones thinner I'm hi Natalie
that I and whenever you see a pen that
says that Apple's building the invisible
smartphone I'm kind of going to believe
that this is out daily let's
just say off with some official news as
nokia has just sent out presentations
for their event to happen on april
second where they're planning to launch
their future Lumia lineup and they're
actually announcing this in the teaser
we are waiting for the Lumia 630 which
is a mid-tier phone aside from the Lumia
930 which is the successor to the 920
that's really gonna be hot but aside
from that we also hear rumors of Nokia
calling its future firmware Windows
Phone blue for Windows Phone 8.1 in the
past we had amber and black so we should
be expecting some really interesting
features here just stay tuned for that
and speaking of Microsoft because Nokia
is a Microsoft company this is really
interesting we've got some customers
complaining about the fact that they've
ordered the surface pro 2 and they're
getting the surface pro in their
shipments and i'm not talking about
these people buying these tablets on
amazon i'm talking about people
complaining that they bought these
online on the microsoft store and they
get the old variant of the core i5
processor which is a really interesting
coming from Microsoft I mean why exactly
do they still have a stock of old
devices so you know be wherever you're
out there to buy a surface just hit the
link to the description for full details
and want people are complaining about it
make sure you don't get the same
problems because it's really hard to
tell the difference now it's all about
Apple as the company has just filed a
very interesting patent the dual cameras
or separate cameras it's pretty much one
module but it's separated into two
lenses and the concept of these separate
sensors is that one sensor will capture
certain things in the other sensor will
capture the other to build one photo and
the only reason why they want to do this
is because apparently number one it'll
make the phone tablet or computer
thinner or number two the fact that
apparently you will be getting better
photos from this though we can't really
confirm that so stay tuned pens never
really necessarily happen when it comes
to Apple so a lot of things could happen
let's talk about Samsung and its galaxy
s5 as we get more rumors that the
company
is expecting some sort of production
constrains apparently and this again is
probably confirmed that they are having
issues building that I so self-censor
with the lenses or some sort of problem
it's a manufacturing issue obviously as
I'm customers will probably not notice
that initially they'll just restricted
to certain markets but still it is a
problem with the galaxy s5 hopefully
that I so sell sensor is as great as
they want to sell it and finally for the
very hot news of the day HTC has finally
unwrapped they're all new HTC One which
is now just the HTC One m8 that is the
official name for the phone you can
watch everything that we publish we have
our full review text and video we have
our comparison with the old HTC One in
comparison with Sam's and its lineup for
this year and even the unboxing because
you know we love to do unboxing and
aside from that we have our editorial
round table of all of our impressions of
what we thought about this phone so
please make sure you hit like to the
description watch all the videos and
then that leads me to the question of
the day what do you think about the new
HTC One m8 is this gonna be your future
phone because in my particular case guys
I wanted this phone so bad I wanted it
so bad and then we didn't get a better
camera we actually got a lamer camera

don't think I'll get it but leave us a
