in the second video we're going to
compare the email and calendar
applications on Android 2.0 with windows
mobile 6.5 running HTC touch flo 3d and
then in the final video we're going to
take a look at these settings the
programs and the marketplaces and those
nuances between the two operating
systems let's go ahead and begin with
Android this time you do have two
applications you have one which is a
general email application and you have a
gmail application if you have gmail
accounts they will be pushed gmail and
you can go ahead and tap on those and
you can set up more than one gmail
account tapping on an email will open up
that email in HTML formatting and you
can scroll left right and pan up and
down as well pictures are not
automatically loaded to protect your
privacy but you can tap on it and it
will load pictures and you can also
search within email so let's go ahead
and search for some of brandon's email
by typing in his last name and it will
load up some of the conversations that
brandon and i have and if you keep on
swiping up it will continue to load more
conversations on the server in the email
application you can configure multiple
accounts as well they could be gmail
accounts or they could be corporate
accounts exchange accounts or any other
pop or IMAP account you do have a
combined email inbox which is nice and
once you're in the combined view you see
the color coding on the left hand side
here and that color coding shows the
different email accounts at a glance so
if you tap on this mobile world congress
email you can see it formatted in HTML
view and you can also view it in
landscape mode as well
in google android 2.0 you have two
calendars you have a regular calendar
with which things up to your google
calendar for your google account you can
tap on it if you tap and hold you can do
a new event that way and everything is
very finger friendly you can choose from
the radio buttons here you can set it
and then you can type and pull up the
on-screen keyboard so we're going to say
test events
and then once you're done and here after
you're done there's no way to get rid of
the on-screen keyboard you have to
either tap on a field or you can scroll
from the top so that's a little bit of
an annoyance and you can select which
calendar so we're going to go ahead and
tap on the calendar select it let's go
to the bottom and hit done and the event
has been created so there's not really
that much special with the calendar you
can scroll through swipe left and right
so that you can move to different dates
let's go ahead and view it view the
month view in the month view if you have
stuff going on it will show you in green
so let's go ahead and see our calendar
for that day and then you also have a
corporate calendar application as well
we're going to go back home I'm going to
go ahead and open our corporate calendar
this things up with your corporate
exchange server you don't i don't have
one set up but if you do have an
exchange account you can configure it
right here so that it will sink so you
can keep a separate work and home life
if you want let's go ahead and look at
calendar and email on touchflo 3d and
windows mobile 6.5 let's go ahead and
begin with email touchflo 3d gives you
this email widget that you can flick
through without opening it but let's go
ahead and open up our inbox and we're
going to go ahead and pull up that same
facebook invitation here are some of the
main pictures are blocked and you can
only scroll up and down you don't really
scroll left or right but you can tap
here and set that option so that you can
scroll right in this one so you can pan
around
have more of a desktop like email
browsing and internet pictures are
automatically blocked as well to protect
your privacy I'm windows mobile 6.5 you
can set up a number of different emails
account email accounts including pop
IMAP and exchange with exchange however
you can only set up one exchange account
on Android you can set up multiple
exchange accounts to sync with HTC also
implemented Facebook to us connect so
that you can sync up with your facebook
account as well which android natively
supports but windows mobile doesn't
unless you have the HTC support built in
so you can see the photo contacts for
your facebook and also birthdays for
your facebook contacts let's go ahead
and take a look at calendar this is the
main calendar you can go ahead and view
the day view you also have the month
view under Dave you you will also see
the temperature so you know the
oppressive proprietary or if it's a
warmer day which is a nice quick glance
at it we're going to go ahead and launch
calendar and let's go to and create a
new appointment unfortunately the finger
friendliness ends there because here
it's not as elegant and you don't have
the radio buttons and the pull downs as
you do on Android but it's still
navigable with your fingers and you can
type in test appointment if you or test
the event and then you can tap here and
then select a date and with the end time
you can switch to a number keyboard and
say let's say four o'clock p
and that should do it and we're going to
go ahead and hit okay so that's a quick
look at calendar unfortunately it
doesn't differentiate between a home or
work calendar you can set separate
calendars within within the calendar app
but you don't have to Calendar apps
which may be a good thing is it does
avoid some confusion for new users so
this has been a quick look at the email
and calendar applications for new users
on android and windows mobile 6.5 in the
next video we're going to go ahead and
take a look at settings programs and how
marketplace differs on both devices with
the different operating systems and we
have previously explored the user
interface voice command and multimedia
in the first video so thanks for
watching and stay tuned for the last
installment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
