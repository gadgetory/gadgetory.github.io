Paco calm and this is another episode of
the android application weekly in which
we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started this
application is called forest runner and
it is free on the android market the
object of the game is to run as fast as
you can or to jump over all these
objects without hitting them if i do hit
them i go back to the beginning of the
level it's sort of like robot unicorn if
you are played that game on the ILS
systems so as you can see i'm not doing
too great but let's try it one more time
and we'll see if we can jump over all
these objects there we go and you want
to get the most amount of fruit as
possible so you get the highest score
and you want to avoid these other
obstacles if you have trouble finding
things in your area or in a new area
that you're visiting goby is a free
application that will help you find
exactly what you want to do so let's say
I want to find cool things to do today
near me I'll just click on here and then
I'll have to just click on things to do
so let's try outdoor recreation and
we'll do biking and we'll do bike paths
and trails and do all and will view all
the trails in my area so I can view all
these if I click on one of them I get a
rating and also some information about
this miram is an easy to use web browser
that's free on the android market so we
can view a full page here it has pinch
to zoom we can also double tap to zoom
in and zoom out we can go back or
forward we can also swipe left to right
to go back or forward we can go down
here and to make the screen larger or
big or smaller you can click on this
button down here you can also auto
rotate and the cool thing about this is
you can lock this screen so let's say I
wanted to lock it so that it stays this
browser does have many features
unfortunately it does not have a flash
support yet music wizard downloader
allows you to download mp3s directly to
your android device for many different
music servers online so I want to search
for an open-source music file so I just
click for search for Mozart which I did
here and I'm going to click on this and
I can either download it or preview it
so I can preview this course there are
many non open source music files as well
that you can down
to your device for you to stop that we
can go back and view the Billboard Music
panel my music my ringtones and we can
also support this by rating it on the
Android Market stitcher radio is free
application available in the android
market it allows you to listen to talk
radio broadcasts as well as podcasts
that people are posted on the Internet
so let's say I want to listen to adam
carolla radiata just go to my favorites
which I've already stored and it's in
the top stations and some other
favorites so we're just going here for
the adam carolla show listen to this so
now I can listen to the adam carolla
show any time I want the best time to
listen to talk radio in my opinion is
while you're driving of course you will
file I want to use a headset or
something that plugs into your radio so
we hope that you've enjoyed this episode
of the android application weekly and if

more settings thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
