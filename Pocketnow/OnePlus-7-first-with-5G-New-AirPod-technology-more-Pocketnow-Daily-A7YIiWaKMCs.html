first with the Falcom sanitarian 855 and
one of the first with 5g in Europe and
okay 8.1 is now official and it brings a
very aggressive price tag and in case
you had some bugs with your iPhone's iOS
twelve point one point one was just
released I'm Jaime Rivera on day two of
the Qualcomm Snapdragon summit here in
Maui it's been great today has all been
about the Snapdragon 855 this is firing
out daily powered by qualcomm the
official news today begin with Qualcomm
Flawn CH of the new Snapdragon 855
mobile platform we're talking seven
nanometer process that's up to forty
five percent faster than its predecessor
up to the point where in the comparison
they were like well it's like grabbing a
Snapdragon 845 and adding a Snapdragon
800 on top and there you get the 855
we've got significant improvements in AI
in addition to all new improvements in
video recording and addition to
photography and yes it'll also be the
road to five GS it'll support the X 50
modem the Snapdragon X 50 modem in
addition to providing multi gigabit LT
so yeah this is what's gonna power
everything every flagship next year
we're really looking forward to it now
let's talk about air pods of we're
waiting for the next generation but
probably the next generation will not
include a change in design and instead
we're hearing that the following
generation will have this symmetrical
design that will allow you to use any
air pod on any ear and for those of you
that don't know this earrin makes this
really awesome pair of headphones the
m2s
which actually bring that capability it
doesn't really matter which ear you
place them on they fit perfectly so it
seems that this technology is coming to
air pods probably in 2020 now for those
of you that have been having issues with
iPhones and it could just be the 10r
with that whole haptic touch which is
horrible in addition to other issues
that I've been having with face ID on
the iPhone 10s well yeah there is a new
software update rolling out today I
believe it's iOS 12 point one point one
I believe and yeah it brings all the bug
fix
that apparently will deal with this I
just you know Apple whenever you deal
with the battery life I'll be really
happy now let's talk about the Nokia 8.1
which was just announced for those of
you wondering if we're getting a higher
tier mid-range err from Nokia yes this
one brings the Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 4
gigs of ram Android Pi which is pretty
much Android one and a sleek design that
pretty much complements the seven point
one for those of you that are looking
for a better phone let's just hope they
launch it across the board and finally
the hottest news today had to do with
feat Lau who stood on stage in this tech
summit here in Hawaii and guess what out
of all the announcements he confirmed
that they've been collaborating really
strongly with Qualcomm and with major
operators in order to bring us 5g to a
smart phone so he made bold
announcements like the fact that their
next flagship will be the first ever
with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor
which makes me wonder about timelines
yes I mean think about it
timelines mean that we usually get
galaxies first and then we get one
postpones so does this mean that we're
the next one plus black ship is coming
earlier that would be interesting that
would be awesome as well but then we
also have announcements like from e in
the UK that pretty much confirms that
the the oneplus whatever that's gonna be
one plus seven will be their first phone
with 5g meaning it's not just the
Snapdragon 855 here we're also talking
about 5g and at least one of their
variants which also brought some
controversy because of when talking
about price tags it seems that oneplus a
strategy in the price is not gonna be
able to be sustained initially with 5g
he even mentioned phones probably
getting 200 to $300 a bit more expensive
so I do assume that there will be
variants the one would that just brings
the processor and the one that brings 5g
let us know in the comments down below
oneplus launched a one plus seven next
year and it became $200 mark sent
expensive because of 5g would you buy it
because in my pay in my case I mean
those two hundred dollars are more
expensive is still a ton of money less
expensive than every iPhone out there
with 4G LTE and not that great 4G LTE by
the way leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion
