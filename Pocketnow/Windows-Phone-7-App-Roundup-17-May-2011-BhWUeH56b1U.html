the device slacker radio is a free

go here let's say we're gonna search for
some music and we'll just pick one of
these which recently searched for and
it'll begin playing the music directly
on our windows phone 7 device and if you
have the upgraded version which costs
around three dollars and ninety-nine
cents or four dollars and I in attends a
month you can to skip ahead to other
songs so I can skip the song and it
gives me a set number of Psalms that I
can skip and by upgrading can also skip
those pesky advertise Mars runner is a
free reaction style game in which you
must navigate a spacecraft over the Mars
surface to avoid rocks and other objects
so let's choose medium difficulty and
how it works as we can use the
accelerometer to turn either left or
right we can also touch the screen to
get a boost in warp and we apparently
used quite a lot of work on that one and
now we have to avoid these rocks by
navigating through the channels screen
and once we hit one of the rocks we lose
the level and it looks like that end
game is over movie trivia is a free
application available in the windows
marketplace the game is pretty simple so
all you have to do is start here we can
choose our difficulty level and select
our game mode I like taglines because I
like movies quite a lot so we'll hit
start and we'll see how well we can do
on this what movie was the tagline the
future
guessing Star Trek what movie has this
tagline with great power comes great
responsibility that is spider-man and it
continues on like this if you miss one
of them you get a couple of other
chances and if you missed too many times
you can incorrect up at the top occupied

marketplace one really cool feature
about this is you're able to go into
options play your own music so let's
start a game and we'll choose easy how
it works is just to move these little
people into their own designated spaces
and the faster that you're able to do
that the higher score you're able to
achieve so let's just go here and
hopefully you can get a pretty good
score it becomes much more difficult
kind of a slap in the face to Google
because they do have to go android guy
