though this is the longest winter in
history we do know that a lot of you on
the ropes thinking which is your next
device so I'm hi madam ivetta this is
pocket now and these are top 5
smartphones for spring 2013 number 5 the
Nokia Lumia 920 and yes even though this
device was launched last year and it
doesn't have a 1080p display this is
still the smartphone camera to beat and
there are a ton of innovations included
on this device that are still not
included on any of the smart phones that
have been launched in 2013 so if Windows
Phone 8 is for you just consider the
fact that Windows Phone 9 won't be
launched onto the phone we most likely
won't be getting other devices into the
fall so still Windows Phone 8 nokia
lumia 920 that's the best match number
for either the sony xperia z or the sony
xperia ZL both devices are pretty much
twins and they are beautiful greatly
designed but the sony xperia z is water
proof glass on glass 5 inches 1080p 13.1
megapixel camera have had a great review
but aside from that we also have the ZL
which brings up 5-inch 1080p display on
a smaller bezel which is really
interesting both devices are beautiful
and even though they rock specifications
from last year they're still great
devices that you should consider out
there number 3 knows the combination i'm
going to make here either the galaxy s4
or the Galaxy Note 2 that 02 is still
the phablet to beat if you want S Pen
functionality in a big device really
don't look elsewhere Samsung is the only
company that still knows how to make
phablets they pretty much invented the
category and then the galaxy s4 is still
a gorgeous device I mean it pretty much
doesn't bring many of the iconic changes
that a lot of people were waiting for
but it's still gonna sell like hotcakes
and it's still going to bring you more
bang for your buck when compared to
other devices since you get expandable
storage replaceable battery just about
everything that people want out there
pretty much Samson just shows everybody
how to do it in a small chassis number
two the iphone 5 and you know it was
coming even though this device was
launched last year it is still the best
iphone out there it's the best-selling
smartphone in the world and it's also
one of the most beautifully designed
phones out there with its aluminum
chassis and just about everything else
it's also one of the smartphone cameras
to beat and if you're wondering why
you see everybody out there owning an
iphone there's a reason for that so just
consider that obviously the iphone 5
will be one of the best selling
smartphones until the iphone 5s or
iphone 6 comes to town it just happens
every time and the top number one
smartphone that we'd recommend for
spring 2013 as the HTC One this is a
consensus from every editor pocket now
and the reason why is because it's
probably one of the most beautiful
things we've ever seen not just the
phone thing it is gorgeously designed
HTC Sense 5 is definitely what sense
should have always been the smartphone
rocks when it comes to speed and also
even though you're not getting the best
smartphone camera out there it's not a
bad camera from the standards of almost
everybody out there and for what you're
going to end up using it for so the HTC
One is definitely one of the smart
phones to beat this year it may not have
expandable storage it may not have a
replaceable battery but definitely HTC
shows us that they can compensate with
that with other beautiful features that
will just make people turn around and
look at what phone you're carrying boom
sound whatever you're considering this
phone to bring you yes the HTC One is
probably one of the most beautiful
smartphones of the year thats it for our
top 5 thank you very much for watching I
