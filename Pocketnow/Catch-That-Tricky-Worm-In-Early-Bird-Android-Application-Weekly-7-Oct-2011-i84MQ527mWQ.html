you again pick one of these tables here
so let me just choose this one so which
what i do is to throw this ping-pong
ball into one of these six cups or
however makeups you specify so let me
just shoot down here the screen does
become a little more wobbly and it's
kind of funny after you i continue on in
the game then each other level becomes
more and more wobbly if you have money

something or how much it's going to cost
to pay it off then the financial
calculators pro app is a great

interest that i paid so i can go back
and i can view any one of these other
calculators and they all work really
well 7 little words is a free game
available on the android market that you
can also upgrade to other puzzle pack so
this game is kind of like your crossword
puzzle in which you have these of clues
on the sides and you need to create a
solution based upon how many letters so
here i have something to eat and that's
a four letter word so let me just see if
I can figure that out so Chow is a
four-letter words or something to eat
click there

harmless okay so there I was able to get
number six and guessed that and the game
continues on like this until you get all
the words solved early bird is a paid
for gaming rule in the android market so
the object of the game is to use these
number of feathers to fly your little
bird over to the bullseye and capture
the worm so we'll just swooped up and
we'll hopefully we'll be able to fly
over there and if we're able to do this
in one net feather it looks is only
might possibly able to do that then we
score a perfect score and we move on to
the next level and we all get three of
these stars so we'll try this other
level and we'll just swipe up and it was
able to get the worm again and now we
