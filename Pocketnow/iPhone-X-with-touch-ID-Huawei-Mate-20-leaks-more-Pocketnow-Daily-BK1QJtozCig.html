comeback for iPhones but we're still
waiting on the headphone jack because
some new leaks of the huawei mate 20 but
sadly not the pro variant and that
Motorola that looked like an iPhone is
now official and it's very cheap
actually I'm Jaime Rivera and for those
of you that complain about my t-shirts
making me look like a teenager think
about what my acne does for me as well
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for iPhones Verizon might
probably be your best option because the
company has now partnered with Apple
music so it seems that if you get an
iPhone on there Verizon unlimited plan
you'll be getting six months of Apple
music notice the conditions and
apparently there are more you can learn
about them in the description now let's
talk about Microsoft and Amazon both
companies teased a year ago a year ago
that Amazon's Alexa and Cortana we're
gonna merge together and work together
as it stands it is finally live if you
have an Amazon Alexa device you can tell
Alexa to turn on Cortana vice versa as
well if you've got Cortana you want to
Alexa to work obviously there are
benefits from different assistance you
can learn more about you know what you
get in the description as well now let's
talk about Motorola we've been
discussing this moto device that looks
like an iPhone for a bit it is probably
one of the most shameless ripoffs
that we've seen in a while and well it
just became official $300 specifications
are of a premium mid-range err pretty
much but the most interesting part of
two things number one that it's
exclusive to China at least for now is
called the p30 number 2 $300 for that
thing that is crazy
let's see if it ever leaves China and
speaking of devices that sound like the
p20 let's talk about the mate 20 well at
least we're expecting the pro because
this is apparently gonna be the most
awesome version of this device
keren 980 processor with 7 nanometre
that's all great but the leaks that we
have from none other than Evan blast
show was the pea sorry mate 20 light
we're not exactly sure the design will
be shared or what but let's see what we
get and finally the
nice that they have to do with Apple
patents and the fact that we actually
hope that this one works we noticed that
the company has found a new system that
will allow touch ID to work on this
place this is different to the sensors
that we currently see from companies
like synaptics that we see on vivo
devices I actually have the vivo next
there let me know in the comments if you
want to review on that this is different
apparently there will be some small
little holes within the display that
will have a camera on each of them take
a photo and authenticates apparently
this is gonna be a smarter solution that
will we currently see from competitors
but then again in the comments today let
us know what do you think would you like
touch ID to make a return to displays on
iPhones or are you okay look face ID
because in my case
honestly I've gotten used to face ID but
it doesn't mean I don't hate it so I
would definitely love a fingerprint
scanner back but it was a comment down
below love to know your opinion friends
