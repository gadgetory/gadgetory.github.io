faces pass and I'm nowhere near home
which map should I use i'm jules wang
with PocketNow and this is a quick
comparison of Apple Maps versus Google
Maps here are the basics Google Maps is
available on both Android and iOS
platforms while Apple Maps is just on
iOS who collects a lot of their own map
data while Apple doesn't really but they
both share business listings and
satellite imaging from plenty of the
same sources including TomTom and ax
accom Google collects transit
information to Apple doesn't so let's
see how all of this gets mixed together
when I head out for Independence Day
celebrations here when opening up Google
Maps on Android your default a to
standard view with labeled point of
interest badges will open up satellite
view for control purposes Apple Maps
defaults to satellite view but with no
Pio eye badges no problem we'll just
switch it to hybrid mode here though
there's no text annotation to the badges
tilted view brings to life the 3d
modeling on Apple maps which has been
there since its start in a densely
built-up place like Boston though can't
help but feel that there's a lot of the
obstruction going on here you can turn
this feature off because the whole goo
is based off of the 3d architecture
including the top-down view now from my
office here I have to get to a certain
intersection to enter the ministered
festivities area I do have the option of
taking a quick trolley ride to get
partway there Google Maps is able to
give me transit directions while Apple
Maps directs me to use Google Maps I
decided to take a nice walk over just
set these two on equal ground while Siri
has trouble interpreting where I want to
go after a little phrase coaxing both
apps plotted some other courses through
the Boston Common I also wanted to get a
quick bite on the way over looking for
restaurants nearby Clarendon Street
Google results were more concentrated to
my target area while Apple provided some
disparate destinations well let's just
take the flour bakery as an example here
for the info cards tapping on the pin on
Apple or
at the text box with business name some
Yelp in film and a navigation option
which is for driving by default much of
the same pop set on Google Maps
along with price range info and even a
Zagat mark the navigation option here
can be set to walking driving biking or
transit and left as a preset pulling up
the info summaries we have basic contact
info though Google allows you to save
the business for quick in-app access
later Apple only has the option for you
to save the place as a contact while
Google gives a short description of what
the place offers in just the hours Apple
Maps offers more of an index card for
restaurants hours price range delivery
options category weather reservations
are allowed and if the place is
kid-friendly or not further down on both
maps clients there is a picture splatter
to look at on Google you can go into a
very exclusive Street View mode for a
locational context reviews wise while
both clients source Yelp for data Google
slices down the reviews by ratings and
allows you to add one yourself from
within the Maps app at bottom Apple map
suggests apps for you to use while there
and those again summary appears on
Google Maps
in fact the bottom part of the info card
for Google can hold some pertinent info
for different venues now I have to give
Apple do credit here because for the
lack of extensibility it offers on how
to interact with its data when I went to
below Co a burrito place the operating
hours or information was correct as
opposed to Google which thought the
headquarters location was just an office
and not a restaurant even with that
though I still prefer Google Maps to
Apple it's not freely it provides more
glanceable information and when you're
reporting a missing location Google Maps
does not refer to it as a problem just a
small thing but the connotation does
make a difference and adds to the
perceived and actual user friendliness
and at the end of your trip that we need
a user-friendly Maps client thanks for
watching this comparison and while we do
know that there are plenty of
third-party apps out there we want to
know which of the two would you go with
leave that in the comments below as well
as a thumbs up and a subscription if you
think we're worthy of it

website pocketnow.com
I'm Jules Wong at green point zero on
Twitter one way or another I'll find you
it's a blondie gym see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
