the days of blackberry and Windows
Mobile this startup might have something
for you
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow this
is our review of Pressy if you found
yourself missing the dedicated shortcut
key on your old Blackberry or in Vieng
the customizable active key on the
galaxy s5 active press II is almost
exactly what you've been looking for
without even knowing it so what is it
Pressey is a simple button that takes
advantage of your standard 3.5
millimeter headphone jack something
every Android smartphone and tablet has
which is why it's so clever
it's also why it can be somewhat
annoying it resides in your headphone
jack
meaning if you want to listen to music
through headphones you'll need to remove
Pressy first unless of course you use
bluetooth headphones also Pressy juts
out from the headphone jack seven tenths
of a millimeter if you aren't using a
case it will stick out like a sore thumb
that said we can't say it bothered us
all that much
the added utility was a fair trade-off
for a small bump along the bottom edge
of the phone but it did make accidental
presses more common than we'd like the
idea is to take advantage of a mostly
unused headphone jack and use it as a
programmable shortcut key using the free
app you can create different tasks to
perform with Pressy using different
combinations of presses for example we
found programming a single long press to
launch the TV app is extremely helpful
when sitting down to watch television
since we use the m8 as a universal
remote at home we also programmed a
single press to launch the camera a
double press to launch todoist a triple
press to launch Evernote and to long
presses to launch the rear LED for a
flashlight
we haven't gotten too fancy with press E
yet but you can do even more specific
things like send a text message to
someone with your current location and
some text with your phone still in your
pocket the Kickstarter page also
confirms it works with Tasker to get
even more technical with your button
presses creating new actions is
extremely easy and so as deleting or
freezing them fortunately press e
doesn't seem to affect the battery life
of the device it's plugged into the
press application doesn't run until the
button is pressed on the flip side that
means launching those actions is almost
always slow there's a one to two second
latency between completing a button
press and the start of the action
when you already have the phone out it
doesn't really make a lot of sense to
use Pressy
but that latency becomes less of an
issue when you can launch your favorite
apps from standby if you don't want to
leave press e and all the time it comes
with a holster which can be added to
your keychain or you can also string
your headphone cable through the loop on
the holster to keep it handy when you
plug in headphones as much as we love
the idea of press e though it isn't
perfect it can be somewhat problematic
at times for instance our One m8
sometimes confused press e with a media
button often found on headphones
despite the prompt which appears when
you plug it in and it would play or
pause music when we press the button
rather than launch the camera sometimes
when we answer calls there would be no
audio into a unplugged press e which was
particularly frustrating those glitches
don't make it any easier to stomach the
$27 pre-order price either especially
when you consider they're much cheaper
software alternatives in all and despite
some of the shortcomings and quirks
we're quite pleased with press e the
build quality is impressive and it adds
a host of utility to your phone from
standby we just hope the developers can
overcome some of the action latency and
other glitches if you're looking for a
way to handle some simple tests without
ever taking your phone out of your
pocket or the ability to launch your
favorite apps with the press of a button
press e is a solid investment although
it isn't exactly cheap there is a ton of
potential and promise in a tiny button
that hangs out in your unused headphone
jack just don't expect it to
revolutionize the way you use your phone
