get on social media is if it's worth its
upgrade to the Galaxy S nine plus our
review was mostly focused on answering
this from a galaxy s perspective but
that wasn't really the hottest galaxy in
town I'm Jaime medley that I would
pocket now and this is galaxy s 9 plus
vs. Galaxy Note 8 tablets tablets
they've got their benefits and their
complications these two are some of the
most expensive money can buy but also
some of the most useful in the hand both
devices feel literally the same the note
has sharper corners but the aluminum
trim feels just as pronounced on both
though I do hear the s9 brings a
stronger build of aluminum same glass on
glass sandwich across the board same
love for fingerprints and smudges
so I'd stick to another color variant
that's not black if I were you on either
phone dimension wise the Galaxy Note 8
is actually a larger phone overall we're
talking four millimeters taller one
millimeter wider 0.1 millimeters thicker
and six grams heavier a complete oddity
since the galaxy has nine plus has a six
percent larger battery then outs
gorgeous infinity display is also
slightly larger at 6.3 inches diagonal
vs. 6.2 but both support the same Super
AMOLED technology the same quad HD plus
resolution capabilities and also Corning
Gorilla Glass 5 storage options are the
same starting in 64 gigs expandable and
six EAGA bytes of RAM Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth antennas are also same specs
at AC and 5 respectively both devices
are also IP 68 water and dust resistant
and support fast and wireless charging
really what makes the Galaxy Note 8
stand apart is the s-pen this feature
alone turns this phone into that
productivity workhorse that you'd like
to bring along to doodle notes or sign a
PDF but that's about it I've been using
Galaxy Notes for the past six
generations and one thing that I will
tell you is that the s-pen is something
that's nice to have but that I rarely
use and sure the s9 plus on the other
hand might look similar but its benefits
are significant it has the new Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 processor that's not just
25% faster but also more battery
efficient and it also supports faster
gigabit LTE speeds were available and
then the s9 plus also solves some of our
major complaints about the note 8 for
example it finally brings stereo
speakers for more immersive content
consumption and they do support Dolby
Atmos and are plenty loud with the
fingerprint scanner is now also placed
where regular human hands can reach and
don't remind me about the node 8 in that
department
and the galaxy s 9 even has intelligent
scan to blend facial recognition with
the iris scanner where the node 8 only
has the ladder and hardware isn't really
the only thing that got improved one of
our biggest complaints about the Galaxy
Note is also the lack of software
updates sure the galaxy has 9 plus is
still a version behind on Oreo but I'd
call that a better option than being a
year behind with nougat on the node 8
now an interesting thing to note is that
Samsung's experienced 9 on the S 9 is
pretty much the oriole version of
experience 8.5 on the node 8 that means
that everything that we praised about
the note is reaching the galaxy s things
like the broader grid of icons on the
launcher and also app Paras are now
making their way from the node to the S
other than that we have a are emoji on
the galaxy s 9 plus which I sadly still
cannot recommend it's still not well
implemented and as for Bixby it seems
that the note is still stuck a version
behind so features like Bixby vision do
work and they do claim AR capabilities
but only the s9 can go further with
features like translation and makeup
Galaxy Note 8 was my primary daily
driver pretty much until the pixel 2xl
replaced it and now the galaxy has 9
plus performance feel smoother on the
galaxy s 9 plus by a meager margin it's
like if the node 8 was sometimes waiting
for an extra second to respond to a
gesture now you won't notice any
differences when playing games though
both devices are just as powerful when
it comes to the phone calls I seriously
feel the galaxy s 9 plus has allowed our
earpiece the node 8 isn't bad but not as
clear as the newer phone and then things
like battery life are also better on the
s 9 plus I wouldn't say that by a
longshot but at least I know that with
the S 9 plus I can reach end of day with
around 30% where the Galaxy Note 8 was
just okay the camera is where things
become interesting
technically the new dual camera system
on the s 9 plus is more versatile with a
variable aperture of f15 and f2 point 4
for low light and bright scenarios
respectively every other technical
specification is similar with the same
megapixel count the same specs for the
telephoto lens the same specs for the
front-facing camera
in theory the improvements on the s9
wouldn't mean better photos overall but
you won't really notice much of a
difference in the daylight both phones
are really really good
I do notice the brighter aperture brings
better low-light performance on the s9
plus though you'd have to notice things
like corners or brick walls where bs9
just butchers the no-date in both
brightness and detail the bear in mind
both devices do prove to be very
sluggish when it comes to moving
subjects I love that the galaxy s 9
brought the same live photo capabilities
of the note eight apply effects after
the fact or stick to the white shot if
things went bad what I will praise about
the galaxy s 9 plus is its capabilities
as a video machine I can record 4k at 60
frames per second 1080p at 240 frames
per second and super slow-mo video at
960 frames per second at 720p all things
that even the camera that I'm using for
this review can't do the know tape is
obviously no slouch with stabilization
on both phones being great the Galaxy S
line clearly has significant
improvements in this department to
conclude it would seem that the Galaxy S
9 Plus is a more complete phone we have
significant improvements in the
processor with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
newer software stereo speakers and
significant improvements in the camera
system calling out a winner really
depends on your needs though if you
depend on the s-pen and there's no way
around that you need the Galaxy Note 8
now if you don't which is the reality of
most people then I'd recommend you go
for the new or galaxy s 9 plus it's the
overall better Buy where you get some
unique features that many folks today
don't have obviously you could wait for
the next Galaxy Note that will most
likely bring all these improvements and
then some but that's still around 6 to 8
months away
