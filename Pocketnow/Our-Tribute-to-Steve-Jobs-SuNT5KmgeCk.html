rebels the troublemakers the round pegs
in the square holes the ones who see
things differently they're not fond of
rules have no respect for the status quo
you can quote them disagree with them
glorify or vilify them about the only
thing you can't do is ignore them
because they change things they event
they imagine the heel they explore they
create they inspire they push the human
race forward maybe they have to be crazy
how else can you start an empty canvas
and see a work of art or shouldn't
silence and hear a song that's never
been written or gaze at the red planet
and see a laboratory on wheels while
some see them as the crazy ones we see
genius because the people who are crazy
enough to think that they can change the
world like Steve Jobs by the ones who do
what I admired most about Steve Jobs was
this ability to defy tradition you know
I still remember the day when I bought
my first ever Apple product it was a
13-inch MacBook Pro I bought it a year
and a half ago and it just completely
changed my perspective on computers my
friend Randall back then was just crazy
I mean you have to buy a Mac you have to
buy a Mac and I was like why am I gonna
need a Mac I've been using Windows
computers for the past 15 years in the
transitions not going to be easy and I
just remember that he brought his own
13-inch MacBook Pro back then he set it
on the table and he began just gesturing
with the trackpad and you know he had me
at the gestures people don't remember it
but back thirty years ago if he wanted
to buy a computer you had to memorize
command prompts and commands to be able
to handle it it wasn't easy for a
typical person to use a computer if you
didn't memorize the commands you had to
be a programmer or learn the language to
understand it and Steve Jobs comes out
of the blue with the Macintosh to change
the way things wore everything was
graphical you didn't have to memorize
anything because the computer was
actually smart enough to do what it had
to do
it took computers competitors so much to
catch up with that and they still
haven't figured it out that was those
were the kinds of things that would make
me remember Steve Jobs as somebody
totally out of the ordinary because you
always push the limit for functionality
in the benefit of the user in a way
Steve Jobs has changed the world I mean
in the past we didn't even think about
vehicles the way we do after Henry Ford
invented them and we didn't think about
electricity or even needed it until
Thomas Edison came up with something to
bring us electricity and it's the same
way I mean the computer the Information
Age the internet everything is just
totally different after Steve he wanted
more he definitely thought different and
that's why we admire him the way we do
my favorite part of any type of product
launch was going back to watch Steve
Jobs delivers keynote on stage it was
magical in and of itself the way he
talked about how competitors were doing
it differently and how Apple had an
elegant simple amazing solution that
always seemed to be above and beyond
what we thought was possible with
today's technology it was truly amazing
and magical to watch him on stage and I
will truly miss the way that he
presented himself and the products that
he loves so much he not only was a
strong leader and visionary he was an
iconic figure of our times who made sure
he didn't only change the present in
which we live in but he also changed the
future he changed the way we perceived
technology and life in our everyday
day-to-day life and we not only have to
thank him for exceptional products like
the iPod the iPhone the iPad the Mac's
or services like iTunes or
everything which is a belated we have to
thank him for leaving a strong legacy
believing in your dreams and making sure
they become reality in order to make
people's life easier today to offer for
this he will always be remembered in our
hearts in our minds and the even beneath
our fingertips because we all love that
of products as they set out a new
standard in technology you will be very
much missed Steve Jobs thank you for
giving us everything thank you for being
here for me personally it was an honor
living in times together with Steve Jobs
may you rest in peace it's hard for me
to imagine growing up in a world without
Steve Jobs as influenced my first
computer I ever had growing up was an
apple 2gs family God and Christmas of
1986 or 1987 and for my little
five-year-old mind seeing these
relatively high resolution graphics the
colors being able to interact with the
mouse just blew me away
in later years and I took up Apple soft
basic and I really thought I was going
to be a computer programmer largely from
the influence that this 2gs had on me
and Steve Jobs is influence over shaping
his vision of that product is a large
part of how I ended up looking at
computers and other technology as I grew
and in later years I ended up getting a
PC and I drifted away from the Apple
world but I've never been anything short
that was astounded by the way Jobs has
been able to shape this entire ecosystem
around the Apple this idea of having one
easy-to-use system that lets you
communicate with people that lets you
create lets you share and
working everything from iTunes and
GarageBand into now the iPhone and it's
just you don't see in this day and age
that's sort of singular vision driving a
whole family of products you can get you
know an Xbox from Microsoft that maybe
you have a zoom but you don't shape your
entire collection of electronics around
them as Apple fans do and as right they
should Jobs saw that it's about the user
experience and connecting people with
their devices and I don't know if
anyone's ever been able to do it like he
did again for that I'm really gonna miss
him here's to the crazy one the misfit
the rebel the troublemaker because the
people who are crazy enough to think
that they can change the world like
Steve Jobs are the ones who do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
