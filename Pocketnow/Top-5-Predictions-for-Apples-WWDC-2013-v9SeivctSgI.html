predictable companies in the world and
when you least expect it they come out
with something that nobody was waiting
for so I'm Jaime Rivera this is pocket
now and these are top 5 predictions for
WWDC 2013 that's happening on jun 10
number 5 is I radio or whatever this
music subscription service that's been
rumored for the longest time is going to
be called and the reason why i'm leaving
at last is because well first of all
Steve Jobs never believed in music
subscription services and I don't see
the company changing that anytime soon
second of all because we've heard that
Apple struggle to be able to land these
deals with record companies and third
because Apple has their own music events
happening in the fall it's actually
called the music event so it doesn't
make any sense for them to launch
anything right now at WWDC innovative
probably happened by the fall number
four is AB still related enhancements
that are mostly focused on you being
able to try applications before you buy
this has been a small rumor out there
that Apple is working on bringing the
service into applications because a lot
of us are annoyed at the fact that we
can't test something before we buy and
for those of you that read the Terms of
Service on anybody well sadly every
purchase that you make is final by the
time you buy it you can't really just
give it back even though Apple sometimes
helps you it gives you back your money
apparently we will be able to test
applications and hopefully there will be
some sort of trial periods for music
hopefully or whatever other services we
might get but stay tuned we do see some
enhancements on the App Store coming as
our fourth prediction number three is
hardware and this is gonna be kind of
difficult usually either Apple is
blocking their leaked radar recently or
we haven't received many leaks of
products that could probably be launched
at this event by the time the iphone 5
was announced we had already seen the
phone pretty much everything was already
leaked and most probably we will not be
getting an iphone but we have received a
ton of leaks of the ipad the ipad 5 that
is so we either get a rehash of the ipad
mini with a Retina display or we will be
getting the ipad 5 hopefully as we have
been seeing final photos of what the
hardware would look like so stay tuned
we probably will be
hardware probably just a rehash of
current products or we could probably be
getting the ipad five at least number
two is iOS 7 there is no holding this
one back Tim Cook already mentioned that
a d11 and it's going to happen we are
going to be getting a new version of iOS
and considering the fact that iOS 6 was
a complete disaster this is most likely
gonna be a big revamp and why because
Scott Forstall is no longer there so the
person that came up with the whole
concept of iOS is no longer there we
will probably be getting new
enhancements in new design coming from
Johnny I've and Craig federighi sadly
rumors out there say that all we're
getting is actually a flatter version of
iOS and I would just you know just hold
on for the event because will most
probably be either surprised or I don't
know this made we'll keep you posted on
this one but yes iOS 7 is happening
hopefully not only iOS 7 is getting
improved hopefully serious well but
again rumors are rumors and series
another one out there and the top number
one prediction that we have for WWDC
2013 is pretty much the same one we have
for every apple event one more thing the
reason why we have one more thing again
here is because Apple has been extremely
secretive lately we've been hearing
about an iWatch every now and then and
probably we will be getting hardware but
we don't know exactly which hardware
aside from an ipad or rehash of a
current product so the question is of
Apple is willing to defy whatever other
companies are doing now with google
glass and with watches out there are of
apples going to send their laurels for
another year judging from what we saw 11
i don't see Tim Cook doing that this
year but again it's been half the year
already and we haven't seen anything so
it's about time for you to act Apple so
that leads me to the question of this
top five what do you predict for I you
know WWDC 2013 do you predict that we
will be getting an iWatch do you predict
that we will be getting new hardware
Iowa 7 what are your predictions leave
us a comment down below and tell us what
you expect to happen at this event on
jun 10th that's it for today's top five
