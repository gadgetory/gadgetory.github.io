get into the box and see what it's all
about hi I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is a Sony Xperia Z
unboxing we are here with the second of
two smartphones that Sony announced at
CES this year the Xperia Z L the unbox
the Xperia Z last week and let's get
into the box and see how this one's
different what's different in the box
and so on and so forth just like the
other one the box itself is very easy to
open just pick up the top and it's
opened inside right on the left you have
the device itself in its little plastic
packaging we'll set that aside also like
the Xperia Z this one comes with two
screen protectors these are actually one
for the front one for the back the
world's smallest microfiber cloth and an
installation card which helps you smooth
out any air bubbles that may or may not
be beneath this little flap is easily
removed
you have your quick startup guides and
other reading materials pamphlets and
whatnot information more information and
your quick startup guide here you have
your earbuds the same exact ones nice
little in earbuds that at least look
nice I didn't actually get to try them
out with the Xperia Z that is microUSB
cable
here you have extra tips for the earbuds
I don't know if we can get that to focus
probably not I'll just move along and
here we have another international
charger or and charger from another
country that I also don't know so it's a
USB wallet after of course so let's get
this stuff back in the box
without further ado let's take a look at
the device itself it's in this plastic
packaging so we'll discard that we don't
need that on the front of the device the
face has the same 5 inch 1080p display
as the Xperia Z and the buttons are not
capacitive or physical they also are
software buttons so they're on screen
and they do take a little they do take
up a little bit of that 1080p display so
they do take up some pixels I don't know
exactly what the amount of that is there
there's an earpiece there and the
microphone is down here to the bottom
right corner and you'll notice that
there is no front-facing camera up here
it's not under the plastic there's no
front-facing camera it's actually down
here on the bottom right corner and
that's for landscape video calling which
makes sense most people make video calls
like this and it just looks weird
I hate portrait video calls I hate
portrait pictures I hate portrait videos
so having this here kind of encourages
people to turn to landscape so kudos to
Sony for that if you turn around to the
right edge of the device you've got
different buttons here you actually have
a physical camera button which is
awesome
using Xperia Z that's one thing I missed
is having a physical camera button most
don't have it but it really felt like
one that really needed it there's a
power button near the middle and the
volume rocker is up here on the top edge
if you flip over microUSB port and I
imagine that is either a speaker
microphone you got one there one there I
don't know which is which one's a
speaker one's a microphone if I'm not
mistaken the top is the foot 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and just that
on the bottom but on the back here
you've got this little door for SD card
slot and micro sim and here on the back
you've got your thirteen point one
megapixel camera loudspeaker and a LED
flash and that is a noise cancelling
microphone and Experion so that's really
all there is on the hardware here but
you will notice that this one has a
textured back it's a it's a lightweight
plastic bag but it feels pretty nice
it's got a nice texture eyes feel to it
but to your favorite part let's get the
plastic the Xperia Z when we rip the
plastic off made absolutely no sound so
let's get this close to the mic and see
if this one will a little itty bitty
sound button
nothing like the nice plastic ripping
sound that we want I'm sorry
Sony has led us down in the plastics
noise Department this has been the
unboxing of the Sony Xperia Z L stay
