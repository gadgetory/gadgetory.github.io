acclaimed portrait mode from the pixel
now open-source technology it seems that
Huawei went early with at least one of
its p20 offerings and Nokia spent Alan's
camera phone might bring an in display
fingerprint center as well I'm Jaime
Rivera and before we begin I'd love to

this is pocket out daily the official
news today are extremely unexpected I
mean we are just a couple of days away
from the Huawei P 20 event and the p20
Lite is already available for pre-orders
in Poland yeah you can pretty much
pre-order it now with a launch date on
March 28th you're getting the Karen 659
processor Edition a 1080p display 3000
milliamp hour battery it doesn't look
like a slouch at all obviously we'll
learn more about it when we get to Paris
for the event other official news come
from Apple as the company has just
announced that WWDC is happening on June
5th set your calendars as for Hardware
it's really hard to predict we haven't
heard much about that affordable home
pod nor the other affordable Apple
products we do hear that we're getting
two iPads an 11 inch model on the twelve
point nine inch model and apparently
they'll bring face ID they'll kill the
bezels bring a faster processor etc stay
tuned we'll give you a rumor roundup as
soon as we learn more as we get closer
now let's talk about Siri and Apple as a
well there is this very interesting
article that just came out on the
information where we actually have Siri
engineers talking about well the product
and how its really spurred a lot of
fights between Apple over what Siri
should be and what it is up to the point
where we hear a lot of things like for
example the fact that the home pod was
going to be a standalone product and
actually not include any Siri
functionality up until Apple was
interrupted on 2014 by the Amazon Alexa
you know the echo speaker and so yeah
Apple had to pretty much
we engineer and reimagine the whole
concept up to the point where delayed
the home pod so long and we now know
that the home pods out and people aren't
really happy with the Syria
implementation and we're not really
happy with what Syria has become either
I mean this was the first ever digital
assistant that actually made headlines
even though Microsoft at something
earlier this was the best one in my
opinion when it started now it's not
let's see what happens to Siri going
forward
now let's water spotlight over to Nokia
as we can't wait to hear more about that
Nokia nine pencil and smartphone
obviously just the whole concept of
having different lenses and being able
to rotate them around this great but
even better apparently the company is
not done there it seems that there will
be a fingerprint scanner on the display
as well I really the company has been
working on this technology for a bit I'm
really stoked I mean Nokia has been
really killing it lately I can't wait to
for them to come to the United States
and finally the most interesting news
today have to do with Google and the
fact that the company has pretty much
just surprised everybody by making the
portrait mode that we have on the pixel
2 and pixel to excel now in open source
technology this is rather interesting is
probably one of the coolest features of
the pixel 2 in pixel 2 Excel is that
portrait mode the fact that software is
able to detect the foreground and
background and intelligently adapt the
photograph depending on that I've
praised that tremendously because it
does a far better job than a lot of
other smartphones that use hardware to
do it that's all great it's not a
guarantee that om is you're going to
just pick this up and use it but I
wouldn't understand why they wouldn't if
it's now available to them and you know
in today's question that's pretty much
it I mean what would you like for OMS to
do would you prefer for companies to
continue what they're doing with triple
lenses or dual lenses to achieve this
will you prefer for them to just pick up
the Google way and use software in my
case let's use software guys I mean come
on this is really cool it's what makes
the pixels so cool but leave us a
