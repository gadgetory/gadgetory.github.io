much over there is a large possibility
that Santa did not bring you the gift
that you were waiting for this Christmas
and if you're broke like many of us you
really want to know what other devices
are out there that are affordable to
your pocket so I'm Hina Ravana this is
pocket now and these are our top five
picks for best affordable devices for
the end of 2013 number five is any
amazon kindle tablet and bear with me
here amazon kindle tablets are not
really the devices that we would
recommend most but if you're out there
trying to buy a tablet for york in your
little brother your sister or anybody
139 dollars we'll get you a kindle fire
HD and that is just crazy the problem is
obviously you're stuck with the Amazon
ecosystem and if you don't like it then
you're pretty much stuck again but then
again there are a lot of tutorials out
there and how to root these tablets and
how to get you know stock android
running on them so for a hundred and
thirty nine dollars this is really the
most unbeatable deal out there even
though again these are not the best
tablets we'd recommend for the Amazon
ecosystem on its own because these are
actually very powerful tablets number
for our most windows phones and I'm even
talking about the high-end smartphones
out there the Lumia 1020 right now cost
you less than to buy any iPhone or
pretty much almost every android
flagship which is great and if you're
really in the budget sector you can get
the Nokia Lumia 520 or 521 for crazy 70
bucks almost everywhere these are
probably like the best offerings and the
reason why I'm saying this is because
there are actually no bad windows phones
out there most of them are really really
good you get the best experience out
there for your money and again windows
phones aren't really bad this is just an
emerging platform sadly it's growing
it's still not where it should be but
again these make really great gifts
number three are some windows tablets
and specifically the Dell Venue tablet
lineup right now you can get a dell
venue 8 pro for two hundred and fifty
dollars and what makes this tablet
special is that you're not buying the
surface RT or surface 2 or whatever
you're buying a full-fledged Windows 8
tablet we're meaning the full windows 8
running on this tablet for two hundred
and fifty dollars
it's very portable it's actually very
beautiful and it's very powerful and
very capable yeah atom processors are
not the best but for two hundred and
fifty dollars you get a full fledged
computer that you can give your kids to
go to college you give your hips to go
to high school or whatever it's better
than buying them an iPad I'll tell you
that again for 250 bucks number two is
the Moto G I mean oh my god two hundred
dollars for a full-fledged Android
smartphone that currently already runs
Android 4.4 KitKat this is probably one
of the best deals out there and surely
it doesn't have the best camera or
whatever but if you really want a non
compromised Android experience this is
the way to go there's actually no other
way to go even if you have better deals
with Windows Phone this is probably one
of the best smartphones out there when
it comes to giving you more bang for
your buck twenty dollars is just
unbeatable and a lot of us are actually
in love with the spoon mainly because it
is that inexpensive and that good and
the top number one device are pretty
much devices that we'd recommend you buy
or give to anyone this holiday season
their nexus smartphones and tablets the
Nexus 5 and the nexus 7 the Nexus 7 will
cost you two hundred thirty bucks you're
probably getting one of the best android
tablets in the market we're just not
talking about in an expensive tablet
this is pretty much one of the best ones
and then in the case of the Nexus 5 even
though it's not one of the best android
smartphones in the market pretty much
all the quirks that we have within our
software base there is still a lot more
to go with this smartphone and for three
hundred and fifty dollars it is
definitely one of the best deals in the
market right now again not necessarily
just for the price tag these devices are
not great just because their price right
you get the newest version of Android
and you get really good hardware for
your money that's probably one of the
best deals out there but anyways that
leaves which is a question of this top
five what deals when you recommend what
do you buy right now or which of these
devices would you get out of the list or
would you include other devices in the
list in my case honestly the Nexus
lineup is probably the best but leave us
a comment down below what are your picks

much for watching if you have another
