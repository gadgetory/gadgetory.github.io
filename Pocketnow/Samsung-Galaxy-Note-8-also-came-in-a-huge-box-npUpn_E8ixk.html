package that FedEx should have delivered
since yesterday but hey what matters is
that it's finally here
I'm hematuria vana with pocket now and
it's time to unbox the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 brought to you by D brand
so one company that has spent the last
year surprising us with the unboxing
experience is definitely Samsung and you
know this is one thing we do care about
at a time when you pay top dollar for
pretty much any flagship those of you
that pre-ordered the Galaxy Note 8 weird
night with a couple of sweet deals for
your loyalty something that's fair for
the hefty price that you're paying for
it unwrapping the external box I was
expecting to see one large box like in
the case of the Galaxy s8 but it turns
out that we have to the gear VR comes
packaged separately in its own retail
box and the note comes in the other one
inside the main Samsung box were treated
by two things Samsung's latest fast
wireless charger which I'm glad is here
as the previous one has a hard time of
charging tall phones like the s8 plus
and beside it we have the goods this is
pretty much the retail box that everyone
will be getting in the next few days the
external cover tells us what you're
getting in the box slide it from the top
open the flap and there we are the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 in its full glory
below the device we have the typical
literature in addition to the Senate dr.
tool and under that we have the facet
app to charger the OTG adapter your
usual microUSB to USB C adapter and at
the top under the flap we have the AKG
headphones that Samsung has been
offering since the Galaxy s8 about the
only extra in this box are the
replacement tips for the s-pen something
I do recommend you keep handy even if
I've never really had a problem with an
S Pen in the past this Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 comes in midnight black and once
we feel all the plastic coatings off
yeah it's time to play
definitely this color option is one of
my favorites given how elegant it makes
the phone look but it's not really
easier to film at night as it reflects
light better than anything and unless
you like orchid Grey you definitely
should get ready as this glass will
catch a lot of fingerprints overall the
first impressions with the Galaxy Note 8
is definitely this is a commanding phone
and that's actually a great thing is
probably one of the things that I've
enjoyed most about the Galaxy Note 8
trust me I cannot wait to get to work
now keep in mind that glass back will
need some protection the brown skins
will eliminate those fingerprints and
add some grip to your upcoming Galaxy
Note 8 or any Galaxy film for that
matter check out the brand comm slash
galaxy or visit the link of the
