pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to show you Ubuntu running on an
HTC Touch pro2 the guys at x8 developers
have figured out how to run this through
Harry XE Ubuntu and I'm sorry if I'm
mispronouncing that I'm not a user of
that operating system is a flavor of
Linux and so just like Android you can
run it through Harry XE on a windows
mobile device and actually I've been
messing around with this and it works
quite well the keyboard support is there
you can't make calls on it obviously but
it's really fun especially if you are a
Ubuntu user so I'm gonna zoom in on the
screen a little bit and let's move
around the screen so we've got the mouse
cursor synchronised here and we just
brought up the calendar it looks like so
I'm gonna go up here to the upper left
corner to the menu and I'm gonna go down
to office and let's go to the word
processor and see how that looks so you
get the Ubuntu word processor on your
touch pro2 pretty amazing stuff they've
also got this working on the xperia x1
and let's go check the keyboard actually
works when I slide off the keyboard and
say hello this is a test and it's very
small on the screen so I'm having
trouble reading it and let's see if I'm
able to highlight that text yep
and let me change the font size got to
be very precise with this stylus let's
make it larger look at that it works so
let's zoom back in on the screen and in
the upper right corner I'm going to hit
the X or at least try to it's very very
tiny it says do you want to save and I'm
gonna say close without saving and we
get the calendar still kind of blocking
the view there okay and that goes away
I wonder how you hide the calendar and I
don't use Ubuntu so I'm not really sure
how to do these things so I'll go back
up into this menu up in the upper left
corner and let's go to off this and the
word processor or the spreadsheet
actually it's gonna take a moment but
it's gonna launch it okay here we have
the spreadsheet program let's see if we
can move it around on the screen looks
like I can't do that but perhaps I'm
doing that command wrong we can tap
along in the spreadsheet program just
like you could do in Excel
although of course this is the Ubuntu
version I'm gonna exit out of that and
see what else we have forget about that
see what else we have in the menu up
here so we can go to settings and
appearance and then we get a few
settings here although probably many of
them don't work because we're running it
on a device that really wasn't intended
to run this operating system so we can
bounce around here and change the
different options again I'm not really
sure what any of these things do because
I don't use Ubuntu but if you do use
Ubuntu then you'll probably feel
comfortable on this in this environment
I'll post a link on pocketnow.com on how
to get this running it's very easy to do
you load all the files onto your storage
card run harity XE and within a couple
minutes you've got you want to running
on your touch pro2 with keyboard support
so pretty cool stuff that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
