desperately in need of some change but
for all that's different here there's
also a heaping helping of the familiar
I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow and
this is a first look at the HTC One a9
everyone's thinking it too let's get it
right out there yeah this looks an awful
lot like Apple's iPhone 6 family of
devices and that's something HTC readily
acknowledges but the way HTC's he said
it's just reclaiming a design legacy it
started back in 2013 from HTC's
perspective Apple stole its mojo not the
other way around however you feel about
that in the hand the one a9 feels like
what it is a solid but very lightweight
metal handset that'll eventually be
available in four colors it's dominated
by a 13 megapixel camera with optical
stabilization on the back and by a sheet
of Gorilla Glass 4 on the front HTC took
plenty of notes from the feedback it got
on the one m9 the a9 doesn't have a
single sharp edge insight its power
standby key is heavily textured so
there's no confusing it with the volume
rocker and those buttons now stand well
apart from the sim and microSD trays on
the other side of the phone the a9 is
much slimmer than the HTC s of
yesteryear but it's still nearly as tall
as the one m9 it replaces to avoid
making it even taller the company says
it was forced to make a choice between
its trademark front firing speakers and
a fingerprint scanner and well bye-bye
boom sound drop your finger on that
sensor it's very fast and the 5 inch
full HD display kicks on to reveal
another big departure HTC has gone with
AMOLED instead of its usual super LCD
for this one and that's a big plus in
terms of contrast and color saturation
the one a9 ships with Android
marshmallow it's one of the first
devices outside the Nexus family to do
so and as such you get all the goodies
of that new build including Google now
on tap and the new battery saving
enhancements like doze and apps standby
good thing considering the anemic size
of the a9 s power pack
HTC says it's eased up on its
third-party UI with this device but from
what I can see cents is still very much
alive in the form of the blinkfeed
social stream the interface design in
general and features like Zoe speaking
of the selfie cam is still the four
ultrapixel module made into a wide-angle
lens and tuned for low-light all this is
powered by a Snapdragon 617 processor
backed up by three gigs of RAM and 32
gigs of storage and that mid tier
silicon might not be the newest of the
new but it doesn't seem to have any
trouble making marshmallow quick and
zippy and as a special bonus
it'll also enable quick charge 3.0
meaning the one a9 should be capable of
going from 0 to 80 percent charge in
just over a half an hour with a
compatible charger sold separately with
this dramatic redesign HTC says it wants
to bring a new level of simplicity to
the Android experience and the one a9
certainly seems capable of that but at
least at this early stage it's tough to
escape the feeling that in its rush to
reinvent HTC has crossed over into
conformity giving up some of the quietly
brilliant identity that got it this far
we'll see whether that trade-off was
worth it and whether that first
impression holds up over time in our
full review coming soon this was just a
quick first impressions pass folks for
more details including pricing and
availability and the all-important color
