of the iPhone 8 that Apple was expecting
Huawei has begun to claim that its
future made 10 will be smarter than the
iPhone 10 and it seems Samsung has
decided to give users some sort of a
choice with Bixby I'm Jaime Rivera and
if you were planning on complaining
about Monday I'm not gonna join you I
want to be nice for today at least this
is pocket out daily the official news
today begin with deals if you're in the
market for an iPhone 8 and there are a
ton of reasons why you should Sprint is
currently offering it for free but there
are a couple of catches number one you
have to trade in a phone and the list is
actually not old we're talking about
iPhone 7s or galaxy s 8s and the list
even includes the node 8 for reasons I
don't understand but in addition to that
it's a 19 month contract then you can
pretty much pull your sprint phone for
free so makes sense but again only if
you have a very recent phones now let's
talk about Samsung and Bixby the company
has just pushed the software updates a
Galaxy s8 and Galaxy Note 8 users that
allows it to disable the button that
calls on Bixby n I know that people
complain about the fact that they're
trying to push the volume buttons and
then depressing Bixby it makes a lot of
sense I just wouldn't recommend that you
disable Bixby fully because after the
reason two updates Bixby has gotten so
well that I've actually stopped using
the Google assistant we're actually
working on a video focus on big speech
particularly mainly because of how good
it's become so well yeah if you want to
disable it there's the option as well
now for the spotlight over to huawei we
are very close to the companies may 10
event and the company has just
trademarked Huawei pay in the European
Union and you know the main reason why
we actually decided to make this a
separate piece of the news is because I
actually want to ask you guys I mean how
do you feel about this whole Android pay
Samsung pay Apple pay
LG paid now we get huawei pay like
really I mean the fragmentation is so
crazy why not just decide on one medium
and just follow that I think Samsung pay
so far is the best one
and speaking of Huawei in that event
that we were talking about one of the
major reasons why we want to be there is
because of the mate
the company has just launched a teaser
and video where it kind of marks the
iPhone 10 and the whole facial
recognition because according to the
company the only phone that has true
artificial intelligence will be the May
10 with its Karen 970 and given the
performance of the 960 and everything
we've learned of the 970 sure that makes
a lot of sense but then again we will
like to see what we get in the end and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with Apple analysts and the iPhone 8
mainly because believe it or not if you
still want to get yourself an iPhone 8
and get it to arrive to you on launch
date well it turns out that their
options are still available in devices
like the silver options because it seems
that Apple for the first time ever did
not sell out on its new flagships the
reason why is because according to
analysts people are waiting for the
iPhone 10 it makes us wonder if Apple is
going to be able to make a knife iPhone
tens for this but you know and leads me
to the question of the day I mean the
differences between the iPhone 10 and
the iPhone 8 are really just design
you're pretty much getting the same
phone and absolutely everything else or
at least almost everything else in
addition to certain features so do you
really think that it's worth it to wait
for the iPhone 10 or just get an iPhone
8 and I pay so much money in my case
obviously I have to review them so I am
biased but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion frenzy
another way it goes if you want to get
the news earlier before the video was
filmed but wasn't talking about comment
subscribe to our channel as well for
more videos like this one you'd also
follow me on Twitter Jaime underscore to
be better on Instagram at home it'll be
better please give this video a thumbs
up if you like what you saw I am hi Mary
thanks so much for watching we'll see
you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
