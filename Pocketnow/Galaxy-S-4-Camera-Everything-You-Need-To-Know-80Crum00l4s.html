galaxy s3 and it seemed only natural to
build a video around the 13 megapixel
camera on its successor so I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is
your guided tour of every photo feature
on the samsung galaxy s4 so taking great
pictures starts with learning the
devices camera software we touched on
this a little bit in our full galaxy s4
review so check that out if you haven't
seen it already also follow us in all
the usual social spots to catch all of
our galaxy s4 coverage to start with the
software on the s4 gives you a few
options to jump into the camera the
easiest way of course is just to tap on
the camera icon on the home screen but
what if the phone is locked in default
configuration there's no quick jump into
the camera on the lockscreen but there
is an easy fix hop into settings and
under the my device tab tap lock screen
here you can set the option to either
restore the quick launch shortcuts on
the bottom or you can use a dedicated
lockscreen widget to jump into the
camera by swiping to the left of course
it's not quite so simple if you use a
secure lock screen the camera interface
itself is clean and fairly
straightforward on the galaxy s4
starting on the upper left we've got the
toggle to switch from the primary camera
to the 2 megapixel forward facing
shooter on the front next to that is the
on/off control for Samsung's new dual
shot feature as well as the settings cog
of both of which we'll get to in a
second on the right in a queue taken
from HTC the record button for the
camcorder function is always displayed
there's no need to switch modes you just
need to tap it to start recording and
tap it again to stop below that is the
shutter release for still photos again
always displayed and below that is the
mode selector which we'll come back to
in the bottom centre is the pull tab for
the live filters Samsung provides and on
the lower left is the quick jump into
the gallery so you can review edit and
share photos you've taken finally not
displayed but important is the focus
area like many smart phones the galaxy
s4 lets you tap to focus on a given
subject and it displays a box around
what you've tapped on this can be handy
for long shots or trying to force
perspective in a close-up photo the box
flashes green if the phone can get focus
and red if you're too close
or if there's not enough light for a
clean shot so just getting the filters
out of the way these are overlays like
cartoon and rugged and oil painting that
you can use to quickly add some
personality to a photo yeah you can do
this after the fact and a great number
of apps but the advantage here is you
can see what the shot looks like before
you take it one thing you might notice
about the galaxy s4 camera is that it
has a narrower field of view than some
other smartphones on the market meaning
you'll need to step a bit further back
from your subject to capture as much
surrounding area that's just something
to keep in mind for shooting in tight
spaces now the camera feature you're
probably going to be using most often is
the mode selector which Samsung has
brought over from its Galaxy camera
which we covered on Pocket now a few
months ago the device offers specialized
shooting modes for all kinds of
situations but they're laid out in a
nice friendly series of cards you can
scroll through with one thumb auto is
what you'll probably use most often and
it does a good job of optimizing photos
across most normal situations Beauty
face says it enhances facial features
automatically but it's results sometimes
look more like someone smeared pancake
makeup all over your subjects face your
mileage will vary on this one best photo
and best face we've seen before on the
galaxy s3 in the galaxy note 2 they're
effectively burst shot modes with
stitching features so you can pick and
choose the best faces in a group or
protect against your subject blinking
sound and shot is a feature Samsung
seems to have added just because it can
it lets you record and append an audio
file to a still photo the results are
weird you're left wondering why you
didn't just shoot a video but it's cute
we showed you drama shot in our full
review which is awesome it overlays
multiple exposures for a neat effect
it's a little finicky but it works and
the results are very trippy animated
photo replicates the cinema gram or
cinemagraph functionality of apps on
other devices that let you create an
animated gif selecting specific areas to
animate or D animate this is a lot of
fun at parties we've talked a lot before
about rich tone or HDR and it's one of
our favorite shooting modes this is
ideal for a situation where maybe your
subject is slightly backlit or there's a
mixture of very bright and very dark
areas in the frame HDR which tends
for high-dynamic-range takes photos from
the same angle at multiple exposures and
stitches them together to create a
single photo you don't want to use this
mode all the time though and you don't
want to use it on moving images eraser
is a mode that also draws from Samsung's
innovation in the multiple consecutive
photos arena it snaps five shots in a
row of your subject and eliminates
objects like people or vehicles that
might pass between you and it it's
perfect for areas packed with oblivious
tourists who would otherwise blow your
shot and it works very well panorama is
something of a standard feature these
days allowing you to stitch multiple
photos together into one ultra wide shot
it works ok on the galaxy s4 but it
really demands a steady hand and even
then the stitching lines between photos
are often very evident especially if the
exposure value changes as you pan across
a scene the Samsung has added the
ability to take panoramas in portrait
mode with the galaxy s4 which is cool as
well as 360-degree panoramas but unless
you're only photographing distant
landscapes you really need a lot of
skill and patience to execute one
properly the last two modes sports and
night are self-explanatory the sports
option helps you capture fast movement
and the night mode allows more light
into the sensor just be sure to keep a
steady hand when shooting modes can only
take you so far sometimes you need to
access the more granular aspects of the
camera and that's what the settings cog
is for in the upper left tapping it
expands some quick and helpful options
there's the flash toggle which lets you
choose between flash on/off and
automatic next to that is automatic
night detection which will let the
camera put itself into night mode if it
detects a low-light situation next up is
the voice command toggle which either
enables or disables the function that
lets you take pictures by telling the
camera things like smile cheese cap
shoes
shoot some of those trigger word cheese
better than others by the way
cheese cheese you second to last is the
recording mode toggle for the video
camera which lets you either limit video
size for media messaging or change the
frame rate to shoot slow and fast motion
video these are really cool options but
we're not focusing on the camcorder for
this tour so we'll stick with normal
finally
there's the Samsung specific sharing
options such as share shot which uses
Wi-Fi direct to share photos to other
connected devices Samsung's old buddy
photo share feature chat on if you use
chat on and probably the coolest feature
in this menu remote viewfinder this
allows you to use another galaxy s4
connected via Wi-Fi direct as your
viewfinder in situations that call for
stealth or self-portraits serve just
some fun silliness when the toggle bar
is extended in the upper left tapping
the COG again that's the tricky part is
what gets you access to the very
granular settings the window is
separated into three tabs still video
and other under the still heading is the
photo size selector which is probably
the only setting we semi-regularly play
with on this device that's what allows
you to set the resolution of your photos
which out of the box is 9.6 megapixels
instead of the maximum rated 13 that's
to preserve the 16 by 9 aspect ratio
fortunately the aspect ratio is included
in all the resolution settings so you
don't forget what shape you're shooting
in other settings like burst shot and
face detection are pretty
self-explanatory a burst shot lets you
keep your thumb down on the shutter
release to take up to 20 photos in the
space of a couple seconds and face
detection does what it says optimizing
focus for human faces that the camera
can see metering is more complex it
refers to the way the camera determines
exposure and allows you to select
between center-weighted which
concentrates sensitivity toward the
middle of the frame spot metering which
takes its exposure information from a
very small area and matrix mode which
averages several different points of
analysis these modes can be handy for
very tricky scenes like crazy
backlighting but HDR mode should suffice
for all about the toughest conditions
ISO refers to the sensitivity of the
image sensor the lower the number the
less sensitive the sensor and the finer
the grain you can force the ISO manually
higher to capture more light in darker
situations but the picture will be much
noisier again the night shooting mode
will take care of most folks in
low-light situations so you shouldn't
have to touch this very often if you're
just a casual user anti-shake refer
- the cameras artificial software
stability enhancer for bumpy shots but
it's not as good as Hardware
stabilization and its default setting is
off auto night detection is a duplicate
we saw that before switching over to the
video tab makes us wonder why it's even
here there are only two options in
camcorder mode one for controlling
resolution and the other for anti shake
in recording again defaulting to off
mode it's the other tab under the COG
that contains the rest of the cameras
advanced features once again we have a
mix of complex and simple here and we
wish Samsung had organized this a little
better in the more complex Department
white balance allows you to compensate
for various atmospheric lighting
conditions both indoor and outdoor in
short it helps you keep white objects
looking white which of course makes your
colour reproduction overall better
exposure value allows you to compensate
for a camera's incorrect assumptions
about the lighting of a scene it's most
useful in very dark or very bright
situations where the auto settings
sometimes gets things wrong for very
bright settings the positive numbers
should be used for darker environments
go negative these settings will be most
effective in the hands of a more
experienced photographer but it can't
hurt to try them if you're in a tricky
spot at the very least it's helpful to
know they're there finally the cameras
other settings are pretty
self-explanatory GPS tagging lets the
camera know where each photo was taken
useful information for the gallery and
other apps review displays the just
taken photo immediately after capture
the device volume buttons can be used to
simulate a shutter release or zoom more
the camcorder record button and the
timer is handy if you can find a rock to
prop the phone up against for a
self-portrait guidelines can help with
the composition of your photo contextual
file name governs how your photos are
named in the phone's file system and
finally reset will you guessed it reset
the cameras settings back to default if
it all seems a little overwhelming well
it is but that's just a combination of
all the utilities samsung is built into
this camera software along with the fact
that really no one should sit down and
try to absorb all this information at
once and we've really only scratched the
surface of describing at all
hopefully though we've provided a useful
high-level overview of the Galaxy s4
camera settings and features that you
can refer back to the next time you're
wondering what that button in the
viewfinder does until then happy photo
taking and good luck folks as you know
