formidable mobile video production
platform available today you will find
no better combination of hardware and
software to produce high quality moving
images happily what makes the phone so
strong for video also translates into
producing some great stills and in one
generation LG has migrated from mid-pack
lens performance to one of the sharpest
we've ever reviewed this camera shines
as soon as the user guides the phone
just a little adjusting exposure white
balance or even audio output improves
dramatically for all the excitement
seeing LG addressed some long criticized
pain points the v30 will still probably
disappoint those who only shoot full
auto better than its predecessor but
competitors are likely to deliver
juicier more crowd pleasing Auto HDR
shots
not to mention this phone has one of the
poorest selfie shooters we've handled on
a flagship this year but you really
won't want to ever use that front camera
when the rear cameras are so stinking
good do you want to see how we arrived
at this conclusion well here's our
in-depth examination LG v 30 real camera
review
the v30 carries on in the tradition of
the g6 before it using a smaller main
image sensor than the v20 but increasing
the aperture and now bragging about a
new glass lens element to improve light
transmission and clarity the second
sensor boasts an ultra wide field of
view instead of a zoom it's a more
flexible arrangement especially when
capturing landscape shots but omits the
fancy image processing background blur
modes found on competitors looking at
exposure and saturation the v30 is a
capable performer in auto mode though
LG's main aesthetic tends towards a
lighter touch on saturation images might
land a bit duller than some folks are
used to in a climate where HDR modes
rule even Apple is adding a bit more
color to the iPhone 8 LG feels a step
behind consumer trends happily the
exposure works hand-in-hand with the
restraint saturation to prevent blowing
out colors in brighter conditions
especially reds and pinks and direct sun
we're only seeing saturation clipping in
the brightest patches and tiny details
are very well retained ditto a white
flower in direct Sun look at all that
wonderful petal texture even with the
camera slightly over exposing on Auto
this is very well done this output is an
absolute joy to work with for those
folks who don't mind a little editing or
like to apply some filters the white
balance in Auto plays nicely with warm
California afternoon light just enough
of an adjustment to reflect the scene
but stopping short of altering color too
far
sidewalks for example are not looking
orange so the phone is still trying to
maintain a more accurate sense of object
color with just a hint of information
from the lighting it's a competent
balance though personally I prefer
weighting lighting information more than
object information on finish' JPEGs but
of course your tastes will vary and
digging into a raw file purposely
overexposed to stops as the phone meters
we can rescue a lot of information
walking it back to into third stops
though we can't quite recover the
texture of this wall this is about par
for the course on flagships this year
and users can expect a healthy safety
net when editing RAW images and those
RAW files become even more impressive
examining LG's claims over lens quality
this glass is gorgeous compared to the
v20 it's almost like we're using some
kind of structure and contrast filter on
all
shots only that detail exists for real
it's sharp it's clear and there's less
flaring at night just look at those
crisp lines of light coming off street
lamps this is excellent performance we
were concerned seeing the sensor size
shrink but the lens and aperture work
together to match top flagship
performance background blur almost just
matches the Galaxy s8 and note eight
elements in the background are nice to
leave blurred and on a personal note I
do like the slightly softer bouquet
balls from the V 30 compared to the
iPhone 8 which uses the same sized
sensor LG walks away with a victory in
isolating a close-up subject the super
wide aperture can create some issues for
macro shots however like Samsung's
cameras this year the depth of field is
so shallow and focus falls off so fast
that your subject will likely look soft
or ghosty around the edges the
inevitable trade-off with such a wide
aperture now looking at the zoom the V
30 is easily the most versatile shooter
of the year the ultra wide is pulled
from the g6 which we also praised and
remember when we could make the horizon
smile on the V 20 yeah that doesn't
happen anymore
there is still some barrel distortion to
be sure but it tends to lend a dramatic
flair to your image instead of making
your shots feel stretched or warped not
having a zoom sensor just doesn't feel
like much of a compromise matching the
field of view of the note 8 zoom sensor
at two times zoom images look comparable
and at the farthest end of each phone
zoom Samsung wins but not by much Plus
at night both phones will resort to
using the main sensor for zoom so you
won't find much benefit in lower light
conditions and speaking of low-light
shots we mostly see improvements with a
few frustrating compromises when in
normal mode LG's image processing still
delivers some terrible edgy almost wormy
noise a new noise reduction filter
improves output dramatically but the
scanning process will increase the time
you need to hold still it's not
difficult getting good night shots out
of this camera but it certainly doesn't
come off as effortlessly as a pixel
while it's not my favorite candidate
shooter in low-light again I have to
point to the lens quality delivering a
texture and look for photos which is
really compelling taking a quick look in
autofocus LG has well improved
focus speed no longer has the smooth
rolling rack focus effect but will
likely please consumers for feeling more
responsive just nipping at the heels of
Samsung's dual pixel shooters likewise
LG's HDR performance has improved over
the v20 but the capture method still
feels slow compared to the top image
processors of the year
shadows are nicely boosted without
wrecking highlights in most scenarios
but moving objects can often create a
little ghosting or blurring panorama
image stitching is well better than
average still some small stutters in a
really busy environment but pieced
together excellently even down to these
power lines which have frustrated
numerous other phones but now we get to
the huge weak link of the phone as a
camera the selfie shooter is one of the
worst we've reviewed on a flagship phone
this year the auto exposure is
frustrating the output is dull and
lifeless the video isn't much better
we'd highly highly recommend learning
how to shoot your selfies from the rear
camera I've done a lot of vlogging from
the v30
it's way better from the back cameras
trust me
switching over to video that's what this
phone excels at looking at the high
bitrate 2160p with full control over
every aspect of the exposure the same
philosophy for photos is employed where
exposure and saturation are generally
reined in for auto mode shots it looks
very good on its own but this kind of
image processing is handy for folks who
might need to edit or blend footage from
other sources it really is good this
idea has pushed LG to a new high by
including their own sin a log file this
is a flat image which looks pretty bad
out of the camera but is intended for
editors to color correct and apply their
own filters in contrast we've never seen
anything like this from a phone
manufacturer and while I'm absolutely
terrible at color grading on more of an
audio guy this kind of feature can
really come in handy for folks who care
about nailing a specific look or feel
and looking at low-light shots I'm happy
to see LG's restraint that the camera
produces video that more closely
resembles the scene than trying to
impress users with overexposed bright
vibrant images a little graininess can
look good too much grain because you
wanted to boost the brightness will
wreak a night video we can also take a
closer look at image stabilization LG
has done a great job reining in some of
the jello of the v20 videos still have a
little busyness and a few shots where
I'm trying to hold still got ugly
jittery but on the whole this is a nice
improvement shifting down to 1080p
enables a software stabilization but I
still don't like this combo the lens is
moving warping the scene and the
software tries to crop to match the
frame so the final output is worse in my
opinion then only hardware or software
stabilization case in point the
wide-angle lens is not Hardware
stabilized and only using software by
itself this looks pretty good good video
is made all the better bike good audio
and this is another area where LG has
made significant improvements over a
very short period of time the V 30 loses
the ability to tune microphone direction
but retains gain low-cut filtering and
leveling in addition to high AOP
microphones the receiver as mic feature
turns the top earpiece into another
microphone for loud environments like a
busy beer garden in Germany or when you
shove your phone into your studio
monitors at maximum gain I had to wear
ear plugs this was way too loud
in a world where iPhones and pixels
record mono audio this is another area
where LG delivers top-tier performance
and professional control
a slow motion is a fun feature to play
with but it's only modestly improved
over previous LG's so it's fine but if
you really enjoy high frame rates you'll
be better served by a pixel iPhone or a
Sony lastly looking at the app while
this is an incredibly feature complete
performer losing the ticker display from
the v10 and 20 means the app has to hide
more settings in software the app layout
is more cluttered and some choices are a
bit frustrating modes now slide over in
one big menu but even though we have
plenty of real estate for color filters
and a switch for the selfie camera which
is duplicated with a gesture LG still
hides the HDR toggle under the app
settings like Samsung this year I think
that's a mistake
also LG has followed Samsung and adding
a zoom rocker to the shutter button I
hate this the feel is super finicky and
like my experiences on the note and s8 I
missed numerous shots because my finger
might slide slightly instead of a great
burst of photos that I can turn into a
cool jiff I assume and no shots are
taken lame this is super lame that said
it is worth reiterating that this is the
best layout for manual controls we've
ever used the quick reset for exposure
is better implemented and performance on
the snapdragon 835 is generally snappier
than last year's phone though still with
a bit of lag on starting a video in all
its fantastically functional but like a
lot of LG software we wish it were just
a little cleaner to navigate there you
have it folks the v-series are absolute
monsters and the v30 continues a
tradition of manual mode excellent pair
it up with a video editing app and you
have the absolute best mobile production
device available today
happily we do see improvements to auto
modes and consumer friendly features but
folks who only want to interact with a
shutter button will probably be better
served elsewhere that said if you wanted
to learn a little about improving your
photos and videos the V 30 would be a
killer platform
