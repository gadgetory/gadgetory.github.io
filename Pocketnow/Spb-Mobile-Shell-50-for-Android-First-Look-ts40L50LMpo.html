and this is an exclusive first look at
SBB Mobile Show 5.0 for Android let's
get to it so this is not yet available
but it will be soon SPB showed off
mobile shell for android a long time ago
and just to put a little context into
this SBB came up with the mobile shell
interface for Windows Mobile it was
quickly deemed as the best interface
replacement for Windows Mobile out there
a lot of people liked it more than HTC
Sense and everyone was waiting for them
to come out with their Android version
and this is what it's going to look like
now obviously this may not be the final
version but it's darn close and it's
working really well so let's talk about
what we have here so basically we have
multiple home screens but there's a lot
of different things that really makes
this different than what you get with
launcher pro or sense for Android or
things like that so on a basic level we
have a variety of home screens with some
really rich widgets that they've added
so here on the main home screen I've
just got some shortcuts to the left I've
got the weather conditions and we can
flip through really nice-looking weather
animation and we can adjust the settings
to determine your city over here we've
got a really cool module from Flickr and
what it's doing is it's feeding in
images from Flickr and you can actually
use this to change your wallpaper if you
like to change your wallpaper a lot what
you can do is tap on a wallpaper click
set on as wallpaper you give it a second
it's gonna download it and you have
fresh wallpaper really cool here swept
to the left we've got a simple time
module going over to the right we've got
more shortcuts and more icons but a lot
of these are very much changeable let me
show you if you tap and hold on one
particular item you'll get a green arrow
next to anything that can be changed
visually so if we press the green arrow
on the clock will kind of cycle through
the different clock designs that we can
have which is really awesome to make
things custom additionally you can slide
around these icons they move around kind
of like an iPhone or you can bring one
down here to delete when you're done you
press the checkmark and you've got them
settled on something now this works with
a lot of other widgets too so if we go
over here and we tap and hold on tools
we can change the tools widget to be a
variety of
styles and and functions and also we can
do that with the favorites we can do
that with the world clock so a lot of
flexibility that they have given you and
of course the most visually stunning
part of mobile shelf 5 for Android is
when you go down here and you get this
let me try to get that again it's
something cool to show your friends
perhaps not terribly usable in terms of
day-to-day operation but it's cool
because you get a little wallpaper all
the way in the background you can kind
of see in a very 3d immersive way what
your home screens look like and
something else you can do in this view
if we go down here to manage panels we
have a really cool way of reorganizing
the panels so we can actually bring one
down here bring another down kind of
have a tray going going on and we can
stop there and only have five panels or
we can bring them up and rearrange them
as we see fit in this beautiful 3d
interface just a really well done so
again this was just an exclusive first
look at SPB mobile shell 5 it's looking
awesome and we can't wait for it to be
released so everyone can enjoy it by the
way you've also got shortcuts here for
the phone and for the web and let's see
if those are changeable it doesn't look
like they are right off the bat but from
what we see here it's looking great it's
looking to be a worthy successor to what
we saw in Windows Mobile with the
earliest version of SP via mobile shell
if you liked this video please give it a
thumbs up and thanks for watching hey
check that out you get really cool 3d
animations when you stay on some of
these particular panels that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
