pocketnow.com cyanogenmod 10.1 nightly
was just released for the samsung galaxy
s3 what does it look like how does it
perform is it stable enough for you to
run is your daily driver let's go find
out here's our samsung galaxy s3 we've
routed it we've installed clockworkmod
recovery we've installed rom manager and
now we have finally flashed cm10 nightly
we've got our nice little cyanogenmod
statistics up at the top that we can opt
out of if we want we also have our nice
little jelly bean quick settings here we
can go into the the deeper settings now
I've already gone into about phone and
turned on developer mode so we could
turn on some extra fun stuff but you can
see that this is the CM 10.1 from
December 17 that nightly this is the
first 10.1 nightly that that they
released for this phone at least that I
know of and that's been stable enough to
actually run and show you a video
they've had previous versions out that
were just cm10 which were not the four
point two point one as you can see here
just so you know this is the GT i 9300
version of the galaxy s3 there are
Knightley's for a few if not most of the
other ones out there already so what can
we do with this well other than what we
were just showing you here you of course
got all of the trebuchet features nice
and quick very responsive come back into
settings you've got your cyanogenmod
settings you can do in here including
theming I don't have any themes
installed but we could very quickly and
easily install a theme on it we go back
we can change our lock screen up of
course lock screen has some cm10
specific things to it that have kind of
been duplicated replaced with all of the
new stuff that's in of course jellybean
4.2 let's look at launcher we can come
into our home
set however many number of homescreens
that we want all this fun stuff
transition effect I always like these
let's go ahead and do let's do something
fun shall we let's do a spin and when we
go back home it's going to take just a
minute because it has to relaunch the
launcher but now you can see that it
kind of rotates things in and out neat
little effect like that very smooth very
fluid something that you don't see every
day back into settings again and let's
see what else we can do with cyanogenmod
got some advanced settings in here that
we can get into enable hsdpa upa or
hsdpa only UMTS only so some interesting
neat things we can do there haptic
feedback where we can modify the
vibrator intensity we'll leave it at
fifty percent which is the default go on
back profiles or something that I love
with cyanogenmod roms if you've got
different settings for home or work or
even car you can set those up and then
quickly toggle between them just by
pressing and holding your power button
and choosing your profile there or you
can do it with NFC if you've got NFC
tags pre-programmed to do that of course
in performance you've got options in
here you can go in and change all kinds
of stuff this is using that Pegasus q
governor but you can change that to any
of the others we just ran an article
about different governors and how they
affect your speed over pocketnow.com if
you missed that head over to
pocketnow.com you'll want to make sure
that you read up on that we can also
then change the minimum of maximum once
that is enabled in the rom this version
it is not so it's pre configured to
minimum and maximum currently it's
bouncing between 200 and 400 megahertz
with that Pegasus cube governor in there
so overall I've only had about 20 30
minutes to use this I haven't noticed
any hang-ups anything that I would not
expect out of a and nightly rom it's
very stable it's very fast as you can
see in there it does everything that I
need it to and as far as I can tell
there are no features that have not yet
been implemented or aren't working I'm
connected up to Wi-Fi I don't have a sim
in right now
just why I'm not getting that but as far
as all of the reports go looks like
everything works just the way you would
expect it to so what do you think do you
like what you're seeing here with CM
10.1 on the sgs3 if so give the video a
big thumbs up if you have any questions
or comments please head over to the
article at pocketnow.com we'd like to
keep the conversation going over there
if at all possible if there's a feature
that you like about cyanogenmod that we
didn't show off here make sure you also
note that in the comments over there
showing off CM 10.1 on some of our
favorite devices for pocket now I'm Joe
Levi thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
