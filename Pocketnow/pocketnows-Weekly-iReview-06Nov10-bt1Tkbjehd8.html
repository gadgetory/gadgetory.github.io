you Apple files a new pen for advanced
gaming between users and skyfire finally
brings flash to our iPhones but in a
very non flashy manner all this and more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
high metal iveta and welcome to the
pocket now I review the show we go
through all this week school and they're
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices as always I start this week
off with the cool well iOS 4.2 is
finally reached gold master candidate
which means it will be in our handsets
very soon it's still in developers hands
right now but gold master candidate
releases and vinyl releases are probably
a week or two apart so most of us are
assuming it will be here on november
seventh with a couple of support
documents out there from Apple that are
stating something close to that but
given it has to do with DST we're not
going to confuse the fact that BST ends
in the United States by that date us
iphone users aren't going to get much
we're only going to get airplay airprint
and a couple of other things but what
really has is on the edge of our seats
is the fact that the dev team has
confirmed that we will get a jailbreak
and even a carrier unlock as soon as a
couple of days after the release so we
hope it really happens by next week I
know a lot of us are on the edge of our
seats because of this well Google
Instant searches finally made it to our
iPhones and Android devices as of this
week it's a really cool service that you
enable in your browser say the Safari
browser or the Android browser on your
handset and while you type any search
it'll actually give you suggestions and
even search results while you haven't
even finished typing it's really cool
google claims it'll save you time in
your life I don't feel any younger but
it's you know it's a cool service it's
new it's currently on a beta sore
anything could go wrong but as of yet
we've been testing it and everything's
going really cool let's hope this
product evolves into even better things
eventually will a police file the new
pen called interactive gaming with
co-located Network direction and
location-aware devices I wonder where
they get these names it's really long
but what it's really cool or what's cool
about it is the fact that it will use
all the sensors in the iphone meaning
the proximity sensor the
accelerometer the gyro the front-facing
video camera the backward camera and
anything that the iphone has like the
GPS and even the networking services to
actually know where you are how you're
sitting what you're doing at the moment
and it can do the same thing for any
other opponent or user or friend that
you have close to you that's playing a
game against you so yeah you can imagine
you can actually use this to play laser
tag in the future between users and
actually have motion detection and I
don't know if this is really going to
look like connect or something but you
never know this is something very new
and innovative for mobile devices
something we've never seen so really
don't know what to expect or when to
expect it let's see what happens another
really cool release that happened
recently is tech track an application
that allow you to locate or fine you're
lost or stolen iPhone within this cool
user interface in the web it's actually
a five dollar application it's not free
but it doesn't cost $99 like mobile
being the Find My iPhone application
it's not as cool as mobile me there are
things that are missing like for example
the fact that on mobile me if you want
to find your iPhone you can actually
make it ring even if the phone is on
vibrate you can't do this on tech track
but it's a first release again for a
five dollar one-time fee which is
currently on sale I'd call it a bargain
again nothing perfect but it's something
better than ninety nine dollars a year
alright so that does it for the cool
let's continue on with the not so cool
t-mobile has just released an ad which
makes fun of the iPhone because
according to t-mobile they have the
fastest and Broadus 4G network right and
they make fun of the iPhone because they
say they have to carry around the slow
AT&amp;amp;T network which is not so reliable in
many places and it could be correct in
some cases but the funny part is when
you have the t-mobile CEO stating that
there are low sales and low results this
year have a lot to do with the fact that
they don't have an iPhone kind of ironic
don't you think well skyfire 2 point 0
finally made it to iOS devices as of
this weekend you'd ask why is it in the
not so cool well sadly it didn't deliver
first of all skyfire is free for Windows
Mobile in for Android but we have to pay
three books on the iPhone two starters
the other uncool thing was the fact that
we were expecting really good
flash-based browsing on the device and
it just didn't deliver it was really bad
really choppy really slow a lot of bugs
a lot of sluggishness on the application
and aside from that it only plays flash
video doesn't play flash games or it
doesn't bring you flash interactive
content on your browser and when a place
flash video it's not the fact that it
detaches the video from the browser for
you to see it in full screen really cool
but video was really choppy was really
ugly now one of the ugliest parts about
all this releases that we consider the
lamest release ever because in the end
skyfire ended up pulling the application
from the app store because well they
said they had problems with their
servers they can handle as much traffic
other people were saying that they
pulled the you know release because
apparently they oversold the amount that
they could sell software we really don't
believe that so again we really don't
know what to expect I mean I feel the
application is not finished there's more
to do for it and then afterwards if you
want to charge for it then fine but
don't charge for something that really
looks at an alpha close to a beta
release and not really a final product
in the end that's it for today's i
