deal with the iphone battery issues the
iphone 4s is coming to 50 more countries
as of november 11th and the semi
tethered jailbreak def team project
seems to be working all this and more
coming up right now hello everyone I'm
hi everyone and welcome to the pocket
now I review the show we go through all
this week school and the not-so-cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's rock this week off with the cool
that's right Apple has just released iOS
5.1 beta 1 and shortly thereafter beta 2
to deal with the complaints that we
talked about last week iphone 4s
customers are complaining about lame
battery life and while the ipad owners
are complaining about the fact that they
can unlock the devices easily so far
Apple has not mentioned if they'll also
be dealing with the serious shoes
because I don't think Apple considers it
an issue that serious able to work even
when your phone's lock so expect for the
update really soon though I wouldn't
expect the serie update to come Apple
has been doing a really great job in
releasing their iphone 4s of the masses
so far 15 more countries are getting it
as of november 11th so expected in the
country near you though sadly well a lot
of people in the US or finding Apple
stores to be sold out an irony and hey
what's a new version of iOS spy without
a jailbreak ah well reports have it that
the dev team has already brought their
semi tethered jailbreak service to the
betas of iOS 5.1 remember semi tethered
means that you'll be able to use your
device jailbroken as long as you don't
have to reset it if you end up resetting
it or get get stuck all you have to do
as well connect it to a pc to be able to
get your jailbreak back or well just
reset your device and instead of being
stuck in the apple logo the semi tether
will allow you to boo your device to an
untethered jailbreak states and while
you work with your device before you get
to a pc and then you jailbreak it again
really cool out of this week's coverage
make sure you catch Adam lanes recent
video comparing navigon service on both
windows phone 7 in the iphone and well
it's no trick question who won that
battle the iphone and also catch then
webster's ios app picks which air every
week bringing you five new app
locations in 30 seconds each a really
short and sweet way to discover new
applications every week and while we all
know that C Spire just got the goods
being another US carrier that's getting
the iphone for us in their network the
cool thing here is you'll get an
unlimited data plan just like you do in
sprint some speculations out there have
it that the FCC will probably dog them
because of the fact that people are not
really going to be satisfied if they're
giving out unlimited data and not being
able to comply but according to cease
fire they will be able to do the job now
interesting enough US cellular is not
what I'm going to be one of the carriers
is going to be carrying the iphone for
us according to them they're open to get
it but they didn't like the conditions
of the contract between Apple and them
probably them feel that they could sell
as many iphones but so far it's really
cool to see the iphone coming up on new
carriers and well let's hope that they
do a really good job in pointing it to
everywhere because it seems that it's
one device to rule all carriers
that does it for the cool let's continue
on with the not-so-cool in an
interesting note John therriault which
is Apple's former vice president of
global security just left Apple and well
guess why well first of all if you lose
one iphone 4 prototype well now stop me
if you've already seen this you could
probably get into trouble but if you
lose to I mean an iphone 4s prototype
was also lost you definitely need to get
your act together now so far Apple has
been famous for sucking at their
security measures and letting their
phones leak then eh none of us in the
tech world are actually complaining
because these leaks are actually what
give us our bread and butter so so far
it's sad to see the guy leave because he
was really making our job really cool
but it's sad to see that Apple's dealing
with this and well let's just hope that
somebody else this new guy that comes on
board dealing with this job is able to
bring us an iphone 5 weeks where's
gizmodo when you need them and we'll
aside from the sprint data issues in the
iphone 4s you'd expect apple's
investment in their colossal data center
to be keeping them up like an energizer
bunny just going and going and going but
sadly well sorry just fell it fell off
the charts a couple of days ago and we
really don't know why the outage was
happening though obviously we're sure
that not many of you are actually
missing talking to your phones but still
it seems that Apple really needs to get
their act together with these data
centers because their services keep
falling lately and every time they
launch something something goes wrong
Apple deal with it that's it for today's
show thank you very much for watching
I'm hi memory that I remember to give us
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
