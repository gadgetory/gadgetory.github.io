and solar charging according to rumors
microsoft announces onedrive since using
SkyDrive one of a lawsuit and even the
galaxy gear 2 is rumored to include a
bendable display I'm high memory that I
and I wonder when we're getting the
first smartphone with a bendable price
tag this is parking out daily let's
start off with the official news as
Microsoft has just announced that
they're changing the name of SkyDrive to
onedrive and this is not really a new
service they're not changing it this is
actually the same exact service up to
the point where current customers of
SkyDrive pro and the typical SkyDrive
won't be affected by any of the changes
except for the fact that it's now going
to be called one drive and if you're
asking why well SkyDrive sounded good
but the company got sued in the UK over
this and so they ended up being forced
to change the name so onedrive let's
just hope that HTC doesn't sue them over
the one name and for those of you
non-believers of color options for the
google nexus 5 me included well links in
the description for the full gallery of
photos we have it in its retail
packaging we have it another retail
package and we have the packaging open
showing the phone this is actually the
first time that we see google taking a
pretty much departure from the typical
black or white color options for their
Nexus lineup and now we're apparently
getting it in red another four different
color options as well we're just not
sure when but we already have retail
packaging it's only a matter of days
hopefully mwc now let's talk about HTC
as we get some more interesting licks of
the m8 which is the one plus or whatever
they're going to call the successor to
the one this sign because apparently the
phone is going to lose its buttons and
you remember how controversial it was
for HTC to only go for two buttons on
the HTC One but it seems that this phone
will not include any hardware buttons
and when you think about the fact that
there are other rumors of Windows Phone
devices you know losing their hardware
buttons and the fact that they're
working on being able to dual boot bees
it's really interesting to see what
we'll get from the feature of the HTC
One if it does lose its wasn't so stay
tuned probably far fetching now let's
talk about the Samsung Galaxy gear as we
do know that the company CEO T's to the
feature Galaxy gear will be launched
along the galaxy s5 so buyers beware
the current one because this one is
going to have some major enhancements
and technology but aside from that
apparently it'll have a bendable display
so this is probably going to be the
first bendable SmartWatch and we're
wondering if this just means a curved
display like in the galaxy curve or
we're actually getting a bendable phone
like the LG G flex I'm sorry watch is
what I actually meant but obviously it
makes you wonder exactly what they're
planning to bring as long as they bring
us better battery life and better
functionality that's great but you know
a bendable SmartWatch that's also
durable will be interesting let's just
hope the price tag is also bendable and
finally for the hot news of the day Tim
Cook was in a recent interview with ABC
and he just revealed for example things
like the fact that they just acquired a
new manufacturing plant for sapphire
glass panels and this has got Alice
scrambling because they're starting to
put all the patents and rumors and
hirings together first of all Apple has
been hiring a lot of people focused on
solar panels and they're also investing
on sapphire glass so one of the biggest
rumors says that the reason why the
iPhone 6 is getting bigger is because
Apple is planning to merge solar panels
with sapphire glass in order to recharge
the battery and obviously they're
needing a bigger phone because they want
to recharge a bigger battery for many
reasons that we know but anyways that
leads us to the question of the day do
you believe that this is the solution
for battery life solar power we've seen
solar power on calculators for years but
for some reason nobody is then on a
smartphone just don't know how powerful
they aren't obviously we don't have the
technical knowledge yet but leave us a
comment down below do you think that's a
good idea and friends you know the drill
if you want to get the news earlier
before this video is filming sure you
follow us on pocketnow.com it's the
script I channel as well you also follow
me on Twitter Jaime underscored iveta
