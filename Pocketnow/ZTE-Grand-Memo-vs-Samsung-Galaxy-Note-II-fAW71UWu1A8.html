here at mwc 2013 in Barcelona Tony
behind the camera and we're checking out
the ZTE memo alongside the samsung
galaxy note 2 so we obviously haven't
had all that much time to play with the
grand memos software load so we're not
going to do any kind of a in-depth
comparison but just to have a look at
the at the hardware first off sorry
these are very well used demo units you
can see that the grand memo is actually
quite a bit taller than the Galaxy Note
2 which I did not necessarily expect and
it is also it is almost the same
thickness and let's have a look or width
rather and let's have a look at the
thickness to the grand memo coming in at
just a just a hair thicker than the
galaxy note 2 you notice on the back
here ZTE has used the same kind of hair
line metallic finish that Samsung has
and obviously a different colour variant
here but while we're back here we should
mention that this is a 13 megapixel
camera on the ZTE unit whereas the
Galaxy Note 2 is of course back in that
familiar 8 megapixel shooter from the
galaxy s3 we have inverted volume and
standby keys on these units obviously
they've chosen different spots to put
the doors in but we have a removable
battery on the galaxy note 2 still not
sure if that's true for the ZTE device
but there is microSD memory expansion on
each as well
and we'll go ahead and pop the displays
back on for just a second now these are
both 720p screens but they do offer they
vary slightly on the color reproduction
as you can see and these wallpapers are
about as different as can be as our the
UI skins on top here this is TouchWiz
nature UX and this is etes my favor you
I in this particular mode we're not
using the 3d effects so it's a little
bit less involved but definitely
something different I don't want to say
it's it's lighter than TouchWiz because
it doesn't necessarily appear to be
there are a lot of customizations going
on on the new device we weren't able to
get a solid answer on this there may
well be a stylist available for this
device but it does not doc anywhere on
the unit so once again just a quick look
at the ZTE memo along grand memo
alongside the samsung galaxy note 2
we'll have more for you as we get it
michael fisher with pocket now Tony
behind the camera stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
