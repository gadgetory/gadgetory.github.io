good and odd news about the phone HTC
seems ready to build a smaller version
of the HTC 10 and news don't seem too
positive for Sony in the United States
I'm high metal iveta and for those of
you that asked me yesterday if I was a
Nintendo fan of course I am this is
Parnell daily
it took us forever to ensure that the
news today we're not April Fools pranks
I could say that these ones are safe
enough starting with motorola as the
company is now offering some major deals
for the last Moto accent4 the current
one you can even get a moto 360 though
that's the previous generation one which
i still love and there are also some
other deals for other of its smartphones
in the lineup i highly suggest you get
the link of the description for more
details other official news have to do
with sony that are not too positive as
the company has just decided to move its
headquarters for the mobile division to
california a different area and well
sadly while doing so the company also
let go of a list of employees exactly
sure how many employees but it is clear
that sony is in dire needs to revamp its
whole concept of how to address mobile
starting with the fact that my god such
great hardware being used by other
smartphone manufacturers that's built by
sony and sony even though does take
advantage of these is not famous for the
metal and for those of you in the market
for the HTC 10 we are very close to when
the phone gets announced but apparently
it's not the only phone we saw the leaks
that there were other variants up to 3
but it seems that the company is also
working on a smaller HTC 10 that will
bring all the bells and whistles of the
larger variant I love the fact that this
is something that's happening it's
something that we've wanted for the
longest time apparently it's going to be
a 4.7 inch display model so yeah it's
not going to play an apple but it's
close enough right at speaking of Apple
strategies we get the first tear downs
of the iphone SE our coverage has
already begun by the way and well this
is rather interesting apparently the
iphone is he is a little more difficult
to rebuild tear apart etc then the
iphone 5s and iphone 6s respectively it
could be the fact that there is a whole
mesh of hardware from both smartphones
but whatever the case may be just make
sure you do not draw it and finally the
very hot loose that they have to do with
the LG g5 in a very polarizing way
number one the good news the phone is
sold a lot more than the LG g4 in the
same period
and 24 hours it seems that the g5
already sold 15,000 units when compared
to 5,000 for the g4 and it just said
nails the company closer to its goal of
sales figures but hey tear downs have
begun for the g5 and there are some
concerns starting with the fact that
even though LG says that this is a full
metal enclosure well there are some tear
downs that prove that there is a lot of
plastic involved and obviously the
company had to figure out a way to do
this you know provide us with a metallic
design that does not include antenna
lines and yeah some creativity had to be
used but it leads me to the question of
the day do you mind the fact that LG had
to figure out a way to provide us with a
new way to build a smartphone in my case
I really don't i like my experience with
the g5 so far there's a lot more
coverage coming soon but hey we'd love
to know in the comments down below what
you think I know a lot of people are
enraged about this and I don't really
get why friends you know the way it goes
