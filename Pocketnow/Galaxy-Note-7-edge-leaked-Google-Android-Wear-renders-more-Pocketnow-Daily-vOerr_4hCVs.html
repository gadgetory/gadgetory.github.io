note 7 which is not just taller than the
s7 other lee show was the possible
google android wear smart watches and
what they will look like and my god can
someone save us from the frenzy being
caused by pokemon go i'm high metal
iveta and as compelled as I am to try
that Pokemon go game the last thing I
want to see me run over by a car this is
pocket now Bailey the official news
today begin again with deals those of
you in the market for one of my favorite
smartwatches of all time the Moto 360
second generation is currently for one
hundred and sixty dollars on ebay and
two different colour variants of yeah
you're asking what the catches well
these are manufacturer refurbished
products yes these products are not new
but my god for one hundred and sixty
dollars that is a true steel I highly
suggest you consider and the other
official news today have to do with
pokemon gold oh my god this game has
taken the world by storm and it's cool
it's made people more active it's made
kids go out the problem is when you have
the New York City Subway MTA service
tweeting the fact that the regardless of
that Pokemon that you see there you
shouldn't cross the yellow line and jump
where the train tracks are it's
happening a lot there are some accidents
being caused obviously people are
tripping true it's proving the fact that
augmented reality does have a future it
probably has a larger future than VR
mainly because of how much people have
adopted it we cannot wait to see more
especially some sort of smart
restriction here now these are some very
interesting statistics that are claiming
that the iphone 7 will be a massive hit
in sales much better than the iphone 6s
mainly because of one particular reason
and that's the fact that forty four
percent of iphone users are set for
contract upgrade because their contracts
are currently either two years or
reaching two years or above so this
could mean that there is a forty-four
percent market potential of people that
are going to get this new iphone makes a
lot of sense it's usually been the case
for apple but then again there is no
guarantee given the fact that there are
awesome competing devices out there that
people can also buy not necessarily
waiting for that iphone have some very
interesting leaks show us what to expect
from the possible google made Android
wear smartwatches we're still waiting
for Android wear to ATO to reach at
least beta and watches no case here but
we have heard that Google's working on
this project today we see the first
leaks now these leaks are not
necessarily accurate because apparently
the source is protecting anonymity but
we do see both smartwatches angel fish
which is going to be the LT cable
variant and then swordfish which is
going to be the regular variant
obviously one is Fifi ER than the other
bulkier beasts watch this look normal
they don't look crazy hot just like
pretty much every Nexus smartphone out
there but we could be onto something
cool here hopefully we don't have to
wait until these watches are out to see
what Android wear 2 dot 0 performs like
and finally a very hot news today have
to do with elite images of the galaxy
note 7 yes it's like if you're looking
at a galaxy s7 edge on a table pretty
much almost identical except for two
things number one the iris scanner that
we've talked about number two if you
look closely this phone is actually
thicker than the galaxy s7 edge it makes
sense last year the galaxy note5 was
significantly thicker than the galaxy s6
edge+ but then again a lot of it had to
do with housing the stylus another had
to do with obviously the beef your
battery so we are expecting to actually
get that beefier battery on this galaxy
note 7 but it does lead me to the
question of the day what do you think
about the leaks do you like what you see
with this galaxy note 7 edge is it's
something that you're looking forward to
do you mind the added thickness in my
case no I actually want that added
thickness one of the things I don't like
about the SM an edge the fact that the
bezels are so thin that it's really
difficult to use that phone without
touching the display and there is no
palm rejection here for you to protect
the edge display from activating itself
when you try to take a photo or
something so there was a comment down
below we'd love to know what you think
