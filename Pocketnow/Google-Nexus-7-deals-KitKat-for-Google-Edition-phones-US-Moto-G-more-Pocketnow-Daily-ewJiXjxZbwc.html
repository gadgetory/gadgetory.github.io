Android 4.4 KitKat google's nexus 7
deals got an ounce for those of you
interested and if you want a moto g in
the u.s. you've got a moto g in the US
i'm high memory mehta and i guess i'll
have to wait now is for that google
edition rom to reach my other galaxy s4
this is parking out daily listeners they
off with some official news for those of
you interested in the Google Nexus 7
well Google has just published their
deals but I'm not sure how good they are
since all you're pretty much getting is
free shipping and also you're getting a
$25 gift card for Google in their play
store but the problem is that it expires
in april whereas amazon and best buy
will just allow you to buy the tablet
now and get discount now so i think if i
were you i would most likely just go for
amazon or best buy i mean best buy if
you just walk to the store and leave
with it and on to some more official
news those 12 or 13 brave of you that
have spent crazy amounts of money for a
google edition HTC One or galaxy s4 can
now get your Android 4.4 KitKat rom over
the air finally after paying that crazy
amount of money and you can bet that a
lot of us are already waiting for that
stock rom to reach xda-developers for us
to be able to load it on our current
subsidize the non crazy paying galaxy s4
is an HTC one so leave us a comment down
below tell us what your experience has
been and obviously if you're able to
root the phone and get us a way to get
it installed leave us a comment down
below as well now let's talk about
Samsung as the company has just patented
a new service that apparently will come
to the galaxy s5 and will be its
flagship feature out of many and
apparently what it has is it will allow
you to have chats with dual cameras
meaning yeah you have a front facing
camera back camera you'll be able to
chat with other parties and then use the
two cameras on the phone which is great
for the person that's looking at the
display but i wonder how exactly will
the person at the back be able to chat
with the rest of the people if he can't
actually see the people but anyways
that's apparently a pen that's been
filed obviously it probably won't come
but stay tuned you know Samson they do
just about everything now let's talk
about Apple you've all heard about the
Lytro camera that camera take a photo
with and
you're allowed to refocus after the
photos taken and you've also heard of
Nokia's application called refocus which
allows you to do pretty much the same
thing only in a software-based way which
is not necessarily great but it's good
it's out there apparently Apple is
planning to bring that same technology
to their future smartphone cameras the
question is actually when most probably
for the iphone 6 whenever we get it but
obviously it's interesting we wonder how
Apple plans to make this any better now
what we can purely due on nokia lumia is
and obviously little i trow camera so
stay tuned and finally for the hot news
of the day those of you interested in
getting the Moto G in the United States
can now get the Moto G the United States
and before you ask me why this phone is
hot well it's pretty much because of the
price tag for the eight gig model all
you'll pay is 179 unlocked no subsidy
unlock 179 and then for the 16 get 10
all you'll pay is two hundred dollars
for full smartphone just about
everything all the bells and whistles
and everything it's pretty much a moto
actually underpowered it's got a great
design as well so you know it's kind of
interesting I just wonder I mean I that
leads me to the question of the day how
many of you are interested in the Moto G
are you caring for this phone I mean for
two hundred dollars it's crazy for two
hundred dollars that's like the craziest
price tag ever it's really disruptive
but leave us a comment down below who
are you getting and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
