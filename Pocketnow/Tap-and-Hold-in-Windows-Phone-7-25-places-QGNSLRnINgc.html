pocketnow.com in Windows Phone 7 there
are many places where you can tap and
hold and perform an action in the phone
but they're not very discoverable
there's no way to know that it's happen
hold it will actually bring forth more
functions there's actually about 30
places in the operating system where
it's happened hold will do something in
this video we're going to talk about
five or six of them some of the most
important ones that you should know when
using a Windows Phone 7 device so let's
get to it alright and in the description
we're gonna list all of these different
places where you can tap and hold but
again we're going to talk about six of
them in this video so let's start off
with the keyboard so we're gonna open up
any place where we can enter text in
this case we'll open up Bing and we'll
go to search for something but you can
actually tap and hold a variety of keys
to get different things to happen for
example we can type the period and that
will change to a variety of punctuation
we can tap and hold the end to get the
Spanish character and so on and so forth
if you go to any other character you'll
get the the the extended look at the
different characters that are available
and of course this is common to a lot of
smartphones so you probably expected
this to happen
also if you go into internet explorer
and instead of dot-com the dot-com
button will turn into dotnet edu or kind
of like the iPhone and in Android - okay
so let's talk about another one the
pictures hub background can actually be
changed and that little picture of a
beer mug here is actually set to the
pictures hub background and so we open
it up and you can see if it's here the
stock picture is built in and in the
background you can see the one that I've
sent now you can actually change this
background by tapping and holding you
can do change it for me or you can click
change background and change it to
something else so we can pick some fall
foliage here and move it move the
picture around to crop it just right and
now it will set the picture hub as your
background but there was no way to know
this there's no notification that you
can tap and hold so it's one of those
things it's not very discoverable and
again it changes the picture hub
background right there which is quite
nice now something else you can do is
tap and hold to delete an SMS
conversation so if you go into messaging
here
okay so what we can do here is tap and
hold and press delete there's no other
way to know that that would be an
available option so if you want to hide
a conversation that you had with someone
you can do it that way and just quick
tap and hold another thing you can do is
uninstall programs by tapping and
holding there's no added remove programs
settings area like there was in Windows
Mobile but if you go to any third-party
application here let's say accidentally
tap there let's say we want to remove
say Yelp we tap and hold and from here
we can also rate and review we can also
pin it to the Start menu or we can
uninstall it and uninstalling takes
about a second it's extremely fast we
can do rate and review which will dump
you into the marketplace that allow you
to write a little review rate it say
something about it and you get the point
so tap and hold on a program to
uninstall it or to rate or review it
another thing you can do is save
pictures if you are in the internet
browser this is a great feature it's
common to a lot of smartphone operating
systems out there so let's go to
pocketnow.com
and we'll pull up a picture and we'll
try to save it to our library so here's
a picture I want to save it so you tap
and hold on it and it will allow you to
save the picture or actually you can
share it so we click save picture and
now if we dump into the pictures hub
should see it available
over here saved pictures there they are
pretty cool so again there's a whole
slew of places where you can tap and
hold in Windows Phone 7 not easily
discoverable so we've made a list of
about 30 of these places and it's in the
description so you can reference this
video or this page if you need to come
back to all these different places where
a tap and hold it will do something in
Windows Phone 7 if you liked this video
