pro since units have nice curves and
wrong places we have a new video in a
limited edition 5g Galaxy S 10 and more
cameras are coming to the pro version of
the Huawei P 30 I'm Hema Ravenna and so
much for an expensive tablet that I saw
bend in a video and I was like people
don't really Bend tablets but anyways
this is pocket out daily sponsored by
swapper the official news today begin
with the launch of yet another gaming
phone that Nubia red magic that's been
teased pretty much ever since MWC it has
just launched in India and the specific
issues are just interesting for this
phone eight gigs of RAM a lot of storage
we've had a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
which everybody will say well yeah but
that's last year's processor think about
it as for a 427 dollar price tag I don't
think you should be asking for much it's
actually a good deal you can learn more
in the description now let's move the
spotlight over to well 5g and I'm not
gonna bore you with a more 5g stuff
think about it is we've already got
countries like China for example already
preparing for it in a way that's
interesting there killing 3G so for
those of you that are interested as of
December 31st 3G is going to die in
certain countries China being one of
them and yeah 5g is the next thing
happening next year now let's move the
spotlight over to the Huawei P 30 and P
30 Pro we've seen some leaked concepts
to a certain degree but for the first
time today we see cases now and once
case makers get products that makes it
almost official I would say we've got
three cameras on the Huawei P 30 and
four cameras on the P 30 pro this is
gonna be crazy
stay tuned for that definitely now let's
talk about the typical rumors that I
decided not to leave as the hot news
because I'm tired of them anyway Samsung
Galaxy S 10 we've got rumors for two
units the 5g special edition variant
which apparently will launch later this
year and another one which is a rather
interesting one which is the galaxy s 10
Plus mainly because I don't know if I
got this right but it's got six camera
in a 6.7 inch display in specific Asians
that are crazy and I'm not exactly sure
if it's a different phone or the same
phone I would say that it should be the
same phone but then I could be wrong
we'll keep you posted as more rumors
emerge and finally the hottest news
today I have to do with iPad pros
because uh we saw my buddy Zack in his
video where he bent the iPad pro and I
was like all right you know tablets
obviously are longer devices so it's I
think it would be normal for products to
bend but now it's being proven that it's
normal so much so that Apple has
admitted that yes the iPad pro does Bend
there is a been gate but the interesting
part is the resolution from Apple
according to the company the bending of
this tablet is normal it is I don't know
man let us know in the comments down
below what do you think cuz I am
definitely not going to put up with a
$1200 product with all the
specifications and everything obviously
you can get it for cheaper but that's
how much mine cost and just be ok with
the fact that it bent there's no way
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion and folks before we
end this video we would like to thank
our sponsor swap afore making today's
