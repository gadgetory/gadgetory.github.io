Galaxy Note 10 will be Samsung's first
keyless smartphone several users are
complaining about connectivity issues
with their new Galaxy S 10 specially on
certain carriers and if you're worried
that the galaxy folds won't last long
Samsung just made a significant test to
prove it I'm high memory Vetta and well
this is gonna be a day full of Samsung
news because obviously be thirty pros
now official this is PocketNow daily the
official dish today begin with deals and
I know Apple has become famous for their
deals lately if you want to get yourself
a pair of last generation air pods head
on over to Costco in the United States
they're currently one hundred and thirty
dollars full price which is a like $30
drop and then it's like five dollars for
delivery from Costco I didn't even know
they had that service I should probably
get them to send me a couple of chickens
that way but anyways yeah old air pods
why not now for those of you in Europe
that have been wanting to use the Apple
watch's EKG ECG whatever they want to
call it you did notice that the update
of iOS 12.2 did bring the feature to
your iphone to activate it on your watch
but then it wasn't available on your
watch apparently that's going to be
launching in the next couple of days
stay tuned follow the link of the
description for more details now for
those of you that are worried about the
galaxy fold and how many folds you have
available and listen Matta
obviously every company provides stress
tests to their products and Samsung has
pretty much just published the one that
they conducted for the Galaxy fold where
according to the publication 200000
folds will give you 5 years of folds if
you are to fold that thing a hundred
times so I guess we don't have to worry
given the price tag but there's only one
way to find out we can't wait for review
unit Sammy
and speaking of Samsung and those of you
that are having issues when it comes to
connectivity on the galaxy s 10
apparently this is something that's
narrowed out to sprint at least that's
where most complaints are coming from
people that are having difficulty
retaining LTE connectivity and so
apparently Sprint is not going to make
you wait for anything if you have any
issues they have a solution which is in
the link of the description and if that
doesn't work they'll swap your units so
you've been having issues there is a way
to solve it
and finally the hottest news did I have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10
and it's funny when I've read keyless I
was like keyless entry but no it's the
fact that just like we saw meizu teased
a phone without buttons or ports it
seems that the Galaxy Note 10.1 without
buttons and if you've noticed in the
Galaxy S 10 there's a way to wake the
phone by just pressing the screen
touching the screen so Samsung has been
moving towards this we've had the
capacitive button that used to be sort
of like touch ID in the past so truly
Samsung has been working towards that
it's just the Wow of thumb without
buttons let us know in the comments down
below I mean what do you think do you
think that's a good idea or not because
I guess my biggest concern is how do you
turn that thing on if you switch it off
I don't know leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know what you think
that might mean friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow us
on pocketnow.com Instructables our
channels english and spanish for more
videos like this one you follow me on
twitter I'm Anders quartering that on
Instagram a tiny metadata please give
this video a thumbs up if you like what
you saw I'm Jaime Medellin and I thanks
