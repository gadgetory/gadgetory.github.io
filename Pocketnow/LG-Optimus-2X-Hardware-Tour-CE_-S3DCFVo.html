calm and this is our hardware tour of
the LG optimus 2x which is now available
from negri electronics let's check it
out first off what we have here is the
first smartphone with a dual core 1
gigahertz Tegra 2 chipset so that should
be pretty fast when I check that out
pretty soon maybe not in this video but
we've also got this one is a European
version so it's got GSM 850 900 1800
1900 and a 3g on the 920 100 bands so
that means it won't work for 3g on ATT
or tmobile in the US but it will in
Europe oh we've got a 4-inch 480 x 800
pixels screen there is eight gigs of
internal storage 512 megs of ram we have
course Wi-Fi bluetooth all of that and
there's a FM radio in their gps you know
the usual stuff so let's take a look at
the screen how compares to say the
galaxy s 4g so let's get the same
websites up ok so both these have auto
brightness on and you can see the LG is
a little bit brighter on the whites if
you can see that but then we have the
screen comparison so let's take a look
at the LG got some really nice little
build quality features here you can see
right there the screen the edges are
kind of curved down
that's pretty cool easier on one on the
edge there and we have capacitive
buttons down at the bottom you notice
the menu icon is kind of strange looking
not sure what that really means but that
will bring up the android menu home back
and search there that's normal the top
you got the front facing camera some
sensors over there LG logo and the
speaker grill of course see what's on
top you've got the power button very
tiny but it works nicely clicks and we
have an hdmi port so that opens like
that there's your mini HDMI port and we
have the 3.5 millimeter headset jack of
course over here on this side is nice
and clean as metal rim there ok the
other side we have volume buttons nice
click to them feels good down there
nothing and the bottom we have speakers
and a micro USB port around to the back
this is a interesting material it's kind
of a rubberized paint and we have the
little metal strip that says with Google
and we have an 8 megapixel camera and
the LED flash camera is capable of doing
full 1080p video recording and of course
I Reds 8 megapixel pictures
okay now to open the back its kind of
tricky get a little slot there and you
got it there we go i did it pretty well
doubt that time previously maybe I
loosened it but Cruz leo is kind of
difficult so here's our battery 1500
milne I powers can put my finger in
there and clip it out and here's our sim
card slot and over here we have a micro
USB port it comes empty so you can buy
your own add that in so that's about it
for the back goes back together plastic
and goes so like that see this is kind
of a brown color I don't know if you
like that it's pretty nice so there's
the LG optimus 2x now you're gonna have
to wait for our next video to see some
benchmarks and the speed test so we're
going to do that so that's it for our
hardware tour of the LG optimus 2x this
device is available now from negri
electronics com hope you enjoyed this
video that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
