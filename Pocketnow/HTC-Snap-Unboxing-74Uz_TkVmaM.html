pocketnow.com and today we're excited to
unbox the HTC snap this is the true
successor to the HTC X caliber or also
known as the t-mobile dash and a lot of
people really like the dash because it
was a small device with a great form
factor a fantastic keyboard and a great
in hand feel people could tap out a
message on a dash in seconds and it was
just a really productive device and the
HTC snap it brings a new keyboard it
brings a trackball in the center which
really helps with navigation hopefully a
huge battery and also a feature called
inner circle which lets you filter out
email from people that you don't want
this is the European version so it will
work in the US but it won't get 3G we're
gonna have a release of the snap on many
US carriers including t-mobile Sprint
and Verizon and it's likely that most
global carriers the major ones will see
the HTC snap it's gonna be a very
pervasive device and so watch out for
that so let's do the unboxing
right Wow the feeling this is gonna be a
stunning looking device very nice
keyboard on the front there's the
trackball has a nice brush metal
aluminum look to it it's gonna be very
classy device I think the back will be
covered in kind of that rubbery coating
that the - had that a lot of people
liked it made for a non-slip grip let's
take a look at what we have here
Qualcomm 528 megahertz processor 256
megabytes ROM 192 megabytes of RAM which
is a little bit less than we like to see
it's a non touchscreen device which is
good and it's bad it's good because you
can be very productive you don't have to
reach up to touch the screen everything
can be done with the hardware keys and
it's bad because a lot of people like
touch screens and that may be a problem
but let's take a look at the device
really excited to see what it looks like
all right put the device to the side for
now let's see what we get in the box
just like with the touch pro2 and the
diamond - and most HTC devices we get
the headphones here with the HTC's
proprietary jack here charger standard
we have a battery which is 1500 milliamp
hours which for a device like this
should allow for some pretty amazing
battery life so we're really excited to
see how long the battery will last on
the snap and of course we have the USB
cable and some documentation and
software of course
so warranty card accessories Quick Start
Guide probably not in color
HTC doesn't like to do color guides but
that's okay and let's take a look at the
device can already feel it's very small
much smaller than it probably looks in
the pictures Wow Wow
feels just like the - actually it does
have the rubbery coating on the back
very smooth extremely thin let's take
off the cover here screen is kind of
small but you have to expect that with a
device like this the trackball super
smooth the keyboard is gonna feel great
very large Keys arranged in a kind of
smiley face like pattern let's see how
it compares in size to say a credit card
so as you can tell by this a very
compact device you're not really gonna
feel it in your pocket it's made to be a
small messaging device and it really
feels great in hand it's very light
right now can't wait to put the battery
in and see how heavy it is so let's
compare it to some similar devices
here's the q9h which was an extremely
popular device thanks to an amazing
keyboard and really well optimised
hardware key layout similar design
although the snap is not as wide and is
not as tall and is not as thick so think
about it like a smaller q9h we're gonna
do some keyboard tests to determine
which keyboard is actually better so
let's compare it to the old blackjack 2
which went under many names throughout
the world again the snap is smaller it
looks actually a little bit wider but
the key the keys are closer together
here they are spread out in terms of
thickness the snap is thinner which is
great and how about the propel pro with
the smiley-faced keyboard from Samsung
the keys are definitely bigger on the
snap and it's much much thinner and just
for the sake of comparison next to the
HTC Touch pro2 it's shorter of course
it's gonna be much thinner and if you
want to compare the keyboards although
this isn't really a fair comparison here
they are it's a much smaller keyboard
but I think it's gonna be really well
optimized for ergonomics and the like so
a lot more coming on the HTC snap I know
a lot of people are really waiting for
this device and we're gonna have
multiple video reviews including a full
review coming up on pocketnow.com soon
