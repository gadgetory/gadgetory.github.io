going to be mostly about display
multiple reports show is a very fragile
camera lens for the LGB 20 and we've got
a new Windows Phone that you might
actually want to care about i'm hi meri
behna and the yesterday's experiment
would Premiere Pro crashed and burned
how about if we try it again this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with yesterday's rumors as Alcatel
has just announced their new idol 4 s
running Windows Phone or should I say
Windows 10 mobile believe it or not even
though we were not expecting any more
Windows 10 mobile devices to be
announced this year or ever the idol for
us is actually a very beautiful phone
only this one is more powerful than the
Android counterpart Snapdragon 820
parsis or 4 gigs of ram and you've got
the whole benefit of everything you can
do with Windows 10 mobile like continuum
for example so you can learn more on the
leg absorption now some very interesting
developments have emerged when it comes
to Apple music as well people aren't
really going crazy for it as they are
with Spotify and we've got Amazon really
disrupting the market with a surprising
scheme mainly for Amazon Prime users so
we've got some trusted sources claiming
that Apple is seriously considering
changing the price and to compete with
price because that's just the way it's
going to be let's see if it works and
for those of you that are extreme fans
of LG and want to get your hands on the
LG b 20 i would suggest that you take
care of it mainly with its camera lens
as we've got a ton of complaints already
that it seems this camera lens is
extremely susceptible to breaks and
we've even seen videos of how easy it is
to break the camera lens obviously the
best way to fix this is by using a case
as this camera protrudes quite
significantly that being said the LG v
20 has one of our favorite cameras this
year so oh another device that has one
of our favorite cameras this year just
changed in colour as we covered the
rumours of the blue coral Samsung Galaxy
s7 edge and today it becomes official in
certain markets starting with the United
States obviously we're not sure if this
is going to launch immediately or it's
going to take some time but yeah the
phone
now available in this new color variant
which means that everybody is going to
believe it's about seven and hopefully
that's not an airline representative and
finally the very interesting news that
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
s8 this time because apparently Samsung
is going for a dramatic redesign and the
company needs it with everything that's
happened with the note 7 according to
the trusted sources this device is going
to be mostly about display apparently
we're talking about 90% screen to body
ratio which is crazy and Samsung is even
working on eliminating bezels in the
future for a 99% screen to body ratio
this is extremely cool obviously we hope
that the company adds a Wacom digitizer
to that thing because palm rejection on
the s7 edge is not really that good not
as good as it was with the note 7 but
anyways it leads me to the question of
the day what do you think about these
bezel less displays that are emerging in
phones from Xiaomi we saw one from sharp
we hear the rumors of the iPhone 8 do
you think that this is the way to go in
my case I do believe that's the way to
go we get larger displays again
companies just need to work on
technology for palm rejection but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
have your opinion friends you know the
way it goes if you want to get the news
earlier before the video is filmed

more videos like this one and also
