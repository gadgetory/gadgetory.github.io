this phone the HTC Desire s is running
Android Gingerbread that's two point
three with HTC Sense UI version 2.1 this
phone the t-mobile g2 that I've got
CyanogenMod 7 on is not running HTC
Sense but with the new 3 version out
some people call that 3.0 others call it
HTC Sense 3d let's see what happens when
we try and put sense 3d on to the g2
let's go take a look ok first of all
this rom is very very experimental it
it's not even the right resolution all
kinds of fun stuff but I haven't seen it
yet you haven't seen it yet so let's go
ahead and look and see what it's like so
the steps we need I've fired up rom
manager premium over here and what I'm
gonna do is install a rom from sdcard
I've already downloaded it to this
device so it should be over here in the
download folder and there it is RM k rom
vision sensation yada yada yada we'll
select that we'll say ok that's the one
that I want I do want to backup my
existing rom just in case something goes
awry and I do need to wipe data and
cache otherwise this is going to blow up
all over the place so two very important
steps say ok to that it gives us a
warning saying you know this is your
last chance to back out do you want to
do that I want to go ahead and continue
so we'll say ok it's gonna reboot me
into my recovery image which in this
case is clockworkmod recovery and from
there it's gonna go ahead and run all of
those different tasks that I just told
it to that's probably going to take
about 5 or 10 minutes
so to save you that agony I'm gonna go
ahead and shoot that off camera so when
we come back we'll get the first boot
and see exactly what this is going to
look like alright and here we go this is
the first boot screen that we've got you
can clearly see the HTC confidential so
I hope
this isn't getting anybody in trouble
we've got our traditional tab to unlock
we'll go ahead and unlock that got our
HTC scream there again now if you want
to try this yourself on your own
t-mobile g2 or HTC Desire Z head on over
to pocketnow.com and I will have a link
to the the XDA thread where you can go
and grab the wrong for this as long as
the ROM is still up you can go ahead and
do it as soon as they take the ROM down
well that son we're not gonna mirror it
or host it or anything for you so now
with most HTC Sense roms you'll have an
initial setup where basically launch is
a setup wizard to walk you through the
rest of the process configuring your
username and password and whatnot so I
believe that's what it's doing right
here we're gonna go ahead and let that
continue and be right back okay so here
we are at the language selector screen
and I'm gonna go ahead and choose
English Singapore because that's I only
went to Singapore once and they spoke
English there I'm not gonna transfer my
stuff so we're gonna skip that okay
we're gonna go ahead and say mobile
network or Wi-Fi so so far the setup
process is pretty much the same as what
we'd see in any HTC sense ROM we'll go
ahead and automatically sync data we
want to go ahead and connect to my Wi-Fi
so I'll do that off-camera so I've done
that and you can see my green checkmark
there now one thing I noticed while I
was doing it this watermark this HTC
confidential watermark is laid on top of
everything so every screen that you see
is gonna have that on top of it and I
don't know if there's any way that we
can get that off we're going to go ahead
and use location just like we've seen
before we're going to agree to let them
do that I'm not going to set up any
accounts right well you know what let's
go ahead and do that just so we can go
through the process like we normally do
set up my normal gmail account okay so
we put in the username and password and
I don't necessarily want to keep this
device backed up if this were a normal
phone that I'd be doing I'd keep
that checkmark but because this is just
kind of a demo of an experimental ROM I
want to uncheck that so it doesn't sink
what I do here up with with Google so
you got a green check on my Google
account I'm not gonna do any of the
others I'll just go ahead and hit next
and yeah let's go ahead no you know
because this is a pre-release ROM I
don't necessarily want to do that so we
uncheck the HTC anonymous collection
we'll go ahead and finish that okay the
first thing you're gonna notice is it's
gone ahead and pulled it in my wallpaper
from my previous device but you know
also notice look over here on the side
see how everything is kind of scrunched
up to the right side of the device in
fact it's cutting off half of market and
half of camera which isn't really all
that cool well the reason for that is
this ROM is built for a different
resolution device and it's not just
pixel density you know it's actually the
size of the device so I can't go in and
shrink it and make it any smaller by
anything that is user controllable
that's something they may be able to do
in future versions of this ROM but for
now it's just going to and we're gonna
have to live with it now that's not a
problem other than just you know it
doesn't look all that great until you
get the keyboard opened you know when
you open up the keyboard that's when you
notice you know half of your letters on
the side over there are cut off and up
not very usable so we're just scrolling
around here the first thing I'm noticing
is I don't have an HTC Sense little dock
bar down on the bottom and I don't know
why so what I'm gonna do is you guys
have seen this up front really quickly
oh that's cool do you see the carousel
there I just flipped through it really
fast and that time I tapped on it rather
than flipping fast so we're just gonna
flip there you go the carousel where the
faster you flip it
the smaller those thumbnails are and
then as it slows down it brings that
thumbnail up nice and close really cool
it's kind of like what SPB is
done but in a more user-friendly more
animated way right there on the home
screen so let me go ahead and find some
cool stuff to show you here it's looking
like we got the stock widgets you know
some updates here and know that Celsius
guys I haven't changed it to two
Fahrenheit yet so it's a bit warmer than
nine degrees but anyway really cool let
me dig into it and I'll show you the
highlights in just sec okay the next
cool thing that I found is the web
browser no not that that's the cool part
but check this out I've loaded up the
PocketNow website and this is the mobile
version of our website you guys are all
familiar with that but check this out
see that guy little little RSS feed guy
right there
yeah tap on that and check it we can now
add a subscription I can rename this
which I'd like to rename PocketNow but P
is way over there so I can't do that so
we're just going to call it RSS put a
checkmark next to that and we'll go
ahead and add that now theoretically if
there were a whole bunch of RSS feeds
that we had on our page it would list
all of them down there so we'd be able
to see it now it said that the RSS
loading was complete and that there are
99 plus items in the feed and that it is
loading up right here so I assume that
what this is is an integrated RSS reader
into the web browser you can go in and
let's see so just really cool really
quick you can subscribe to the RSS feed
so you don't even have to visit the
websites to get the the news so really
kind of cool there if you like something
like the white iPhone 4 go ahead and put
a star next to that of course I'm an
Android guy so I can't do that
so we'll uncheck that yeah that was
humor guys just so you know well hey you
know kind of cool it's even got this
lazy load where it'll pull in the most
recent ones and then when you get down
to the bottom it will go out and load
the next batch so very fluid very nice
fits on the screen all kinds of neat
stuff now one thing I do want to show
you over here ready let's go ahead and
go home and I've got an alternate
launcher apparently that came with this
or that's being pulled
so let's use sense now I mentioned to
you that I didn't have a little bottom
app drawer launcher drawer thing down at
the bottom right you know the one has
the phone that customized and the app
drawer button on it has a nice
swoosh style well that's because my
screens not big enough it's actually
right about down here I can screw this
up so it's down here if I could tap the
screen down there I could get to it but
I can't so we're just going to have to
live with not being able to launch many
of our apps from here again not all that
functional but still kind of cool so
let's dig deeper and see what else we
can find all right next up I'm going to
show off the the weather widget but to
do that I want to show you kind of the
that HTC 2.1 the sense 2.1 versus the
sense 3 widget so you can kind of get a
feel for how they're different
so the icons and the way to get to them
are the same so let's go ahead and open
them both up now with HTC Sense UI you
get to pick which type or which style of
widget you want so the traditional one
is right here and it looks very nice
it's very well done there's one of three
there's two of three a little bit
smaller there's three or three very
small and I believe that's a two by one
so this is the one that I usually select
so let's go ahead and do that and you
can see nice animation it looks really
good it's still measured in Celsius I
believe so
showing you that kind of stuff okay
now over here you'll notice a new kind
of full screen very nice looking widget
now I'm not going to talk too much about
this one first I want to show you the
other two remove that phone out of the
way so we come over here this is the
small one just like you saw on the the
desire s a moment ago we go back one
that's the the bigger one kind of a two
by two and then you've got this new one
and this is really cool so I'm going to
go ahead and select this and just
gorgeous go ahead and select it and
watch what happens here
clouds fly out at ya it animates in
you've got the sound effects going along
with it you can see that it's raining in
here again this is Celsius degrees not
Fahrenheit degrees so the weather is
actually accurate it has detected my
location just like you'd expect so very
very cool
now one more cool thing that I want to
show you here and I don't know exactly
how to get to it so let's just kind of
stumble through let's go into settings I
could have taken a shortcut to
personalize I suppose and lock screen
you see lock screen right here now this
I would love to show you in a lot of
detail but I can't because on this ROM
if you apply a lock screen you can no
longer boot your phone
it's very securely locked I guess you
could say I believe that's because the
lock button is off the screen so you
can't grab it and pull it up to unlock
now the reason for that is this is a 3d
style resolution if you will it's made
for a qHD screen which this phone does
not have so what that means is basically
it's about the same width but in aspect
ratio it's going to be longer so you
think it's gonna be longer so that it
has more of a widescreen or a letterbox
look to it but let me go ahead and show
you what you would have now they've
taken kind of widgets and put them on to
the lock screen so you can see down here
this little kind of half circle that's
hidden off the bottom of the screen
that's your unlocker okay so if you were
to grab that and of course I have to go
back into it now personalize a lock
screen so if you grab that little washer
there and pull it up it will have a nice
animation and will unlock the screen
there are some videos out on YouTube to
show you exactly how that works but it's
pretty much like anything else you've
seen you drag it up and it unlocks
there's some nice animations that you'd
expect from HTC Sense in there as well
but back to widgets you can see here
this is using their their finance or
their stocks widget so you can turn on
your device
without unlocking it have information
too or have a one glance look at your
information it's updated it's right
there and it's ready for you but of
course you may not want stock
so you might want something like just
the time in a nice wallpaper that gives
you an indicator of how many phone calls
you've missed how many emails you've got
waiting how many text messages you've
got waiting as well over here
the next one is just photos so you can
have your photo album there and you can
see they're kind of floating around here
so I can imagine that being a nice
floaty 3d animated look into your
gallery which might not be a good thing
if you have inappropriate pictures in
your gallery somebody tricks up your
phone unlocks it and yeah so be smart
cool little watch widget there over here
these are your messages again in that
same kind of floating around you know
the cards are in space showing you the
most recent than rotating and then
weather just like we saw now this
actually functions exactly like we just
saw with the weather widget on your home
screen this time is just on the lock
screen so you have that animation right
there as well so very very cool there
are some settings that you can do in
here to customize the buttons down at
the bottom all kinds of neat stuff all
right now this is HTC Sense UI 3d right
so what does the 3d mean well first of
all this is a 2d phone one dimension to
dimension that's all my screen can
display three dimension means that there
would be some depth to what I'm looking
at so here's what they've done with some
of the widgets now let me show you first
with the flip clock the flip clock as
you've seen before kind of flips the
numbers down well it has to flip on some
hinges right but where are the hos hinge
is hiding so if we rotate look right up
there on the top if I can get in there
closer for you can you see the hinge
that rotates on you can also see that
there's some depth to those cards you
can see that there's three stacked on
top of each other and if I rotate that
it kind of goes away kind of goes the
other way where the numbers are sitting
on top so very cool how it's doing that
if I come back over here to my people
look at the rolodex card up there on the
top see that how it
sitting up on top of the the rest of the
widget so let's go over here to weather
so here's our weather widget let me just
put on and if we look at that we've got
multiple layers of clouds we've got the
temperature on top of that and
everything is on top of the the
background of the widget itself so very
cool now looking at this just right here
it's just spit and polish htc didn't
want to reinvent the sense UI instead
what they wanted to do is improve it so
what they've done is they've kept things
pretty much the same but they've added
in some extra features some extra polish
and you know they've just made it look
really nice I mean especially when you
come in here and do this fast flip where
you're going through and it's rotating
through and the carousel it's just
really really nice it looks cool when
you add that to the 3d effect and when
you add that to a high definition or a
qHD screen which is what most of the new
phones are going to be coming with
that's my prediction you get a you know
longer screen that's more like you're
watching a movie that's more like a you
know an HD style screen like you have on
your TV so when you're looking at it
this way your video content is going to
be more letterbox than it is just in a
box like that so they're doing that
across the whole screen that's nice
because anything that you record with
your camera or with your video camera is
then going to theoretically be hi-def so
it will look wonderful when you watch it
on your your TV now the HTC EVO 3d even
has a micro USB port in it that with an
adapter will plug into your HDMI port on
your big-screen TV and if you've got a
compatible TV it will even charge your
phone while you're watching it so you're
not gonna have to worry about you know
I've only got 10% battery life yet am I
gonna be able to watch this whole home
video or what not you'll be able to to
do that on the newer TVs or with a
powered adapter which I'm sure they're
going to come out with first so
all kinds of cool now I'm not going to
be able to function with this ROM very
obviously and you could see there my my
lockscreen was the old style lockscreen
and my back lights not working entirely
right so I'm gonna have to flash this
back to something that I can use more
regularly but it's really cool and I'm
sure there's going to be updates to it
now that's the good news the bad news is
HTC has come out on their Twitter feed
and said that they're not going to have
since 3d retrofit to existing devices a
lot of that is because of screen
resolutions because of extra sensors
that are in the newer devices and 3ds
screens and whatnot and I don't know so
much that I blame them especially
because it's more just polish on the
existing Sense UI experience than
anything else but I can see us hopefully
being able to as a developer or a hacker
community get in there and make those
fixes so that we can run this on some of
our unlock devices I think it's cool I
don't know what do you think and more
specifically I've only had you know a
couple hours to go through this and look
at it and play with all the the bells
and whistles here so is there something
that I missed is there something that
you'd like to share with us that you
found in Sense UI 3d if so that's what
the comments are for leave them down
below if you like seeing these things so
you don't have to try and flash it on
your phone and run into all the problems
of course give the video a thumbs up and
head on over to pocketnow.com for that
hyper link if you'd like to try this out
on your phone as well for PocketNow I'm
