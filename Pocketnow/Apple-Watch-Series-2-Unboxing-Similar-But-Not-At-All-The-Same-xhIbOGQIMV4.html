you better believe it's about that time
I'm home it'll be better with pocket now
here with our unboxing of the Apple
watch series 2
you
for a company that claimed Fame for its
minimalistic unboxing experiences yeah
this is not one of them the Apple watch
sport has been barks the Nexus since the
days of the first variant but hey the
box is just part of the story
cutting the external cardboard were
greeted by a familiar box padded in foam
the white external packaging bears no
colors asked to match this year's iOS
packaging and about the only way to tell
this is a serious - is because it's
printed on one of the sides lifting the
Box open were greeted by literature I
highly recommend newbies of the sport
band to read in addition to a spare
strap for those of you with small wrists
inside there's your brand new watch
along with the wall adapter and charging
cable that's half the length of last
year and have you noticed the other
interesting change is that there is no
longer the plastic case that protected
the watch like last year about the only
thing you get is new plastic protection
that hasn't really changed hinting to
the instructions on how to wear it and
that we will do starting today I
separately ordered a pearl nylon band
just to change things up a bit this year
and given Apple watch's ease and
replacing bands the swap continues to
just take a few seconds now even with
how similar this Apple watch is to last
year's model and aesthetics the
differences are very substantial last
year's model didn't really age well or
at least in a way to match its
investment and given the pricey starting
point of series 2 we're planning to give
this watch our full review treatment
just to see if Apple finally got it
right make sure you check back tomorrow
