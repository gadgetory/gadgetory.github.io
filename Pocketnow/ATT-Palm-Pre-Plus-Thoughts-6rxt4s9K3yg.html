now calm I've been waiting for a long
time for AT&amp;amp;T to pick up a webos device
finally last week the palm pre plus was
announced and it's coming out in early
June on the carrier I've been using it
as my daily driver for a full week now
and I just wanted to report back with a
few different aspects of the palm pre
plus having used it for seven days now
so in this video we're going to cover
ergonomics and gestures performance
productivity and battery life let's take
a look ok so let's start off by talking
about the hardware the ergonomics as I
mentioned in the hardware tour video I
don't like the keyboard particularly
much on the palm pre plus I find that
it's sunken in and it's difficult to use
unless you're using sort of the
fingernails on your thumbs and after
using this for a week I still feel this
way I thought that perhaps that after a
while I would get used to it but that's
not the case if you want a really really
good keyboard the palm pixi in the palm
pixi plus is in my opinion one of the
best keyboards of any mobile phone out
there and of course the palm pixi plus
is coming to AT&amp;amp;T in the near future so
if you're on the ATT network this may be
the better one to get except this is the
palm pixi plus and the palm pixi are
underpowered compared to the pre which
is really unfortunate so let's talk more
about the ergonomics on the palm pre
plus on 80 I find the device to feel
overall numb there's no there are no
buttons on the front there are only
buttons on the sides here and there is a
standby button on the top so none that
sometimes I take the phone out of my
pocket and I don't realize which way I'm
holding the phone because it's all the
same the only way to tell if you're
holding the phone right side up is to
look at this little chrome strip up here
but if you're feeling for your phone
you're trying to do something really
quick a lot of the times I've taken the
phone out and I'm like oh this is the
wrong way so I flip it over whereas on
other devices like the hd2 or any other
phone there are hardware buttons and you
can feel for them and you know okay I
don't feel hardware buttons therefore I
am on the top or I feel hardware buttons
therefore I'm on the bottom and on the
palm pre plus it's just not that easy so
I feel that it's overall a bit numb the
device is also thick
paired to other devices I know it as a
slide-out keyboard and it's about as
thick as the HTC touch pro2 but I think
because it's small because it's not very
tall not very wide it just feels like a
little brick it's not that heavy but it
definitely has some thickness to it so
let's talk about the gestures webos has
so many gestures built in that you could
probably write a 10-page book about them
so let's go into them now so I'm going
to unlock the screen I guess that could
be considered one gesture but I'm not
going to call it won the first gesture I
want to talk about is a notification
gesture I think webos is one of the best
notification systems of any smartphone
operating system it's very unobtrusive
and it's very easy to action on so
perfect i have two notifications here i
tap down here and here are the two
different notifications that i have i
can tap on either to read it fully got a
text message and an email where i can
swipe them off the screen if i don't
want to see them anymore and then it
goes back to the full screen view and
again these notifications can pop up
while you're working but they don't pop
up in front of your face like you'll
find on the iphone or other smartphone
operating systems so that is a look at
one gesture another gesture is the
simple gesture to go back to the home
screen and I thought for a very long
time that to go back to the home screen
you tap on this capacitive area and that
will work but I'm actually wants you to
do it a different way they want you to
swipe upwards to get back to the home
screen and I think that actually feels a
little bit better if you swipe up one
more time here you'll get your program
list we're going to talk about that in a
minute if you tap and hold on your cards
you'll get the zoomed out card view
although for most people you probably
won't need to use this and what it lets
you do it's rearrange the cards because
you're probably going to close the cards
when you're done with them unless you're
using an application a time like email
or Twitter so you'll leave them open all
the time but even then you probably
don't need to rearrange the cards I've
never run into that situation so let's
go back in and we'll go back to another
application now another gesture you can
do and this one helps tremendously when
you're trying to get to an application
that can only be found in your
application tray is to drag up and you
get the sort of favorite
you get your four favorite apps and on
the right you get your full application
tray so you don't have to bounce back to
the home screen to jump to the next
application which is really nice and
really helps a lot with productivity
another gesture that you can use to
switch aptly switch between applications
is the right to left swipe so i can
actually shuffle through my cards like
so and it actually looks like you're
shuffling through cards so i have three
applications open instead of going back
to my home screen I don't even have to
leave the app and this is kind of like
doing alt tab on the computer if you're
using a Windows machine just a really
convenient way to cycle through the open
windows that you have so I'm going to go
into the web browser and show you one
final gesture that really helps a lot
with navigation so let's go into the web
browser and I'm over Wi-Fi network so
let's load pocketnow.com the browser is
good it's not great i think the browser
on android and on the iphone and even
opera mobile 10 on Windows Mobile is
better but it's definitely capable so
here we have pocket now that come loaded
you can scroll down and sometimes it
lags a little bit it's not very
responsive to the touch and you get the
checkerboard pattern if you zoom down
very fast but the gesture that i want to
show you here is that you can actually
use the capacitive area on the right to
scroll which is just a really good idea
this way you're not having to put your
finger over text you can read everything
it just works very very well and it goes
one notch at a time so it's not too much
it's not too little and you can see the
little lights sort of transforming as I
do the gesture so really cool thing that
I think helps a lot with getting around
a web page and back to the car view we
go okay so let's talk about productivity
for me productivity on a mobile device
is very very important I want to be able
to multitask I want to be able to jump
around from application to application
without too much difficulty so let's go
into say the web and let's say I want to
load this link right here and all the
while I want to open up my email so I'm
going to swipe over to my email and it
looks like i just did a back gesture so
if you don't do a full swipe if you do
like a half swipe you're actually
going to use the back function in webos
and this is a problem in webos I think
because it's kind of annoying to have to
use the gesture pad to move back and in
a program like Twitter and thuy free you
really notice this another great thing
about webos is that as an application is
loading you can flick it off the screen
to close it in other operating systems
you have to wait until the application
fully loads before you do anything but
in this case if you open an app and you
say Oh on second thought I don't want to
use it you can flick it right off the
screen and there is no hiccup in the
device so what it login to twitter here
and show you this back gesture because
this is actually one that i forgot and
so let's say that I tap on John for
lakers here and I want to go back to the
previous screen I have to swipe back and
you use that a lot and I find it to be
so annoying I just want a hey bag button
a hardware button that I can click that
I can find very easily I don't like this
gesturing and so if you do a full swipe
then you get the ability to switch
between applications but only if you do
a full swipe you can see how your thumb
is going to get a lot of use in webos so
we were talking about productivity and
how the ability to switch from app tap
is very very important and as I
mentioned web post give you a lot of
different ways to go from app to app of
course we have this that we just talked
about we have the full swipe to go back
and forth we have the home screen view
which lets you switch between
applications so in terms of productivity
I find myself to be very productive
using webos it just works very very well
and speaking of applications I like how
the application tray is set up in webos
so let's go into there it's comprised of
three different screens which is
different than other operating systems
where maybe you'll have a very very long
list of applications like in windows
mobile or you'll have screen after
screen at the screen of apps like in
iphone in the case of webos you have
three screens one two and three and the
way as I think about it is that the
center screen is what I like to keep
where I like to keep the things that I
use the most often and webos actually
remembers which screen you're on so if i
end up with this screen the one on the
left and i go back into
I'm taken to the one on the left so with
that in mind I keep all the programs
that I like the most in the center and
you can tap and drag anything from the
other screens to another screen to
populate it with the things that you use
the most which really helps a lot so
that you're not having to flip through a
ton of application lists and screens and
other things like that so for
productivity webos gets really high
marks I've really enjoyed using webos on
the palm pre plus on ATT for that now
let's talk about performance you see
that I have a lot of cards open right
now and I'm going to open up even more
and really try to toll the platform I'm
going to open up an additional card and
the way you can do that is go up to this
drop-down menu which I also don't like
too much and I can click new card and
let's go to say engadget com yep there
we go hand click enter
by the way while this is loading
something that I do like about webos is
the is the menu in the upper right
corner so you can toggle between off
very easily this way we're just leaving
on all of the time and you don't have to
go into a separate menu to see the the
networks that are open it's kind of an
overlay in the upper right corner so
that's pretty cool i like that but again
i don't like this menu in the upper left
corner because you have to be very
precise with your finger to open it up
so here we are we've got to web web
sites open although this one turned
blank on me for some reason up there
comes so we'll go back to their so now
we have two web browsers we have twitter
email calculator and photos let me open
up a photo let's open up the strawberry
picture and as you can see it's blurry
right now and it's going now it gets
clear webos takes a long time to clear
up pictures which I don't like
particularly much and so we can swipe to
the right or to the left and see it's
lagging right now it's starting to get a
bit slow and I'm going to pinch to zoom
in a second so you can see what that
looks like pinch to zoom is very good on
webos it's very precise let's go back to
the home screen we've got a ton of
things open let's see if we can make
this thing get really upset and close on
us open up Google Maps while that's
happening I'm going to open up another
application let's say open up the camera
and you know what's going to happen in a
second it's going to say out of memory
which is fine webos does a really good
job at managing memory and for the most
part you don't run into the to the
notification where you're running out of
memory that much and I am actually quite
impressed this is a this is a lot of
applications that are open right now and
it's still performing decently well
they've made a lot of improvements in
webos to get it to perform well with
multitasking they've doubled the ram in
the palm pre plus vs. the palm pre which
as you can see helps a lot I wish there
was a way to close all of the apps at
one time but you're probably not going
to have that many open at one time
anyway and finally I'm going to talk
about battery life battery life on the
on the palm pre plus is a lot better
than it was on the sprint palm pre I get
through a day usually with no problem
right now I've been using my device a
lot it's about 147 in the afternoon
and again these notifications are
sometimes tough to press I'm trying to
see my battery life percentage I'm at
sixty-two percent it's going down a
little bit fast today I think tonight
before i plug it in it'll be about
twenty five percent which is pretty good
a lot better than many other smartphone
operating systems out there before I
give some final thoughts I'm going to
wrap up and talking about the app
catalog which is of course palms app
store for webos I have a certain suite
of applications that i like to download
there's about six or seven of them I
have them on the iphone i have them on
android because those are both mature
application marketplaces but i can't
find most of those applications in the
webos app Cadillac it's just not variant
there's not enough developer support for
the palm app catalog which is very
unfortunate because a lot of the
applications that you can get are pretty
high quality there are some really
fantastic racing games on here there's
applications for Twitter of course
there's always applications for Twitter
but there's also a lot of junk a lot of
these little applications that aren't so
great but I guess you'll find that in
any sort of the more open application
marketplaces but in terms of the app
offering it pales in comparison to what
you can get on Android or the iphone so
some final thoughts there are two things
that are keeping me from loving the palm
pre plus on AT&amp;amp;T but I already like it I
really like the software i love the way
that you can multitask switch between
applications handle notifications use
gestures organize your applications i
love it all it's a very very productive
friendly operating system if you're a
business user or someone that likes to
get a lot done it's a great operating
system but there are two big problems
one I don't like the hardware at all I
don't like this keyboard I don't like
the overall feel of the palm pre I never
really did they really need to come out
with some more form factors and number
two the application selection is just
not there yet I don't use a million apps
i only use a couple but those those few
that i do use I use a lot and I can't
find them for webos so I'm very much
looking forward to the AT&amp;amp;T palm pixi
plus because that will solve at least
one of these problems of the hardware
but it won't necessarily fix the
shortage of apps in the App Catalog
