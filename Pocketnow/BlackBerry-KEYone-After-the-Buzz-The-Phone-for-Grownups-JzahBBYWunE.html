same old song and dance we all go crazy
over the newest tech but after that
initial review period we all move on to
the next new hotness the thing is how a
gadget ages is just as important as that
fresh out of the box perspective how we
hold companies accountable view progress
we shouldn't shy away from that
conversation so let's do something about
that at one time in history this company
was one of the most brutally dominant
forces in mobile technology but they
completely underestimated the consumer
response to phones like the iPhone when
this brand fell it fell hard back from
the ashes with the new manufacturing
partner and returning to their hardware
roots it would seem you can go back home
again here's our blackberry key one
after the buzz let's get this out of the
way right at the top of the video I
really like this phone easily one of my
top five favorite devices from 2017
that's not to say it didn't come with
something of an awkward learning curve
or relearning curve depending on how old
you are younger members of our audience
have likely never interacted with a
hardware keyboard and that unfamiliarity
can make for a really poor first
impression but it honestly doesn't take
long before these little tick tack
clicks this little tactile feedback
starts to feel really good 2017 was a
great year for specialist devices and
the key one was the premiere
communications device of the year more
than just a pleasant tactile experience
we could staple a hardware keyboard on
to any phone if we really wanted to
blackberry manages a very delicate
balancing act properly integrating this
hardware into the overall Android
experience a lot of phones will give you
a programmable button on the side some
phones give you a little squeezy gesture
on the key one nearly every single key
is a programmable shortcut that makes
the key one the most customizable phone
on the market you make it exactly the
device you want it to be and it is
pretty crazy how quickly you take this
customization for granted going back to
full touchscreen phones demanding much
more
visual attention to interact with
individual apps and services those
phones start to feel a little clingy
maybe the less successful aspect of this
marriage between Google's OS and classic
BlackBerry software I've never been the
biggest fan of gesture-based
overlays or short cut side panels
swiping into the screen to get more
information that swipe gesture is
already replicated as a part of Google's
UI so if you don't nail it perfectly all
you do is flip your home screen
blackberry launcher blackberry hub
collecting communications accounts it
feels a step out of place with the way
that we currently use data and services
and for as close as the rest of this
phone interface gets to stock Android
those additional pieces of software can
SAP some of that computing power out of
this mid-range chipset that being said I
really like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625
in this phone it never was much of a
pain point for me getting my daily work
done blackberry and TCL got a lot of
grief for the price tag of this phone
using that mid-range part but it only
really holds the phone back on graphics
intense gaming sure your Twitter feed
might take a fraction of a second longer
to load but in overall daily performance
I'm much happier with the battery life
that this low-power unit can provide
that battery life though we're well into
its first year of use and this phone
still handily outpaces flagships which
are significantly more expensive this is
the phone I turn to when I'm traveling
or when I know I'm going to have a
really busy especially communications
heavy day plus it's just refreshing to
handle a phone which feels like it was
made for grown-ups I've been a huge fan
of the combination of metal and a grippy
back in the note for the leatherback
Moto X 2 the LG v10 now I've totally
been mocked by my friends for whipping
out a blackberry in public but no one
denies that this is a more
professional-looking gadget than many of
the glass back experiments we see today
this videos coming out right before
Valentine's Day and it's coming off as
something of a love letter to the phone
I really do enjoy using it so I wanted
to detail where I hope blackberry and
TCL will go next key one is a terrific
restart a truer returned to the
BlackBerry roots than the detect phones
which came before it but four key to I
really hope to see some small
refinements the camera could definitely
use a little attention blackberries have
never had a reputation for being the
best multimedia devices but calling
something business grade isn't really an
excuse consumers expect their phones to
be their primary cameras some snap your
performance some crowd-pleasing
post-processing tricks and maybe throw
in optical image stabilization I'm
pretty sure we could get rid of the
convenience key now TCL continues to
mount their power button in a very
unfamiliar place and it's actually
pretty awkward so the location of this
button is very muscle memory confusing
if you've been trained on other devices
considering the wealth of customization
options we have on this keyboard don't
really need this button on the side
worse it makes mounting this phone very
tricky you can only mount it from the
very edge of the bottom of the keyboard
that's a dicey proposition when you're
trying to slap it into a car cradle
business grade hardware is synonymous
with durability and linkki one has taken
more than its fair share of bumps and
bruises I just think there would be some
added peace of mind if we had a proper
IP rating for this phone even if it was
IP 53 the target audience for a
blackberry I think they would appreciate
that knowledge knowing what the limits
of their device might be lastly this
one's gonna sound a little nitpicky but
it really was one of the biggest pain
points for me using the BlackBerry key
one and that's how close the hardware
keyboard is to the navigation controls
under the screen the touch sensors on
the keyboard are really cool and very
helpful when you're entering in text you
can swipe up on the keyboard to
autocomplete the word you want to type
but mounting your capacitive navigation
buttons just above your capacitive
keyboard I still regularly swipe up just
far enough to hit the multitasking
button the home button the back button
so while I'm in the middle of typing out
a message I am interrupted to go
somewhere else on the phone because I
swiped just a little too far it's really
distracting it's very disruptive for a
key to I hope we can find some way to
buffer just a little bit more in between
these two hardware parts or maybe
consider just going to on-screen
controls having a slightly larger
display on a key - even though that
display is going to be taken up with
your navigation at the bottom and other
than those four points
think I'd change a whole lot else I
definitely stick with another mid-range
'red chipset move us up to the
Snapdragon 630 bumping up the storage
would be nice but not necessarily
mission-critical considering the target
audience for this phone the rest of the
phone works for me so I don't really
think a lot of tinkering is really
necessary more I hope to see consistent
progress moving forward continuing to
release new phones on a regular schedule
that consumers can get used to and
making sure that we're keeping up to
date with security and operating system
patches reviving a brand is a really
tough uphill climb but using this phone
is giving me a little hope I don't like
the idea of a world without a blackberry
in it so I've been very happy with how
well this little puppy is performed and
of course we want to hear from you where
do you want to see BlackBerry go next
what features would you most want to see
on a follow up to the key one and do you
think TCL should be putting more
Hardware pressure on delivering a
high-end flagship with this BB logo drop
