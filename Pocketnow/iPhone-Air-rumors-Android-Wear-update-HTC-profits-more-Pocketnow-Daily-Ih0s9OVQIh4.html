6 in an iphone air have just emerged HD
finally finds an economical break with
some quarterly profits and as new as
Android wear smart watches are they
already have a software update I'm hi
Mary that I and man wouldn't it be cool
i mean Android wear is new it already
has software updates how about the rest
of Android this is parking out daily
let's begin today with some official
news that are actually good HTC has
finally found the break when it comes to
its economics it finally landed its own
projections when it comes to its quarter
results and even land a 75 million
dollar profit the first time in a very
long time now given the success of the
HTC when I made in the great design that
it has it's great to see that HTC is
finally finding the break that I was
looking for it hopefully that trend
continues that's how about Android wear
as Google seems to be doing for it what
it couldn't do for its smartphones right
now the company has just pushed a
software update to the G watch and the
gear live and they got the update just
like it should be not having to wait for
OEMs or carriers or whatever the
software update sadly no specifics all
we know it's that it's 4.4 w and
apparently these are just bug fixes but
still this is great news on how things
should be done now we've got some
interesting photos of a Nokia Lumia
smartphone with this very nice camera
hump at the back that's actually smaller
than the one that we see on the Lumia
1020 some of us were assuming that this
could be the successor to the 1020 which
is already due for an update but
apparently the specifications and the
code name of this phone don't really
point to a flagship apparently this will
be something like the Lumia 830 so we
really can't understand why the camera
hump and stuff like that stay tuned
rumors will get better and we will get
more details coming soon now just as we
heard the rumors of the Sony Xperia z3
up next are the rumors of the Sony
Xperia z3 compact and even though the
lame is long I love the fact that Sony
knows how to push a compact phone the
specification Tsar pretty much the same
only with the smaller screen size unless
resolution which is fine it's just fine
it makes sense lynx repair full details
on specific ations hopefully the z3
act will be launched shortly after the
z3 in the fall and finally for the very
interesting news of the day if we get
calm news these are more like rumors we
get more details on the iphone 6 launch
we had heard September 19 by two sources
but now the source is talking about a
September 25th launch would that have
been happening on September 15th but
even hotter with these rumors is the
fact that apparently the iphone 6 will
be the 4.7 inch model and then the 5.5
inch model will be duffy iphone air
which is really confusing as surely this
follows the whole ipad trend but when
you go into the macbook trend that's
completely different we don't really
know why this moniker or anything but
that leads you to the question of the
day what do you think about that name
iphone air I mean it's completely
misleading since all Apple phones are
been in light leave us a comment down
below what other name when you give this
phone and hey any name is allowed
comments down below friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video is filler
she'd follow us on parking out our karma
script a tube channel as well he also
follow me on Twitter highlanders
quarterly data please give this video
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
hey Natalie better thank you very much
for watching we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
