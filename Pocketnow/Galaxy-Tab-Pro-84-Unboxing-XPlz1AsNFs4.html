official at CES in January and now we
have the Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 on hand it's
time to get it out of the box I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is our
unboxing of the Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 so
Samsung announced its latest additions
to its tablet lineup at CES 2014 and of
all the new tablets this one seems to be
the most interesting the Galaxy Tab pro
8.4 and it's so interesting because it's
exactly what we've been asking for all
along a smaller higher in Android tablet
nobody seems to have been able to bring
this to us except for maybe a soos ever
really and that's why this one is so
interesting if you look at the back here
this is the Wi-Fi model with 16
gigabytes inside it has an eight point
four inch WQXGA display that is the same
resolution we had on the Nexus 10 and
it's impressive at 10.1 inches at 8.4
it's even more impressive that's 359 PPI
it has a Snapdragon 800 inside with a
2.3 gigahertz quad-core Krait 400 CPU 8
megapixel camera 2 megapixel camera on
the front 4800 milliamp hour battery and
2 gigabytes of RAM so the specifications
on this thing are very impressive of
course you can see on the box here it
has an IR blaster as well but the one
thing it's missing because it's a tab
pro is the S Pen it has no s-pen so
that's my only qualm with this tablet
but let's get inside the box and see
exactly what it's about what it's made
of and what it has to offer as you can
see the box opens up very easily this is
this is the standard Samsung packaging
you know the wood grain like box with
soy ink it's printed in soy ink so
here's the tablet we'll set that to the
side really quickly as they take a look
under this flap that I can't seem to get
open and you have basically your
standard stuff in the box a micro USB
cable at wall adapter AC wall adapter
and some reading material samsung galaxy
tabpro Start Guide health and safety so
there's that we'll put that back in the
box and slide it to the side and take a
look at this because this is what we
really care about right this thing is
very much like the note that we reviewed
late last year the 10.1 edition our 2014
edition galaxy note in that it has the
same faux leather on the back with the
faux leather stitching and the one
difference here is that the Tab pro line
doesn't have the lines in the chrome
around the edges but let's get this
coast of Mike and pull on this I don't
think it's gonna give us some noise
nothing nothing too fancy there this one
this one will so stick with me here you
always complain that I react that paper
off the plastic off too quickly so I did
it very slow for you you're welcome
so if we take a look around the hardware
you see that you've got a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the top and on your
right edge or your top edge if you're
holding it in landscape you have a power
button volume rocker and your IR blaster
the bottom is for your dual speakers and
your microUSB port and on this edge you
have just a micro SD card port or card
slot rather you still have your standard
Samsung button layout but it's a little
different that's very slightly modified
this one has as we've seen on the galaxy
s5 now the quick are the recent tasks
button recent apps home and back so it
doesn't have the Menu button anymore
which is nice I guess ed adheres to
Android guidelines now and if we take a
look at the back here you see that this
one is very much like your note series
with the leathery or the faux leather
and the faux stitching but of course
since this one is white it is not the
matte finish it's not the rubbery
texture it's a hard plastic key texture
so there is that it's not our favorite
but it's not horrible so we also have
the iPad Mini here for a size comparison
as you can see it is quite a bit shorter
than the Tab pro but it is a little bit
wider as well so this one's very narrow
and that's good because you can actually
grip it really well I don't have long
fingers and I can still wrap my hand
around the backside of this thing and we
also have the note 8.0 on the Galaxy
Note 8.0 it is wider as well and also
shorter so that just goes you just show
goes to show how narrow these bezels are
on the side that's a really
thing I think for a tablet like this so
before we jump off here we're gonna take
a look at what the screen looks like
because that is really the standout
feature of this tablet of course you've
got your new my magazine view but this
display oh my gosh it looks great
I haven't obviously this is the first
time I've Howard it on I haven't had
time to look at this too much but uh man
it looks fantastic
so we'll definitely be looking forward
to getting into this thing and and
taking a closer look at at the display
seeing games and all kinds of other
content on it so especially with the
Snapdragon 800 so stay tuned to see more
of this tablet as well as comparisons
with other tablets and the full review
