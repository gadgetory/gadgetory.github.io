top-of-the-line
a nine processor in the iPhone se so how
does this entry-level iOS option stack
up against Apple's flagship iPhone 6s
i'm juan carlos back now for PocketNow
and it's time for a quick comparison
it's easiest to begin by showing off all
the hardware that the SE adopted from
the 6s we've got the aforementioned a 9
processor 2 gigabytes of ram 16
gigabytes of base storage
nearly similar headphone audio playback
and the same 12 megapixel camera with
you HD and slow-motion video recording
capabilities while the screen on the SE
is obviously smaller and a lower
resolution it actually has the same
pixel density is the larger success
which means text and fine photo detail
at arms-length will be very similar
immediately we can say that's a pretty
great hardware spread for iOS
considering the 250 dollar price
difference between the two phones but
that's not to say the SE doesn't come
with a few compromises maybe the most
significant to consumers is a
significantly lower resolution FaceTime
camera the iPhone 6s delivers a 5
megapixel shooter with a slightly wider
aperture of f-22 while the se drops us
down to a 1.2 megapixel shooter with an
F 2.4 aperture it's fine for FaceTime
calls but this won't be the most
inspiring camera for sharing photos
getting some of the geeky stuff out of
the way the iPhone se actually uses the
same Wi-Fi antennas as the iPhone 6 and
lacks the MIMO antennas found on the 6s
while it's doubtful most people will
notice a significant difference the
iPhone 6s will likely have better Wi-Fi
connectivity when used with newer
routers the iPhone se also lacks support
for LTE advanced which allows phones to
use multiple separate frequency bands at
the same time to improve connection and
speed 2015 saw a number of smaller
markets start lighting up around North
America carriers around the world have
started activating this faster version
of LTE which is supported on the iPhone
6s and we can assume more markets will
be using LTE advanced over the next two
years
comparing the feel of each phone the
iPhone 6s has this geeky cool tweak to
how vibrations are
the iPhone se lacks 3d touch which is
one of the main uses where you would
notice the tiny pulses and pops that
serve tactile information to your
fingertips
but the taptic engine on the iPhone 6s
also influences the speed and
sensitivity of traditional notifications
another economic difference the iPhone
se uses an older version of touch ID
than what's found on the iPhone 6s and
it's subtly but noticeably slower at
scanning and unlocking the phone using
your thumbprint talking about those
gigabytes owing to the fact that the se
is something of a starter option for a
new iPhone Apple is not currently
offering a top level storage option you
can choose between 16 and 64 gig but the
iPhone 6s can take you up to 128
gigabytes of built-in storage
lastly the battery is smaller on the
iPhone se by around 90 milli amps which
represents less than a 6 percent
difference given the smaller lower
resolution screen our early testing is
pointing to slightly better battery life
on the SE than what you can get on the
flagship 6s which is a nice little perk
the iPhone se makes a compelling
argument for folks who want a premium
punchy performer in a small form factor
though there are a number of reasons why
someone might want to step up to the
more expensive iPhone 6s this purchasing
decision shouldn't hinge solely on the
processor and camera being the same
what's most interesting here is how
disruptive the iPhone se is to apples
former mid-range strategy where they
still offer one-year old phones with a
$100 price break
most of what the iPhone 6 has to offer
is either the same or better on the
iPhone se and the SE is a hundred and
fifty dollars less than the iPhone 6 the
six has a larger screen and that's about
it
we might even hazard a guess that the
iPhone se will handle future software
updates and features better thanks to
the beefier guts inside the takeaway
here though the design is a recycle and
a few nicer hardware options are absent
it is kind of exciting to see Apple
purposely attack the mid-range
smartphone market with some flagship
grade components forcing other
manufacturers to step up their offerings
is always good for competition as always
