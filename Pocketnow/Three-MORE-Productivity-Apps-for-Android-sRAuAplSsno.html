productivity apps for Android but since
then some things have changed and we
found some that we really like I'm
Taylor Martin this is pocket now and
here a three more productivity apps for
Android we've covered productivity apps
for Android before even earlier this
year but new applications appear every
week and sometimes it takes us a while
to discover new amazing apps think of
this as an update to the last video with
more of our favorite productivity apps
for Android first up is to do list I had
been searching for a great task manager
for quite some time Annie do was
obtrusive and always popping up in your
face then I found todoist at the surface
it's your typical task manager add tasks
set priorities and due dates use labels
and tags etc but once you dig into the
service there's much more to it tiny
things really that set it apart you can
add notes to your tasks due date entry
is powered by a language recognition
model you can sync your tasks with
google calendar and more best of all
it's available via web and there are
apps for Mac Windows Android and iOS as
well as extensions for chrome firefox
outlook thunderbird gmail and more the
to do a snap is free to use but to
access extra features like task notes
and file attachments productivity
tracking custom filters and more you'll
need to upgrade to do as premium for
twenty nine dollars per year I did test
the stock Android calendar it's old
clunky and ugly none of the alternatives
managed to entice me agenda calendar
awesome calendar didja cal etc then
sunrise calendar released on android a
few weeks ago it's beautiful fluid and
has some pretty useful features like
integration with Evernote reminders
github TripIt songkick and asana it has
integrated weather in the agenda view
and it's simply one of the most
beautiful Calendar apps on Android we've
ever used best of all it's completely
free and available in iOS and web as
well ja der pad X is a recent fight of
mine from a new twitter friend dr. Rita
Curie it's a minimal text editor with
dropbox integration and tons of other
tiny useful features you can set
different styles or typeface really for
your choice in
appearance there's an integrated
dictionary and it gives you word
paragraph and character counts the idea
here is to keep things as simple as
possible for distraction free writing
and we have to say Giada pad x is an
excellent execution best of all it's
free of charge for basic functionality
though if you want extended features
like markdown support and integrated
thesaurus save versions night mode and
PDF export you'll have to snag the
in-app creative unlock for 498 of late
these are the apps that keep its
productive on the road which android
