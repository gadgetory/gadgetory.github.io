pocket now come and this is the hardware
review of the samsung captivate on AT&amp;amp;T
let's get to it ok so the captivate has
several sensors up here we have a
proximity sensor and a light sensor
which does a good job at regulating
screen brightness and of course of
turning off the screen when you're on a
call the Super AMOLED screen has a
really interesting blue hue to it when
it's turned off and I really like that
it's very much different than other
devices like the google nexus one kind
of has a gray hue to it and the iphone 4
which has a black you to it so I'm I
don't think that was on purpose but it's
just a way that the Super AMOLED screen
is made has a cool little glow so the
screen is four inches which you know is
a really good size it's not massive like
the droid x but it's not kind of
smallish like the iPhone 4 or even like
the google nexus one which has a 3.7
inch display i think it's a really good
size for text entry for seeing things on
the screen without really compromising
the form factor making it too large
continuing on we have for capacitive
buttons down here and it's interesting
how little bit of a space there is
between the samsung logo and these for
capacitive buttons menu home back and
search they have a good amount of
sensitivity to them and they glow when
you press on them if it's a dark room
and by default you get a little bit of
haptic feedback actually you get haptic
feedback when you press anything on the
screen by default I turn this off to
save a little bit on battery so let's
turn this around to the top and what we
have here is a little door for the micro
SD or the micro USB port which actually
also doubles for TV out and you need a
special cable to do that it doesn't come
with the TV out cable so we can close
the door it's a very sturdy door a nice
thing to have although it's really not
that necessary because you could just
have the port exposed all the same
although you get a little bit of extra
protection by having the door there 3.5
millimeter headphone jack turning over
to the side we have the volume rocker
that
go place on the left side of the device
going down to the bottom we have the
microphone this doesn't have two
microphones like the droid x and the
iphone 4 and the nexus one to do noise
cancellation unfortunately over here on
the right side kind of a strange place
is the standby button so you can tap it
over there and it will unlock or turn on
the display will talk about software in
a future video back here we have a 5
megapixel camera but there is no flash
which is really annoying because a lot
of times you need a flash low-light
situations we have this really cool
looking back battery cover which is
actually made out of real metal I'll
show you that in a second we've got the
galaxy s branding Samsung is really
pushing this the galaxy s devices will
be on all four carriers and they want to
make sure that when someone looks at
your phone they say that's a galaxy s
smartphone this is for the speakerphone
the way you get the back battery cover
off is kind of interesting you move that
down and then you can slide open the
battery door here we have a 1500
milliamp hour battery here I've got the
micro-sim adapter because I just came
from the iphone 4 i'll put a link up on
the video if you want to see more about
that particular part this is the slot
for the micro SD card unfortunately it
is swappable when you have the battery
and a lot of phones make you take out
the battery to swap the micro SD card
not the case with the captivate which is
quite nice and as i mentioned this is a
real metal backing very thin and very
light we can slide this back on if you
get it just right and it clicks into
place there we go now something I find
remarkable about the captivate is how
thin it feels it's nine point nine
millimeters thick which is amongst the
the thinnest smartphones that are out
there and I think it achieves this thin
feel by the way that the edges are
tapered not only are the sides tapered
so that you get a really thin line here
but the top and the bottom are tapered
that way kind of like a wedge it feels
like a big wedge and see on the bottom
it's tapered up so when you pick up the
phone you're really feeling these thin
edges on the top and the sides and it
feels like the thinnest smartphone
out there even thinner than the iphone 4
which claims to be the thinnest phone on
the market and if you look at it sort of
from a stacked point of view you can see
how the captivate is a little bit
thicker than the iphone four but in hand
it just feels extremely thin and also
very light and the materials that are
used on the captivate are pretty high
quality i think the build quality is
quite nice because of its lightweight
some may think that it feels cheap but
when you get down to it and you look at
the materials and sort of the
craftsmanship that went into making the
phone you realize that it's a nicely
built phone and the build quality is
actually quite solid Samsung makes some
really good products so coming up soon
we're going to talk about the software
on the samsung captivate if you liked
the video please give it a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
