calm and the LG expo just arrived for
eighteen t so we're going to unbox it
let's take a look at the box first got
the picture of the device so when icons
18t right here we see as Wi-Fi enabled
touch screen gps five megapixel camera
battery data cable sound let's go start
alright 18t only our specs tribe and
hsdpa talk time five point three hours y
5 eng bluetooth wvga 3.2 inch screen for
you bae 800 micro SD smart sensor
fingerprint recognition voice and data
access alrighty let's open it up thank
you for purchasing and LG expo get the
most out of your smartphone visit this
website i am quick start guide color 30
days of 318 teams to get every that's
good
manual
here's the device please don't text and
drive look at that later big orange foam
what's up is our AC adapter it's pretty
compact how to use P plug that's good
and we have a USB cable let's see what
is it down there that's a microUSB all
right I believe so or is it prepared
well anyway we also have headphones look
at that
I'm not 3.5 millimeter that's USB but
look it here there we go that's nice so
you can plug in whatever headphones you
want to this part while this piece is
plugged into the phone and you still
have a microphone over here and your
answer button that's pretty good nice
solution we also have a little thing
with a tie thing where's this do Mary
our stylist that's interesting a
collapsible and what's this last piece
let's say a note about Ken synced up
alright let's look at this again pretty
nice no d-pad and a back button I'll end
pretty nice keyboard really hard to feel
the difference between the keys though
that's pretty smooth and there the
little tiny bump on the J and the F very
hard to feel though I on let's look at
how compares with some of the other
devices here's the touch pro 2 bit
smaller
touch pro 2's keyboard is much better
here's the old Titan to say that here's
the pure pretty much same size screen
there of course the expo sticker with
its keyboard and here's the old diamond
which is still the smallest of thinnest
windows mobile device if not smartphone
ever so there we go we're going to have
to boot this up and test out did not
come with the projector that we were
open for which is probably the most
innovative part of this device here's
our battery which looks like fifteen
hundred milliamps per hour
and that's all for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
