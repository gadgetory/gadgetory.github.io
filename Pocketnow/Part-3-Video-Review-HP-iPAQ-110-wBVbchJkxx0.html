parking
part three of the video review for the
HPI pack
110 this addition we're going to go
through
capabilities and a couple of bugs I've
noticed after a couple of weeks of usage
media capabilities is probably one of my
disappointments one of the things I
didn't like about this device is that
even though you have a px a310 processor
which has 300 624 megahertz of
processing power I converted a Bourne
Ultimatum through svv mobile DVD which
is a 320 by 240 which is Q VGA
resolution under 25 frames per second
which will render or 437 kbps video and
even though you're supposed to have all
this power and the processor has
enhanced media capabilities there is a
little bit of lagging probably a small
fraction of a second but I would have
expected and you'll notice that there's
a little small little bit of lagging
here I would have expected that at least
for this small resolution you would have
flawless video video performance but I
honestly haven't noticed that to be that
good I would have expected or would have
preferred it to be better it's just too
bad for this part obviously video
quality is something important for
example this American Airlines flight
landing in bill C alpha was filmed under
a bit more quality than the Bourne
Ultimatum I showed earlier and you will
still notice some lagging here and there
one there there's another one and those
are probably things that I would have
expected this device to show up better
on and obviously you won't see it there
and then obviously when you bring larger
videos like for example part two of our
video review which was filmed at a 3640
kbps and their VGA resolution lagging
just keeps on getting bigger and bigger
too bad for this device honestly I would
have expected better rendering it has a
large processor it's a really good for
its price range it's just too bad video
performances definitely not what I
expected
gaming performance isn't bad I was just
expecting that probably the device would
understand
the commands better because of obviously
it's a Windows Mobile classic device it
has the same buttons for when this the
game was configured anybody remember
Wolfenstein 3d from the OS here it is
but the problem is it doesn't the button
mapping doesn't really understand the
the way my Windows Mobile 2003 device
did I was really nostalgic about the
fact that I could probably play these
games on my on this new device but uh it
hasn't really gotten as better as I'd
expect obviously playing these games on
a phone device is really bad it's button
mappings are not at all the same I was
expecting that to be better here but it
sadly isn't going into bugs I've noticed
three in the last couple of days for
example one of them is Wi-Fi you'll
notice my WLAN icon here at the bottom
to be turned off but then you see the
windows mobile icon turned on at the top
any time you send your device to standby
and then you turn it back on it'll
sometimes try to connect again to Wi-Fi
sometimes it'll just stay stuck like
this and then you have to soft reset
your device to fix it
haven't found any other way to fix it
myself another one for example is the
fact that if you enable GPRS connection
and the BT phone manager then whenever
you're connected to Wi-Fi and you lose
your Wi-Fi connection by some issue like
distance or something it'll start to try
to connect to the GPRS connection
uncontrollably I've tried to find a way
to disable this or try to make the
device ask you if you want to connect
and it just doesn't give you an option
it'll just try to connect and try to
connect and keep on doing it until you
end up soft resetting again another sad
bug from the device then and the other
one is probably battery life
I just finished charging my device like
five minutes ago ten minutes ago the
most and then you'll notice that I'm
down to 61% probably in ten charges this
has only happened to me twice this is
second time whenever I disconnect you're
probably at 100% and then in a couple of
seconds you send your device to standby
and turn it back on and then you're down
to the 68 probably one of the other
things I haven't liked about the device
is that even though you do get a mini
USB connection at the bottom and that is
supposedly compatible with any other USB
connections I try to use my you my mini
USB connector from our Harold which has
the same amount of
approach and voltage that the HP device
has and it just won't recognize it
that's probably one of the things I
would have enjoyed and probably the bugs
obviously are some things that no user
wants but then again this is probably it
for what the problems I've noticed in
the device and that's pretty much it for

iPAQ 110 remember to keep us posted on
