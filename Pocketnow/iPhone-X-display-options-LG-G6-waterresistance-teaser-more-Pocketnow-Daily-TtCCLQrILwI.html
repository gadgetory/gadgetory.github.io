what to expect for water resistance on
the g6 we already got some information
on the next generation Galaxy Notes
believe it or not and sources are
already talking about yet another screen
size for the iphone X I'm hi mera neta
and no I don't think there's a
possibility that Homer will ever make it
to been in black but he can dream this
is parking out daily the official is
today begin with deals we've seen these
four weeks now when it comes to the Moto
Z and moto Z Force and whatever if you
want to get this spoon and you haven't
already right now the motorola store is
offering the Z or the Z Force with
either a hassle blog moto mod or in the
other case the projector moto bond which
is something I would probably never buy
but if you want to karaoke and style
that's probably a nice thing to get
anyways you can learn one link in the
description other very interesting
official news have to do with one of my
favorite smartwatches ever the huawei
watch we just heard from huawei CEO
teasing that for mwc we will see the
next generation huawei watch now the
problem is it apparently then it's going
to be a shift towards fitness with this
Huawei watch which is a complete
opposite to everything that we saw with
the first generation model and one of
the main reasons I like the first
generation model was because it really
looked like a classy regular watch so
let's see how that goes as well as
fallout over to the iphone x iphone 8
whatever Apple wants to call this thing
it's clear that we are at prototyping
phase or at least somewhere close to
that because we hear different screen
sizes right now we've got kg I assuming
that there will be a 5.2 inch iPhone on
the 4.7 inch iphone chassis that makes a
lot of sense we hear that aval wants to
get rid of it's much better than a tan
and it's long overdue like for the
longest time if it wasn't for the pixel
like the iPhone takes the cake in the
worst bezel to body ratio on any
smartphone and notice I didn't even say
screen to body that's bezel to body
families 5.2 inches on the smaller
iPhone 8
your iPhone X makes a lot of sense but
again we've heard five inches as well or
the regular 4.7 let's see what we get in
the end and I totally know that i am
going to butcher this main but
apparently the code name for the next
generation galaxy note is by call baked
whole or it's a lake in Russia the
deepest freshwater lake in the world why
is samson using this is a code name we
don't know we would love to know what
you think in the comments down below but
at least this at least teases that there
is a galaxy note coming that is great
news on its own when can we expect this
product we don't know but we'll keep you
posted and finally a very hot news they
have to do with the LG G six as we
continue to get more teasers of what to
expect from the smartphone there is one
teaser that says of this phone is going
to be more reliable and then we actually
got an exclusive teaser from LG claiming
to this phone will be able to resist
more under pressure now we assume that
this means that the phone will be more
submergible than other smartphones out
there there's probably another IP rating
that is great but it could also mean
that this phone will be able to
withstand more pressure from graphics
intensive games and so many other things
so hey it leads me to the question of
today what do you think this means to
resist the more under pressure I don't
think it has to do with you know the
folks capabilities I think it has to do
mainly with the IP rating but the
question is how much do you actually use
your phone when submerged you actually
submerge your phone or is it just that
you like a water resistant phone because
you want that peace of mind if going out
and it's raining or whatever because in
my case I'll be honest with you because
of capacitive buttons on devices like
the Galaxy s7 I really don't submerge my
phones like at all I just like the
opportunity to get it wet whenever I
have to leave us a comment down below we
love to know your opinion frenzy another
way it goes if you want to get the news
earlier before the videos filmed follow
