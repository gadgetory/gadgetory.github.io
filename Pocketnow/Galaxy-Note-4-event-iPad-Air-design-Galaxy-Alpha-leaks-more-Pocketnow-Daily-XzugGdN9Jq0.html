getting a new redesign samsung announces
its Aoife unpacked event and we expect
the Galaxy Note 4 and new leaks of the
galaxy alpha show us some premium design
I'm hi Mary that I and since my gym
trainer knows how much I hate mondays he
also makes a leg day as well this is
parking out daily let's begin today with
what's official and interesting a lot of
us are waiting for the galaxy note 4
it's probably the favorite phablet of
everyone and as it turns out Samsung is
Justin out press invitations for its
event to happen Anifah in Berlin
September 10th is when we are expecting
to have the Galaxy Note 4 in our hands
and yes our own michael fisher and
taylor Martin will be there to cover
everything live so stay tuned now in
some interesting official news a lot of
people were complaining about corrosion
issues with the LG G watch and the
port's that charge the SmartWatch at the
bottom and a lot of people were
expecting for LG to make a massive
recall of these smart watches and no LG
has just sent out a software update to
fix the issue and while we haven't been
able to confirm if this actually helps
the corrosion issues because obviously
something that's already corroded is
already corroded you can't really fix it
but leave us a comment down below has it
fixed anything for you another company
that's made the official news today is
Apple finally they've just launched iOS
8 beta 5 and even though there are some
minor improvements with the update the
most interesting is that you have SMS
relay now active meaning continuity has
begun we've been waiting for continuity
to work on the betas for the longest
time a lot of us are already using
Yosemite and we didn't have this feature
now it's available at least between iOS
products aside from other features and
I'll link to the scripture for full
details on the update now let's talk
about the apple rumors as we get some
new leaks from the ipad housing and
apparently this will be the ipad air and
it turns out that there are some minor
redesigns mostly in internals but also
in the drills at the bottom of the ipad
and a lot of people are actually
expecting those i have to be much
lighter than the previous one and even
though we can attest this obviously all
we have our league photos this would be
the second cycle for the ipad
many so could it be that we are at least
getting something for the ipad mini are
both at the same time and finally for
the very hot and interesting rumors of
the day we get some leaked photographs
of the galaxy out from its side and does
not necessarily disappointing but the
sides that we just found or pretty much
the Sham furred edges that we saw for
the galaxy f that was being rumored as
the high-end black ship with aluminum
design and as it turns out no this is
actually of the galaxy alpha the galaxy
alpha is going to be the phone that has
this design it looks very premium it
looks like an iphone 5 from the sides
but still this would be the first time
that Samsung actually brings us some
aluminum even though the back is plastic
but that leads you see the question of
the day since Samsung is currently
struggling do you think that this
aluminum Galaxy alpha is what everybody
wants because in my particular case yeah
sure I would love a better design but
that doesn't change the fact that it
still looks like every other galaxy
phone in my opinion leave us a comment
down below what do you think frenzy s
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video with
spelling treat follow us on fucking our
comments trap change channel as well it
