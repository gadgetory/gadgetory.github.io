but it's the so called friends the
add-ons or modules so to speak that give
it additional functionality and value
I'm Anthony not reporting from MWC 2016
and this is a quick look at the LG g5
friends brought to you by the brand the
LG 360 cam and the LG 360 VR are also
friends with the LG g5 but we'll take a
look at them in a separate video this is
the LG Chem plus a camera grip add-on
for those who want to take their camera
experience to the next level you eject
the battery placing the camp last module
reinsert it and upon reboot you can not
only take pictures in a more
point-and-shoot e way but you also
extend the battery of the g5 by 15% all
the way up to 4,000 milliamp hours from
the built in 2800 the kem plus takes
controls from the screen and places them
at your fingertips whether that's the
shutter button the video record button
or the analog dial for seamlessly and
smoothly zooming in and out the user
experience is dramatically improved now
this is nothing new
not yet did it with the Lumia 1020 back
in the day granted with a different
approach but the added value is
absolutely there if there's one thing we
need to complain about its the added
thickness we just wish it added just a
little bit more bulk in order for you to
hold it in a more comfortable way
sometimes bulk has its advantages when
you're done shooting and you want to
slim the phone back to normal you can
just eject the module and revert to
stock or you can start using a different
module like the hi-fi plus module this
one is for audio files among you it will
come bundled with the bank and olives
and h free earbuds and LG will try to
offer a premium listening experience the
hi-fi Plus module is basically a DAC and
the headphone amplifier that's
specifically tuned for the best
experience by bno what's great about the
hi-fi Plus module is that you can listen
to music up sampled from the phone to 24
bits if you plug in the headphone at the
top of the device on the dedicated
headphone jack
but then if you plug them into the
bottom jack on the module itself the
entire experience has changed and you're
listening to music that's been tuned by
beyond oh of course we will take all of
these modules for a spin with the
occasion of our LG g5 review but until
then make sure to check out the LG g5
