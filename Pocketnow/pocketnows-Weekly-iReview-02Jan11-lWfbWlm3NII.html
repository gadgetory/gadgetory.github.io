devices for ice and buying iphone
domains just for the fun of it in our
predictions on what Apple might bring to
the iPhone on 2011 all this and more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
hi Madame Yvette and welcome to the
pocket nail I review the show we go
through all this week school and they're
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices first of all happy new year
and to start this week off we'll have
the cool segments the not-so-cool
segment and our predictions on 2011 for
iOS devices and well following Yahoo's
recent video chatting options skype
finally rolls out an update to their iOS
application that allows you to have
video callings over the iphone 4 and it
also works with the iphone 3gs is
backward camera really don't know why
the iphone 3g is not included in the
list apparently but it's not working so
it also works with Wi-Fi and 3g and you
can also chat between pcs macs and
iphones really great changes for the new
skype iOS application whoa verizon
iphone rumors get stronger as we have
stores pulling up lineups of stuff there
specific to the verizon iphone meaning
that we'll probably see a variant of the
iphone that's totally different to what
we see on a tnt coming to verizon really
don't know what to expect out of that
but also we have verizon buying domains
like verizon iphone calm that are
specific to iphone and verizon so it's
really cool we still don't know a
release date some of us have been
assuming that it will be you know on CES
or probably a day or two before CES
given you know CS is just around the
corner probably just to pull the rug off
you know the renew releases of Android
and Windows Phone that we could probably
expect on CES so we'll see what happens
in the end and well-read snows recent
update finally brings us untethered
jailbreak to the iphone 4 even though
things are a bit rocky because things
are still in beta we still don't know
what to expect from the dev team given
you know things have not been really
nice up there but finally it's out there
we're still waiting for the carrier
unlock feature to be out there somewhere
sometime someplace for some people like
us that are really dying to get our
phones unlocked we'll see what happens
that does it for the cool let's continue
on with the not so cool it seems there's
an iOS bug that's out there that hasn't
woken people up on january first and it
seems that it will happen to everybody
on non-recurring alarms from here up
until january third don't know what's
going on with iOS really sad and lame
and it's just a really ugly wake-up call
sort of for you know proms and trusting
apple recently with their updates and
well according to a CNN report the
iphone 4s antennagate issues have made
the top of the list of the worst
technology fail of 2010 you know i'd say
they're probably right i'd say that
definitely antennagate was bad you know
i just feel that it's not that bad
considering not everybody had the issue
and then again we could probably also
add the kin to the list you know what i
mean and while that does it for the
uncool let's continue on with our
predictions for 2011 on the iOS and
iPhone lineup first of all with hardware
we do see a 64 gigabyte or a 128
gigabyte or whatever iPhone coming out
and yeah I'm one of the people that
cannot live with 32 gigs even though
Brandon always asked why we do see
changes in hardware coming to the design
probably they could bring in aluminum
aura I don't know stainless steel
version of the iPhone or they could just
stick with the glass on glass I mean
glass gate is a problem that I see
everybody could have just as all phone
scratch it's just something that happens
we do see a gray iPhone somewhere in the
future though I really don't know what
to make of it given Apple hasn't really
been able to bring out the white iphone
to sale and yet you know Apple love
simplicity so we do see a city ma iphone
or an LTE iphone that is also compliant
with gsm terms somewhere and we also do
see Apple bringing an overclocking to
the a4 chip or probably an a5 chip that
could do also dual core processing we'll
see what happens there now we go on to
the software portion of iOS 5 or iOS
four points something we do see Apple
bringing the new user interface
somewhere you know
I'm one of the people that see that the
whole search side at the left is
something that Apple could probably use
for something else but probably they'll
offer some sort of new locking screen
options probably skin something totally
different but we'll see you know it's
Apple and they love their UI and well we
do see 1080p video recording come in
somewhere though we don't really know
what to expect on you know backwards
compatibility with the iphone 4 or any
other older versions of the iphone we
also see Apple figuring out how to mix
the iphone into more of the Apple
ecosystem like making it work much
better with the Apple TV working on
airplay and stuff like that we also see
Apple working on their front facing
video camera options and offering more
things like probably you know facial
recognition for I don't know unlocking
your phone and probably using that same
facial recognition technology to work
with their photos application also and
well finally we see Apple working on
their mobile me you know probably they
could leave it with the price tag but
figure out how to offer iTunes streaming
services through people that have
subscribed to mobileme so again we'll
see what happens we don't see Apple
changing the iphone 4 name to iphone 5
we see Apple keeping the iphone 4 and
just offering something different like
iphone 4s for speed considering the
k'tralli bring the dual core processing
I probably just work on the iOS to make
it you know work faster and just work
better than it currently does because
even if you have an iPhone 4 we do see
some sluggishness every now and then
with you know lots of applications
working out there so we'll see what
happens with Apple in the 2011-12 our
predictions and what you would like to
see for Apple to bring in 2011 that's it
for today's I review thank you very much
for watching remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
