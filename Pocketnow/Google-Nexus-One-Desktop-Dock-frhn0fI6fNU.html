pocketnow.com and today i'd like to show
you the google nexus one desktop dock
let's take a look okay so let's take a
look and see what comes with the nexus
one desktop dock first thing that we've
got our papers we've got the instruction
manual we've got warranty information
and we've got a regulatory notice most
of the time people don't open those so
we're not going to either we'll set them
aside the next thing is an audio cable
now this has a neat little headphone
jack to RCA jack and the reason for that
is your doc can actually accept audio
and pass that through to a stereo or a
set of headphones or whatever but
Google's nice enough to include this
headphone style to RCA styled cable for
you and you can tell I haven't used mine
yet next thing that it comes with is a
AC adapter two mini USB or excuse me
micro USB now one thing to note is in
the instructions it says do not plug
your dock into your computer or into
your laptop now why is that it doesn't
say but I assume it's because your
laptop just doesn't supply enough power
when you go through an AC adapter you
usually get quite a bit more juice and
you'll notice that when you're charging
your phone it'll charge a lot faster
when you're plugged into an AC adapter
versus plugged into USB so if you've
never done that try it I found that my
charge times are cut basically in half
what we're going to do is we're going to
plug this in and that's the headphone
jack that I mentioned before and then
we'll look at the front now in the front
you'll notice two little metal dots here
and one more little metal dot there and
there's no micro USB plug anywhere
inside of it just those three metal bots
those match up with the three metal dots
on the bottom of the nexus one so
case you were wondering what those were
for and that's it one thing I'd like to
point out again this is the micro USB
port on the bottom of the nexus one
there is no mating plug on the bottom of
the dock so when you're plugging it in
you're not going to have to worry about
snapping that plug off we're doing
damage to your phone it's very very nice
design here where you just slide the
phone into the dock and it'll
automatically start charging so let me
go ahead and do that and I'd like to
show you what it does the very first
time we're going to slide that in those
dots make contact the first time it
comes up and asks me if I want to use
the dock for audio for music and media I
do and I want it to remember my settings
so I'll say okay that puts us over here
into the desktop mode where it keeps
your wallpaper kind of dims it out put
the clock calendar current weather along
with highs and lows the fact that it's
plugged in and charging and what the
charge state is and then some relatively
large easy access buttons on the bottom
so that's nice one of the things I like
the most though is this little dim
button I touch that and you can't see it
because it's dim the screen but if all
the lights were out you could still see
the screen a little bit and in fact it
gets a little green clock that just kind
of pops into different positions on the
screen to prevent burn in apparently so
it's really nice even for a nightstand
clock which is what I use it for so
we'll turn that back up now something
kind of neat here is you'll notice I've
got my bluetooth turned on let's go in
and look at my bluetooth settings so I'm
going to come back home and we're going
to go into settings and wireless and
networks and turn the bluetooth off and
we'll turn it back on and once that's up
we're going to go right into settings
now down here you'll notice these are my
bluetooth devices I've got my car I've
got my Nexus One car dock and I've got
my laptop so one
this pairs with my doc I'll have a nexus
one desktop dock show up here in my
bluetooth list so that's going to be
kind of cool and you can see now it
paired my bluetooth is connected let's
go home and let's check that go into
settings go back to wireless go back to
bluetooth and right here is the nexus
one desktop and it's connected to media
audio so i'm going to tap that and if I
do it's going to disconnect it obviously
you don't want to do that tap and hold
and we can see all of our Bluetooth
options we want to connect and we want
it to connect using media so what does
this do instead of having a whole bunch
of different connectors like the iPod
the iPad the iphone the zune the
whatever device you want to talk about
to transfer all of that audio and all
the controls and all that everything
google has done something really smart
and that is to use the bluetooth that's
in the phone and put a bluetooth
transceiver in the dock so the two
actually pair with one another so you
have less contacts that you need to make
in fact you don't have to have any
penetration into the device you just
have those three metal dots then and
that's for power so that's really really
ingenuity it's ingenious in my opinion
and it really adds a lot of utility to
the dock you don't have to worry about
sliding it in just right and the
possibility of scratching or damaging
your phone what don't I like about the
dock well this little lip that the phone
sits in is not very deep so I've had
times where I come in here and I dropped
my phone in and it just slides right out
because I didn't get it seated just
right what I've decided to do now is I
set it in at an angle and then drop it
back sometimes I don't get a really good
connection when I do that but most of
the time as you can see here it worked
just fine so the google desktop dock
really really nice accessory and it's
done well it
the best-built doc the best thought
through doc that I have ever used and I
really like it it's a little bit on the
spending side you're going to be looking
anywhere from 50 to 75 bucks depending
on where you get it from you can get it
straight through google or you could
until they turned off their phone store
so how to get it right now is kind of up
in the air but just do a google search
for nexus one desktop dock and i'm sure
you'll be able to find it on there so
give it a try if you're using a
different doc for your nexus one I'd
like to know what it is and if you like
it what the pros and cons of that are so
showing you a hands-on with the Nexus
One Desktop talk I am Joe Levi for
