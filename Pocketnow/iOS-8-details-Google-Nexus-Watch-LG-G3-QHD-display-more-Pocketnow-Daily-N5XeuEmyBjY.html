plans more mac integration we got leaked
specifications of Google's probable
SmartWatch and the LG g3 seems to want
to fight the smartphone display battle
I'm crying every bit and one of the
coolest things about my country is that
people here confuse Thursdays for
Friday's this is pocket now daily you
know I wish I had official news for you
but uh the rumors were kind of hotter
and especially Microsoft a company
apparently is starting to waive its
licensing fees for Windows Phone 8.1
apparently the company wants to strike
big when it comes to getting more OEMs
and it's kind of logical as obviously
OEMs are now worried that microsoft owns
nokia we know that obviously the company
is a software company and wants to focus
on that but it's also a products company
now so let's see how that plays out for
Microsoft as they do need more OEM up
next let's talk about LG the company is
probably going to do as a big favor with
their LG g3 and the reason why is
because we were worried about the Oppo
find 7 being the only smartphone that
pushes the display bar at qhd which
would be you know it's almost 2k
apparently the LG g3 is also being
rumoured to sport a 2k display we just
obviously don't know yet we're still
waiting for LG to make some sort of an
announcement or teaser as it's taken a
while and we still don't get any
detailed specs and for those of you
waiting for the Samsung Galaxy s5 and
specifically those of you on t-mobile it
seems that the company is planning some
interesting strategy to sell this phone
apparently they are going to try to sell
it online exclusively 32 gigs and then
if you want the 16 gig model you can get
it at the store and it's kind of
interesting we really don't know exactly
why t-mobile is planning this we do know
that the company is pushing big on their
LTE services and obviously the galaxy s5
is going to play a big role there we
just don't understand the difference
we'll see now let's talk about iOS 8 we
get more leaks and even screenshots of
what to expect for the next operating
system and this is very interesting as
we get some leaks of a health book which
we're trying to confirm if it's real
because it looks a lot like the icon
from passbook but we do know that iOS 8
wants to make a shift in to help which
is great
we also get leaks of the preview feature
from the Mac os10 and also text edit
which is really interesting as we really
didn't understand why those were coming
but then we got more reports that
apparently Apple once they integrate the
iOS iCloud experience from the mac onto
iOS which is actually the way that I've
tried to pronounce that but anyways the
interesting thing here is that Apple
plants to bring more I cloud integration
between the mac and iOS so let's see how
that plays out and finally for the very
interesting news of the day we get the
first leaked specifications of the
google smartwatch that's eventually
coming and the reason why this is
interesting is because if you follow the
link of the description you'll notice
that the specifications are pretty much
a gear to exactly a gear to and
absolutely every single detail even the
four gigs of ram sir storage which is
really interesting it seems that google
is probably a little you know backburn
because of the fact that samsung decided
to go with its own ties an operating
system and not choose android and we do
know that Google's making some serious
moves in the SDK but that leads you to
the question of the day are you looking
forward for this feature SmartWatch
probably a nexus SmartWatch in the
future because in my particular case
it'll depend on which company figures
out something better than the pebble and
that includes Samson but leave us a
