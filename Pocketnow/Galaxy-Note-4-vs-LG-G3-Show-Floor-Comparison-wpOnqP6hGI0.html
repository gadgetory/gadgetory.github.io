stealing the show here in berlin how
does it compare to what many have
considered one of the best android
smartphones today i'm taylor martin with
pocket now and this is our show floor
comparison of the galaxy note 4 and the
LG g3 we've now reviewed the g3 in its
various blends a few times now and every
time we've determined that it's a
fantastic smartphone and as far as we
can tell it's a very nice match for
comparison with the newly announced
Galaxy Note 4 internally the differences
are slight both kammath quad HD displays
the g3's is a 5.5 inch true HD IPS + LCD
and the note fours is a 5.7 inch Super
AMOLED from what we can't help the notes
display is much warmer and vibrant than
the g3's but it also has a much wider
brightness range both phones also come
with 3 gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes
of storage though the g3 also comes in a
version with 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of storage the g3 has a three
thousand million power battery while the
note has 220 million powers more and
both are removable both primary cameras
are optically stabilized but the g3 has
a 13 megapixel sensor in the note 4
boasts 16 megapixels and the note force
front camera is a wide-angle 3.7
megapixel camera the g3's isn't nearly
as impressive finally the note 4 has the
newer Snapdragon 805 with a higher clock
speed the g3 has the Snapdragon 801 a
respectable chip and its own right with
a tether on the note 4 it's more
difficult to judge its weight but it's
taller and wider than the g3 and it's
much heavier 176 grams compared to 149
truly the biggest hardware difference
though is the s-pen this is a tool that
unlocks a lot of additional
functionality on the note for the note 4
also has a fingerprint scanner the g3
does not the building designs are
dramatic contrast from one another the
g3 is built with a wing design made to
look like brushed metal it's almost
entirely plastic the galaxy note 4
introduced a new metal band around the
diges with a soft touch leather like
backside we had no problem saying the
galaxy note 4 certainly feels like the
more premium device of the two the
software between the two is actually
very similar Samsung has lightened the
load with TouchWiz once more introducing
a toned-down interface with transparent
widgets a simpler settings experience
and new multitasking features like pop
out windows and a better more
window the g3 software also comes with
script the g3 software also comes with a
split screen view but it's definitely
more limited the appearance of the g3
software is more neutral and can be
tweaked more out-of-the-box in other
words TouchWiz on the note 4 comes with
a handful of newer features and advanced
functionality but the LG ua has a fair
amount of utility as well if you're not
after productivity features that are
pushed with the s-pen the differences
between software are few and far between
the galaxy note however is a more
feature packed option it has more
premium hardware and an integrated
extension of its hardware the s-pen but
that's definitely not enough to
determine whether this is a better
overall foam for that you'll have to
wait for a full comparison in the near
future
keep it locked on pocket now for more
comparison straight from the show floor
here at Aoife and stay tuned for full
comparisons and reviews of these devices
in the coming weeks i am taylor martin
