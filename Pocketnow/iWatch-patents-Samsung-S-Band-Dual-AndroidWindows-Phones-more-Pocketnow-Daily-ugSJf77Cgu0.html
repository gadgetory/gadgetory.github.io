pointing towards fitness we got more
leaks of the Samsung S fan than it's
also a tracker and we should be getting
the first duel Windows Phone Android
device very soon I'm high never met and
since I got confused with the whole
Thursday Friday thing yesterday I'll
just continue what I started yesterday
and you should join me this is parking
out daily let's first they offered some
official news as nokia has just launched
a refocus application to pretty much all
the nokias that actually matter and the
reason why this is cool is because the
refocus application brings that Lytro
functionality which actually takes a
couple of shots at the same time and
then allows you to refocus to wherever
you want it's a really cool feature in
hey it's free for the Lumia so it's
great but even more interesting for
those of you that were interested in
nokia martini and all the rumors that we
talked about a couple of weeks ago it
turns out that this apparently is the
successor to the Lumia 920 which will be
dubbed the Lumia 930 so stay tuned for
that it should be launched in the next
couple of weeks and speaking of Windows
Phone probably one of the coolest
features of Windows Phone 8.1 is the
ability to run on Android devices and we
have one of the first OEMs committing to
this in q2 2014 which is just around the
corner we're talking about Huawei the
company plans to have their first
handset running both operating systems
in the next couple of weeks and they
find the cool and compelling reason to
do so for them it's like if it only runs
Windows Phone it shouldn't be that
important but if it runs both things
it'll be an immediate sell so they got a
good point now let's talk about Samsung
as you all remember the patents of the
samsung s band and as it turns out this
is pretty much just the fitness tracker
like a Fitbit it doesn't work or do
anything without a phone which is
actually cool for those of you that use
s health this is pretty much just a way
to help s health interpret things better
on you which is great it's a great
feature let's just hope the price tag
speaks the same way but then again we
also have a samsung CEO stating that
there will not be a high-end galaxy s5
what you see right now is what you get
the galaxy s5 is the highest then model
that they're making which is really
interesting as we are still waiting for
that galaxy Jay I think it was her
effort or whatever the name would be
let's see if Samsung does pull it off
because then again they won't pull all
their cards on the table right and
speaking of fitness fraud
Apple has just painted a new type of
pedometer for the ipod that runs on your
wrist and yes there is no ipod that runs
on your risk you all remember the last
generation ipod nano which could be
dubbed that way but Apple never intended
for it to be that way so we are
expecting for apple to launch the iWatch
with a pedometer and obviously have it
be a fitness product that then again
could it really be called the iWatch
could it be that apple's planning just
to build another type of ipod that runs
on your wrist and that's how they're
planning to Brandon stay tuned this
rumors will be coming very soon and
finally for the very annoying news of
the day Facebook has just made it
official that they're planning to milk
the cow as much as they can when it
comes to ads right now it's currently
extremely annoying for you to get all
these ads either on the website or on
the mobile applications and now the
company is planning to give you a video
and this video is actually going to play
as you scroll so let's hope they don't
make it annoying let's hope that there's
a way to mute that as you're scrolling
because hey they have a right to give us
ads they just don't have a right to make
it annoying but that leads me to the
question of the day what is your
favorite social media service which is
your preferred one in my particular case
I'll be honest with you I have
everything but to be honest with you my
favorite one is Instagram you can follow
me on instagram and primary data and
honestly the reason why I like Instagram
is not necessarily for the filters but
because I could actually take a photo
and share it from there to tumblr and
twitter and facebook at the same time
that's the real reason why i like it but
leave us a comment down below which is
your favorite one and friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video was filmed
sure you follow us on parking our
comment subscribe to our youtube channel
as well they also follow me on twitter
Jaime underscore iveta let's give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hey Matt we met up thank you
