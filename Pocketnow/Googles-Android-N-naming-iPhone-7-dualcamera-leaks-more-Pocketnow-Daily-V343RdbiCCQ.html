and naming its Nets version of android
iphone 7 dual cameras get teased showing
that previous leaks might have been fake
and HTC teases world class cameras for
the HTC 10 I'm hi Mary Vanna and isn't
it a bummer when you run out of coffee
and it's barely eight pm this is parking
out daily the official news today begin
with deals those of you interested in a
budget-minded smart phone the Moto G is
currently on sale at B&amp;amp;H and get this
deal you're paying 150 dollars for the
phone but in addition to that you get a
32 gig micro SD card and a twenty dollar
gift card which makes this deal
extremely compelling you can learn more
in the links of the description other
official news come from fossil as the
company has a pretty much shown us that
they have more android wear plans up
their sleeve now we have two new q
android wear smartwatches that look
pretty much like the original though the
price tags are a little bit on the
better side at $275 we are not exactly
sure when to expect these smart watches
or how will they defer from the original
but it seems that leather straps are
pretty much it 46 millimeters in size is
pretty much what we also noticed but we
can't wait to get more official news to
let you know now let's move the
spotlight over to HTC we cannot wait to
see what the company has in store after
the point where we continue noticing
teasers today on twitter the company
lets us know that we can expect a
world-class camera for the HTC 10 now
bear in mind it isn't the first time
that HTC has teased the world-class
camera for their flagship and hasn't
really delivered so we will keep you
posted as soon as we learn more but what
we're getting and speaking of cameras it
seems that some recent leaks of the
iphone 7s dual camera modules might
prove yesterday's leaks of the design a
little wrong seems that the dual camera
modules are for either of the iphone 7
or the iphone 7 plus we're not exactly
sure but we have heard that apple will
be working on this technology for its
next-generation smartphone it's kind of
hard to believe which one is true but
then again
Apple is famous for prototyping and
finally the very hot news that they have
to do with Google as the company's
opinion rewards is now asking users what
name would they recommend to for Android
and and we thought that nutella was
going to be part of that list but it
turns out that it isn't we see names
like Napoleon nori or I don't know even
noodles none of these which are actually
pastries it could be that Google is
moving away from the whole pastry
concept but then again we wonder exactly
what other name options could actually
sound as enticing as a pastry and it
leads me to the question of today what
name do you believe that Google should
bring to Android n should it be Napoleon
or whichever one of these because in my
case I feel it should just be called
Android n please google leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get these news
