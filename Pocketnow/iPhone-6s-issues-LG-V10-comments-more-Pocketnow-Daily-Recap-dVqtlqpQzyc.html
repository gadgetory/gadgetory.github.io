episode a bit earlier you have no idea
what it's like to publish a video every
day buddy do you even sleep dude no do
you I mean I just had a dream where you
taught me how to do calisthenics and
that you dream that too no that's right
it's that time of the week I am Hyneman
event this is pocket now and this is the
vine out daily recap the last week on
Monday the news were of apples winning
streak the company had just announced
its numbers for how many iPhones had
sold over the weekend and I asked you
have you ever thought that apple would
ever stop this winning streak when it
comes to iPhones we have 829 comments we
start with of course it will puto they
will run out of people to sell to and I
do believe so I do believe that at some
point it has to stop because hey we've
got companies like Nokia Motorolla which
were smashing hits years ago no longer
exists I believe it will continue the
iphone 7 will definitely prove that it
will definitely shatter many more
records and here's the thing i think
that apple's got a really interesting
formula we're on the first phone they
have a new design with the old specs
then on the other one they have the same
design but better specifications that's
really worked well for them I wonder if
it'll work for them in the long run as
Samsung phones have been catching up
very quickly I'm really surprised with
these sales numbers I've seen an
enormous decrease in iphones Riley I did
too right now that I was in Vegas I saw
so many people with galaxy phones and
very few people with iphones and that is
a statement that it's the first time
ever in the united states that i've seen
that and it could be the samsung's onto
something we should learn more with
quarter results on tuesday i tried to
condense the google nexus event as much
as I could in about four minutes and I
asked you which was the highlight of the
event for you what did you like the most
we had 629 comments we start with i have
a nexus for not getting android 6th auto
hurts so much you know what hurts even
more that my old xperia ZL is getting
marshmallow i believe or at least the
latest version of lollipop which is much
older than the nexus 4 and not the nexus
4 that is terrible a Nexus device for
the build quality that actually looks
premium Nexus 6p completely stole my
attention you know I wasn't expecting
something so hot to come out
way but they've made a believer out of
me and I hate that word believer in you
guys know why the pixel see is really
interesting you can always trust in
Google to surprise us with something new
not necessarily but yes that pixel see
is the best way to make great design
make an android tablet look good let's
just see if it sells who's google is not
really good at that and what is an
iphone watch without complaints
Wednesday was about those complaints and
I asked you if you were experiencing any
of these we have a thousand and nine
comments we start with yeah I have a
problem I can't afford it and that is
the reality of a lot of people do true
it is a problem battery life on the 6s
sucks going back to Android and I can't
believe that dude I mean have you told
me i'm going back to Windows Phone and
yes battering life is epic but come on
man which android phone has great
battery life I know very few got a
problem with your iphone in the unlikely
situation that you do and the simple
restart can't fix it you have a major
benefit that's Android users don't have
which is the apple store and true this
is a major benefit from Apple we have a
problem just walk into the store they'll
probably either give you a new one or
fix the problem for you which is great
the problem is that Apple stores aren't
available all around the world on
Thursday we had LG's event they
announced their v10 and the new watch
urbane second edition with its LTE
capabilities I asked you what product
that you like most or both and what you
think about them and we have 4 18
comments we start with LG v10 looks
badass and I guess you do like it i like
the v10 though LG could have done better
than 80 wait for a phone they called
super premium and you know i don't see
anything wrong with the snapdragon 808 i
do obviously note the snapdragon 810 is
the best processor according to them
sadly hey I do understand why they
stayed away you remember the G flex 2
came with a Snapdragon 810 because of
the bad publicity and heating I do
understand why they moved away but me 10
second screen is a cool idea but it's in
a bad position it's hard to reach if it
was on the side or the bottom I would
would be better and you know I do agree
Michael Fisher does agree as well it is
a good concept but I think that they
could have done a better job with I
don't know a curve or something or at
the bottom at the vessel I think they
could have done a better job of true at
least you would have the
option other phones don't and finally
Friday we were surprised with the fact
that it seems that the iphone success is
water resistant or waterproof even
though Apple didn't announce it and I
asked you if it's important for you to
buy a phone that is we have a 590
comments we start with so we can call
this iphone waterproofing Watergate god
I was waiting for this one I wish I had
a waterproof phone I could watch you in
the shower that didn't sound right not
really usually phones that are
waterproof and shock absorbent are ugly
and thick just like me and sorry to hear
that about you buddy but it is true also
these phones are really ugly but then
again you have sony phone than samsung
phones doing a far better job or at
least just sony now and i feel that that
is the way to go bones need to be used
you're out on the street you get wet
when it raised or whatever or people
just drop them out of the blue it
happens it's normal and I feel that it's
a requirement apartment that I've wanted
to see in phones happen years ago and
only Sony's been able to mail it's just
sad that Sony hasn't been able to grow
more in order to make that competing
need for other companies but I do wish
Sony the best that I do hope that they
figure it out because I got in the end
it's all benefits for the user that's it
for the bargain out daily recap thank
