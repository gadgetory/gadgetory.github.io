weekly hello and welcome to episode 02
three of the pocket not weekly the
once-a-week podcast from pocketnow.com
where we discuss what's hot and what's
cool in the world of mobile technology
from windows phone to android to iphone
and sometimes even blackberry I'm your
host Michael Fisher senior editor at
pocket now and i'm joined possibly for
the last time by our managing editor
anton d Naja good day to use her good
morning to you guys i hope you take a
good look at the Sun because if the
mains are right is gonna get ugly it's
going to get really really brutal here
on the last last pocket now weekly and
it's not just add anton sharing the
airwaves with us we also have a man who
is closer possibly to the center of the
destruction of the universe the man with
the nexus collection Joe Levi the
android guy happy last day on earth to
you sir good morning good morning and
remember the Mayans they left that
they're not here anymore they took off
when they knew the world was going to
end that's true so they have nothing at
stake anymore there's this is nothing to
lose the thing is if you've tuned in at
all to any of the news channels or news
organizations that need to get
desperately trying to fill column inches
is all kinds of talk about the end of
the end of the world do you guys
remember where you were when you first
heard this that's this Mayan myth we are
going to tie this into smartphones in a
second I just want to know no no no I
just don't know where you I don't know
it's been it's been circulating around
here in Europe for like four or five six
years I don't even remember yeah oh yeah
what about you Joe at about the same
time frame for you I want to say that I
was standing on the top of a pyramid but
no alas i think i saw out on twitter and
if you saw it on twitter it must be true
and if you saw them who else wants me in
the past three years or so see I I
watched a documentary on National
Geographic or something like that in my
eighth grade global studies class and I
remember hearing like December 21st 2012
and I
rotor town on a slip of paper so I
wouldn't forget it and I was like this
is when the world is ending it's very
much like what I did a couple of weeks
ago I was setting myself a reminder not
to plan anything for today after tonight
good idea don't you think that that
given Tony those questions for you don't
you think that given our impending
demise then maybe we should have
tomorrow off well but I have an old a
calendar appointment it says busy and
out of the office see as you see fit
I'll tell you what it go ahead and
invite me to that to that event and i'll
go ahead and create here great that's
excellent so I'm wondering why all these
companies who run like extreme sports
and whatnot have not been just
advertising get your bucket list done
and out of the way he they should be
full this whole week leading until
tomorrow they should be full with people
just finishing off their bucket list
yeah I feel like you know I feel like a
lot of them have I bet like you know
especially physical fitness companies
like the guys who do tough mudder or
whatever or like come to this apocalypse
run you know and they've added a whole
bunch of really horrible obstacles to it
i don't know i'm not a not a physically
physical fitness dude so the funny thing
is that i think it was the beginning of
this week so one of these days i was at
a supermarket at a superstore and at the
cashier and it was a queue of course a
five or six or seven people and i was
second in line and the third guy just
stabs me on the shoulder and he's like
are you also preparing for the end of
days and i was like no I'm shopping for
Christmas so that's awesome I I want to
tie this in before we do an announcement
here what Tony had a good suggestion for
for making this somewhat relevant to our
audience and I love your initial
question Tony which was um what
smartphone would you want to carry for
the end of days if you could only carry
one and then you kind of tried to talk
about apps I don't want I wet unless you
want to but I really want to hear what
device you would want with you as the
mall is ending around you I probably
take my full-sized iPad because he's got
huge battery life and even though it's a
little bit heavy
I think I can rely on it for two or
three weeks would moderate day-to-day
use Zev assess the radio energy of one
of the preview and i don't think i will
have anybody to call if this thing goes
south that's a that's a solid point
that's it that's a good call where I
will be tweeting facebooking like an
animal great good go that's right jus
tony is going to go on a massive tweet
rampage tomorrow so everyone get ready
for that if the millions were right
exactly if not then it's just gonna be
really quiet girls are you I'm thinking
we've got to have some some device that
has the most bands possible because i
can't see every cellular band going down
and you still got to talk to people you
still have can you imagine all the
instagramming that's going on during
this hail storm the zombies whatever it
may be the sunset hashtag is just going
to explode yeah literally literally
explode oh yeah yeah I want all the
bands I can and I'm probably going to
use my little tip you know when you're
in a crowded place and you just can't
get a good LTE or hspa+ connection you
drop it back to 2g and bam you are
faster than everybody so you might want
to drop that back to 27 megahertz am do
I got my ham radio to fall back on so
yeah there we go see it is abba solid
answers the thing from me would be
durability right because I'm gonna have
to be running shock waves and like you
know driving recklessly and all this
kind of stuff and possibly falling into
large bodies of water so i would i would
take even though they're still I think
all running like gingerbread or
something I would take one of the the
verizon wireless casio phones the really
brutally like rug guys complain about
Bill updates exactly yeah that's what I
want to do for the energy i want to
complain that i'm stuck on gingerbread
but at least my phone still works
because it's a brick and i still don't
know how to pronounce it I'd the ghazan
or the jizz one or their geez whatever
the casio brand name is anyway that's
that's where we're sitting for the end
of the world be careful we're gonna lose
our safe tag calling the casio phone I
was bit about two minutes ago I was
gonna make a joke about how I can't wait
to live tweet yourself
you know what go live tweet yourself go
live tweet that's awesome that that's
gonna be a live tweet just watch for
that perfect I'm ready just do it right
now announcements did Tony do we want to
have we yet found the perfect match for
pocket now or do we want to remind
everyone that we are still hiring I
don't know because honestly we had so
many applications that I'm having a hard
time going through all of them I have
probably crunched through approximately
fifty to sixty percent but the more the
merrier as as I said in my post we are
looking for somebody and we are picky so
i might not be able to answer everybody
that doesn't mean i don't thank you for
your application but we are looking for
quality and the sure why not please make
him an announcement again and absolutely
then with then in fact pocket now is is
still hiring there is a post on this
podcast post at pocket not accounting
click on that link and or there's a link
on this posted anyway you click on the
link now so you'll forget to put it
there anyway yeah exactly right now it's
it's um looking at it right now it's in
there here's the thing i think a lot of
people kind of disqualify themselves
from like they don't disqualify
themselves from contests because i'm not
that much of a jerk right we don't
disqualify people just ferb randomly
screw it up but if if all the details
are in the post like if the hiring post
has all the information you need but
like you tweet at me or you send me an
email asking a question that's answered
in the pod in the in the post i'm kind
of less inclined to to recommend you
right i mean you guys you remember those
in elementary school or like do they
ever give you that trick test where the
test is like 20 questions long and the
directions at the top are like read all
the directions before beginning the test
and the last direction is like only
answer question 20 you know what I'm
talking about I get it but I never had
the one of those yeah I'd want to be in
fourth grade one of those fooled me and
I was I felt like a dunce for the rest
of my school career I said if they ever
break out that test again I'm gonna beat
it anyway the point is follow directions
uh yeah it's pretty much like a RT f
m.o.r.e yes yes really effing manual
exactly it is is that the new tablet
from Microsoft that has a radio tuner
building
that's what I thought initially I was
like what are we talking about some kind
of wide band instrument alright anyway
we have we have some things to cover
we've shuffled up the run down just a
little bit today we want to start with
Android because of our guest of honor on
the airwaves today and Joe Levi has been
running the cyanogenmod installing cm10
or variations of CM on various devices I
think you were you have a video up from
the past week where you're running it on
the gs3 but you also you got cyanogenmod
attend on one running on the HTC g2 is
that correct yes the t-mobile g2 also
known as the HTC vision that's kind of
this successor to the nexus one that had
a slide-out keyboard that everybody said
the hinges were gonna break on yeah that
was one with the special hinges right
where they had a funny design that were
both like swing arms yeah it was kind of
a lift out and all right and just really
weird design people thought it was
flimsy well here we are in retrospect
that design is rock solid there's no
problems with the hinges so take that so
this is like a two-year-old phone at
least possibly a three year old phone
yeah it's it's getting up there yeah i
think it's it's only two years old i'm
looking at the specs now and it's been
announced / launched in october 2010
really ok yeah so just over two but
still still an old phone and the specs
are crappy yeah right and the benchmark
show it so first of all this is not an
official cyanogenmod 10.1 this is
someone who took CM 10.1 from the you
know the cyanogenmod repositories and
applied a vendor overlay to it to make
it work on the HTC g2 and it works on
the HTC g2 it's beautiful it's fluid it
it's every bit as fast as I remember
gingerbread on it and wow just don't
benchmark it and you'll probably be
happy with it now do those poor
benchmark scores affect its usability in
terms and outside the UI like I mean if
okay you've got the launcher be able to
scroll and you've got you know you've
got fluidity and the notification shade
and stuff but can you play like anything
more advanced than angry birds on it can
you can use
Netflix for example can you do that kind
of stuff yeah yeah I didn't have any
problem with videos and whatnot I didn't
do an awful lot of intensive testing
with gaming but the only thing that I
really found as a detractor other than
you know just rough around the edge of
stuff that you'd expect from an alpha of
a nightly was that apps took longer to
open and close and to switch between
then what I'm used to do and I'm running
on the Nexus 4 so I'm used to that being
almost before I even want to switch apps
it switches apps so very very fast this
it was just painfully slow but it worked
and it did it and believe it or not
jelly bean looks really really good on
that hardware I was surprised you know
what I'm not surprised because it takes
it a lot of cues from the first next
from the nexus one when it's closed mean
I don't know when it's open i think it's
a little bit kind of a cumbersome device
but i bet a jelly bean derivative looks
pretty good on that on that hardware i
do want to say though that it completely
irrelevant but i think an alpha of a
nightly is probably one of my new
favorite fake album titles so thank you
for that that that's gonna be your band
let's go now yes I want to ask you
something Joe it's the plan for 2013
we're gonna make a band go ahead tell me
I'm sorry if the CM 10.1 basically
Android jelly bean runs smoothly on the
g2 with its specifications then can you
how should I say this can you explain
maybe why is Sony not updating phones
like the Xperia U which specifications
whys are at least as good as the g2 nice
just for the sake of the example the
t-mobile g2 if you guys don't remember
runs an 800 megahertz processor and the
Xperia U for instance in this particular
example runs a 1 gigahertz processor ram
is the same 512 internal storage the
same gigabytes right so there are really
two things you've got can the hardware
handle the OS and do so in a manner
that's going to be acceptable to the end
users the end users
are you and me and our listener might be
the different end users than sony or HTC
or Samsung has in mind when they're
advertising their product and the number
one thing that they don't want to do
with a product is release something that
then they have to spend more time to
support that's more time that's more
money for them they're not making any
more money off of that product they
already sold it so anything they do to
it is just cutting into the the profit
that they've already made on it it does
take quite a bit of time to know to
shoehorn new stuff with old drivers and
get it all working together and there
have been quite a few changes in in the
driver architecture and whatnot from way
back when to where we are right now so
more than anything that the hardware can
run it they just don't want to run it
and possibly have a less than what they
have right now user experience this is
this is interesting because we all know
that jelly bean has project butter and
and my head project butter which which
makes Android fluid would it will come
down to this the same specifications one
phone on the left running official
supported Android two points on thing
and on the right Android jelly bean with
project butter one would say that
project butter would make it smoother
and the experience would be better than
the official to point something build at
least that's what happened in my head as
long as you have a minimum threshold of
hardware that's absolutely true and I
think what Sony's doing is they're just
evaluating it saying we don't think that
this device meets that threshold to to
have that same smooth and fluid user
interface that other people may be used
to and then their devices get a black
guy and their brand would probably get a
black eye too so go ahead and go to the
open source community and route and have
your project butter and Sony doesn't
have to worry about it and the last
question i promise now i'm reading my
own post and didn't recall well so the
Xperia U Xperia needle or my row and
xperia tipo or type
and of course Xperia Sola will not be
upgraded beyond android 4.0 so that that
leaves me to understand that android 4.0
be running these now why can't they run
4.1 or 4.2 I mean they are point
releases or is it just that Sony is just
this is a marketing bull and they don't
want the latest on a one year old
halliburtt hardware or a couple of
months old hardware 4.1 and 4.2 the the
different flavors of jelly bean are a
little bit more than just a point
release they're doing quite a bit more I
would have expected that we would have
started out you know with a 4.5 when we
came along with project butter I felt
that it was more than just a point one
release 4.2 would have been just a point
release up from that because there's not
a lot that's different or changed so
there's there's some behind-the-scenes
technological stuff without going into
terrible detail that that's quite a bit
different from ice cream sandwich that
said I think it's more just the money
they don't they've already been working
on a cream sandwich they've got sunk
dollars over there they don't want to
Reese pin that money over with 4.1 4.2
to quote unquote start the process all
over again okay thank you i if you guys
have similar questions head which would
run answer just like me there's your
answer four-point-oh jelly be a
four-point-oh ice cream sandwich is i
think it's just not worth for them to
upgrade it to 4.1 and have respect case
yeah you know this conversation has made
me think of like the experiences I've
had on jelly bean with my Nexus 7 and
Jaime's Galaxy Nexus which he was kind
enough to send me for a side project and
you know it so bothersome to me that
they spent all this time optimizing
jelly bean and and implementing project
butter and of course it was not wasted
effort i mean really is buttery but
after a couple weeks and once again this
is why we have series like after the
buzz after a couple weeks when that that
kind of new hotness wears off and you've
installed about 50 apps and you've used
the thing and it's got like four days of
uptime you can still get the thing to
lag pretty easily and here specifically
i'm talking about the nexus 7 joe i
don't know if this is true in your neck
says four but on the Galaxy Nexus in the
nexus 7 I can do this and it so you know
it's frustrating and I understand that
that's going to happen to any device no
matter how smooth and well optimized it
is i mean i can get i can eat if i try
really hard i can even get a windows
phone tube to lag but it's just so
frustrating when your expectations have
been set so high with something even you
know with something called project
butter so I don't know it's just I guess
I guess that's just my little moment to
shed a little tear for the fact that you
eyes are never going to be perfect you
just have to do whatever I do every
night I turn off my devices and power
them on in the morning and there goes
2322 our up time no leg ooh that one way
to do it isn't it that's a good idea I'm
gonna do I mirror your sentiments with
the Nexus 7 and this kind of goes back
to to the concern that Tony was bringing
up of the three current Nexus devices
the nexus 7 the nexus 10 in the nexus 4
of those three all of them running the
same version down to the sub point four
point two point one the only one that
I've ever seen noticeable annoying lag
on is the nexus 7 so why do you suppose
it is is there a hardware explanation
for that I have to assume that it's just
the the slightly lower spec of the
hardware that we have in the nexus 7
compared to the other two devices that
is somehow being slow and laggy i'm
going to try Tony's trick and do a cold
shutdown every morning or every night to
see if that takes care of it to a
nighttime shutdown yes pretty much the
same i bet that you're muting your
devices overnight so you're not reading
emails overnight so why just not turn
them off nighttime shutdown that's gonna
be a band name nighttime shutdown and
alpha what is it alpha of a nightly it's
gonna be our first out okay glee survive
tomorrow's if we survive tomorrow yes
we're gonna play we're gonna play the
ruins well that's awesome thank you for
your free two thoughts on that joe is as
i was telling the team i've been elbows
deep in the TFS stuff all weeks i
haven't had a chance to look at any of
this
it's good to hear your your first hand
impressions of running cm on these
various devices would you let me just
before we have to the next thing would
you would you either of you consider
using a very old device with a with a
new CM version as your daily driver for
a little bit this just puts me in mind
of all these these questions that we get
from people who still want to hang onto
physical keyboards who still have a
favorite old device that they really
miss and they wish they could carry it
but it doesn't have the newest software
like if you could flash a current CM
build onto any older device what would
it be for you guys do you mean Joey I
don't imagine you would run around with
the g2 by choice uh yeah you know I'm
one of the people I started out with the
g1 and loved it because of its physical
keyboard and it's funky flip out screen
and why do we always have to funky flip
out screen android i went to the nexus
one after that and really hated not
having a physical keyboard which is why
i went with the g2 after that now since
then keyboards have in create a V
improved the soft keyboards have
improved screens have gotten bigger so
my big meaty thumbs can type on them
well but just met even just setting it
up flip and open that keyboard having
the screen auto rotate and I can type
right there there's something nice about
having that physical keyboard so yeah to
answer your question if I had to go back
in time and pick a phone to to use a
daily driver it will probably be this g2
Wow alright well that's pretty cool I've
told you have an old device you'd like
to go back to not necessarily but to
answer your question I think that it all
depends on your use use it scenario if
you're like me and all you do on your
phone and tablet is browse the web
basically work on your email calendar
contacts tweet Facebook and do the light
stuff without playing games or something
which which would drain probably the
last percentage of the CPU I don't see
why not if you have an old device which
you love and for which you probably
cared until now if you don't do heavy
stuff sure go on
with the latest version of Android if
you will not have problems with such
lightweight utage if you are playing
games then probably it's time to change
your phone yeah I carry around a
separate gaming device well and
ironically that's what we were doing
with those older devices because we
didn't have these high-end high CPU
games and apps it was all just it's a
smart phone which means it's a phone
that has email and web browsing and some
other stuff with it now we kind of
overlooked oh there's a phone in there
too you know you it's a gaming console
with a phone whenever we're doing a
review and I'm like I'm like firing up
the test notes I mean there has been
more than one occasion where I'm
finishing up the test notes portion I'm
like wow there's a whole lot of text in
there all right moving on to the next
thing which I feel like I'm forgetting
something and all of a sudden I'll be
like oh crap I didn't talk a bit about
phone calls like I didn't I didn't
discuss the calling situation also I
have to go back in and be like oh yeah
by the way here's all my call notes on
voice calling it's it's true have you
ever gotten to that point in a review
where you're just finishing it all up
it's scripted it's it's it's ready to go
and you you have that sinking feeling
and you realize not only have you
forgotten to mention any of the phone
call notes and specs but you also forgot
to even make a phone call on it because
you're so busy using it as a typing
device or it a mini tablet that happened
very recently on yes out with the deity
vests which we'll talk about in a little
bit yeah I had to make a series of phone
calls in different network conditions
over the course of about a very short
span of time it was like less than than
than half a day because I yeah because I
didn't I had started out with all the
frankly the more important stuff yeah I
think I think this is something specific
to you guys in the u.s. you don't really
necessarily love to talk on the phone
your texting and messaging no well
around here and especially in my case
and people who are in my inner circle we
are talking like 2-3 hours on the phone
Wow daily so that means i'm having like
5 or 6 20 minutes conversation every day
so i cannot miss something like that
we prefer to talk on a fight it's of
course it's free to talk with in the
same operator you don't pay for calling
you don't pay for being called so sure
why not let's talk you know I gotta tell
you about you know that's pretty common
you know talking with the same operator
you're like oh wait are you want sprint
yeah I'm one sprint okay well let's
let's talk and we won't use our minutes
but sprint did something really
interesting a couple years ago or where
they were like hey unlimited mobile to
mobile now doesn't just mean calling
from a sprint phone to a sprint phone
now anytime you call a cell phone you
don't use your minutes it doesn't matter
if it's verizon if it's AT&amp;amp;T any other
carrier and we took it one step further
and the blighted the landlines to you
guys did yeah i mean not us but here we
can we can talk to learn lines without
using up your minutes you're you you're
charging your bill so basically you're
talking about unlimited calling aren't
you yeah yeah okay well that's much
simpler isn't it yeah let's talk about
devices let's talk about some things
that i don't frankly i'm just annoyed by
and I I think saner heads will have
better opinions to offer about these
Samsung is about to drop to Android
devices possibly with you there's a
question mark on this headline Samsung
is possibly going to unveil the galaxy
frame and mwc and then Samsung has also
announced the galaxy grand which we'll
talk about in a second Tony what is this
galaxy frame and why do I care I don't
think you will care at all and as I
don't think I don't think you care about
the galaxy grand either but just for the
sake of conversation it is rumored that
mwc will bring a galaxy frame now the
fishy thing of about this is that the
sources which are I think Sam mobile
sources say that this phone will be
serial or model number GT s6810 now I've
done some research and the GE T s6810 is
referenced as a galaxy ace variety so
this will either be a follow-up to the
Ace or it will be something completely
unrelated now what I think we can play
until tomorrow guessing what the galaxy
frame will mean mm can
be a bezel this phone maybe I don't
think Samsung will introduce something
like that on a mid-ranger but there's
also theory now yeah that's true but I'm
more inclined to agree with Jaime and
that we have a galaxy camera now and
this galaxy frame will probably be an
android-powered photo frame on your desk
I mean just imagine that so it's going
to have a kickstand on the back up but
and it's also going to have one of those
little inverted keyhole things so you
can hang it on the wall probably with
Wi-Fi or USB attachments report or micro
SD card support and why not but that's
very close to tablet territory well and
they're also gonna release it with an
hspa+ variety so you don't have to look
out setting up your your Wi-Fi with it
and you just pay another you know what
30 40 bucks a month to stream your pick
let's do it and when you go to verizon
to ask for a contract for your Galaxy
camera are you get an additional
contract for a galaxy frame sure yeah
well you exactly why not throw carrier
contracts and everything and you know
what what why am I surprised at this
possibility I think you're spot on I
think I'm is speculation is pretty cool
there but you know it's it's it's just
such a shame that the galaxy brand
continues to be applied further and
further afield from its original mark
when you mention the galaxy ace and I
remember I mean when I first heard about
the galaxy ace I guess last year
whenever it was it was kind of released
I was excited because it was a smaller
device and sometimes I like smaller
smartphones but it had the galaxy brand
which at the time wasn't so diluted so I
was like oh well what is is Samsung
making a smaller device you know that
has really awesome specs I mean that's
what I was excited about and of course
no that wasn't the case at all it was
just Samsung deciding that they were
gonna throw the word galaxy on
everything yeah well if this is going to
be a frame will see it at NBC but you my
friend have better chances at CES which
is a consumer electronic show to see the
galaxy jet maybe a jet water dish washer
machine with in from the galaxy family
running Android hey ya could definitely
gotta find the the new the new galaxy
shower head
I do have a samsung natural gas dryer
downstairs so em that's a thought Alexei
they didn't call the galaxy but it's a
little bit longer and then as well yeah
the new version that's gonna send status
updates and notifications to your
Android device that's whenever you have
some accounts dryer yeah exactly it's
just letting you know that the permanent
press cycle is complete yeah you saved
22 dekha therms today first use of deca
terms on the podcast thank you Joe you
win the prize let's get let's get the
galaxy grand out of the way this the
this is the same exact story I mean it's
I'm looking at it right now it is it's a
galaxy s3 body with really really
underpowered specs it looks like but I
mean they're not too bad we're looking
at of what a 1.2 gigahertz processor a
gig of ram and eight gigs of storage
with an eight megapixel camera android
for 10 12 and a 2100 mega milliamp hour
battery I guess the big disappointment
here is what is the display right oh it
depends everybody said that this phone
was targeted and aimed at senior
citizens and I can totally see myself
using this in 30 years from now holding
the galaxy brand in my left hand and a
paper bag in my right hands sitting on a
bench and tweeting about stuff I
shouldn't tweet at that age but
seriously know if this is aimed at
senior people es larger text they
probably won't see pixels they'll
probably won't see fonts which are below
a certain threshold so yeah why not let
them have their galaxy this is a 55 inch
diagonal wvga display I mean it's gotta
look terrible but but I guess you're
right if it's targeted properly if it's
if it is indeed the Jitterbug of the
Samsung world then no bit or the knot of
the galaxy world rather I don't and I'm
not oh there goes the surface with some
sorry team ok yeah I don't want to talk
about the galaxy grand anymore can we
just Jodi do you don't have any good
food great feelings about that thing to
do you want to revive I'm just
wondering why they didn't call the
Samsung Galaxy Grandma and Grandpa
bazinga I have just one additional note
if he ever since the galaxy s3 and
through the galaxy note 2 and now with
the galaxy grand and with the galaxy s3
mini Samsung is reusing the exact same
outer aspect and design policies for its
bones yeah so I'm inclined to say that
Samsung is pulling on HTC when HTC back
in 2011 you use the same exact design
for all of its phones now I'm not sure
how this how the market will react to
this but people are already getting
bored of this design which was a good
design back in May when they introduced
the S free but they have to change
something for the s4 or for the 2013
lineup you know that is a really really
solid point tell me and it's I want to
touch on it with the with the achieve
ass thing um that would be an awesome
segue but I don't want I don't want to
jump over this piece of news but thank
you can I come back to that in like one
minute I just want to make everyone
aware that because I wasn't aware until
is making the podcast outlined the
Google Play is doing their calendar
countdown right now and what is this is
like a deal this is like a discount
thing we've got titles marked down to
like ten cents each and some in some
cases and it's running from what is it
December 17th a couple days ago through
January one with one day deals going on
and I guess like the first the first
days thing was a $35 booking credit on a
hotel tonight which I Joe I think you
and I were just talking about via email
yes yes we were stay tuned for some
information about that particular app in
an upcoming piece yeah I I think it's
cool i like it when app stores run you
know run promotions like this because HP
did it with the web west to the kind of
jumpstart that and I know Windows Phone
had its own kind of discounted app days
and stuff and does this happen often and
I just don't notice it on the google
play store it's happened a lot more
frequently than a lot of people may have
realized it seems to be getting more and
more mired down with all the new
offerings of different stuff you know
your book
your magazines your movies your TV and
play right yeah apps you always knew hey
I've got this free app grape or I've got
this Chi bap great and now it's kind of
it's not all ten cents is it free is it
not as a it's getting kind of lost but I
think Google is reacting to what Amazon
is doing with their app store where
you've got a free app a day that just
entices you just go over to their store
and so you hate what's on for free today
and it hopefully will drive people to to
get in there and peripheral e drive up
other sales as well I don't know lemon
Don on chicken and the egg story but the
you guys probably know but there are
probably people lots of people who don't
know that Apple had this running for a
couple of years now but here's the catch
it's not running to my knowledge in the
US Apple has a campaign which is called
12 days of Christmas or 12 days to
Christmas which is valid in the UK and I
think it starts the first or the second
day of Christmas through January one
where you can get basically free apps
books movies you name it for free but
this is in the UK and I haven't seen
this in the US so this begs for a
question one why not in the US and two
heads up to google for beating Apple to
the punch punch on that yeah I know yeah
it's fun to see these big app stores
doing it where you don't like you know
it's like what why are you guys what do
you feel the need to do this is it to
keep the devs happy because it's not for
increased mindshare everyone knows about
the App Store on iOS and most people
know about the google play store for I
think it's marketing here because google
/ apple / amazon are one hundred percent
in control of what titles they are
pushing and in what they so say you have
ten days that will be 10 software titles
or maybe 5 to software titles and some
other content now getting that inner
circle getting on that list but i think
it's it's it's it all comes down to
getting to having a relationship between
you as a developer and the application
store because it will expose you to lots
of user
who'll probably either purchase yours
other software titles or maybe even pay
for an upgrade if they get the
application on your phone for the first
time that's it yeah that's a solid point
I think there are a lot of layers to it
that I that you don't really understand
until you dig deeply into it and it's
like okay but now that's a solid
explanation i'll buy that by having
talked to you having talked to some
developers that have been in that
situation where their app was featured
free on the amazon appstore what not a
lot of times that comes out just as a
complete surprise to them sometimes
they're sent an email saying hey we're
going to do this but the people that
I've talked to in the developer
community that they think it's a
two-edged sword yes it gets them noticed
yes it gets there you know their product
and their brand in front of a whole new
set of eyes but those eyes then need
support and you've got a whole bunch of
new devices that you you may not have
sold to before that now you've got to go
in and bug fix and you didn't make any
money to to to all that so it's a lot of
extra work for hopefully some marketing
that will carry you through so opinions
are it's really mixed from the people
who write the apps whether or not that
kind of marketing pushes is worth it or
not here's a question for you guys you
are both developers for whatever
platform and I'm running that platform
and Joe you've got a 199 application and
Michael you've got a point 99
application and your install base is
about fifteen thousand users 15,000
devices I write an email to you guys and
I'm saying this I want to feature your
apps and I want to give them for free
for one day the question is are you
agreeing to this because I exposing your
applications to more people or will you
just reply to me to go somewhere else
because you are losing money and you
prefer to sell your application too much
less people but still gain some money
that's the thing right I feel like I
would be totally on board with making a
little less money if i get my app in
front of a whole bunch of eyeballs you
know I know it's not quite the same
thing
as a manufacturer brand name situation
because I think a lot of people don't
know development houses and a lot of
people don't know individual developer
names but there are a couple apps that i
have on my android phones where it's
like I've they've updated frequently
enough for I have used them frequently
enough for I've seen them in the place
for frequently enough that it's like oh
I know that developer name and what else
has he done you know a couple apps have
surpassed that threshold for me so I'm
like oh yeah let me see more from that
developer so if i can if i can get my
title in front of more eyeballs and you
play that stupid numbers game and even
if point five percent of people only
that's tiny sliver of the population
learns my my name and looks at my other
titles i think that's a good thing I
think it's liked anything else that you
have to build very slowly like you know
audiences for for television shows or
audiences for anything Joe that's a hard
question for me to answer because I I'm
in that situation I i haven't sold
15,000 copies of my app and my app yes
you did and my example he did well I
know but I'm talking for the real world
I have a nap and I do sound like a buck
99 nobody's saying yeah telecoms name is
Joe ojos application yeah let's primp
Joe's app I've given the what's happened
in the news recently I don't know if
it's that good so I'll just will mention
about Josette this is the new TV show
that we're making in 2013 pimp jose app
there there you go so just really short
shout out to all of the families in
connecticut that are going through pain
and lost morning right now our thoughts
and prayers are definitely with you my
my app follows one of my side hobbies
and that's firearms for self-defense and
i have an app that has articles that are
regular everyday people who have used a
firearm to stop a crime to save a life
to to save someone from that that pain
in agony i'm not advocating that we do
anything in the light of what's happened
in Connecticut but that that's my app so
as as lightly as i can say that
it's my app that's what it does let's so
it's an aggregator basically and and yes
how long ago did you write the app and
what's what's it's like you know mmm a
sales figures been like and I don't want
to ask you for permission I excuse me
for specifics and stuff like that but I
if you haven't that's for this person I
don't ask you for your permission or
another no no I'm just curious as to how
long it's been on the market and and how
happy you've been with its organic
growth the app has been out there about
a year now it consumes articles that run
on one of my websites so so it's not
just aggregating from from new sources
it's actually stuff I have to put time
and effort into to to write the article
cite the sources and whatnot I've got
shy of a thousand installs on it I
haven't spent a single cent to to
advertise it I think people that are in
that that are into that will just
naturally organically find it and those
who aren't won't those who aren't
specifically looking for it won't and
that way you know I realize it's a
polarizing subject so I don't want to be
in your face with it if if this is a
topic that appeals to you then you'll
find it and I'm happy making I think
I've made like three hundred four
hundred dollars off it so far which is
that's great almost enough to cover for
the development costs and she's gonna
say you must be about ready to break
even it just about yes d have you ever
this is the last question I'll ask about
this because we do have to jump into
Windows Phone have you ever considered
developing an app for a different
platform because this is the question I
always ask yes in fact I'm a Microsoft
developer by profession and I have all
of the tools that I need to write an app
for both for Windows and Windows Phone I
haven't done that yet because it's still
kind of settling down they don't put a
mortgage here that's cool on the other
side I just have heartache about Apple
taking thirty percent and charging what
is it a hundred bucks a year for the
privilege of having an account to
publish stuff in their store think of
all the iPads and the iphones yeah so so
me with my particular
app I don't think my demographic is
going to be realized as well on iOS as
it is on Android there's just a
different mindset between the two user
groups and I think android better better
addresses that for the my target
audience but yes I have considered it I
would like to have it just so i can say
go out and get the app it's available on
the top three platforms and you know
then i can retire but you know it's just
a hobby and I don't see retirement fit
from that coming anytime soon well it's
it's it's good to hear what it's like on
that side like Goldman things yes honey
this is the time i ask you how is the
samsung achieve s yes it is okay and i
delete the script off now yes yes you
can go ahead and take that off for you
of your run are very cute the we're
gonna jump into Windows Phone here and
the ax t vas review just went up about
10 minutes before we started recording
the podcast so this is new this is hot
and fresh and awesome a commenter I
think our first commenter said who's a
frequent commenter I just can't see him
right now because of the page won't load
we said are you guys the first the first
US side within a TV s review the truth
is were not we were beaten up we were
beaten by engadget by by a little while
but as good open okie oh thank you we
but we are one of the first certainly
and it is it feels good to have a device
in a timely fashion and I have to we
have to thank samsung for that because
they were really great about getting us
the device very quickly and I'm coming
off of maybe 72 to 96 hours of total
just kind of intense time with the
device i think i've left I've love lost
some sleep as a result of just sitting
in bed with the phone and and and
traveling across Greater Boston with the
device and oh my goodness it's amazing
Tony sent me an e-mail this morning you
know je and you know I don't you want to
want to want to detail that I was I was
I sent Michael an email after after
reading the draft of the tv's review it
was probably five minutes before it went
live and I was like hey Michael why is
the atif s can we okay spoiler alert the
achieve s scored eight point five in our
review and the Nokia Lumia 920
regardless if it's of a mtng or the
international version scored 8.3 and I
was like okay with all the PureView
things and everything all the hype about
nokia why is the Divas at 8.5 and the
Lumia 920 at 8.3 exactly and and it's a
totally valid question and actually when
Tony sent me that message I was kind of
half awake and so I was like wow why is
that what's going on and then I kind of
had myself away for 20 seconds I'm like
what did you do did you mess up self and
then I was like no no self I did not
because despite the fact that i think
the Lumia 920 has a more innovative
design despite the fact that the 920 has
a far superior camera specific
particularly in night modes the atif s
is a much better device for power users
or anyone who wants added flexibility in
usage and that is because of the thing
that everyone groans about about the
windows phone 8x from HTC about the
Lumia 920 from from Nokia these high-end
devices from two big-name manufacturers
have excluded removable battery and
expandable storage and Samsung has
brought that with deity vests they've
got an a micro SDXC card slot in there
that can you know take I mean
theoretically I think that that standard
can go up to two terabytes on the card
size but I'm sure that there's some is
there a windows phone 8 limitation does
anybody know there's some software
limitation windows phone 8 that I think
prevents it from going above a certain
threshold but you can throw is probably
a 64 gig card in there and be okay and
64 gigs on top of a 32 gig at yvettes
internal storage mean that's a lot of
storage you can carry around with you
and you can swap cards on the fly and
the same thing with the battery the
battery is 2,300 milliamp hours which is
great and the battery life to begin with
is fantastic but you can also carry
around a spare battery with you and swap
it in if that one does die
for your ready for your day to be over
and these are things you can't do with
either of the flagships from the other
manufacturers so while I have great
respect for the 8x and the 920 and while
I love my own 920 the deity vests
definitely I think deserves a higher
score on those metrics because of this
because of that and because of the
larger display which is quite beautiful
it's the same panel as on the galaxy s3
and you know the camera is the same
module is on the galaxy s3 so all these
kind of the people who said well this is
like a galaxy s3 for windows phone
that's pretty accurate it is that it is
but you know and this is kind of it's a
shame that this segue didn't work before
because would've been great because Sony
were talking about how Samsung is like
if you like waiting they build right is
like a variation on this theme and
that's entirely true but on the achieve
s they've managed to do it in a way that
that is slightly different it's not I
agree i think i wrote in the review it
was like looked does it sort of look
like samsung isn't really trying with
this yes it's a variation it's nothing
that's going to blow the doors off but
looking at the Windows Phone landscape
as a whole in 2012.the atif s is the
most different of them by being the most
conservative you know you don't have
these kind of blown out crazy colors and
then fun soft touch and like weird
polycarbonate it's like now this is a
phone that's pretty typical looking and
it happens to run Windows Phone 8 the
only thing that's really stand out about
it is that the battery door which is
incredible I mean I've never seen better
fake metal it sounds like a backhanded
compliment but it's totally not it's
really amazing looking and I was showing
it to my uh it's am I saying this I i
think i am sorry i've recently i really
i recently uh got myself a girl i'm
seeing and i decided to sort of make it
official so I guess I showed it to my
girlfriend last night ah that's because
of all those youtube comments you're
getting it's exactly right no I I showed
it to her and and she was didn't quite
know what to make of it because it looks
like metal and it looks so much like
metal that battery door in the ax t vas
I mean it's just it would fool my father
who would
was a materials guy like he would see
that and he'd be like oh yeah no that's
totally brushed aluminum and then you
touch it and it has the feel of plastic
I'm not cheap plastic necessarily but
whatever I'm just kind of like having a
love fest for the ax t VES over here I
really like it is it the Samsung slimy
plastic no it's not it's not the hyper
glaze that you that is on the s3 that
makes the s3 feel mm sort of cheap it so
how does it feel does it feel slippery
and slimy it doesn't feel like metal but
does it feel good uh okay metal would
feel better all right brushed aluminum
would feel better and feel cool to the
touch it would give the phone a more
substantial feel because it's 135 grams
just like the s3 and I think that's too
light for me personally but it when you
touch it it feels more like a semi-gloss
finish it feels more like maybe a
kitchen counter or like this is going to
make it sound awful but like Formica you
know how that bled laminate feels on
fake wood like that's kind of how it
feels it doesn't feel like hyper gloss
or hyper blaze rather so not to spoil
anything in the the review because
everybody after listening to the podcast
is going to go out and look at that by
the way especially you android guys
because just looking at the picture
you're going to say holy crap what rom
is that and how do I put it on my sgs3
yes it looks like the N android anyway
so without spoiling the article does it
feel good or is it just weird I will say
it feels better to me than the galaxy s3
I've never been a fan of how the galaxy
s3 feels in the hand it feels like a
galaxy s3 that has been given a little
bit more money in the development
process you know I mean that that's
about as close as far as I can go
because the s3 has those kind of curved
river stone pebble influences and while
the 80s does have wide radius corners it
has kind of softly curved corners it is
not as soft visually as the s3 is it's a
little harder it's a little more like an
s2 and that somehow makes its it better
in the hand I think I wanted to circle
back just for one second to the idea
that Samsung is recycling the design and
we're being a little bit too
and Samsung because if I come to think
of it Apple's been doing the same with
the iphone 4 and the iphone 4s and the
iphone 5 and certainly the crowds
favorite nokia is doing the same with
the 800 to 900 a 920 so that's pretty
true it's just yeah if we were too harsh
then yeah we're sorry but that's just I
think because of the fact that Samsung
has managed to grow so much people are
expecting something more from them and I
personally wish that every phone they
released would look differently and
that's of course not possible yeah
exactly at some point reality has to set
in and you have to be like okay well
this is your design identity company a
and I understand and I may be sick of it
but it's what you're doing you know and
we have to make the point also that
Samsung is not doing poorly with the
galaxy note 2 and Galaxy s3 design I
mean those things are moving in the
millions and millions and it makes sense
for them to extend that to the achieve s
I'm just happy to see that that that
what could have been a very boring phone
is not and I was even a little surprised
by how many titles there were in the
Samsung's own the kind of custom
software that Samsung makes now I need
to be clear there are only like six but
i think i was expecting even fewer than
that and a couple of them pretty useful
so if Samsung could get some really
awesome custom apps in the windows phone
8 store that would be that would make
this phone even more compelling hey
Michael even though i'm ninety-nine
point ninety-nine percent sure that the
camera module on this particular phone
is the same as the one on the s3 and the
note to do you see any differences
between camera performance on the
achieve s and on the galaxy s3 is there
may be a difference in how Windows Phone
handles the camera compared to android
or is just the end product the same you
know iiii think the software does does a
little something to it i didn't really
mention this in review because i wasn't
sure and I wasn't able to do any side by
side testing of the two but it I I think
that images could that come from the
achieve s maybe are a hair softer the
color saturation
might be a hair less I'm looking at the
sample photos in the review right now
and I mean though they look quite good
but really the bigger difference for me
was in the video where and this is not a
Windows Phone problem I think because
other devices have handled this better
the autofocus is a little slow on the
atif s like we're before you go from a
long shot to a macro shot when I bring
the phone from the horizon down to my
coffee cup like the 822 in the 810 the
Lumias will would adjust kind of like
that whereas the etfs takes a second
it's like oh you've changed something ah
yes what I mean so that yeah that's the
a yes I see so anyway at any rate that's
that's the achieve SI please do see the
review I think I put a note to listen to
the podcast at the end of the review so
if you came here from the review thank
you and feel free to go back to the
review will just keep on that keep this
loop going on before we leave the ativa
I just have to throw in samsung
absolutely has to team up with Jamie Lee
Curtis or I don't know her doppelganger
Sigourney Weaver and do some kind of a
co-branding tie-in with Danny yeah and
an advertising campaign for the activia
yogurt because it sounds so much the
same every time I hear a t vas I think
I'm about to start listening to an
activia yogurt commercial buy a samsung
atty vests and get 6 free cases of
activia you active cultures for better
colon help take care of your smartphone
needs while taking care of your
digestive system yeah I think that could
work Joe what's little citizen since we
use our smartphones well never
necessarily Tony saw that coming for
about 40 miles away it was like no Oh
God um let's let's talk about something
else let's talk about the just briefly i
also got an update while I was polishing
off the Samsung at Eve s review last
night the Lumia 920 and 820 have
received updates to what is this version
10 to 11 of Windows Phone
yes 10 to 11 yeah and that means that
they are getting what is it now mine
came in and then I was like oh great
thank you update and then I went back to
the TV so I haven't even played with it
but apparently this is giving us finally
the ability to keep the Wi-Fi radio on
while the phone is in standby which by
the way is probably the most overdue
feature ever right now and some some
other tweaks data saving internet
explorer tweaks it looks like but
there's there's another big one that I'm
missing guys what is it well then there
are improvements on nokia side and there
are improvements on the OS Microsoft
side yeah the Nokia side is Wi-Fi in
camera and stuff like that and the
Microsoft side has messaging
improvements with the multiple risks
when it ends yeah you can reject calls
with text message now and that yeah okay
so listen but while we're talking about
updates so nokia did update a slew of
their nokia collection in advance of an
following this update so I've but just
been doing app updates for like two days
and one of those is the most awesome
thing ever I've been going nuts with the
cinemagraph app on nokia and i've been
trying to figure out a way Tony to like
pitch this editorial idea and I just
can't figure out a way to do it but I
want to I really well I don't think
about an angle oh my I I have been if
you are listeners if you have a windows
phone or an iOS device or an Android
device and you can get a cinemagraph
half but the if you have a nokia windows
phone the cinemagraph app from nokia is
so much fun I've been busting it out at
parties I mean this is one of those
things that I haven't one of those
feelings I haven't had in awhile with a
smartphone where you take it out at a
party and people are kind like oh that's
cool you got a new phone what's that you
let's talk about it but when you show
them when you show people who aren't
familiar with cinemagraphs the
cinemagraph application it just blows
their minds and if you haven't heard of
it it's all it is really is just
selective animation it's it's it's not a
video and it's not a photograph it's a
photograph with moving components and
what you've called an animated gif right
back in the good ole days yeah but but
you know where an animated gif is a jiff
as Adam Lane was kind enough to correct
me on in when I saw him in the city and
animated gif
is typically a direct transposition from
video so the whole frame is moving all
the time with a cinemagraph you can
select what element you want to move but
the rest of the photo is static so
that's the best way I can explain it it
is still packaged in an animated gif
though but so you can basically have the
candle static and only the flame would
be moving exactly or in one of my first
cinemagraphs i have three cameras three
candles burning in the shot but only one
of them is flickering and I've got
another one of anyway they're amazing
and you break this out at a party and
you just start you just start snapping
away but the problem up until now was
that you couldn't share the cinemagraph
like in order to even get the damn thing
off the phone you had to connect a cable
to your computer and pull it off the
phone but now you can with this update
you can share the cinemagraph a nokia
will host it for you and it'll just send
a link to whoever you want to see do you
know what the format of the file is or
whether you can export it maybe as a
gift and the uploaded somewhere you can
but something happens on the phone
software when you try and get it off the
phone like when you try and send it as
an email from the phone it'll send it
and it'll arrive as a jiff but when the
user when the recipient opens it up it's
just a single frame oh so it sucks yeah
but it's great now I mean that problem
is solved you just let know it you nokia
host at nokia sends a link for you it's
it's great anyway it please check out
the cinemagraph have if you if you have
not i have just been having a ball with
it and I think you know it's an easy way
to impress people but it while we're
talking about Windows Phone and kind of
an abroad in a broad sense did it seems
like for every kind of like awesome
piece of great news that puts me in a
high about Windows Phone there's another
one that like just grabs me from the
basement it just Yanks me back down on
the ground because we've had this whole
google crap that that's happened this
week google has announced that they are
going to terminate what is a Exchange
ActiveSync support for 44 gmail yeah
yeah for Gmail within this affects
Windows Phone in that it uses that
protocol to sing now I fully admit the
either of you guys can jump in here
anytime because I'm not too great with
email protocols
stuffin all I know is that this is going
to severely impair gmail functionality
on Windows Phone if you use that sync
method and I am a heavy heavy heavy
google user well you'll still receive
emails just that you won't have
exchanged functionality meaning that
whatever changes you make in your
calendar your contact and on the fly in
your email will not reflect almost in
real time on your phone I'm not sure
whether he can still set up as a pop or
IMA p account but the activesync
exchange basically means just what I
said right if Joe I'm right right as far
as I know in the context of what we're
talking about i think you're spot-on in
what you're saying about exchange and
activesync you're absolutely right I
just don't I've read the stories and I
don't understand if it's just setting up
accounts or if it's all sinking across
it it's confusing to me I just don't
understand it fully yet I think it's
nice out I think so too and it's really
really expensive to to pay for that that
exchange and activesync license from
Microsoft because that is their tech
google has to pay that right and it's
tens of thousands of dollars every year
and hey they could save some money and
not support an enemy at the same time
yeah well anyways i'm not sure i'm when
i'm running windows phone i'm using
hotmail or outlook so if you have a let
me put it this way if you have a
preferred platform with a preferred
maker you're most likely to have all the
services from that maker if you're an
Android user you have gmail calendar
voice yeah and so on so there are
exceptions of course when when you have
a gmail account and you're like us
you're working in the business and you
switch phones like other switching sucks
and you still need to have access to
your accounts but on a typical end user
level a windows phone user will most
likely beat an outlook / hotmail / live
com email user see I disagree and here's
why downturn that makes all the sense in
the world to me and I like that argument
logic
but i think i think this i think windows
phone 8 is the coolest thing to come out
of Microsoft in a very long time and
it's way cooler than Windows 8 because
frankly it works better so in and and
also we are in a world where mobile is
driving the push now it's no longer
desktop OS is driving the d innovation
its mobile and I think a lot more people
are going to notice Windows Phone 8 and
a lot more people going to be willing to
try it but these are people like me who
have been using Gmail for six years or
have been using other stuff who think
that alive first of all who think that a
hotmail.com email account is like almost
as bad as a yahoo.com email account no
offense to anyone who has those I don't
care I'm gonna get a ton of mail I'm
sorry but no no I'll back yet hotmail is
worse than yahoo that's why they changed
it to outlook come right Alan calm and
then you've got and you know live com is
a little bit better sort of because
nobody really knows what it is but you
know there's so much that's still dorky
about Microsoft there's so much that's
still unappealing that's still in
whatever and then you know it whatever I
think the commenters were yelling at me
yesterday for a piece I wrote about the
surface not talking to the phone but
like it was like you can use SkyDrive
and you can use all this and yes some of
this stuff works really well but there's
still so much of Microsoft's old DNA in
this when I used when I was trying to
share these cinemagraph gifs through my
SkyDrive account it was working well
because the SkyDrive account would host
it but instead of just making it simple
instead of just be like here friend i'm
sending you this link to my SkyDrive
account you can look they would open up
the link and then here's this image and
it wouldnt animate and in order to get
the thing to animate that like check a
checkbox and go up to like view original
or something like something really nerdy
something really adored you something
really not desert friendly you know
that's and there's so much of that
that's still in the Microsoft DNA so
when you ask me and I can't speak for
anyone but I think this is probably true
of other people who are not in the
Microsoft ecosystem already when you
asked me to give up all these tools that
work for me you know like all the entire
Google ecosystem the gmail that drive
the calendar all that sink which I'm
perfectly willing to sync via windows
phone 8 because I prefer a windows phone
as my daily driver he asked me to give
that up in favor of hotmail you know in
favor of this this kind of gross
environment that I don't like working on
in the desktop like I don't
to do that you know and I don't want to
I don't know and I'm sure there are
alternatives there are we've we've seen
a couple articles Adam Lane has a very
compelling case for moving to
outlook.com which is not the right fit
for me but he has a good piece about it
and I don't know I just don't know what
I will do and I don't know what
Microsoft will do because apparently it
was a surprise to them this whole google
coming up and saying we're not doing
this anymore thing so I don't know
tactically speaking there's that
conversation personally speaking I'm
just very scared because I don't want to
have to rely on a whole bunch of
third-party apps to like do this sinking
and it looks like that's what I'm gonna
have to do so even got my google I think
that if if you would switch from an
android phone to Windows Phone I think
that you'd eventually board all your
services to Microsoft services because I
think that that's just psychology than
bits basic brand not necessarily
recognition but staying true to the
brand mmm what do you mean you like you
talking about the general you well
talking about the average user yes if an
average user for instance has a
two-year-old android phone and under the
Christmas tree he or she will find the
Lumia 920 chances are that by by spring
he or she will switch all services to
Microsoft services because it's just the
way things things go or that's just the
way I see things as normal from my
perspective I think that is I think
that's common yes I don't disagree but I
don't think the experience yet I don't
think they did Microsoft kind of cloud
experience matches what Google can offer
yet as far as functionality or usability
that's debatable but yeah I get your
point you know I don't know I it's
frustrating to have to do that i I've
had this idea in my head percolating for
a couple months you know about this
editorial idea where the headline has a
piece of profanity in it in my head
right now so I have to kind of pair that
down but like you know basically it's
what if all this stuff played nice
wouldn't it be nice because i think my
ideal situation would be having a
desktop running a mac an apple based OS
and a phone running windows phone and a
tablet running android that's my michael
nobody wants you except you and me and
the users
I mean if you're a company and your ear
cut up in this competition game right on
this capitalist market and nobody would
want that and it comes down to the same
thing I think Google doesn't really want
you to switch to Windows Phone that's
why they don't give you the opportunity
to take your your google accounts to
Windows Phone so if people are like you
they're probably stay away from windows
home because they cannot use their
Google services so this is probably just
another speed bump or hurdle but on the
throne yeah yeah no I agree I mean it's
definitely a competitive moving as
Steven points out in his editorial you
know both Apple and Google caught a huge
break when windows when Microsoft failed
to innovate on Windows Mobile fast
enough and I think they don't want to
give Microsoft the room to come in there
and fix its normal I mean it's always
easier to kill or to get rid of the the
weakest one and we have a saying kill it
at birth oh god yeah yeah I know you're
right it'sit's just get in there early
and exterminated before it becomes a
real threat right yeah that is true well
I like what you're saying about playing
nicely together that's something that I
advocated for for all my life ironically
my day job we have apple products we
have macbook airs macbook pros that we
run windows 7 and all of the all the
phones are the windows phones or iPhones
and all the tablets are iPads no Android
has made it in there as an officially
sanctioned device yet but we are doing
the the mixing and running into those
problems with you know people who are
trying and to make facetime calls with
someone who is on a windows phone versus
someone who's on a you know a macbook
running Windows 7 vs somebody who's got
an iPad so we need to all play and get
along and it's long overdue there i
think there is still opportunities for
cross-platform apps to come in like you
know skype is a good example and even
though it doesn't skype and facebook
Messenger and all the rest exactly
exactly yeah that's why facebook
Messenger is the only thing I can use to
communicate effectively with them
with my friends who I talked to online
all day because there are desk jobs and
they can't be seen texting so they have
to use something on the phone and
they'll want to chat me up on google
talk I'm like that's great until i leave
the house with my windows phone which
doesn't have a Google solution or maybe
it does fine now I have to check anyway
that's that's a whole big conversation
I'd love to get into it but we don't
don't have much time we have to close
out windows phone and um thanks for
thanks for going with me on that thread
for a second but there's a rumor here
Antonio's whipped up a an alternately
awesome and terrifying render of Nokia
to show a 10 inch Windows Phone or
Windows RT tablet at mwc ? this is
what's up Tony too I just don't know
what to believe anymore either we it was
so much back and forth with the nokia
tablet it was first it was agreeing then
it wasn't red then it was a green and
there and now apparently it's a green
again I can totally understand if Nokia
would want to sit back and see how the
market reacts to Windows RT and to
windows 8 tablets I'm also 75 75 percent
sure that Nokia doesn't have such a
great relationship with Microsoft when
it comes to Windows RT and Windows 8
like it has with Windows Phone so it
will not be probably the preferred OEM
so maybe maybe they're just sitting back
looking at what the surface does what
Samsung and the other OEMs are doing and
if the time comes and if the platforms
are taking off then probably yes we will
probably see a nakia tablet but my money
isn't necessarily on that I have two
questions one would this be Nokia's
first real tablet and nothing putting
aside the 770 those little five entries
from back in the day I think yes yeah
from what I know yes this will be the
first tablet and that would be real TT
it would be very interesting to say that
my second question is does anybody
really want it at this point I mean
Windows RT is not taking the market by
storm at the moment the it users of
Nokia Lumia when those phones will want
it just like users of iphones want iPads
and just like users
nexus Force One Nexus tent well I think
yeah okay I think dammit tell me I've I
thought I thought for a second this was
gonna be a really quick thing but no I
don't think nothing's quick honest I
guess I no no my you know I think users
who have an excess for have reason to
wonder Nexus 7 because they interact
really well seven or ten yes or yeah or
a ten um and certainly there are cloud
based options where and third-party
options and Microsoft hosted options
that make a Microsoft slate tablet and a
Microsoft smartphone interact to a small
degree but I think just like just like
almost anything else in the smartphone
and tablet world L Lumia 920 is not
going to talk to this nokia windows RT
tablet really as much as it should or
you know a Windows Phone it's not going
to talk to the surface for these much
it's like is it going is its existence
going to make me want to buy it as a
Lumia owner like I mean is that true or
is this thing just gonna sit on the
shelves and kind of collect dust cuz
what's it gonna do differently it's
gonna be polycarbonate well we don't
know the better the single fact that
it's made by nokia and at the moment i
think in the windows phone market nokia
has more better street rep than samsung
because Samsung has been completely
neglecting windows phone so I'd say that
if somebody is in the market for a
Windows RT because it's it's an RT but
maybe a Windows 8 tablet made by nokia
they probably look at nokia first before
looking at samsung acer and all the
others that's a probably a solid theory
what do you do Joe what would you be
more likely to buy a samsung product or
a nokia product when we're talking
tablet when we're talking tablets
specifically when we're talking windows
nokia stands out in the window sphere
more than samsung does so i would go
especially looking at this render if
I've got a nice-looking nokia phone that
looks like that i'm going to have a
matching nokia tablet that looks like
that and i'm also going to wonder when
I'm
get the inch and a half version you know
that the Nokia nano that I can run my
miss my windows pad right well yeah you
know so I can have my music collection
on that it looks like that and that's
kind of the direction i see it going but
it's got across that hurdle that you're
mentioning Michael where it's just got
to work together apple just works
together android just works together
right now Windows Phone Windows RT
Windows 8 they they're all kind of
separate entities that are still trying
to work together they're the same thing
from a look and feel until you start
trying to to make them interoperate and
then they're not well and and I think so
my point is it's sometimes some of the
commenters who have responded to the
piece obviously I read half the piece
before jumping down to the comments
section this is usually they did make
some good points like yes the messaging
sinks yes when you when I have messages
message conversations on my lumia 920 of
the show up on my surface and that's
nice contacts get updated across the fly
and that you know and that's nice and
there is stuff that syncs on the back
and just like there is on Google devices
and an iOS devices so you know that
stuff with that stuff windows is
surprisingly on par I think the whole
landscape is just not phones and tablets
aren't talking to each other enough and
we don't have the the special Bluetooth
tunnel and the you know the text message
passing and stuff that that well but one
would say that you can easily use
SkyDrive for instance just to switch or
to upload the photo or any piece of
content from your phone and then access
it on your know right no yeah that's
what that's the point of making the
cloud-based solutions work fine but
until you've come home like Tony I used
it for a couple weeks there I was like
on the cusp of Nirvana where I would
come home and I would put my my fear my
HPV r on that over here I know and
listen this isn't me just being a web
West fanboy like this is really cool and
just tell me if I'm wrong tell me if
this isn't the most compelling thing
ever I took came home I'm having a
conversation on my beer at via text
message I put the thing down on the
touchstone and I pick up my touchpad
welcome to the other room I'm still
having the text conversation on my
touchpad through that Bluetooth
connection and then if I get a phone
call on my fear which is in the
the room I pick it up on my touchpad and
I can take it on my touchpad meanwhile
all the cloud stuff is all sinking in
the background and all that stuff like
that is a continuous client that is the
dream not this kind of like yeah data
sinks because the cloud does it you know
I don't know these that's a whole
different thing and I think yeah i wrote
a rotor piece on it but the point is I I
don't know i don't see a compelling case
for a nokia tablet because i don't see a
compelling case for Windows RT in its
current form it needs to be better
before I get excited about new hardware
because the hardware is not the surfaces
problem if you ask me it's not a
hardware issue I love the so the surface
so in our current windows ecosystem
would you say that windows 8 whether
it's Windows Phone 8 Windows RT which is
eight windows 8 pro would you say that
windows 8 as an ecosystem is one
iteration away from being what it's
supposed to be and catching up with
everybody else and that windows 9
windows RT 9 Windows Phone 9 are going
to give us everything that we have as an
ecosystem on the other platforms finally
on a Windows platform careful Tony yes I
I actually really think I think windows
RT is the embryonic state of what
windows of what a successful windows
looks like on the mobile space I do
think the next iteration the next major
iteration will bring it up to speed with
the rest of with the rest of the
landscape yes somebody I know the race
go ahead somebody I no hint me said that
Windows RT is for tablets what Windows
Phone 7 was for windows phones back in
the day of its launch would you agree
with that say it again windows RT is for
tablets what the initial version of
Windows Phone 7 was for phones oh we oh
I see yes yes I think that's exactly
right Tony did you set it on the
podcaster you said yeah yeah I'm saying
lots of smart things on the bus you
should listen
well let's let's let's put windows to
bed if that's okay Joe that's a solid
question I I mean what do you think Joe
do you're the only one who hasn't
weighed in on this I hope so and going
to the direction that Tony was going
seven was really Windows Phone one and
it it took a while to evolve we're
they're probably right now with Windows
Phone to which is they're calling eight
the tablets if they were to name in the
same way you know windows RT which is
eight is really one so when everybody
gets all together in this we're all up
to the second revision of whatever that
is or that even from the third whatever
maybe that's when everybody's going to
play together nicely it's just kind of
confusing the naming and whatnot because
it is iteration 1 iteration 2 of this
new platform and they don't line up one
hundred percent yet I'm hoping not n is
where everybody will be straight across
the board and the experience you know
the data not data sharing through the
cloud but the data just being there
being completely ambiguous it's it's
just there you pick up your phone it's
there you pick up your tablet it's there
you sit down at your computer it's there
that experience I think us to come in
the next major iteration you know the
wait till you see windows RT's no dough
and mando yeah it will those will be the
end of the interim steps to know I the
equivalence probably windows RT points
something like Windows Phone was seven
point something and 7.5 and now 7.8 they
probably iterate and we'll probably see
some updates the Windows Phone and
Windows RT summer in February March
April just to match that cycle when
they're updating bring bringing you
Steve Ballmer will see that we have 500
new features so right yeah so on that I
I wanted to mention it earlier on
Stephens piece about the the 10 to 21
build the way i read that was holy
app they really have 10,000 221 new
features or fixes yeah so they gotta do
something about their version numbers
here I do love portico though that's a
nice that's a nice word for it for the
next version I've windows phone um but
tony has been saying a lot of smart
things I want to jump into that real
quickly just want to let you know that
we have I've just received a tweet 25
minutes ago from a user named airburst
who's asking what I love I love that
user name it's great isn't it I'm a bit
super leaner it's a I think so he's
asking when will this week's PocketNow
podcast go online have to wrap some
presents and need something to listen to
in that time Bobby we are recording it
right now so Tony the smart thing you
said on another podcast seems to have
come to pass Apple is reportedly in
talks with the fun social networking app
team from foursquare about improving its
Maps data this is crazy now you said we
talked about this in a previous podcast
I have a crappy memory apparently said I
mentioned this as a possible solution
and I came to this realization when I
was out two or three or four weeks ago I
can't remember and I fired up Apple maps
back in the day we didn't have google
maps like we have now so there were no
points of interest nothing Apple maps
was blank so I just had the streets the
roads and that's it and then I fired up
for square and now because Apple maps is
the main mapping application and mapping
source for iOS four square is using iOS
Apple maps and the Apple maps with in
foursquare were full of points of
interest and I was like okay why don't
they just team up and import all the
points of interest into apple's database
and everybody is happy Apple fixes their
maps for square root probably yet lots
of money and the users will be happy now
we're happy with google maps but still
Apple needs to improve its mapping
service agree now I I it'll be
interesting to see what they do and we
don't have time to really speculate
about it today but I'm very interested
in a future conversation where we talk
about what what the future of Apple maps
is now that google google
is on the store it's a difficult future
I can tell you right now yeah even with
foursquare POS improving the map status
yes not all the lens on integrations
that that's the only way apple maps can
come back is be tightly integrated with
partners with apps with everything you
do it needs to default over to Apple
maps and they need to they need to knock
it out of the ballpark to be frank right
but then you I think we're going to end
up with a fragmented situation like we
have on some nokia windows phones were
you sometimes you can you jump into maps
and you go to Nokia Maps but sometimes
you're in a nap and you click on a
location link and it jumps you into bing
maps which you can't access via it's not
preferable yeah right you know what i
mean so yeah ideally you want a unified
mapping solution well yes maybe at the
OS level you're able to select like what
do you want to use for your default
mapping thing like the thing that pops
up in android when you click exams time
yeah like just once or always like that
kind of thing so points of interest i
wanna i know we're running real short on
time but i want to diverge just a little
bit and kind of tease into something
points of interest are the bread and
butter of of maps I mean yeah you have
streets yes you have directions but if
you don't have places to go if you can't
search for stuff and find them it
becomes not as useful so foursquare has
this little game thing going where you
wherever you go you check in and you can
become the mayor of that location Dawson
which it was funny going to city council
meetings I I somehow became the mayor of
Syracuse City the major and I don't get
along but anyway that's neither you're
there but they're incentivizing use
through this this game and through
coupons and through other stuff that you
can do through foursquare and I don't
have to tell anybody about four squares
any everybody knows what it is the
google doesn't have that at least not in
that sense yeah instead they have
something and I think this is what
they're doing I don't know none of us
really know they have this thing called
the Niantic project where they have this
niantic labs that's released two apps so
far it is a wing of google so they're
google apps one of them is called field
trip that helps you become aware of
points of interest that
you were interested in as you're just
walking around so first thing that's
kind of scary they know where you are
and can alert you with a you know a
vibration on your hip or a tone to let
you know hey here's this museum right
next door that you might not have known
about here's this piece of art right
here around the corner it's 300 feet
away go check it out grant it it's what
you're interested in but how do you get
those points of interest in there how do
you get walking directions how do you
get driving directions time of day
information about them photographs of
them and that's the yeah that's the
other app that they've done they've got
this other app which is a game called
ingress which right now is closed beta
you have to have an invite and it is the
most ridiculously addicting game i have
ever played you're in your I'm it I'm in
I I don't know how I got an invite but I
got an invite and they are they just
released a new set of portals these
portals are the points of interest and
that's literally what they're doing
they're having you go around with your
camera take pictures of things and use
the sharing and geotagging features of
Android to send that to niantic super
ops on what you think this portal should
be in a portal is just a point of
interest and you send the picture that
has the GPS and tell them what it is and
why and they evaluate that for inclusion
and then they get a whole bunch of
people to come around again and again
and again via different routes walking
routes car routes to try and get that
portal and do all of the cool gaming
stuff to it have you written a piece on
this yet I feel what it has only one oh
it's it's on the list and oh don't email
do it because I want to read about this
now well now that I'm into it more in
seeing how it can be used and applied
and how Google could Trump foursquare
with points of interest and this by
doing this true crowdsourcing not only
four points of interest but how to get
there via multi modes of transportation
right then in different times of day
that that crowdsourcing data is going to
be infinitely more valuable than what
foursquare is collecting and then
of course it's going to be available on
all of googles products from Heather
Dion so it might come up as a an
editorial in the future with that slant
everything okay I got here I was going
to say here's the thing listeners if you
want if you want if you want more on
this if you want more on said Haley
lights and antonette para nada I'm
kidding do not email Tony email the
podcast and and leave a comment on the
cotton podcast post say it's not the
beats fool anyways after tomorrow silver
white well that's right what about you
know what that's right all of our last
stories right the real thing I wanted to
say is that whoever invited in invented
crowdsourcing was was a damn intelligent
person I mean just regardless if it's
incentivized or not having literally
millions of people work for you and
improving and adding to your offerings
for free it is huntin I mean whether
it's Google Apps it's four square roots
facebook its ways it's anything which
requires you to quote help others right
it's it's just awesome it is i mean it's
it's a genius way of getting the
customers to getting your customers good
to kind of do to kind of make your
product better I mean that's one of the
definitions of crowdsourcing but it's a
great idea I'm good I'm glad that you
guys talked about this cuz I had no idea
that that was going on I had no idea
about any of that and I will look
forward to reading about it um we have
to tell clarify just before we get
inundated we do not have any invites to
the game oh god do I have any contacts
with google that and give us invites to
the game Joe already gave me his invite
that's that's the deal that might not be
true that might not be true didn't even
give you an invite oh I have a way to
invite people but I have zero invites to
hand out just like everybody else well I
already claimed I'm claiming I'm
preemptively claiming your beta invite
when you get it so there any girls can
have it mr. windows phone gets the first
interested that's Adam Lane I don't know
what you mean i'm in every man um anyway
we've got it i really want Adam to come
on the podcast so I can talk to him
about a lot of this test I feel like you
could learn a lot so but he doesn't want
to be on the podcast that's all right
anyway the point is my
fragmented brain is able to wrap up this
rundown the Apple has sold two million
Chinese iphone 5s Wow cool think of it
it is well really I mean it no it is you
know it's in a weekend exactly that's I
wasn't being sarcastic that was a real
wow I know it's that's yeah that's
Friday Saturday and Sunday it's the
world's largest mobile market on the
planet it's it's hugely significant and
but the thing is I think it the numbers
themselves don't excite me as much as
what it means for the other players who
typically the underdogs like blackberry
like Windows Phone who have Windows
Phone actually Windows Phone as some
pointed out trying to make a point which
which they did not really in my head the
Lumia 920 T which is the Chinese carrier
variety of the Lumia 920 is number one
best selling on Amazon okay that is on
amazon but I'm sure it didn't sell a
quarter of what the iphone sold exactly
and that's why this headline is
significant to me because you have these
underdogs kind of kind of the same as
when when these underdogs say you know
we're targeting the dumb phone users
we're targeting than the non smartphone
adopted yet you know with their first
smartphone kind of thing they kind of
rely on China as their other crutch
where they're like yeah you know we're
not doing so great the United States but
look at China we're gonna try and get
ourselves installed in China you know
and then it's now the android is the
same boom yeah sure I mean whoever it is
I I just find it interesting I I'm
interested in I would love to be a fly
on the wall at some meetings in some
boardrooms at these companies as they
look at the the iphone sales metrics in
china and they're like and i would like
to ask you guys something yeah um we are
seeing that the iphone 5 as expected is
the best selling iphone ever we are
seeing that the computer business if
Apple is of course going up and up and
up I've recently read a report that the
ipad mini apple will probably sell 12
million iPad minis by the end of this
year so everything is going up why on
earth is Apple stock going down I mean
really really down it isn't it down on
wasn't it down on like reports of Luke
it was I don't know it which is what
does lukewarm demand mean because when I
when I read like 10 million 15 millions
and millions and millions and millions I
just can't think of lukewarm the vent
yeah well I think I mean yeah taken in a
vacuum those millions are very
impressive but what do they mean
sequentially like year-over-year like
how do they compare to previous growth
and I think android is no I don't have
the metrics back this up but I do think
that Android is making significant
inroads against iphone the iOS ecosystem
you know at least in the smartphone side
so well I can give you similar iphone as
if as of either today or yesterday I
think Stephen wrote about it samsung
accounts for twenty-eight percent of
global smartphone sales Apple is second
at twenty percent and then the rest
Nokia and the HTC on the rest come with
percentages below ten percent so apples
are running low even five so 28 the
Samsung 22 Apple okay well I think it
all depends on Apple's growth rate and
where the company also Apple has also
had this big maps fiasco and they've
just fired some executives like you know
it's not it's it's not that Apple's an
unstable place to be i don't think in i
don't think anybody's worried about
apple's long-term viability but that
gives investors pause i think i think
investors are very easy to rattle you
know i mean this is this is my view of
oven yeah sure i just wanted to know
because i don't know and i know nothing
about stocks in about how the stock
market works and reacts because once you
see a report the stock market
immediately reacts yeah and i just don't
think it's normal but it's just the way
the stock market works works yeah let's
Joe I know we're bumping up against your
heart stopped and I would really like to
get to this one piece of compelling
listener mail have you got another
minute or two for us well let me let me
finish up on this one yeah we can bump a
little past my stop today I just want to
come in on if I'm doing my math right in
the first weekend that the iphone 5 was
available in China they sold one iphone
for every 1,000 people in the country am
i doing my math right on that I don't
know
wonder at one point 1.2 billion how many
are they but if we assume that they've
got two billion people in China just
making numbers well just for easy
numbers what one in a thousand if it's
one point to that makes it one in 500
600 ish i don't i don't know i remember
saying around so fast dear what a boy my
father but i don't know hold on i'm
making the calculation right now because
it sounds Italian is a million divided
by pi we get android's they get 1.3
billion / 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 that means that
Oh 673 yes so the very first weekend
that the iphone 5 was available one out
of every 673 people got one yeah that's
correct that's that's impressed it's
incredible and you have to consider also
the the wages in China and right the
conditions in which they are living
death day today yes very very impressive
yeah anyway that's my piece go ahead on
to your reader email that Tony and I
have no knowledge of so we absolutely
before right so yeah as I was as I spoke
about earlier my my head has been all
the t VES all week and I haven't really
had time to do anything else so this
podcast outline came very late in the
morning but this is an email that I will
have to cut down this rid of the inbox
I'll read it so that Joe and Tony and
listeners know what's going on this is
from a new listener and I love emails
from everyone but new listeners are
great too is from Sri can't holla from
India I listen to your podcast for the
first time in episode 22 and liked it a
lot from now on I'll be listening every
week we love hearing that thank you look
at that in that great I'm a person who
gets bored with things very fast like
few weeks or a month i have a galaxy s2
from almost a year and I've tried many
things from downloading many apps and
themes to rooting and installing
third-party roms currently I'm on cm10
nightly for galaxy s2 so I think says
shrikant manufacturers should make
phones with standard hardware the OS is
left as a choice to the you
user can buy OS of choice and switch to
another OS when bored with the current
one then he goes on to suggest that if
not that then maybe dual booting is a
possibility my question is how far are
we from getting such phones that come
with standard hardware but an OS of
jealous okay let me go first on this one
because that's something that I have
championed for forever go for it ah
grant I want to go so I wanted to just
say it's also we also talked about this
at length yeah I have talked about this
at length and I just wanted to bring it
up again with Joe go so the first thing
that I want to talk about is back rewind
the podcast back to where we're talking
about the atif s which is the galaxy s3
Windows Phone right we're coming down to
where we're getting very very similar
hardware platforms sitting under my desk
right now I have a desktop computer that
has a standard form factor and i can
plug components into an upgrade and do
whatever i'm not saying that we can or
even should do that with our smartphones
but if we have that one common platform
where it's the same screen it's the same
hardware inside it's just different
drivers and you know a different
silkscreen on the button for a little
windows logo versus nothing for android
or whatever why can't we do that we've
got the hardware it's awesome hardware
why can't we well it's complicated in
their subsidies and there's all kinds of
other stuff in there but that's why we
have the open source community that's
why we have hacking to allow us to be
able to do that with our own hardware
once we've purchased it and ultimately
whether you whether you buy into that or
not say you can or can't or should or
should not able to hack your own
hardware to do what you want with it I
know Tony and I disagree on this it
makes everybody have more choice and it
makes everybody safer as the only way we
can find out how to get these hacks to
allow us to do this is by finding
vulnerabilities that can be exploited to
let us do this which you know we're
we're in the white hats over here we
just want to run our own OS our own way
but their people want to put malware on
and steal your information and steal
your money and whatever
they're doing it the bad way this this
concept of letting us have it and being
open with it and it kind of embracing us
to hack it even lets those manufacturers
know and we got a security hole here we
need to fix that and it makes everybody
safer whether or not we're going to be
able to get to that Nirvana of pick your
hardware and then load your OS will
probably never get there but oh I want
that day to come I would love for that
day to come as well in it Joe that's
well said you that I completely agree
but I do think that there will be there
will come a time because as you say we
are getting closer and closer to this to
this ability anyway I mean the hardware
is so similar across platforms right now
that there's going to be a small company
that shows up I think a small firm that
says we're making standard hardware and
you can load android or you can load
that's the problem there's really
nothing else you can kind of like load
without breaking some laws right you
can't like to compile your own version
of Windows Phone right you can't like
taste rip iOS off and offer it so that's
tough so maybe there will be a firm that
comes along and says hey here's our
hardware you can run android or webos or
me go or oya or whatever the hell are
calling it on this and then maybe if
that sells well if that gets enough
headlines then maybe another a larger
somewhat larger company will try it and
then maybe a larger company still will
try it but I think that that it's not
impossible but I think we are a long
ways off from a major big OEM actually
offering it I think probably we won't
see this from Samsung until you know
2020 that's my view well and to take
that view and just expand on a little
bit we might there is a small
possibility that there could be a
Windows Phone variant available on that
platform because it's it's available to
OEMs to license and install on their
hardware so theoretically contract could
be negotiated that says here's our
hardware we're letting users put
whatever OS of these that they want on
it we would like yours to be in there
too we realize that if we do that we
have to pay you X number of dollars per
license and it's probably going to be a
premium over samsung or nokia because
it's not going to be co-branded in yada
yada yada so even if it's you know an
extra 50 bucks an extra hundred bucks
whatever that figure is to load that on
why can't they do it just as a licensee
and make it legal and legitimate I think
it could be legal and legitimate and I
don't think it would sell and enough to
I think it would have to be a hobby
project by a larger company maybe Google
would do it but they have no incentive
to sleep baby Google would do it let's
take out activesync in exchange of once
I'm sorry new you're right that was my
2007 spit self speaking this is
something Google would have done five
years ago before they had too much
invested in the mobiles maybe HP would
do it they don't know what they're doing
they have no direction on the mobile
side you Tony what's your what's your
take on this I'm sorry I was muted for a
second because there's a psychotic
little dog outside which I would do
things to I I think that okay it just
did shut up I I don't think it will ever
happen because the world is going to end
tomorrow all right no seriously now if
not in advance timeline we gotta meet it
it's gotta be done today little bit
today that seriously I don't think it
will ever happen because of multiple
reasons maybe there will be one or two
small companies which will try to
somehow do it it is doable but it will
never go mainstream because of multiple
reasons number one in many many cases it
is still the platform driving smartphone
sales samsung would have not ever gotten
to the first spot if it would have only
sold bata phones or windows phones
Android is driving samsung just like
windows phone is driving nokia so having
a phone to which you have a liberty to
install either platform will probably
not drive sales for that phone that plus
all the other implications encoding and
boot loaders and drivers and
optimizations multiple teams working on
software development and it's just
basically simply put nobody wants this
except some guys who send us emails for
a podcast which is the serious our
reader and Michael and me and everybody
who wants this raise your hand yeah
exactly okay that's the majority who the
earth just moved
crap that's what starts the Mayan
apocalypse well it was a great great
piece of email shrikanth I wish we lived
in that world already I think it's gonna
be a while until we do but great great
email thank you for the thank you for
listening and thank you for the question
um we have to get Joe off to as to his
job I have to get to writing some more
stuff and Tony I think has to get ready
get his escape vehicle ready to escape
the world ending shockwave yeah it's
gonna be 20 first before before you guys
get to 21st yeah that's true don't ya
utonis come not gonna text you guys I'm
gonna tweet you guys remember Tony
animals are more sensitive so that dog
yeah honey yeah by the with just a lame
question guys did the man say exactly
which time zone it will happen on or at
what time in which time zone because
yeah that would be the blame they only
told me though so lions were really
smart and they didn't have time zones
nothing Zulu time but that said they
most of their major cities are in plus
one or two hours of where I am so let's
let's just all standardized and say it's
it's mountain time is gmt minus sex you
it's gonna be the 22nd here guys so okay
already yeah Tony's already gonna be
gone anyways been a pleasure guys yeah I
know it has been an honor podcasting
with you both I think way and I think
privilege and an honor thank you to all
of our listeners to we hope that this
will survive and be found by historians
in the future when they come to visit
our planet from another planet thank you
find out what destroyed gotta be on the
very optimistic I think yeah we have to
be optimistic we all have to come
together in trying times like these from
the end of the timeline optimism springs
eternal from the well of Stroh Levi it's
a beautiful day to be alive I think but
we need a half that's that's a Chinese
you get her suffer music here we do we
need some really awesome laid out music
well from the end of time
that is going to wrap it up for this
episode of the pocket now we claim it's
a last day on planet earth let's spend
it tweeting to Levi is at your leave I
Tony over there's have aunt aunty nadjem
