calm and we are going to take a quick
look at the new and improved HTC hub
let's check it out first off here's our
live tile and it is live remember the
first version do not have a live tile so
this is showing the wither in my area
and let's tap it and you see this is a
lot different now we have a list of our
weather cities well I don't have that
many so it's not scrolling we have our
current location up at the top and we
can choose any other location and it's a
lot less animated it's not flying in
your face anymore we have some sound
effects and you can see this little
picture in there is nicely animated very
subtly but it looks pretty nice and we
have a little expand view so you can see
more of the cool with our animation and
we have 24-hour view and so you can see
some forecast information as well and we
can also pin this to the start screen
first let's try the demo see some
animated weather so there's some clouds
clear sky
some sound effect for the snow do that
there's the fog thunderstorm to hear the
rain looks pretty cool
there's the sunny animation with some
really nice god rays coming out of the
clouds they're all right that's enough
of that so let me pin barcelona to the
start screen there is barcelona so i
could I can do weather for any kinda
number of cities that I want let's get
out here and it's not immediately
apparent unless you saw the admission
the beginning that you can swipe so
here's the stocks panel and you can add
any stock ticker names you want you can
edit some of them you can refresh it to
get some updating information and we can
also tap it hold and pin to start up
that one our is pinned to start so we
can do this one and there we go you have
a nice live tile for that particular
company and their stocks so that's
really nice but there's more also have a
news a tab over here so I can choose
different news sites and I can add some
so we can choose from all sorts of
little categories so there we go let's
see if I can do a custom one
see if it finds this let's see how about
that one there we go and so there's my
pocket now news feed right here in the
HTC hub and let's wait for it to load a
little bit and here we go let's pin that
to the start screen so there you are
nice quick access to the pocket now
newsfeed I tap it it's going to go right
into it let's get back to the full hub
reloading it's just ox again there's
your news okay so we can pin now you can
also pin all items if you want all of
these can get those there and here's our
featured tab these are just apps the HTC
wanted you to note about and we go again
and its back to the beginning all right
so that's pretty much it for the new HTC
hub but there are some pretty nice
features there and we get some great
laughs tiles alright that's it for now I
hope you enjoyed this video give us a
thumbs up if you did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
