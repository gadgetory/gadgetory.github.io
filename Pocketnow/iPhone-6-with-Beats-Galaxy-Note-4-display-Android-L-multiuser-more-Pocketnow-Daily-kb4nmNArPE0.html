hardware improvements and even a beach
chip rumors points a multi-user support
reaching smartphones on android l and a
samsung really planning to bring extra
curves on the galaxy note 4 i'm hanging
metal be bettah and after watching a
full marathon of fast and furious it
makes you wonder if i could make this
show any faster this is pocket now daily
let's begin today with what's official
as we do know that sony is going to have
its Aoife event on September third where
we are expecting the revamp to the
Xperia lineup but for those of you that
are wondering exactly what we are
getting the company has just begun
teasing just like Samsung that yesterday
with a note for and yeah it seems that
we're getting a smartphone it seems that
we're getting some accessories and there
is a tablet rumored as well though we
don't really see it in the ad it looks
the description for full details on
everything that's there hopefully Sony
can wow us again this time another
official news that are kind of on LG has
just launched another g 3 variants and
we talked about this there were a lot of
them being mentioned and yes it seems
that there is a g3 a they just got
announced in Korea this phone pretty
much reminds us of the galaxy note 3
when it comes to specification
snapdragon 800 processor it's got a
1080p display it's got a 5.2 inch
display as well up you know it's not
really a backbone it's just the lesser
spective that's even a word version of
the g3 for other people that don't
really want to k i wonder who and as we
get closer to a launch of android l we
get some more teasers on what to expect
the company didn't really tell us much
on what the updates were site for
material design and other things but it
seems that multi-user support is coming
to smartphones for the longest time it's
only worked on tablets and yeah it would
be cool to have this feature on
smartphones and this is apparently part
of a narrow log and stuff like the
description all details on everything
obviously this is not confirmed but
according to google developers this is
coming on the next final build which is
android l up next week forgot apple and
the iphone 6 we've got some rumors on
specifications kind of shady though but
yeah we had her the phone is getting NFC
who we had heard the phone is getting
Wi-Fi 802 11 AC great we had also heard
the phone
is getting better touch ID fine rivers
habit that the a8 chip is going to be
clock the two gigahertz which is the
first time ever Apple is very
conservative when it comes to that but
even more interesting apparently the
company is going to add a beat chip
meaning that it will detect when beats
headphones are being plugged in in order
to give you enhanced sound and you know
we've been debating exactly what is
Apple planning to do with beads for 3.2
billion so let's see how that goes and
finally for the very odd news of the day
if you remember back at CES we were
covering the fact that Samsung is
working on these wraparound displays and
it's been rumored for the longest time
that the company is working on a
smartphone that includes this technology
we've got the Galaxy Note 4 being
launched editha and it turns out that
manufacturing sources claimed that this
wraparound display is already entering
mass production and it'll apparently
make it to the note 4 and now for those
of you that are wondering i mean the
Galaxy Note 4 announcement is just a
couple of weeks away well if you think
about it says it doesn't really launch
the note line up immediately after Eva
it takes a month so if this has entered
production today or a couple of weeks
ago then there are two months of
production and the Galaxy Note lineup
doesn't really sell big initially so
could it be that we're getting a
wraparound display here I mean the
company CEO tease the new form factor
that leads you to the question of the
day what do you think about this do you
think that a wraparound display is
something cooler gimmicky because in my
case I really feel that it's a gimmick
but hey samsang has proven me wrong with
the Galaxy Note up to the point that
I've been using it for a year so leave
us a comment down below what do you
think frenzy s you know the drill if you
want to get them as earlier before this
video is so mushy follow what I'm
talking about comment subscribe to
channel as well he also follow me on
Twitter hi underscore you betta please

what you saw I am high never better
thank you very much for watching we will
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
