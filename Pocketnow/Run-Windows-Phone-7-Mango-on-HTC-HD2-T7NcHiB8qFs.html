pocketnow.com the HTC hd2 now a
two-year-old device is still one of the
most versatile phones out there you can
run android on it windows phone 7
windows mobile you bun to the list goes
on and on and now you can run windows
phone 7 mango on if you want to get a
preview and a taste for what's coming
next in the world of windows phone in
this video we're going to show you what
it's like let's get to it ok so the
steps are relatively easy to get Windows
Phone 7 mango on your HTC hd2 especially
if you've already installed Windows
Phone 7 onto it will post full
instructions on how to do that within
the post and if you're on YouTube will
put a link in the description but here
it is mango and it's very much in beta
there's a lot of stuff that doesn't work
you're not going to be able to use this
as your daily driver marketplace isn't
working and SD card storage doesn't work
right but you can at least get a sense
for what mango is like so that when it
finally ships and starts being pushed
over the air to all the existing devices
devices you'll know what to expect so it
can move around here we can talk about
the Twitter integration now in the
People Hub so quite simply I'm not going
to go through the process but now you
have a new option for Twitter this is
all stuff you've seen with mango before
we've got fast app switching you tap and
hold the back button just get this
simple card like interface you can't
flick the cards off the screen like
webos you can't close them but you can
quickly toggle between various
applications the internet browser has
been updated ie9 with better html5
support faster rendering speed they've
also kept the address bar in landscape
mode so we'll take a look at that in a
second let's just go to pocketnow.com
and as that loads over Wi-Fi we can go
into landscape you can see the browser
bar is there which is nice previously
they took that out in landscape mode and
also the browser bar is on the bottom
now this is quite a deviation from what
other mobile operating systems have done
it's usually always on the top and
Android and iOS and web OS and go down
to the bottom here and load the load the
desktop version of pocket now see how it
handles is graphic intense
web page so of course as that's loading
we can go into our tabs we can move
around and and add new ones and let's
see it load naturally because this is a
beta this doesn't really represent how
fast Windows Phone 7 mango is going to
be in terms of web browsing when we get
final shipping copies will definitely do
it speed test between other operating
systems and Windows Phone 7 mango so
here it's loading a little bit slowly as
you can see we can do a pinch to zoom
everything supported here on the hd2 it
works basically as if it were a stock
mango device besides marketplace and SD
card storage we go back to the home
screen we can fast apps which between
now the browser session sometimes it
takes a second to bring open that card
interface there you go get a little
preview of the website and if we swipe
to the right now we get a little search
bar so we can quickly search for say
calculator and you get your results
right there so you don't have to look
through a really long program list if
you download a lot of third-party apps
so again we'll post a link on how to get
this to work on your HTC hd2 it's great
that with the hd2 if you have one you
can test software before it comes out
and you can experiment and really see
what is coming around the bend so if you
like this video please give us a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
