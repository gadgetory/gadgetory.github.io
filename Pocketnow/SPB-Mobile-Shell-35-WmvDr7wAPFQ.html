Park geun-hye calm and today I'm gonna
show you the new version of spb mobile
shell 3.5 and there's a few other
features that are different to this
program than the spb mobile shell 3.0
and we're just going to couple them
right now so as you can see the layout
for spb mobile shell 3.5 is a little bit
different than the spb mobile shell 3.0
we can no longer flick up to go to a
professional layout we have just our
widget based screens right here and we
actually have three separate screen so
we have this one right here we have our
default screen and then are of course
our right screen and we can change any
of these widgets we can just click and
hold and we can move them around can
change the skin so if wanted to change
the size of them I could so if I want to
make it larger I can on this one but I'm
just gonna leave it small for now click
OK and it will set it we have our
calendar of course and other some other
features we can also add other widgets
to any of these panels that we have we
actually have a Twitter widget so we can
actually change our status on Twitter
some other widgets on this program as
well let's see here anything new not too
much we have a birthday notification and
that's about it we can also show today
I'm going to click on that one because I
like that okay so if I click on show
today it will actually bring me back to
the default today screen on your device
and I can also click back to spp home
okay so we'll scroll back and some of
the icons have changed we actually have
the Communication Manager is changed
it's a little bit more user-friendly now
because all you have to do is click on
one of the buttons to select it either
on or off you can then change though I'm
going to change the bluetooths are
discoverable change the volume just put
it back to normal it looks pretty
similar to the spb mobile shell 3.0 go
back we can also get our weather
information so need to set up your city
of origin and I of course have Seattle
here because that's where I live you can
either get a current forecast or a
four-day forecast and I'll give you a
breakdown of the current day by quarters
so we'll just go back
the carousel on spb mobile shell 3.5 is
a lot more smooth than on the spb mobile
shell 3.0 conclude look at our contact
carousel it's also a lot more smooth and
just flick through some things as you
can see you can also change the pictures
for our context and we can also go to
Facebook camera or to a file like
previously and it also set a ringtone so
just go back and to look at our contacts
it's just like before we have our
contacts set up and we can if we wanted
to can move any of these so let's see
here can edit the layout so if I want to
move some of these people around it can
do that change it into any orientation
you'd like go into the launcher and it's
similar to the spb mobile shell 3.0
except now we have themes on this one so
we can actually pick different colors so
if I want to change the color of my
device and now I have changed the color
and theme throughout my entire device
see here so that's me you can also go to
start and look at programs of course all
your icons and everything have changed
so if I click on one of them as you can
see as orange as well and on the
launcher it also gives you recently
opened applications and just flipped
over to a tile so now we have our
organizer click on there and as you can
see in our calendar tasks or notes just
go back go onto the internet that will
give us our favorites history opera
mobile and Internet Explorer and what
other mobile browsers you have on your
device multimedia can go to media player
camera and pictures go to tools and this
is some of the SPV tools can either soft
reset directly from this program itself
which is actually quite nice if you
don't want to turn off your device or
take out the battery go into our
programs and that's just a list of all
of our programs what's great about this
is it actually shows you the windows
mobile office programs in this file as
well so a lot of the times you have to
go to start and then down to office
mobile but this one actually shows you
the office mobile programs right here so
go back into our settings
this is the spb mobile shell settings as
well as our system settings for our
device so we can go into personal into
our system we can go to messaging and
get our email and text messages so
that's pretty simple go into my
shortcuts this is where you can also you
can add your own shortcuts so if you
wanted to add a program here or a file
let's just click one it's quicker than
easy to set up your favorites so i'll
just go back so that is spb mobile shell
3.5 and i'll post a link on parking
other comments to how to get this the
program does cost around $29.95 but if
you already have the spb mobile shell
3.0 it'll be just a quick and easy
upgrade thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
