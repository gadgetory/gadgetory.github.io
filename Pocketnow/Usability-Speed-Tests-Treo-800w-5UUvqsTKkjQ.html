going to try some tests I made up to see
how easy it is to perform certain tasks
with your smartphone these tests assume
you've already learned how to use your
phone and are proficient with its
functions so gave phone out and follow
along with the videos to see how you do
first we'll try accessing programs like
email contacts and calendar I'm not
going to test making phone calls since
you probably know different people than
i do but email contacts and calendar
programs are pretty standard on
smartphones if you think it will make
your results faster you can preload
applications into the memory so let's
start from off and ready go
that was pretty quick
and you're probably thinking it's not
fair because trio has 10 customizable
application launching shortcuts all
right that's true but as what makes it
real fast now to make it a little harder
let's try launching a program that's
buried within the interface now nothing
with a shortcut nothing that's in the
start menu are ready okay you know
nothing on the home screen if you're
using the blackberry or whatnot so
Google Maps is pretty standard it's
available at google.com / gmm and
there's probably a version available for
your phone whether you're using symbian
or blackberry or iphone comes with it so
let's try that now just to show that i'm
not cheating i'm going to i'm not going
to pre-select it see if i do that that's
that's kind of cheating so i'm going to
put my cursor on some other application
right now go back to homes me so here we
go ready set go
there it is launched
and that was pretty quick so those two
tests let's look at the web browser
that's another thing that we do a lot
with their smartphones and one important
thing is how quickly can you access
favorite usually we have things saved as
favorite so that we can access them
quickly now if you're using a blackberry
I know it remembers the last bookmark
you visited and opens directly to the
bookmark listings if it's the browser's
already been closed that's kind of
cheating we're trying to see how quick
and easy it is to access any bookmark at
any time not just last one you use or
the first one on the list so let's see
how that is on a treo 800w ready set go
there's parking out
I stumbled a little there but it's still
pretty quick I don't care how long it
takes for the web page to load we're
just counting the time it takes from the
home screen to launching the favorite
not actually loading it because you
might have slower connection whatever so
that was a pretty quick too now our last
tests let's look at the media player
let's look at starting a mp3 song now
unless you probably have a weird al song
on there I've got a few hundred songs on
a six gig card in here so we're going to
try to launch a weird out playlist
really quickly so let's try that here we
go
ready go
they're done so you can see how quick
and easy that was I stumbled a little
bit even but um we'll look at the time
down here and see how quick that was if
you think you got a smartphone that's
faster and easier than that go ahead and
post a video response in YouTube and
it'll be great to see how that goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
