now calm and this is a look at Epic
Citadel a free game for iOS devices the
ipad and iphone which has possibly the
most impressive graphics of any mobile
game at least I've ever seen it's free
and it's pretty darn cool let's take a
look okay so this was shown at the apple
keynote event where they talked about
the new ipods so it's going to load up
and it's not actually game it's more so
a demonstration of a new technology or a
new graphics engine that has incredible
detail in the scenery here to see what i
mean in a minute so it's starting up
let's get a little bit closer to the
screen takes a while to load even on the
iphone 4 but let's get to it ok so this
part's kind of choppy but wait till you
see what happens let's get past all this
and we're going to go into this virtual
world that has incredible detail for a
mobile device so here we are we're in
the world and it actually wants me to
tap on a certain area and what's amazing
is the detail in the sky and especially
on the ground usually when you get close
to a ground or some sort of texture in a
in a game you get to see pixels but in
this case yeah that's not the case so we
can actually move around with joysticks
on the screen and let's see if I can do
that from this angle kind of xbox 360
style one one way is look one way is
move a little bit difficult let me get
to a cool room to show you here ok so
here I am just sort of traveling through
a courtyard absolutely beautiful the
framerate is buttery smooth you can see
the ray of Sun there's fire over here
here let's go into this castle area
there's a reflective floor that you just
have to see it's really amazing turn
over to the right and we should get in
there it's a little difficult to control
from this angle and here we are in in
this sort of marble floor droom look how
beautiful the floor is this is
incredible and even if we get really
close to an object it doesn't really get
that pixelated you see a little bit of
a little bit of the detail but I mean
I'm looking at the ground very closely
just a really cool game available for
ipad and iphone again the game is called
epic citadel and it is free not really
game or so of a demonstration of a new
graphic rendering engine that hopefully
will show up in some games in the near
future that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
