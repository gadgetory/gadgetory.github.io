part 3 of the video review for the HP
ipaq 900 series we're going to look into
the usability speed
a little bit on performance on the
device on this edition okay so on to our
video test and as our typical test goes
we're going to practically show you that
our task manager only has windows media
player and obviously I'm on exchange so
activesync has to remain active and I
converted transformers using spb mobile
DVD which use the smallest resolution
for the 2.4 inch screen which would be
20 frames per second under windows
mobile standard resolution and you'll
notice we have no lags yet there's the
first leg right there there's another
one we pretty much get a lag every 15
seconds this is pretty much a really
complicated visual movie so you could
say we're straining the device here and
can I live with this 10 second leg to
watch a movie well I would say yes I
would say it's acceptable that I test
the previous I packs and I've noticed
that definitely video performance on
these devices is not really the best but
I could say this I pack is pretty much
doing better than the others the others
would lag a lot more so it would
probably be your choice into considering
actually watching a movie or sticking
into business with this device
afterwards okay so how fast is it to
play with this baby well we're going to
start to make this fair open the task
manager and show you that everything is
going to start pretty much seamless just
raw so just to make a point here we're
at ninety-two percent of battery power
and I want you to see how the battery
power ends up after 10 minutes of film
because that's pretty much how much it's
going to take me to film this so for
example if we start with a simple speed
test like running an application or go
to programs and then let's see we want
to open ereader which is a application I
use a lot so was this quick or slow its
average I wouldn't consider it the
quickest or snappiest device ever but
it's not slow either for example another
test is for example if we want to send
an email let's do it simple we have a
hardware key here we're going to start
using that and then it's going to take a
little bit to start
and there we go outlook email and then
I'm going to start sending an email to
myself and here we go to new and then we
send it to me which i'm here i'm going
to write tests and then you notice a
little bit of lag eNOS and that happens
a bit not all the time and so here we go
for tests then there goes the email and
now i have to wait for it to arrive now
if we want to start for example windows
media player and check out how much
it'll take to start a song since we
don't have a hardware key we pretty much
have to look for it and here we go to
windows media player and then well i'm a
salsa guy so we're gonna go look for
start typing mark anthony and no that
was not what I was looking for here
comes my email so here we go to mark
anthony and all songs by artists and
we're going to look for this song so was
it fast or slow well as i told you it's
not fast it's not so it's simply average
and here's my email if i want to read my
email right there and there's my test
and there we go if we want it for
example open a contact one of the things
i like about the qrt bar form factors
all i have to do is start typing the
name right there on the today screen and
that's pretty much as simple as it is if
i wanted to start a new contact and
obviously have to go to the contact soft
key and then i go to menu no sorry i
have to go to new outlook contact and
then we're going to make a test contact
test for me and then we're going to
write a simple work fax phone number and
click on the function key 5555 555555
there we go then we just click on ok and
there is me for test right there
that's pretty much simply how you build
a contact if we wanted to start with an
appointment then we would definitely
have to go to the calendar soft key
right here on the side and let's go to
new appointment so this is going to be a
test for me and I want this test on the
12 and it's kind of difficult here so
I'm going to have to start until it that
I want it to be at 1700 hours which is
there and the rest is pretty much going
to stay the same so you could say it's a
bit snappy and opes I have a little bit
of a conflict there in my contacts and
calendar okay so let's go to our p IE
test and again just to make it fair try
to move up here task manager empty look
for p IE and the fair thing would be to
go to program since we don't have a
shortcut key well it was here so I was a
quick one pae and then we're going to
start at going to hold on a second park
it now and here it is see some march
from HP up a beginning which is really
nice really cool i'm using 3g hsdpa from
honduras don't expect it to be as quick
as in the States but they're trying
they're doing their best and here we go
it's loading and it's loading under one
column resolution and there we go not
the snappiest but not the slowest I like
that that was pretty good let's start
and I want to do the same thing on the
midlet manager just to show you how
opera mini performs for a second option
this would be our practically second
application test as i said the midlet
manage is probably one of the best i've
seen yet so here we go and then I know
your Java powered send me opera mini
there we go and we're going to start
here loading pocket now I already have
it loaded on my favorites but let's see
how it goes and then
go menu okay and here we go remember
opera mini goes to a server and then it
renders and then brings it over to the
phone so it'll take it a bit to load and
here we go here comes it's not loading
the fastest I'd expect but it does a
good job and this is pretty much how
opera mini would look on this device
let's exit here and well pretty much
just the NY point as I started after
actually 20 minutes of film this
actually took me more than the average
you'll notice that we started at
eighty-nine percent it's been 15 to 20
minutes of constant usage and we're at
eighty percent of battery power is this
good or bad honestly I feel the device
heating up so HP does really need to
work on this but as I said the battery
power is probably not the best in the
world but that nineteen hundred million
power battery does do a good job this is
pretty much it for our usability test
and performance on the device as I
mentioned not the snappiest device in
the world but honestly in my opinion a
worthy companion for business so stay
tuned for a full review soon here at
