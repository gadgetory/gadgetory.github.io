we love reviewing them we love them but
we don't always talk about the network
architecture required to support these
devices particularly in times of
calamity natural disaster terrorist
attack or what have you
well today in Hartford Connecticut we're
going to show you a little bit about how
a national carrier prepares for those
situations I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is your guided tour
of the AT&amp;amp;T disaster recovery team so
imagine you're in the middle of a
hurricane and your cell phone service
fails or you're trying to get in touch
with family in a disaster area and can't
get through being out of touch is a
scary thing in our ultra connected world
it can be expensive for businesses and
dangerous for those inside disaster
areas that's why AT&amp;amp;T formed the network
disaster recovery team which was first
fully deployed thirteen years ago in the
wake of the September 11th terrorist
attacks the team's mission to get you
reconnected as quickly as possible
following an event that damages the
network in a worst case scenario the
disaster recovery team can replicate the
functionality of an entire disabled or
destroyed central office to do this
takes a lot of hardware the large scale
ndr exercise we're visiting in Hartford
involves about 30 pieces of major
equipment out of about 320 available
nationally and between 70 to 80
personnel on the ground the hardware
comes in from undisclosed locations
strategically placed around the country
and the people from within ATS workforce
all of them having volunteered for
disaster recovery duty this is a broad
look at how the carrier gets
communications up and running after a
major disaster at the first 80 vehicle
to arrive on site after a calamity is
often the ecv or emergency
communications vehicle the ECB is topped
by a satellite antenna for backhaul and
it can use that connection to produce
its own Wi-Fi hotspots or even a micro
cell for cellular communication because
of the limited bandwidth of the
satellite connection it won't replace an
entire central office on its own but it
can help first responders stay connected
with one another five of these ECB's
were set up in the impacted area after
Hurricane sandy providing temporary
Internet access to responders and
victims this one supports the
administrative needs of the entire 7280
person camp here at Hartford running
that camp is a bigger job which calls
for a bigger trailer the operations
trailer serves as the command and
control center for the entire encampment
here the people coordinating disaster
recovery can allocate personnel
depending on what work needs to get done
using microwave satellite or even older
HF radio technology the ops trailer
coordinates with the AT&amp;amp;T global network
operation center in New Jersey to ensure
that the ndr team is working on the most
critical elements of a damaged Network
the operation is conducted in accordance
with the National Incident Management
System providing a consistent experience
between AT&amp;amp;T personnel and first
responders actually restoring those
communications takes specialized
equipment depending on what's been
knocked offline if cellular base
stations better known as towers are down
AT&amp;amp;T can call on its fleet of Sat Colts
within a few hours of arriving at a
disaster area 2 or 3 nd our team members
can activate this cell site on a light
truck to replace damaged or destroyed
cellular towers blanketing an area in 3G
connectivity for AT&amp;amp;T customers at
t-mobile customers can also connect for
emergency calls or other calls and
extreme circumstances but because this
is an HS PA only vehicle the Verizon and
Sprint customers need to rely on their
own carriers emergency preparedness
wireless service isn't all that 18t
provides of course and it's not all the
nd our team focuses on either replacing
a disabled central office also requires
restoring landline data connectivity and
that's where the IP trailers come in the
- we toured and Hartford operate on
different Hardware due to a TTS network
architecture but they both do the same
job replace damaged network connections
so the carrier subscribers in and around
affected areas can communicate again to
do all this takes a lot of power while
most everything in the nd our camp runs
on big batteries for continuity of
service those batteries are charged by a
variety of means if electrical power is
still available inside the disaster area
the team can plug in using its power
distribution trailer to convert and
parcel out that electricity
if not this nd our team can call on a
600 kilowatt
diesel generator and/or to 375 kilowatt
units with fuel provided by vendors
based on prearranged contracts there's
even a trailer for logistical support
kind of a hardware store for the entire
ndr camp everything from lubricating oil
to batteries to bug spray is housed here
alongside a machine shop for a quick
fabrication of simple parts sometimes a
network's equipment isn't destroyed but
instead rendered hazardous to humans
this happened in graniteville South
Carolina during a train derailment in
2005 when chlorine gas rendered a tnt's
central office uninhabitable ND our team
members suited up and performed repairs
and maintenance of the equipment the
team members can also use devices like
these to measure atmospheric
contamination from everything from
common gases to radioactive elements and
act accordingly
we've only scratched the surface of the
nd our team's capabilities considering
its long history and the over 600
million dollars invested in it maybe
that's unsurprising the sense that I got
from talking to everyone involved is
that AT&amp;amp;T takes disaster recovery very
seriously the people working on and with
the nd our team are committed to getting
customers reconnected as quickly as
possible after a major event using the
many means at their disposal remember
they're all volunteers as this video
hits the feeds three members of the team
that we're training in Hartford are now
in Oklahoma working to restore network
connectivity so victims of the tornado
strike can stay in touch and so
emergency responders can better
communicate sometimes all the comfort in
the world can come in the form of a
simple phone call or text message an
AT&amp;amp;T seems to understand that very well
