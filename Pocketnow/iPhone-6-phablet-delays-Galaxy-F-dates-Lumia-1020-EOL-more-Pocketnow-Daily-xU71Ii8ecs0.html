due to some manufacturing issues rumors
point to the nokia lumia 1020 reaching
its end of life soon in the samsung
galaxy f might launch in time to steal
some iphone 6 thunder I'm hi Mary Beth
and because it is monday i need a
lifetime supply of coffee but all at
once today this is parking out daily
today is limited in official news but
there is a deal that is still active
today that could be worth it for you the
Sony Xperia z1 compact is actually the
only mini phone that's not a
watered-down version of its flagship
this is actually the same phone and
specifications compared to the z1 only
in a smaller chassis and it's currently
350 bucks on eBay which is an extremely
amazing price I mean this was a
six-hundred-dollar phone that's now 350
that's a big difference and it's
currently worth it i mean it's pretty
much a z1 in every way looks as for full
details on how to get it and speaking of
sony phones a device that got leaked in
photos today being compared to the
galaxy note is the sony xperia z3 this
phone is planned to be launched at ethan
it's just interesting that sony is
following the six month cycle for
smartphones but yeah it's pretty much
like a z2 only better specifications are
assumed so I from the fact that this
thing is big compared to the note though
it's probably because of the bezel stay
tuned for more rumors as apparently this
will have better inspiring speakers set
from other great specification now one
remember that does have us worried comes
from famous stuff straight legs as
according to him the nokia lumia 1020
will reaches end of life cycle on
September fourteenth and by end of life
we're not really talking about the
losing support we're talking about the
phone are being manufactured anymore we
don't really know what to expect from
its successor we've seen some leaked
photos but they're being attributed to
the Nokia Lumia 830 which is not a
flagship it probably the successor to
the 820 so they too will keep you posted
as we all love the 1020 here now one
very anticipated smartphone for the rest
of the year will be the Samsung Galaxy f
that metallic or aluminum-based Samsung
Galaxy smartphone that's being leaked
recently with chamfered edges and
everything rumors have it that
apparently the phone will be ready for a
launch in time for the iphone 6 in a way
to make it lose its thunder
we don't know exactly how Sam's and
plans to pull that off as some people
are assuming that it'll be launched diva
but then that would steal the thunder of
the galaxy note 4 we don't really know
what to expect other people think that
it'll be launched next one so stay tuned
this is probably not a good time to buy
a galaxy phone I mean got the galaxy s5
the galaxy s5 Prime and then now we have
the F apparently will have a different
name though and finally for the
concerning rumors of the day it seems
that the iphone 6 and it's 5.5 inch
model will be delayed won't be launched
in September according to new reports
and the reasons why I have to do with
manufacturing mainly because apparently
the sapphire glass is not strong enough
to make the phone sturdy enough for fall
aside from issues with its ncell touch
display and also some declaration issues
in the metal chassis which is weird for
bigger phone we don't really know
exactly why Apple is experienced in
these issues but again these are just
reports though that leaves you to the
question of the day how important is
this 5.5 inch iphone for you is it
something that you're waiting for
because some of us for example will be
fine with the 4.7 inch model we don't
really want a phablet but that'll all
depend on how Apple plays its game here
so leave in the comment down below I
mean I don't really want I was 7 on a
bloated phone I would rather have you
know a bigger phone if it were more
useful like a Galaxy Note will see
friends yes you know the drill if you
want to get this earlier before this
video is film achieve all the woes on
 out comment subscribe changing
