headphones I know by now what you're
thinking you'll say that this guy is an
ample hater which is quite far from the
truth I edit all these videos on a
MacBook Pro and my primary computer will
be a MacBook Pro for the time being
mainly because of how much I love Final
Cut Pro I prefer an iPhone when it comes
to social media because of its
convenience I swear by this iPad pro up
to the point where this is what I use
for scripting and work in addition to
the Apple pencil and if I had to
recommend an Apple watch I would blindly
recommend that but watch series for
actually if you saw the list of products
that I've bought from Apple over the
last couple of years you'd even say that
I'm a fanboy so why is it that if I
would classify as such I didn't try air
pods one and I was reluctant to try air
pots too and now I am convinced that I
don't like them it probably is because
I've tried better options but that's not
necessarily your case so you know what I
decided to not rush into a review so not
just jump into giving you a video I
decided to take my time and it's been
nearly two months inside tried air pods
- and I'm hearing that I was pocket now
this is my experience
their pots can be found everywhere I'm
really impressed with the level of
success that these have and one of the
main reasons why I decided to take the
jump is because everybody that I know
claims them to be magical I don't
necessarily agree with that but there
are some things that these headphones do
get right and it actually starts with
designed but not for the reasons that
you think I still find them ugly I still
don't like how they look in your ear but
this design serves a purpose one of the
things that most wireless headphones get
wrong is phone calls these odd sticks
along with some neat beamforming
technology makes these ideal for calls
even in noisy environments it doesn't
matter where I am people say that I
sound just as clear as if I had my phone
in my ear and then another convenience
of this company gets right is honestly
the case seriously if you're gonna give
me true wireless earbuds the whole idea
is that they shouldn't be intrusive
whether I'm wearing them or in my pocket
and nothing comes even close to the case
for air pods you can fit it in the coin
pocket of your jeans and forget that
they're there and even more shocking is
that this small little case gives you 24
hours of charge and can give you up to 3
hours of use in just 15 minutes in each
case think about it is aside from the
certain conveniences after I started
using them the magic started getting
mixed at least for me definitely the
pairing process is cool the first time
you open the case the phone to text them
automatically and then it spreads you're
pairing connection to all your Apple
products through iCloud and Apple's new
h1 ship brings improvements to speed the
process and also have them connect
quicker so sure you will save at least a
few minutes in pairing these with every
other product that you have that's
awesome and I also do love the fact that
you can use Find My iPhone to find these
at least in theory my biggest problem is
that I don't consider it magic that
let's just say if I forget my MacBook
Pro at home or I'm not using it today
and I'm using my iPad if the last
product that I connected to was the
MacBook Pro if I put my air pods on and
it sees that the iPads they
it won't connect automatically I have to
go through the process of going into
settings going into bluetooth connecting
my air pods which pretty much means that
they behave just like every other
Bluetooth earbuds that is exactly the
same process so aside from pairing where
is the magic and then another thing that
I've mixed about is the controls again
if you're in the Apple ecosystem you're
fine you can use your Apple watch to
control your music so the fact that the
controls are limited to different double
taps on each ear won't really bother you
but if you don't have an Apple watch
then it's really bad either you use your
phone or you'll have to pick one control
or another and don't even try to raise
or lower the volume without being
frustrated and true there is a Siri to
be able to call on your assistant but
even that is more of a phone
functionality if you look into it but
then we shift things into what I don't
like about air pods and it really is the
fit and I know your mileage may vary I
have big ears and so they fall off from
one ear and not necessarily from the
other but seriously I even gave silicone
buds a try to see if that would help the
fit and while they did initially the
moisture in your ear makes them a bigger
problem after a few days of use and then
if you get the ones with the wings it's
hard to put them on and then align the
ports and they don't fit in the case so
you'll have to take them off every
single time every other company
addresses this by providing different
tips because not everybody has the same
ears sadly not Apple but in Apple's
defense there is one single benefit to
the bad fit that these air pods have and
it's really the fact that if you think
about it once you use those silicone
tips on other headphones there comes a
point after a few hours where they do
become uncomfortable that's one thing
that I do like about air pods you forget
that they're there and hopefully that
doesn't mean that they fell off but
that's just I guess a benefit but you
know it also includes a downside as it
seems that Apple solution for the bat
fit is over cranking the audio go below
100% and they're 210 II go to a hundred
percent of there comes a point where I
feel your pain and that's something you
don't want to play with you know damage
your ear is irreversible and then there
are the limitations of Bluetooth sure
the h1 ship brings connectivity benefits
but at some point I did think that my
MacBook Pro was lagging when video
editing and then I noticed that that
wasn't the problem the problem is that
Apple's solution to not show you that
there is lag and Bluetooth connection
with your air pods is to slow the
playback of video to align with the air
pods so don't use air pods and you'll
notice that your Mac performs so much
better while you're doing anything
that's graphic intensive and then match
that with the fact that there is zero
and I mean zero noise cancellation here
and that's when I really scratch my head
when I see people using these in the
subway I mean how can people go by
listening to their music if the
experience in noisy environments is so
bad and then an apple's defense I will
tell you I've tried lots of other true
wireless earbuds these are the only ones
that remain fully connected all the time
doesn't matter if I put my phone in the
pocket or whatever these remain
connected whereas that's not necessarily
my experience with other competitors
overall after of my extensive views I
sadly cannot recommend air pots too as
they are once the pairing process is
done there's really not much magic left
here to consider that you're getting a
better product for the same $200 that
you can pay for other brands at a time
when the galaxy buds offer the same
pairing experience and when alternatives
from Jabra an earring offer far better
fitting audio quality it's really hard
to recommend these and for those of you
that own air pods one keep them this is
not the upgrade you're looking for and
you can buy this wireless charging case
for a little money extra let us know
what you think about air pots - in the
comments down below we're actually
considering making a video of all the
alternatives that I've tried just to
give you an idea of the better options
that are out there let us know if you
would be interested in watching that and
