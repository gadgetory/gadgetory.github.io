services for games and then pulls them
the iphone for a source to become the
most popular camera &amp;amp; more rumours of
the ipad 3 Retina Display come around
all this and more coming up right now
hello everybody I'm hi Melanie better
than welcome to the pocket nail I review
the show we go through all this week
school and they're not so cool inside
the world of Apple's iOS devices let
start this week off with the cool and
ipad 3 for early next year is all
everyone is talking about lately as we
mentioned last week the biggest news is
Apple finally bring their retina display
for their next tablet even though we
think the implementation is going to be
a little ahead of this time for current
HD standards that we find on any typical
TV rumors have it that if Apple brings
this to the table they'll be using sharp
as their screen supplier for the next
generation display and well it makes a
little more sense having sharp coming up
with that so qxg a seems to be the
resolution for their next display so
time will tell speaking of the iPad just
how well is the tablet competition for
Apple well the NPD group just came with
some eye-opening results that you'll
definitely love to know they mentioned
that in the first 11 months of the year
the amount of sales of non iPad tablets
climbed to 1.2 million units and guess
what a lot of that sales came from the
HP TouchPad fire sale for 99 bucks that
we know everybody went crazy for now
even though Apple doesn't release the
results for each country apple sold 11.2
million eyepatch just last quarter alone
so I guess analysts are right every time
they say that people are not after
tablets thereafter iPads rumors having
that Apple is considering the ability to
sell a 7-inch tablet but sadly seeing
that competition is not really doing
well in seven-inch market it does seem
to be just a rumor but again let's see
how the amazon kindle fire sales and
well let's see if Apple comes up with a
competitor for that the iphone 4s keeps
soaring stores is even the first
brazilian manufactured iphones begin to
make the scene from their first Foxconn
plan on this side of the planet
and wall aside from that remember the
iphone 4 recently took the number one
spot as the preferred camera on flickr
and we'll guess which device just made
the number two spot you guess that it's
the iphone 4s so far the device didn't
really bring anything groundbreaking to
the market but it seems that people
can't stop buying it so far hey just
before we get into the not-so-cool
section have a look at this case apple
recently released their subscription
services for games we can pay a flat fee
to developers to use their games every
month with a limited access though sadly
the irony is that Apple yanked that
service just a couple of days later and
the questions why could it be that
developers began moving their
subscription plants to all apps together
and actually hindering sales from the
App Store or has apple recently just
lost their mind I mean honestly on my
opinion I'm glad they yanked the service
because obviously developers are just
making more and more money but again it
seems that Apple hasn't come on record
as to why they did it so let's hope they
either pull it back for some people that
are actually benefited on that or keep
it there I don't mind not having it
that does it for the coolants continue
on with the not so cool Samsung seems to
be giving Apple a little dose of their
own medicine remember those old imum
akima PC ads were Apple used to mock
Windows Vista customers because of all
the flaws well Samsung just brought a
new ad where customers are making fun of
Apple customers because while they're
making lines for crazy device that
didn't really change over the years and
well it's kind of ironic i'm not really
sure marketing tactics were well there
but think about it i mean if you pull
those old i'm a mac ads well it does
seem that apple had it waiting for them
and i'm wondering actually why
competition took so long the ads are
kind of funny actually and hey it seems
that the list of problems with the
iphone 4s is still giving us something
to talk about customers are now
complaining about Wi-Fi issues with the
device and you wonder where is ios 5.1
point2 to deal with all these problems
Apple really needs to step their game up
with the problems because obviously a
lot of customers are complaining and
it's even becoming a problem with the
iphone for customers i'm having Wi-Fi
issues so i'm wondering where's my fix
apple that's it for today's show thank
you very much for watching I'm Hyneman
ivetta remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
