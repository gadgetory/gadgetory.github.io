bogus to prove what those schematics
might look like vics we get smarter in
Korea Samson continues to push words
relevance and boy do we have an insane
list of seals for today I'm high metal
Iveta and my brother is cruel joke today
was that he will give me a bucket of
beer for every goal that Barcelona
scores in the Champions on Saturday
thank you
this is parking out daily the official
lose today start with an insane amount
of deals if you're in the market for an
iPhone 7 or any sort of iPhone the 256
gigabyte variant of the iPhone 7 is
currently on sale on t-mobile you get
buy one get one free for the iPhone se
both devices that are close to a revamp
but still really good options to
consider a very interesting deal comes
from the Microsoft Surface pro 4 on eBay
this is probably my favorite computer
spilt so far if you're in the market for
one six hundred and sixty dollars for
the core i5 variants and there are deals
for the other variants of your
interested as well I would highly
suggest you consider regardless if we've
got a new one right now and how about if
we add Verizon to the list this company
is not famous for deals but currently it
published its trade-in program devices
that you can bring which is fine you can
see in the link in the description but
in addition to that the company also
took the time to tell us that it's
giving out a free Google home if you go
for any Google pixel and given the fact
that the Google's home has been given
out for free to pretty much everyone
lately I might want to get me one as
well now let's talk about Samsung and
Bixby yesterday we discussed the fact
that well it's not really launching in
Samsung's time frame but regardless the
company has just announced that in Korea
at least think the Samsung pay in
samsung past you are now able to send
payments through your voice using vic
speed that's one of the features that
was teased recently and obviously we're
just waiting for vic speed to actually
work everywhere else samsung and finally
the very interesting news today have to
do with some leaked images of a probable
dummy of the iphone 8 and bear in mind
i'm actually thinking that this is the
iPhone 7s instead or 7 + S or whatever
that things going to be called we see
the vertical camera hump which is
horrible we see the possible
print scanner at the bottom of the Apple
logo but the thing is this phone is not
made of glass the teasers are that the
next generation iPhone 8 will be made of
glass in the back and we have this 18
point 5 by 9 display that I doubt is
going to be the real deal
I mean hey if anybody just put together
the schematics that were leaked and
decided to make a dummy out of it this
makes a lot of sense but it leads me to
the question of the day I mean think
about it look at the images tell us do
you think that this device is real or
it's just somebody that made this dummy
out of a 3d printer in my case I think
they're bogus honestly or this could
just be the iPhone 7s plus and Apple
wants to make it so ugly to compel
people to buy the most expensive one
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion
French another way it goes if you want
to get the news earlier before the video
was filmed hello was not talking our
comm and hit that subscribe button down
