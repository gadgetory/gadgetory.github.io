pocketnow.com if you've got a samsung
galaxy s3 you're going to get an
over-the-air update to jelly bean in the
very near future as promised by Samsung
and that's great because jelly bean
makes Android so much better especially
on an awesome phone a powerful phone
like the galaxy s3 we've got the
official version of TouchWiz running
with jelly bean here on this galaxy s3
and we're going to talk about it in this
video we're also going to compare it to
Ice Cream Sandwich TouchWiz on this
galaxy s3 so you can see what the
difference will be a day-to-day use from
Ice Cream Sandwich to jelly bean on your
galaxy s3 so let's get to the video ok
and here we are and this is the
international quad-core galaxy s3 and
it's running the full version of
TouchWiz with jelly bean and let's just
confirm that we're going to go over to
the settings go into about device they
kind of hid it behind a secondary menu
as you can see here Android 4.1.1 and
this is full TouchWiz make no mistake
about it this is what you're going to
see when you get TouchWiz over-the-air
or jelly bean over-the-air on your
Galaxy s3 let's just move around the
operating system a little bit to see if
it's really as fast and fluid as we've
seen already on jellybean then we're
going to compare it to Ice Cream
Sandwich so you know exactly what to
expect so let's just move around on the
app tray we'll launch some applications
just try to get a sense for how fast
things are so go into the browser here
we're load up Engadget just move around
the page and we really do get that jelly
bean buttery smoothness as you can see
there are no checker boards on the
galaxy s3 with Ice Cream Sandwich you'll
get a little bit of checker boards so
there's not much of a difference there
and we'll do a comparison in a sec but
scrolling and moving around on the
screen just has gotten much better with
jelly bean on the galaxy s3 I mean web
browsing is super smooth it's going to
landscape that's quite fast as well
let's zoom back out just kind of move
around in the various screens and this
this was always smooth an Ice Cream
Sandwich
okay now let's bring in the Ice Cream
Sandwich version and as you can tell
they're pretty much set up the exact
same way for all intents and purposes
they are factory reset stock and fresh
so we're going to launch a variety of
programs we're going to go into web
browsing speed and really see the
difference again on the right we've got
jelly bean on the Left we've got Ice
Cream Sandwich so let's launch the
camera app everything should be faster
in jelly bean on the right the device
should be faster let's see it was
actually faster there in Ice Cream
Sandwich that is interesting
let's do pinch to zoom a little bit
faster on jelly bean swiping to the
right
I did notice earlier than an Ice Cream
Sandwich going from this frame to this
frame you can actually see some frames
which is not really what you want to see
it should be just a smooth motion but in
jelly bean maybe you can see that on the
video it's a little stuttery towards the
end of the animation again these are
subtle things the Galaxy s3 is already
grateful let's move around the the
operating system see what has changed
first things first we go into the
multitask UI and now we have Google now
down here that we can go in so you've
got the features of Google now relevant
information based on what's going on
we've also got some new icons we can
press the delete button to delete all
the open apps kind of like this button
does over there and over here we've got
a task mounted your button so really
it's just the addition of the Google Now
button to the task task list here
let's not chaps see which opens faster
ok slightly faster with jelly bean and
as you can see there's a new divider up
here there's a lot of really small
little things in jelly bean with
TouchWiz like this divider here but
beyond that things are pretty much the
same let's take a look at folder opening
speed because that's always a thing in
Ice Cream Sandwich that seems to be a
little bit slower than then should take
so cancel that drag and drop of course
in TouchWiz in order to make a new
folder you actually have to tap and
there should be an option here to make a
new folder create folder ok there's a
folder let's put some stuff in there put
three things in there ok and we'll move
this over here now let's actually
discard that does it have the flick
gesture and jelly let's see now it
doesn't
ok that's
so tap-in hold and we can actually make
a new folder with the tap and hold just
make a new folder name okay here's our
folder it looks a little bit different
here in jelly beans so we're going to
add some stuff to it let's put the Play
Store in there boom let's put the S Memo
in there and then let's put the okay so
now I've got a folder over here and a
folder over here let's see which opens
faster it's interesting and jelly bean
they added an animation which actually
serves to slow things down a little bit
which is strange and of course you can
turn off animations the folder itself
the frame is loading at the same speed
but in jelly bean you get that secondary
animation which is actually kind of
annoying folder style has actually
changed too now you can see sort of a
stacked view of your icons versus an
ice-cream sandwich you kind of see tiny
little preview thumbnails of your icons
within the folder let's take a look at
the keyboard see if that's changed at
all okay so this t9 trace comes up and
trace is still here in jelly bean and
the keyboard looks about the same it's
the same height it's got the same
buttons nothing has changed in the
keyboard let's go into the settings
because a lot has moved around in
settings so as you can see here in jelly
bean we have a share and transfer link
right here whereas before that was all
located in this secondary screen so if
you want to share and transfer you have
your SBM settings your NFC settings just
kind of the things have been moved
around a little bit and as you can see
over here in Ice Cream Sandwich we've
wallpapers the third item and lockscreen
is the third item here in jellybean then
we've got this more Settings button
under personalization and we can turn on
and off the LED indicator and specify
what it blinks for scroll down a little
bit more and see what else we have under
personal there's no more personal here
in oh it's under personalization that's
kind of a different thing so settings
have been moved around and jellybean
really doesn't matter let's test the
speed of going back to the home screen
ready go okay it was actually faster
it's kind of funny it's faster in some
ways an Ice Cream Sandwich let's go to
the browser and compare web browsing
speed we're going to hit up pocket now
see which gets there faster
see which is smoother scrolling around
on the screen no we don't want Pizza Hut
we want to pocketnow.com okay let's go
it's probably gonna ask to select the
site okay that went right to the mobile
site will go there and again little
things have changed between jellybean
and Ice Cream Sandwich on the galaxy s3
like the bookmark button is on the right
now versus on the left there there's a
back and forward button in the browser
which is I guess a nice touch
beyond that not much has changed we go
down to the bottom go back go to the
desktop site see which loads fat first
let's go one two three go
okay they did go at the same time really
curious to see which goes to the site
first while the same Wi-Fi network so
that should be equal and they look very
similar okay jelly bean finished a
little bit faster still loading here on
Ice Cream Sandwich and we will wait
until it loads before we move around on
the page and test the smoothness of
everything okay it's finally done so
let's move down the page very very
similar web browsing performance let's
see how long text takes to clear up a
little bit faster and Ice Cream Sandwich
this is kind of crazy how in some cases
Ice Cream Sandwich is faster in some
cases a lot of the UI stuff jelly bean
is faster but things like web browsing
speed it looks like jelly beans extra
faster so let's move Oh TouchWiz home
has stopped okay that's a crash that's
not good so let's go into this headline
and see what we get before jelly bean
was faster and loading the page and it
looks like we're not the same result
actually
okay jelly being finished slightly
faster but not by much zooming in clears
up a little bit faster on Ice Cream
Sandwich and that is actually really
funny so as you can see there's not a
huge difference between jellybean on the
galaxy s3 and Ice Cream Sandwich on the
galaxy s3 this is probably because the
galaxy s3 is a really fast really great
phone to begin with it's very well
optimized even with Ice Cream Sandwich
you definitely get a lot of smoother
interaction you get that sense that you
really can't see through a video of the
UI being just a whole lot faster in
jellybean
things are just more responsive they
seem to respond a lot better to your
touches than you would an Ice Cream
Sandwich where you get that UI lag once
in a while but overall besides the
additional features which are nice like
Google now and sort of things moved
around a bit there's not that big of a
difference between jellybean on the
galaxy s3 and Ice Cream Sandwich on the
jelly on the galaxy s3 of course you can
always route your phone if you want a
totally different experience really
optimized for speed but CyanogenMod 10
on it of course we always recommend
doing that if you've got if you're a
little bit brave and you want to do that
kind of thing we'll put a link up on the
video to show you what CyanogenMod 10 is
like on the galaxy s3 so if you like
this video please give us a thumbs up
and once you get jelly bean on your
Galaxy s3 drop a comment and let us know
how you like it and how it's working out
for you it's a very exciting update and
it's coming very soon to your Galaxy s3
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and thanks for watching that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
