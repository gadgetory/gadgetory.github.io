pretty picture for Apple this year
Samsung is apparently working on not two
but three galaxy s seven units and HTC
claims that no matter what will always
see its brand I'm hi Mary that I and if
I look funny trust me I looked funnier
last night this is parking out daily
those of you worried about the future of
HTC the official news that I have to do
with the company CEO chair Wang on
record stating that the company is not
going anywhere that they are still
pushing regardless of their results and
regardless of everything and that we can
expect more from the company coming soon
that she's not going to let the brand
just go away and if you remember the
fact that her father is the the
wealthiest guy in Taiwan and she's the
second wealthiest yeah that is most
likely gonna be the case and if you
don't see me smiling when it comes to
giving news about HP that's because I
never have much faith in them in mobile
they kill palm and compaq and so many
others but anyways we've got more rumors
on the HP falcon which apparently is the
company's a windows 10 mobile device not
exactly sure when we're getting it but
apparently it will have a snapdragon 820
three gigs of ram and all other good
specifications for those of you who
actually care about HP and please don't
go crazy raising your hands and then
when it comes to all four of you out
there crazy about the future of google
glass and yeah I know don't go crazy
we've got more rumors particularly
because well it seems that google had
filed some confidential documents in the
FCC six months ago up to the point where
these expire their confidentiality and
today we learn about the future we see
new designs where we haven't articulated
heads-up display for the future google
glass in addition to other things but
the biggest question is how come six
months went by and we never got to see
the new version of google glass we'll
see if we get something in 2016 and then
when it comes to samsung galaxy s7
rumors are going crazy and this time we
hear a little bit of a contradiction
with regards to what we talked about
yesterday first of all it seems the
galaxy s7 will have the same size as the
current one meaning it's pretty much
going to be the same design and then it
seems that we are getting the plus
variant but this is going to be a six
inch device and
we are going to get a 5.5 inch unit
which is apparently going to be the
curved edge display it's extremely hard
to predict right now what we're getting
but then again given the fact that this
is Samsung we know that the more phones
they launch the better in their
mentality so stay tuned hopefully we
learn something at CES and finally the
very hot news today have to do with
Apple as if you remember those news of
analyst predicting that Apple was going
to start seeing a sales slump in 2016
well analysts are now predicting that
it's also going to happen right now as
there was a sales forecast of 80 million
units from when the iphone success was
launched in September to the end of the
year and now it seems that it's going to
be more or less 72 million units which
is actually two million below what Apple
was able to achieve for that same period
last year and this would be the first
sales slump in iphone history which is
major news of it this happen but it
leads me to the question of the day so
hey if Apple is selling less and Samsung
is selling less what do you think is
being most disruptive in the smartphone
market right now up to the point where
you know these companies are not selling
well in my case I think it's all this
premium mid-range change that has you
know begun happening with companies like
oppa lenovo me you know and others but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think has a disrupted the market the
most friends as always you know the
drill t wanna get the news earlier
before this video was filmed make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com it
subscription channel as well it follow
me on twitter Jaime underscore to be
better on Instagram at high memory data
