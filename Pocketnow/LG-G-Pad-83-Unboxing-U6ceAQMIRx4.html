tablets and I don't really understand
why they built some great displays so
much so that the iPad is powered by them
so when they finally announced the
tablet at Aoife I'll admit I was very
excited so I'm hiding out of ivenna this
is PocketNow and these are unboxing of
the LG G pad 8.3 so I'll admit that when
I pull this out of the UPS Box I was
amazed at how narrow this box is so this
is definitely a long tablet and not a
wide one you got some specifications the
usual details and sadly this is a second
batch unit some outlets and OEMs are
having trouble getting us reviewed and
it's on time and we really appreciate
them going out of their way to get us
one as soon as they could so this is G
pad 8.3 left this aluminum finish at the
back love the plastic finish and the
contrast between these we have the
speakers back here that we're definitely
to be testing 5 megapixel camera here
and we get these light bezels and
definitely this looks like a big LG g2
and I am a big fan of the g2 I really
can't wait to start using this tablet so
let's see if there is some juice in it
here other than that we know the usual
tablets shipped with bare minimums all
we get is a wall ward we get a USB
syncing cable and we get this 8.3 inch
1920 by 1200 display I'm gonna get a
little sound as the usual yeah
Snapdragon 600 processor in this tablet
not 800 I will see how that performs 2
gigs of ram 16 gigs of storage and there
is expandable memory here at the top
there's an IR blaster as well other than
that this is a very simple tablet and
yes I know you're running out of battery
viewing angles this is an IPS display
like in the iPad are that really not bad
at all but this tablet will cost you 350
bucks so obviously you're trying to
compare this against the Nexus 7 which
is $150 cheaper but you also have the
iPad Mini which will cost you somewhere
around there as well $3.00 already so so
far let's see the mini is definitely
wider than this G pad 8.3 and
definitely mmm it's gonna be a tough one
it is slimmer than the G pad 8.3 as well
but I do like how substantial the G pad
feels I do love also this long display I
don't like Y displays because they're
not really easy to carry in the back
pocket of your jeans but so far we're
definitely gonna be putting this tablet
to the test I will admit that my first
impressions are actually positive I
especially love the materials I love the
design so we'll keep you posted and our
review should be out very soon that's it
for our unboxing of the G pad 8.3 we'll
definitely spend some quality time with
it in the next coming day so make sure
you leave your questions in the comments
