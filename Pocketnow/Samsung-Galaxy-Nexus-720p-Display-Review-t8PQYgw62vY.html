pocketnow.com the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
has an extremely high resolution display
1280 pixel is down by 720 pixels across
it's a true 720p display which is kind
of crazy if you think about it because
there are 42 inch plasmas and LCD
screens out there that you watch TV on
that have this resolution yet Samsung
was able to pack it into a small 4.6
inch screen which means that images are
super crisp and clear text is ultra
sharp and you can fit a lot on the
screen at one time so in this video
we're going to talk all about the 720p
display whether it makes a difference
we're going to compare it to other
devices and talk about how it performs
when reading a book when browsing the
web when looking at photos and when
watching videos so let's get to it
so here we have the samsung galaxy s2
the Galaxy Nexus also by Samsung in the
iphone 4s all three of these devices
have a very different screen technology
that lend to different qualities so the
iphone 4 has a what Apple calls a Retina
Display it's an LCD display with IPS
technology for better viewing angle the
sub-pixel configuration meaning what
makes up the little pixels is RGB so
each pixel has its own set of sub-pixels
to make up each pixel on the Galaxy
Nexus we have a pentile display it's
called the samsung super-mo LED HD
screen it doesn't have the plus which
means that it's not the RGB sub-pixel
configuration like you do find on the
galaxy s2 which means that sub pixels
are actually shared and as you're going
to see the screen isn't as amazingly
crisp as you think it would be because
of this sub pixel configuration you
especially get to see a little bit of
graininess when you look at text and
finally on the samsung galaxy s2 here
we've got the super amoled plus
Samsung's best screen and it is using
the RGB sub-pixel configuration very
different resolutions here we've got
wvga 800 down 480 across the galaxy
nexus it is 1280 down and 720 across the
highest of the three and over here the
iphone 4s of course is 960 down by 540
across so we're going to start off with
a book here we're going to go into the
Kindle application and we're turned to
the exact same page on all of these
devices and we're set to the smallest
text size so right off the bat you can
see that you can read a lot more at one
time on the Galaxy Nexus just because
the screen is higher resolution in this
direction it's 1280 pixels down so you
look at where they start they all start
in the same area who's this goes down to
everyone which is right here and over
here it's probably on the next page
let's see where's that word everyone it
is right here everyone and this goes far
beyond that word everyone you get
another one two three four five six
seven lines on the Galaxy Nexus now how
is the text house
text to look on the screen fortunately
this camera has some really good zoom so
I'm going to bring this bring this in a
little bit you can get a sense for how
these letters look okay so take a look
at those letters very crisp and smooth
you can't see any pixels even with a
magnifying glass on the iphone 4 okay so
let's take a look at the screen on the
galaxy s2 also quite smooth but you
begin to see pixels because we're only
dealing with an 800 x 480 panel if you
look around the the the W they're sort
of where the the W goes up and down you
can see pixels that comprise that letter
so not as good as the iphone and here
with the higher resolution pentile
display of the Galaxy Nexus it's kind of
a combination of both of these other
devices you can see pixels if you look
very closely but it looks very smooth
not as smooth as it should look for
having such a high resolution display
and again that's happening because of
this pentile sub pixel display
configuration in daily practice you
really don't notice it that much if you
have really great eyesight you're
probably going to notice that the screen
is a tiny bit grainy compared to how it
should be with so many pixels on the
screen so let's talk about how videos
look so we've got a really really high
resolution video pulled up here on
youtube so you can get a sense for how
the videos look on all of these screens
and you can take a look at color and
detail and things like that so let's
zoom in a bit and we're going to play
the video and we're going to throw them
into landscape so try to play them at
the same time it's a google video
they're all set to the high quality
setting and they're all going to go
ahead and play so click them all into
landscape so they all fit on the frame
here
such and so slide off the iphone for a
second take a look at the Super AMOLED
versus the super amoled plus are
actually Super AMOLED HD versus the
super amoled plus a little bit while
you're here potentially slightly better
contrast but if you look at that clarity
on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus it's obscene
this is playing in full HD all pixels
are being used on the screen all 1280 by
720 when we get back to the shot of
persons face you're really going to be
able to tell just how crisp and clear
this is it's like having an HD TV in
your pocket and hopefully that's coming
across on video on galaxy s2 it's still
very crisp and clear but it's just not
as I popping as on the Galaxy Nexus
let's bring over the iphone of course
with a strange aspect ratio of the
iphone I'm or before by three aspect
ratio you get bars on the top in the
bottom it really doesn't maximize the
view that's best for it a little bit so
hard around the same spot much much much
better viewing experience on the Galaxy
Nexus with that high resolution a 2-foot
65 inch display and no glass bars so
here we have those same web page load
and all on all three of these devices
that I'm trying to keep the URL bar
hidden so we're maximized in screen
space and as you can see you see about
the same on both Samsung devices we're
going down to this story here you can
see kind of down the same page the same
amount but what's different between
these two devices is on the Galaxy Nexus
you can actually read the text here on
the screen hopefully the camera can
focus whereas on the galaxy s2 you can't
read the text the pitlor there are not
enough pixels to make up these tiny tiny
letters for you for you to be able to
see the web page in this zoomed up view
on the iphone 4s like the Galaxy Nexus
you can read texts in the zoomed out
view it's very difficult and if you have
trouble seeing you're probably going to
need to put on your glasses but it's
there and you can see it now let's look
at color reproduction and contrast and
that sort of thing you can't beat the
super
led in terms of contrast blacks are
ultra black if you kind of look over
here at this device and that device and
then over here on the iPhone blacks are
kind of like a dark dark dark dark gray
so high marks for web browsing thanks to
the 720p display and it gets even better
when you put it into landscape because
now if you couldn't read the text before
in the zoomed out view you definitely
can because things get bigger and and
easier to read in this wider screen view
when you flip into full landscape
orientation and finally we've got the
same image up here on the screen it's a
1920 x 1080 image and let's zoom in and
see how the photo looks when we get full
screen very close to a lot of detail
let's try to get the nose exactly the
same on all the screens you can kind of
compare the level of detail the quality
of the color and the contrast between
these three and decide for yourself
which one looks the best here naturally
I'm going to say that the middle then
the Galaxy Nexus looks the best here
just because it's clear crisper the skin
tone looks a little bit more natural
here on the Galaxy Nexus the blue eye
looks a little bit more blue of course
the contrast on both of these devices
seems to be better than what you get on
the iphone 4s if you look at the glasses
here on the iphone for us the black is
not very black it's just a very very
dark grain you get deeper blacks here in
the Super AMOLED screens now in terms of
the sub-pixel configuration let's get
really close on this guy's eye and I'm
going to bring the camera close and I
don't want to go past the point of the
resolution of the image and I'm gonna
bring the camera close to both of these
let's zoom in and you can kind of see
for yourself if you can tell the
difference between the pentile
configuration here of the sub-pixels and
RGB here on the galaxy s2 very tough to
tell right here it really comes through
with text like I said earlier you're
looking at texts you've a very sharp eye
you can notice that the text just
doesn't seem to be as crisp and clear as
you would expect with a 720p display if
you liked this video please give us a
thumbs up and if you want to see a web
browser comparison with the Galaxy Nexus
and these other devices we just showed
you put a link up here
and if you want to see the latest and
greatest features of Android Ice Cream
Sandwich will put a link up over here
thanks for watching and that's it for
now
