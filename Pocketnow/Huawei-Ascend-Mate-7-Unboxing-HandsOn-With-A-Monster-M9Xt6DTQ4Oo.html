confused by the messaging behind
Huawei's latest super phone well so are
we but with so many features to rundown
let's not get mired in marketing hmm i'm
michael fisher ready for 2014 this is
PocketNow and this is our unboxing and
first hands-on of the huawei ascend mate
7 if the ascend mate 2 that we reviewed
a few months back is the phone that
lasts all weekend
then the mate 7 with its 4100 milliamp
hour battery pack is the phone that
lasts even longer like say the duration
of a tradeshow
that's why weighs thinking apparently as
the company's gifted mate sevens to
everyone in attendance at today's press
event in Berlin so now that pocket now
has a unit in house we thought we'd go
outside and unbox it one thing will
safer huawei the company has learned how
to package in a very premium fashion
every part of the unboxing experience is
high-quality from the cardboard to the
bundled accessories then even the
iconography is done in a classy
minimalism picking the phone up for the
first time we're struck by how much it
doesn't feel like a 7-inch device well
that's because it isn't it's a 6 inch
screen so why Huawei called it the mate
7 is a mystery we'll try to solve here
later on but even at 6 inches that's a
huge phone and yet the mate 7 feels
pretty manageable in the hand thanks to
its super tiny bezels and even though it
bears more than a passing resemblance to
a certain oversized
HTC phone from last year the mate 7 also
feels really nice in the hand with its
single piece metal back cover and
diamond-cut chamfers and the newest
version of the emotion UI is actually
really really striking it might be one
of our favorite parts of the device in
our early impressions phase even if you
don't like this theme there are
literally hundreds of others to choose
from we're going to have a full review
of the mid 7 up after Aoife so for now
we'll just say that if you can think of
a feature or component Huawei is
probably thrown it in here from dual sim
to octa core LTE cat 6 to a 13 megapixel
camera from a fingerprint scanner to
a groovy camera Huawei has thrown the
kitchen sink into this phone and we're
really looking forward to testing it out
and one of the more challenging review
environments ever we've got a lot more
from Huawei and everyone else here in
Berlin stay tuned for more from pocket
now and follow us on social media so you
don't miss a thing until next time this
has been michael fisher with pocket now
captain to phones on twitter thanks for
watching and we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
