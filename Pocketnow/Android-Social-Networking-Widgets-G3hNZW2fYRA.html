calm and are you really a good friend if
you don't know what's going on the lives
of all your other friends today I've got
a couple of widgets that might just help
you be a better friend the first one is
for a social network that you may have
heard of it's called Facebook apparently
it's really popular with that comes a
widget and this widget shows you really
going kind of quickly the latest post of
the people that you're following and it
lets you scroll through and see I'm
scrolling here really fast through a
whole bunch I don't know how many that
was but a dozen or more of the posts of
all of your friends so it's really kind
of neat one thing that I like it's a
four by two widget it's nice it's pretty
lets you share what's on your mind kind
of quick we're going to use the nexus
one voice recognition on this and put it
to a real-time test i'm recording a
widgets video for pocketnow.com and look
at that did really great well go ahead
and share that since publishing and my
post was successful so all kinds of
great i'm going to go ahead and move
that up here to make room for the next
one I'm really not much of a facebook
guy I'm more of a Twitter guy myself so
I'm going to show you a nap here called
Twitter that comes with widgets but the
widgets only come with a paid version or
the premium versions they call it now
the premium version is just a unlock
code basically you download the free
version of the app you configure it you
buy the premium key and then you have
access to the widgets and some other
features like multiple account support
and whatnot but for a couple bucks
having these really cool widgets is kind
of neat now I said it was a Twitter
widget but it's not the Twitter widget
it's by level up Studios the same people
that brought you beautiful widgets that
I showed you in a previous video this
guy's from France
so he spells Twitter with kind of a
French flair and since I showed you the
four by two widget of the Facebook
widget I'm going to also pick the four
by two widget of the Twitter widget the
first thing that that you'll see when
you're loading up this widget is it has
a help screen and I think you're going
to start seeing this more and more
frequently when you drop a complicated
widget or perhaps I just say a widget
that has a lot of features sometimes it
takes a while to get used to it and to
figure out how to use it so having just
a one screen overview to show you how to
use this thing is really nice in this
case you can see you can tap on any of
the tweets to open that tweet up in the
Twitter app you can tap over on the left
to write your own tweet tap down in the
bottom middle to refresh from the server
get all the latest tweets and then over
on the right to scroll through an
additional screen of tweets so we'll say
okay and it'll drop that right on the
page this is it right down here you'll
notice just like the Facebook widget
there's no transparency or translucency
which would be nice but it's not
necessary in my opinion so you can see
here I've got my latest three tweets one
from Guy Kawasaki and oh just like that
it changed to the second page I can tap
down here to scroll through additional
pages and its really pretty quick I can
scroll through a whole bunch of pages
really fast and see at a glance what all
the people that I'm following you're
doing if we can't let me see if I can
find a nice linear this is kind of real
time so let's go into chris pirillo will
tap on his tweet it launches that full
app and up here at the top is the chris
pirillo tweet that we were just looking
at let's go back home and i want to show
you just like I did with facebook app
how we can quickly post a tweet so we'll
tap over there on the left again the
tutorial showed us how tap up here I'm
recording a video for pocketnow.com a
little bit of recognition there you go I
can attach a picture to it if I want I
can shrink a URL or a link if I want
using bit ly or some other
preconfigured URL shortening service and
of course then I can send it and right
away it says that my status update has
been sent so a quick look at to social
networking widgets the stock one from
facebook and then a paid for or premium
version from level up studios for
twitter i like them both very very much
and it kind of adds a really quick
glance to see what's going on in the
life of your friends and we all know
that the information that your friends
give you are the most important
information to you so it's good to have
that right there on your home screen so
I'm interested to see what you use for
your widgets have you used Twitter
spelled the French way to access Twitter
spelled the normal way and what do you
think of the Facebook widget do you have
any other widgets that you like better
or worse what do you think of these have
you been able to contact the developers
and ask for assistance or four for
features added things that you'd like to
be able to do with it you know I'd like
to know and if you've got a few minutes
in a video camera I'd really like to see
what social networking widgets you have
on your home screen so please do that
reply down underneath this video and let
us all know so talking on social
networking widgets I am Joe Levi for
