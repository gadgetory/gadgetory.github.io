even had a review rebuttal but we
haven't had any hands-on time with a US
model that's about to change
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is our unboxing of the LG g3 on
AT&amp;amp;T so we already know what's going on
with this phone in particular we got the
Korean model a few weeks ago Michael
provided the full review I provided a
review rebuttal and this one is very
similar of course it supports all the US
bands and it's an AT&amp;amp;T model so of
course you're going to get LTE on AT&amp;amp;T
but inside are pretty much all the same
specifications and this one in
particular comes with a personalized
message from one Michael Fisher which
says eat this phone thanks Michael thank
you so without any delay let's get
inside the box and see what's in the box
because that's really why you're
watching this video because we know what
the phone is about what it looks like
and all of that so remove the little
sleeve of course you just take the top
off we have a SIM card which we will put
over to the side and this is the phone
we'll also set that down which is nice
we have I haven't seen this color yet
the the unit I had was white and from
what I understand it's actually quite
different from this black model or the
gray model so we'll see where I get to
see rather what it's all about
you've got some paperwork a Quick Start
Guide product safety and warranty
information you know the usual stuff
also inside is a microUSB cable link
there for a second you have your AC
adapter and a battery I don't know if
there's one in here feels kind of light
I can't tell I don't think they would
send two batteries in the phone that
wouldn't be the first but let's get this
back in the box
I'm going to need this
get this stuff back in here we'll take a
look at the phone so sorry no headphones
no special things inside the box just
your typical stuff move that over to the
side get this out of the wrapper - yeah
there's no battery in here
but we will take it out of the sleeve
and there it is it's uh pretty standard
the same exact thing we've seen before a
little different branding on the
backside of course you've got your AT&amp;amp;T
brand but let's see no sound I always
get these I never get any sound from
pilling plastic it's just silence let's
get the battery in the backside here
before we do any hardware tours will do
hardware tours as it powers up and
there's already a SIM card in there
alright so I have two SIM cards with
this phone I don't think that's
customary this thing is already ready to
go but we're still just going to give
you a little hardware tour really
quickly you've got your LG branding here
at the bottom which is the same as
before you've got a three micro USB port
here microphone and a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and along the top edge
all you're going to have is an infrared
blaster and another mic hole there are
going to be no buttons on the side
because they're on the back and there is
just one little tab on the lower right
quarter right there to get into the
battery compartment alright and right
here of course you've got your volume
down power volume up you've got your
laser for your auto focus your 13
megapixel optically stabilized camera
and your flash LED and that's pretty
much it here's a little port at the
bottom for your speaker which is
actually quite loud but other than that
this thing is pretty much the same phone
that we've already seen um there are
some differences on the inside for
instance this one does not have Qi
wireless charging because AT&amp;amp;T likes the
PM a standard and does not want XI on
this so there's that and you still have
three gigs of RAM you have 32 gigs of
storage with of course
micro SD card you have a 5.5 inch qHD
display which is gorgeous there are some
color differences not color differences
there are some wonky things that go on
with the colors at times it seems a
little faded and then of course you can
set your saturation in the settings so
there's a lot of stuff going on here but
before we hop off we're going to give
you a quick hardware comparison size
this is a nexus 5 this is a 5 inch phone
and this is a 5.5 so you can see how
little difference there is in physical
size for jumping up to that 5.5 and
that's thanks to very slim bezels on the
side of the phone and some other things
going on there some bezel reduction and
whatnot and here is the one m8 this is
the Verizon one I'm eight and you can
see that they are just very similar in
size and that's because mainly this one
is much taller because boomsound but
there you have it this is the unboxing
of the AT&amp;amp;T LG g3 stay tuned for more
coverage I'm Taylor Martin and I will
see you next time
