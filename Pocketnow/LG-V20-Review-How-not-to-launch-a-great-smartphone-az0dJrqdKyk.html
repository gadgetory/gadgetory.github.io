we've ever produced videos for before
getting to a full review our initial
hands on detailed all the new features
our real audio review digs deep on the
headphone and speaker playback our real
camera review has a great reveal on just
how good the dual camera system is and
if you missed our v20 vs v10 comparison
then you missed one of the best reveals
we've ever shot on the microphone
quality it's about four minutes into the
comparison and we have them all linked
in the description below this video as
such what you're watching right now
might feel more like a long-term recap
than our usual phone review for all we
can praise about this phone that has to
be tempered against the fact that this
was one of the poorer phone lunches of
recent memory LG just couldn't get the
timing right on this beast announcing
the phone a day before the iPhone
claiming to be the first phone with
nougat but in many markets falling
behind the pixel sending out pre-release
units weeks before final carrier
versions were produced this all
contributed to a somewhat muted response
for the v20 tech outlets and blogs can't
make up the difference what a proper
advertising campaign should achieve even
with some fun spots from hit record it
just doesn't seem that LG is really
communicated what makes this phone
unique to potential customers and it's a
shame what with the huge phablet void
left by the note 7 this would be a prime
opportunity for any large screen device
to try and fill that spot getting on
with the v20 this phone is a monster our
first impressions confirmed this is not
a soft friendly all-rounder smartphone
it's a multimedia powerhouse our
concerns over the change in build and
design were calmed after this phone
survived a handful of drops during our
real camera review it's a tough bugger
though we're likely going to use a case
in the future the rear has this
beautiful satin finish but it's not
quite as easy to hold on to as the v10
was with its grippy back the major build
concerns here were not quite as
confident in this camera housing there's
a plastic guard circling the lenses and
we'd highly recommend you leave this in
place underneath
is one continuous piece of glass and as
this is raised from the back of the
phone it becomes a prime target for
potential abuse I'm still not the
biggest fan of phablets but the
rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and
software screen shrink helped quite a
bit for one-handed use and in daily
operation this phone is proven to be a
capable performer but we're still apt to
stumble into the odd hitch when driving
the phone heart or multitasking
LG's skin is a lot lighter than on
previous devices and more of stock
Android is showing through richer
notifications improved multitasking and
proper Google support for split
screening apps that last bit is handy on
the larger screen this might be my
favorite setup now for writing while
traveling it's just so compact gaming
performance is par for the course the
Snapdragon 820 is a capable chipset with
only minor stutters or frame drops in
marvel future fight better optimized
games will play like buttah Network
performance has been excellent on
Verizon as is Wi-Fi reception for a
metal backed phone neck and neck with
the huawei mate night as mentioned
earlier we have a trio of videos to dig
in deep on audio and camera performance
but as a quick recap here this is a
content creators dream phone for all the
comments we get from folks telling us we
shouldn't judge phone cameras and
microphones against professional gear or
regular people just don't shoot this way
the v20 stands as a formidable counter
argument more than any other device
we've reviewed audio and video from the
v20 has worked its way into our content
nearly seamlessly did we mention the v20
versus v10 comparison
you should watch around the four-minute
mark there no spoilers here the V 20 is
overkill for folks looking at covering
the basics or shooting full auto on
over-processing HDR modes to get those
good colors that should be understood in
the V 20s price tag but we live in an
era where slapping the word pro on a
device just means better like game
consoles can be pro Hardware not so much
LG's V Series phones should be
understood as pro devices the auto modes
are capable but this device lights up
once you start participating in creating
your content for those who want it the V
20 gives user
plenty of room to grow the audio game is
on point you get a good speaker as good
as a mono bottom firing speaker really
can be but the headphone jack leaps to
the top of our list this is the best no
better I could go on but why this rocks
lastly battery life is still one area
where the V Series might give some
people concerns it's well improved over
the v10 but powerhouse performance comes
with bigger power draw our media tests
streaming 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 190 Lux the V 20 drained 7% of
its battery really using the cameras or
the - AK can cut into your runtime - the
recharge game is better than average
though 30 minutes on the included
charger resulted in a 40% top off and of
course investing in a spare battery can
help you out during an extended run in
the field this being one of the last
premium devices to still offer a user
removable battery so let's wrap this up
where's that leave us with the LG v 20
well it should be pretty clear by now
that this is personally my favorite
phone of the year LG's lame launch
notwithstanding no other phone has come
anywhere near aiding me and getting my
work done and delivering on my favorite
fun features for folks who aren't
PocketNow editors the recommendation
hinges on a couple key questions would
you pay a premium for expanded camera
controls high quality microphones and
the absolute best headphone jack on any
phone likely ever produced
can you handle mid-pack battery life and
can you trade enhanced water resistance
to gain enhanced drop protection and
that removable battery if you're not
inked more than shaking your head no
then the V 20 is likely a good fit for
you too with the focus on professional
features the V 20 might stand as a niche
device but it's the undisputed king of
its niche just a shame that many people
won't even know it exists as always

already produced on this phone to get
