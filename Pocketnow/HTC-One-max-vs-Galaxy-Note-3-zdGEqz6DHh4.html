it's unbalanced HTC's new one max isn't
exactly on the same tier as the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 in fact it would be better
suited for a comparison with the
downrange Galaxy mega but the mega at
least in the United States isn't what
Samsung is pushing instead it's heavily
advertising the note 3 and the one max
is HTC's only oversized smartphone
offering to date so it's stuck in the
role of a de-facto competitor let's take
a look then at how these devices compare
on their uneven playing field I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is HTC one max vs samsung galaxy
note 3 the gulf between the hardware
here is wide and instantly apparent the
note 3 is significantly trimmer in every
dimension and it's almost 50 grams less
massive making it substantially easier
to hold the Samsung product is also more
grippy at least on our black unit here
thanks to the faux leather trim now
whether you prefer this look and feel
with its distinctive retro styling and
stitching or the one Max's smooth
aluminum construction will depend on
your own personal taste the note 3 still
won't be anyone's first choice for
one-handed use but its markedly better
in this department than the one max
which almost requires a two-handed grip
in exchange for that added bulk the one
max features a display that's 0.2 inches
larger and it's built on SLCD 3
technology versus the note 3's AMOLED
whichever display type you prefer
they're both outstanding screens of
course the One Maxx also features HTC's
trademark front firing boomsound
speakers which contribute to its bulk
but also deliver the loudest clearest
sound we've ever heard from a smart
phone the note 3's bottom firing speaker
is substantially inferior
both of these devices feature a
removable back cover with microSD
expansion to augment the onboard storage
but only the note 3 features a removable
battery though it's slightly smaller
than the one Max's imbedded unit now
further down and the guts is the
disparity the speck abscessed will dwell
on the note 3 is Snapdragon 800 is a
more powerful more buzz worthy processor
than the Snapdragon 600 on the One Maxx
and it's backed up by half again as much
RAM on the Samsung product other specs
are roughly comparable with a few
standouts here and there but it's pretty
clear that one of these manufacturers
was going for absolute top of the line
in terms of internals and it wasn't HTC
you wouldn't know it in terms of
software performance though both of
these phones run Android 4.3 but HTC's
new Sense 5.5 interface is definitely
more polished than Samsung's TouchWiz UI
that's not to say Samsung's software is
bad necessarily but a sense is more
responsive and it's less prone to
stutter and we think it looks better too
with thoughtful touches throughout and a
cohesive visual aesthetic compared to
Samsung's haphazard bloated interface
but what you get in exchange for that
bloat is hugely important and here the
Samsung device shines the note 3 makes
very intelligent use of its large screen
size with a convenient split-screen
multitasking approach that lets you run
apps side by side at the same time along
with a less useful but still
occasionally handy window to view plus
there's the S Pen Stylus that gives the
Note 3 its name which allows for lots of
added functionality and a comfortable
secondary means of using the device
two-handed
by contrast the one max despite all its
responsiveness and visual appeal is
basically just a super-sized smartphone
the multitasking approach is just an
inflated view of the standard tiles and
while features like the new blinkfeed
social media browser and the new gallery
look and perform wonderfully it much
better than Samsung's alternatives in
fact there's been very little effort
made on the max to intelligently use the
added screen real estate
and while HTC will offer a capacitive
stylus for the max separately without a
display digitizer to interact with it
has none of the capabilities of the
s-pen and know where to live on the
device HTC says the finger is the best
stylus but it's wrong because while
HTC's scribble software is once again
cleaner and better than Samsung's
note-taking offerings using it with a
finger just isn't very enjoyable by
comparison
speaking of fingers the one Max does
feature a slight leg up on the note 3
thanks to its fingerprint scanner if
you're into that sort of thing but even
if it works perfectly it wouldn't be
enough to overcome the notes
considerable utility advantage in all
the one Max's software is we'll say it
one more time
gorgeous but it feels like a missed
opportunity next to the note we've
tested both phones on a TN t--'s network
in the Greater Boston area and found
voice quality to be about on par with
color saying we sounded slightly
brighter on the one max boom sound gives
the HTC device an edge in terms of
speakerphone calls though with the note
3 unable to keep up even with boosted
volume settings it bears repeating
acoustically the one max is unmatched
unfortunately for HTC the pendulum
swings the other way on the camera
neither of these shooters is optically
stabilized but the resolution on the
note 3 is 13 megapixels over three times
that of the one max that's more than
just fodder for horsepower comparisons
to Samsung's camera consistently
outperforms the one Max's module in
normal lighting conditions rendering
results that are sharper and of course
more zoomable and without all the wild
swings and exposure that HTC cameras
have come to be known for the one Max is
superior in one respect though low-light
performance even without oh is the ultra
pixel camera on the max manages to pull
much more light from a scene even when
we turn the lights down to near total
darkness yes the shots are noisier but
at least you can see the subject we also
like the Max's wide field-of-view better
than the more confining situation on the
note 3 we also like video output from
the note better again we have the same
narrow field of view yes but audio
performance is far superior and
saturation is higher as well without the
strange warping that comes from the
Max's software image stabilization of
course you also have the option of
shooting 4k video in some versions of
the note in addition to the 1080p
footage you see here there is no
accessible setting in the video settings
for raw
stabilization on the one max so I
believe that's automatically enabled
just doing a little walking shot here
elsewhere in the performance category
we're pretty much on par in a daily use
sense for those interested in benchmarks
please check out the full review of each
device available at pocketnow.com in
general we could not get these phones to
break much of a sweat even with the most
intense games and with batteries as
large as we're seeing here we're also
not too worried about endurance the
notes removable pack gives it an edge
for the most amp-hour abusive of road
warriors but these are both very long
lasting machines so in the biggest
mismatch of the year the note 3 comes
out on top in almost every category what
a shocker again
HTC wasn't necessarily looking to take
on the note with the max but due to the
structure and positioning of the
different lineups consumers will make
this comparison so we had two as well
those seeking a great content
consumption experience or just an
oversized smartphone and who don't mind
a huge heavy device will probably really
like the max but those looking for the
most capable all-around phablet should
probably choose the note 3 folks we want
to hear from you how do you think these
devices compare on the spec sheet in the
real world which one would you buy if
given the opportunity let us know in the
comments down below and drop us a like
if you enjoyed the video you can also
see the full review of each of these
devices at pocketnow.com and you'll want
to follow us on social media so you
don't miss future coverage on the one
max the galaxy note 3 every other device
we can get our hands on in the meantime
I want to thank you very much for
watching this has been michael fisher
with PocketNow and we'll see you soon
until next time this has been michael
fisher with PocketNow thank you for
calling this is first
yeah max ow ow yeah yeah
yes I'm congested sue me
yes I'm congested these glasses are
awesome alright let's go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
