quite your style then maybe a dual edge
will do the trick I'm high out of
Houston pocket now and after spending 24
hours with the galaxy s6 edge+
these are my first impressions it's easy
to just call the s6 edge+ of blown-up
galaxy s6 edge and call it a day but
it's not really the case well in a lot
of ways yes the design while bigger is
nearly identical to the original s6 edge
with the trademark curved glass on both
sides of the screen and the same all
glass and aluminum casing it's fragile
sure but the s6 edge and edge plus are
some of the best-looking handsets around
and despite having ultra-thin sides to
hold on to the H+ is still reasonably
comfortable to hold in the hand that is
of course so long as you can manage a
5.7 inch display it's beautiful by the
way
coming in at quad HD and thanks to the
wide range of brightness settings is
visible in almost every environment
another likeness to the s6 edge is the
plusses lack of microSD expansion or
removable battery much to the dismay of
many self-proclaimed power users our
t-mobile unit here is a 32 gigabyte
model and gold platinum but you can also
get it in a 64 gig configuration and
choose from either black sapphire white
pearl or silver titanium depending on
your location having used the note 5
over the weekend and spending the past
stay with the s6 edge+
a few things have stood out to me so far
of course there is no S Pen on the s6
edge+
but oddly enough there's also no IR
blaster and in fact that extends to both
devices Samsung says that the s6 edge+
should bring back all the display tricks
from the Galaxy Note edge and that's
evident with both people edge and the
news and notification tickers but new to
the mix is app edge which lets you save
up to 5 different apps for fast access
the battery is seen a slight bump from
the phone's smaller identity up from
2600 to 3000 milliamp hours and
performance so far is solid though a
more conclusive report will have to wait
for a full review there's also a fair
amount of bloatware on the phone
including a few t-mobile apps and
lookout Mobile Security it's something
excessive and most of the apps can be
disabled or uninstalled but it's still a
little annoying to see before longtime
features of the galaxy
Cirie's are still here like multi-window
for running two EPs at the same time and
an outstanding camera that'll give even
the best mobile shooters a run for the
money it seems to be the same five and
16 megapixel sensor combo that we found
on the galaxy s6 and s6 edge which is to
say it's terrific we'll be taking more
photos and videos as we continue with
our testing but shots from both cameras
so far look excellent and that's about
the story on the s6 edge as a whole so
far not everybody's gonna find the edge
display useful but between the high-res
display great cameras beautiful hardware
and powerful specs there's a whole lot
to love about the galaxy s6 edge+ even
this early on if you're itching for more
content on the s6 edge+ and the note 5
our full reviews on both are coming in
soon and wouldn't you know we've already
got plenty of content on both phones to
hold you off while you wait
