a hole in the screen battle but
reportedly with a mid Ranger we get more
speculation on the McLaren 1 + 60 and it
seems to bring a lot of power and Oppo
also is working on a foldable smartphone
with 5g support I'm Jaime Rivera and yes
I experimented with wearing an adult
t-shirt today because of certain
complaints in the comments but then I
realized man I look I don't know
this is bogging out daily sponsored by
swap ah if your shoulders today begin
with deals if you're in the market for
any Samsung products there are 12 days
of deals and these deals don't just talk
about smart phones I mean there are TVs
and a ton of products and every day the
deals change so today for example it's
Girish 3 and the gear sports you learn
more about it in the description now
let's talk about Oppo as well the
company is a Chuck Wang just pretty much
came on record to say we've been working
on a project for a foldable device
that's gonna launch in 2019 and I've
learned I'm not exactly sure if there's
another product with 5g support or if
this is the one with 5g support whatever
the case might be it seems that foldable
products are the thing next year and I'm
still trying to figure out what for and
let's talk about the Apple watch series
war for those of you that have wanted
that ECG feature that was not launched
initially it seems to be part of watch
iOS 5.1.1 already out and apparently it
brings it but there's no guarantee that
it'll actually launch even if it's in
the beta so stay tuned for that
let's talk about the oneplus 60 we
talked about that neck Larne variant
that's launching in the next few days
and while there was some speculation
over what is going to make this phone
different it's a salute to speed
according to the teaser but we don't
know anything else that was it now a
rather interesting twist to some recent
rumors that claimed more RAM on this
phone which obviously is definitely a
salute to speed how much we don't know
exactly I mean we've seen 10 gigs
already in certain products so I guess
that's the way to go but we'll keep you
posted
and finally the potenuse today have to
do with Huawei and punching a hole in a
smartphone to be able to give you a
selfie camera as we heard that the
company was going to launch it first
calendars December 4th there seems to be
a mid-range err coming
the Nova for apparently and the Nova is
it's interesting because that lineup is
like it's like in the middle I guess but
well we also know that Samsung is
experimenting with the whole concept of
doing it in the mid Rangers well
apparently there are very minimal bezels
in the Huawei variant but let me know
the comments down below I mean with this
whole push of like Samsung and Huawei
using mid Rangers to experiment with
technology does that entice you to buy a
mid Ranger or does it make you excited
for what's coming next for the flagship
because in that case it's about all it's
all about the Flex are pretty much but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
