known as research in motion might have
kicked off the smartphone era but in the
intervening years it has seen a
significant decline now that the new
BlackBerry 10 platform is kicking off
let's see how it compares to other
modern smartphone platforms I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is
BlackBerry 10 versus Android so as you
can see we're using a Samsung Galaxy
Note 2 as our Android device and the
differences between these two platforms
are extreme and they start right at the
lock screen whereas on Android you have
to press a physical button to wake up
the device you the power standby key or
the home button on blackberry you can do
that you do have that option but as we
just discussed in our first impressions
video you can also just swipe up from
the bottom to remove the lock screen so
that is pretty cool we like that a lot
but Android does give you a bit more
versatility you can unlock it sort of
from anywhere bottom or top and if you
are running a skin on top of Android you
probably have a whole lot of lock screen
action options like TouchWiz gives you
on Samsung whereas with blackberry not
much going on you just have your peek at
your notifications there your recent
events it actually looks a lot like
Windows Phone 8 which we'll talk about
in our next video but you just have to
swipe up in the bottom if you try and
swipe it for anywhere else the device is
like what are you what are you trying to
do to me I don't I don't understand and
if you get it wrong enough it'll finally
tell you listen you got to come down
here so there that is moving on to one
of the principle reasons for smartphone
is notifications on Android you with a
familiar persistent notification shade
which you can pull down and that shows
all your messages in an aggregate list
and if you want to take a peek inside
you can just do the two finger pull down
if you're on jellybean or later there's
a whole bunch of stuff in there you've
got weather widgets and Samsung's
TouchWiz has included some toggles along
the top for handy quick settings changes
so that's Android and then put on
blackberry go ahead and unlock there we
are doing something a little bit
different pull up from the bottom we can
peek right at our notifications there to
see if any of them are things we want to
deal with and if they are then we just
continue that action slide it across and
we have our blackberry hub which
aggregates
everything together in a similar fashion
and then there's one more layer to this
we can pull this over and you can see or
your Gmail your text messages your
Twitter all that kind of stuff right
over there and if you want to say you
just want to come on over and hop into
say text messages then you absolutely
can do that and to get out of that
compose view you'll notice there is no
back button just as there is no home
button on the back of the BlackBerry you
just swipe to go back to where you were
takes a little getting used to but once
you are used to it it ain't no thing
now Google being the leader in search
that it is you might expect that Android
is a pretty good on device search
functionality and you would be correct
from the home screen you can just tap on
the Google bar or wherever you choose to
put the Google bar and search for say
pocket now that you didn't see that one
coming
the device will search the web for
pocket now in the standard Google search
of course but you can also come on down
here and search the phone which will
give you contacts as well as any other
indication of the phone now I use the
pocket now word very frequently on my
device as you might imagine but Android
is only giving me results for my
contacts and for Chrome where I have
browsed to pocket now pages I'm not
seeing anything else and that holds true
on our Nexus 7 as well executing the
same search on blackberry you as you can
see it's a recently used item but this
persistent search button is down here as
well when this bar is visible in the
home screen and we can go ahead and do a
search for pocket now on the blackberry
and see what that looks like as you can
see I don't need to hit enter or
anything like that the divided the
results come up as I type here are my
contacts here my browser results but I
also am getting results from inside my
messages where the word pocket now has
been used and then I can extend the
search down here to other apps - such as
blackberry app world maps application
Google etc what about launching an app
everybody's talking about apps apps apps
and apps are so important so how do you
launch them well on Android of course
you have your groupings of folders if
you like on your home screen which you
can tap or you just have a standalone
apps sitting there like
mobile hotspot you tap it you go ahead
and jump right into that hit back to go
back to the home screen or hit the home
button go to the home screen or you can
just go into the app drawer and on your
app launcher here you have all your apps
laid out in a grid it is all fairly
standard and it works fairly well you
can also launch an app though by tapping
the search bar on an Android device and
say you want to launch Foursquare you
just start typing it at autocompletes
you go ahead and tap Foursquare and then
it jumps right in on the blackberry the
story is similar once we get past the
lockscreen you're in an application grid
here if you're in the grid you can go
ahead and just tap on any app you like
say let's just go into Foursquare to be
consistent the app pops up like that
that's a little different there we don't
seem to be able to launch the Foursquare
app from a text search on the device so
that is different if you frequently
launch apps by typing in their names you
will have some getting used to to do on
the blackberry but there's yet another
way of launching apps on these devices
and that is multitasking so on Android
if we hop past the homescreen and say
we're in an app like Twitter and we want
to go ahead and jump into Foursquare on
regular Android we would go ahead and
press the multitasking key on the galaxy
note 2 we'll press and hold the home
button and we're in our multitasking
ribbon which shows recently used apps
and go ahead and just tap it and go
right into Foursquare there by contrast
on the blackberry once we get past the
launch screen here I recently used apps
are front and center this is the first
page of the home page and you can
vertically scroll through your running
apps this way you have of course your
app launching tray to the right here
with its cascading icons but the
principle screen is the apps you've run
recently in the apps which are running
so you don't need to take an extra step
these apps are already here we can just
tap on Foursquare and we're right in
there if you want to get rid of one of
them you just tap the X to clear it it's
not necessarily a better way of
multitasking it depends on your school
thought it's just different
it certainly is more efficient if you do
use many of the same apps
all the time now let's say you wanted to
send an email from either of these
devices on Android you just
go ahead and hop into the Gmail app I
have already started an email just to
illustrate that but that's your fairly
standard you hop into the email app to
send an email on blackberry you'd think
it would be the same way when you're on
your home screen here no you can hop on
over to the app tray but no you do not
come over here to do your email you hop
to the left go into the hub and of
course here's your recent messages if
you want to you can hop on over here and
choose which mailbox you want to use
choose where you want to compose or much
much easier just hop down here hit
compose and then you can choose what
application you'd like to use to send
your email finally to wrap it up it
wouldn't be a comparison if we didn't
look at the respective app stores so
let's start with Android and have a look
at our old friend the Google Play Store
which features I don't know why I had to
really to the Terms of Service maybe
because I switched countries which
features apps in addition to content all
arranged in a linear feet in a linear
fashion you can swipe from left to right
to go into different categories and top
categories and so on and you can search
directly for an app right here so let's
say we're searching for a particular app
called tricorder because we are nerds
there a our scientific sci-fi scanner
sounds delightful and hit install and
then it you have to agree to the terms
it tells you what permissions that the
app is going to require and how
compromised it's going to make your
security you can accept and download and
then it downloads in the background it
gives the option to keep shopping which
we can now do if we were in the Google
Play Store and in the United States we
can search for an awesome band called
pinback but we don't have access to that
content here in Canada for some reason
so we'll have to leave that for a more
detailed comparison let's go ahead and
buy an app in the new BlackBerry app
world which I actually have not done
this will be my first time seeing this
I'm show off to agree and user License
Agreement and some such this is the
first time load oh maybe not well here
we go look at these oh well this is a
very nice layout here so we have a
featured app up top as well as trending
apps and games down below a section for
top paid games top paid apps it looks
like we can search down here
well so let's say we want to search for
I'm sure there will be no response for
tricorder BB sensors tricorder
environments well I'm completely wrong
this is using the sensor capabilities
your device to scan your unease well
that sounds like fun I'm gonna go ahead
and download that download starting go
ahead the progress bar is proceeding up
top now I can go back and I can do other
things while this is installing I
believe is what was is what was said
today and then if you go down lower okay
here we have our content our top movies
our top TV episodes I wonder if they
feature the awesome band pinned back yes
that rocks anyway more on that as we get
more detailed but for now it's just a
quick look between blackberry 10 and
Android jelly bean here in Toronto once
again Michael from pocket now stay tuned
for a lot more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
