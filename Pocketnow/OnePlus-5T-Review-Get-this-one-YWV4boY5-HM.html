smartphones in 2017 is that they've
become just too expensive
like seriously devices like the iPhone
10 are almost as pricey as a full-blown
MacBook I don't think you're getting
$1,000 worth the phone and I've got just
the device to help me prove my point I'm
Jaime Mehta we met up with PocketNow and
this is our review of the one plus five
T so let me put this to you into
perspective if you damage an iPhone 10
in any way that pushes the repairs out
of warranty guess how much money you'll
have to pay to replace it no you're not
seeing Photoshop work you're gonna have
to confidence Ain five and a half
Benjamins to get it fixed so if I told
you that you could buy one of the best
Android phones of 2017 for that same
price what would you say now you
understand why the 1 + 5 T is so popular
oneplus flak ships are usually all about
guts but I feel the 5 T was a necessary
refresh the oneplus 5 launched with a
dated design that I'm sure had many fans
complaining by contrast the 5 T adopts
the new trends of a taller 18 by 9
aspect ratio on the display this
particular AMOLED panel at 1080p is
definitely flagship worthy with deep
blacks and saturation galore protected
by Gorilla Glass 5 and also with one of
the best ambient displays in the
industry the chassis is once again
anodized aluminum so that's one less
thing you'll have to worry about braking
and the art part is that what I like the
most about the design is that it feels
and complete the Wampus covers feel like
an elemental piece of the puzzle and my
favorite continues to be sandstone gray
now don't get me wrong the phone feels
great in the hand without it but try
them out and you'll see what I mean and
then there are the little things that I
love about this phone like the
three-stage toggle mute switch that has
become a distinctive convenience about
oneplus devices
it's internals literally give this phone
the crown for the most powerful Android
phone of 2017 we have a qualcomm
snapdragon 835 six gigabytes of RAM or
eight depending on your choice for 64 or
128 gigs of storage dual-sim
capabilities the latest Bluetooth 5.0 a
3300 milliamp hour battery and -
charging which is the fastest in the
industry and even if this phone doesn't
have an IP rating oneplus claims that
you can splash it just fine and not
worry about it
oxygen OS four point seven point one on
top of android 7.1.1 powers these
internals and continues to be my
favorite customization for android for
starters it's as close to stalkus can be
and what oneplus adds is focused on
convenience
I love the customizable dashboard on the
left that can become whatever you want
through widgets I love that there's a
full menu to help you customize the
navigation button sir and what they do
you can set up double tap commands long
press etc which allows these three
buttons to become nine if you want to I
love power user features like parallel
apps for more than one account on social
media I love app Locker which provides
extra security for whatever apps you
define and I do love gaming do not
disturb which is self-explanatory and
notice that I keep saying I love I love
I love like seriously guys for all the
claims that Android is free and open
this is one launcher that truly embodies
how Android should operate about the
only thing that's missing here is Oreo
which should launch early next year but
in about everything else this is
definitely a launcher that I highly
recommend
and since we're already mentioning games
my experience using this phone for more
than a week is definitely a delight
graphics intensive games launched like a
charm and play without a problem and the
same goes for the overall user
experience I just don't have anything to
complain about here a key element about
this phone is its new face to unlock and
it works well for me and all the
scenarios that I've tested I'm not gonna
lie I'm still skeptical over my phone
being unlocked by somebody else but I
love that you have the choice of
disabling this feature and going back to
the ceramic made fingerprint scanner or
using both I also don't have anything
bad to say about the battery the phone
last through the day just fine and
that's charging is really quick to
top-up and please don't ask me to
complain about the lack of wireless
charging that's still one of those
things that's cool to have but not truly
necessary really my major complaints
with this phone have everything to do
with the lack of stereo speakers and how
easy it is to muffle the one at the
bottom but this doesn't really mean that
I complain about the audio just have a
pair of headphones on the 5 t and this
continues to be one of the best audio
performers of 2017 and that extends to
using the 1 plus bullets which are
extremely affordable now the cameras
story is a very interesting one on this
device oneplus has really boosted its
game in photography since the 5 and the
5 t is no exception we have a unique
combo of a 16 megapixel shooter at one
point 1/2 microns and another at 20
megapixels at standard microns both with
the same 27 millimeter focal length and
F 1.7 aperture for better low-light
performance the results are good color
reproduction saturation and detail
during the day and admirable performance
at night as well though I find just a
little too much lens flaring in certain
scenarios even when going to X this
continues to be a problem the whole
concept of portrait mode is also good
and I love the idea of these being white
shots instead of crop
then well I still don't praises the
result in low-light the hardware is
there but the camera simply says that it
can't do the depth effect because it
needs more light which is completely
opposite to what oneplus is claiming
selfie photos are not a work in progress
for the most part in photos they do a
great job mainly because of those 60
megapixels in the shooter and the reason
why I say for the most part is because
the crop for video is just terrible
which doesn't make any sense with so
much resolution on the camera another
thing that is not a work in progress is
video stabilization on the primary
shooter I'm really impressed with how
this phone performs no matter how much
walking brings extra hand movement
definitely one thing that oneplus did
get right with this update is video to
conclude I think the theme of this
review is clear with the 1 + 5 t you
don't just get what you paid for you get
a lot more and nearly half the price of
the best flagships of 2017 this is a
phone that's actually better than some
of them at many aspects you may lack the
benefit of being able to finance it
unlocked but that argument would only
make sense if this was less of a phone
the fact of the matter is there is no
way around it this is a better phone
this would be my second year exposed to
oneplus devices and never a dull moment
for those of you thinking that this is a
fanboy video or that we're paid to say
this well I hate to break it to you but
it's not 1 + is actually a small company
that doesn't do that this is just a
truly great phone like seriously instead
of coughing 900 plus dollars for a phone
this holiday season I'd recommend you go
for the 1 + 5 t and use the rest of the
money for a SmartWatch or that game
console you've always wanted
