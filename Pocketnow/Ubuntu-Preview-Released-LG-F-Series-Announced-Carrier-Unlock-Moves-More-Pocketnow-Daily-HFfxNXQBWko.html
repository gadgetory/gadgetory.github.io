but not really it seems LT announces the
f-series to be showcased at mwc and a
successful petition is ready for the
White House regarding carry on blocks
I'm hi meri behna and how dare you make
carrier unlock see legal this is pocket
now daily so yeah LG went ahead and took
the wraps off their new f-series but
buyers beware if you were expecting our
high-end smartphone don't look at the
f-series apparently these devices are
the new f-series to supersede the L
Series in the past which wasn't really
that hot you probably want to look at
the optimus g pro or any other devices
that are out there but sadly well we'll
keep you posted the devices will be
available at the mwc show floor michael
and anton are already there so expect
kansans very soon and speaking of mwc
samsung seems to be planning to showcase
a new TV discovery service for mobile
devices where if you obviously have a
samsung phone and a samsung TV you can
pretty much watch TV ala carte and
selected on your device now sadly it's
kind of interesting that they're leaving
this room WC since CES was more of a
show floor for that but stay tuned
obviously and Tom and Michael will have
a look at that and yes Google Drive just
got better those of you that notice that
there's an application update available
already will know that you get video
streaming now aside from that you also
get pinch to zoom on the presentations
now it still isn't the spreadsheet
solution that I wish it was but at least
it's getting better over and over again
on mobile devices so make sure you hit
the update doesn't hurt to have it and
then let's move on to a bun to just
reach developers on their new preview
for Nexus devices which is cool right
well sadly no if you're piling on
loading ubuntu to your Nexus device make
sure it's not your daily driver as for
example the first thing is data does not
work if you want data on your device
you're pretty much stuck on Wi-Fi on the
original developer preview and aside
from that Nexus 4 users are complaining
about the fact that they've had to take
apart their phone remove the battery
which is not removable and then set it
back because of the vice hangs and
there's just no way to fix that so way
to go boom two we've got a lot of
coverage coming up on everything so if I
were you I would stay tuned for Taylor's
videos just have a look at the device
have a look at how it works and make
sure it's right for you before you load
it
and finally for the yes news of the day
the petition for the White House
regarding carrier and locks is ready you
know that there's a goal it has to be
reached in order for the petition to
even be read by the White House and that
number has already been met before the
date that was set which was februari
23rd now this obviously does not
guarantee that carrier locks will be
legal for any device that was built
after January 26 but stay tuned
obviously this is a step in the right
direction but that leads you to the
question of the day how much do you rely
on carrier unlocks in my particular case
every single device that I have a known
required an unlock at some point so
leave us a comment down below do you
need it I do and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow us on pocketnow comment
subscribe to our youtube channel as well
let's give this video a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I'm hi Natalie later
thanks for watching and stay tuned we've
got a ton of a blue to coverage coming
