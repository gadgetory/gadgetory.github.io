been appropriated by every phone with a
tablet sized screen the Galaxy Note 4 is
here to remind us that it's not just
about size but is it the smartphone for
you the answer in Pocket now is 62nd
smartphone review starting right now so
here's what's hot samsung finally built
a high spec phone that feels like a
high-end product the frame is aluminium
magnesium the screen is a quad HD
masterpiece and everything from the
sensor package to the iconic S Pen has
been upgraded it's all topped off by the
best camera Samsung's ever put in a
Galaxy Note and even the custom Android
interface has been modernized but with
so many features to run that software is
still more complex and inconsistent than
we like the battery life doesn't quite
live up to the legendary endurance of
past notes and for all its expanded
usability features it's still a big ol
hunk of hardware that you'd be
hard-pressed to use with one hand and
yet these are the sacrifices you make
for the note 4's capabilities and if
it's pure capability that matters to you
then you've found your phablet the
Galaxy Note 4 is a powerful attractive
and nearly future proof piece of mobile
technology in the world of super-sized
screens it's a product without peer for
8 more minutes on the Galaxy Note 4
