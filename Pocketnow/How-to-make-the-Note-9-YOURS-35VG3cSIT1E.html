the galaxy note 9 is a powerful device
that is able to cater to pretty much any
of the users needs however when it comes
to showing a little bit of personality
there are a number of things that you
can do I have done a video where I
skinned the outside of it and even got a
yellow as pens I'll finally get that
black and yellow edition and you can
take a look at what I did to make that
happen over on my channel youtube.com
slash or Vergara but this is PocketNow
and I'm Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and it's time to customize the
phone a little bit with some features
that I think everyone should know about
the note 9 so you're probably sick of
seeing galaxy no 9 coverage by now it's
all over the interwebs but this is a
video I wanted to do back with the
galaxy s 9 after all a number of these
features were introduced in the previous
galaxy s device and I wanted to do a
video on it at that point but wasn't
able to in the no 9 however they all
return and provide great customization
options that I think you should know
about if you're a user of the galaxy no
9 this is a way to give it some real
personality there are a few really
obvious things that you can do right off
the bat you can change the wallpaper
which is the same procedure on here as
it is with pretty much any other Android
device you are able to put in live
wallpapers or you are able to put in a
static image that will scroll depending
on how many home screens you have if it
is inside of the Samsung themes app you
might end up paying a little bit for it
or it might be free if you're lucky but
for true customization we end up wanting
to get our own wallpapers that truly say
who we are and what our interests are
for the most parts or maybe you just
want to put a picture of people who are
important to you as your background in
my case I tend to make my wallpapers on
all of my phones reflect my favorite
character of pretty much any medium
Megaman and in particular Megaman X and
that's exactly what I'm doing here but
since this is a purple phone I went
ahead and went with the villain from
Mega Man X vile who is a purple colored
villain but it's a very familiar
procedure and what Samsung has done is
given you those same types of
customizations with a few extras for
both the lockscreen and more importantly
the always-on display the reason why I
love the customization of the always-on
display is because it allows you some
personalization without having to rely
on accessories like cases or skins or
anything of that sort
instead it's something that's built into
the phone so even if you don't change
any of the external parts of the
vais you can still make the phone
uniquely yours and differentiate it from
other phones that might end up looking
the same
but again Samsung themes is great but we
want to be able to show our own
personalities and in my case since I
have my own channel and I have my own
branding I decided to make that my
always-on display
that way it's always showing underneath
the time and above my notifications but
what if you want to take it even further
than just a simple logo perhaps you want
to have a motion graphic on there and
the galaxy s 9 originally allowed for
the creation of gifts in the always-on
display and videos in the lockscreen
which I'll get to in a second you can go
into the gallery and take any video
either one you shot or one that you
downloaded into the device and you can
pick a six-second clip from that video
to create into a gif this is a tool
that's built into the samsung galaxy
note 9 and if you are a gift type of
person that you love to share and send
to all of your friends or even just put
on social media this is already a
powerful tool once you have the gift
created it is put into a different
folder DCIM slash gif and when you go in
there and see all of your gifts you can
select one hit those three dots over on
the corner again and there you go you
could set it as your always-on display
image and finally let's talk about the
oft forgotten screen that is between
your always-on display and the interface
itself the lock screen I don't blame you
for forgetting about the lock screen
whatsoever because if you have the
fingerprint reader here and you just go
straight into the UI you pretty much
never see the lock screen the only time
that you might actually be looking at it
is when you're trying to get the phone
to unlock via face unlock or iris unlock
and that's exactly what I did just bear
in mind that if you are using a
widescreen video the very middle of it
is going to be cropped for the 18 by 9
screen and one of the reasons why I
wanted to show this office because it's
another illustration of just how many
options you get in the samsung galaxy
note device and in the note 9 there are
so many things that are available to you
as a user that you might not even
realize some of them are there so this
is my way of showing that the note 9 has
these tools especially the gift maker
which I think a lot of you are going to
have a lot of fun with and it's really
easy to use but you can also use the
photos the videos that you have on this
phone to a great extent especially as
customization options and really just
the creative in me is really happy to
share this kind of thing because
smartphones are such too ubiquitous
pieces of tech now they're always in our
pockets and there
is pretty much on display so why not
find ways of making it more our own in a
way for us to express ourselves if you
want to see how I got the skin on the
back and what I did to get the
replacement s-pen I changed the purple
one or rather the lavender one in this
lavender phone to the yellow s pen you
can see how I did that over on my
channel at youtube.com slash Joshua
Vergara the link should be appearing
right now and of course you can also
subscribe to su pocket now and consider
hitting the bell over on the side so you
can keep up with all of the pieces of
content that are available here
including the pocket now daily in the
pocket now weekly hosted by Jaime de
Vetta and yours truly respectively and
from there I'm gonna go ahead and call
it on this one I'll see you guys on the
next one here at pocket now and I'm
gonna go in and just start using it here
as well remember to enjoy your tea
