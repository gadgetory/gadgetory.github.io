the glass on glass design is making a
comeback leagues of the lgb 20 show is
that there is a little bit of similarity
with the g5 or maybe a lot the galaxy
note 7 has proven to be quite a hit in
sales I'm hi Mary vetta and up let's
give it up for RIPT apparel this is the
most epic t-shirt ever this is par get
out daily the official news today start
with deals as we try to do so every day
if you're in the market for an Amazon
echo I highly suggest you don't buy from
Amazon because if you look in the link
of the description you'll notice that
Best Buy and other retailers have it
fifty dollars off in some cases and
we're talking actually about the whole
echo Lynam so I highly suggest you
consider as will the spotlight over to
the samsung galaxy note 7 Believe It or
Not pre-orders begun pretty much just a
couple of days ago and the company is
already celebrating that markets like
its homeland in Korea have been
staggering crazy up to the point where
the galaxy note 7 has even surpassed the
galaxy s7 in sales and we're actually
target about to galaxy s7 s they're not
just one so clearly the galaxy note 7
has a proven a point the fact that the
company doesn't have to go crazy with
specifications for us to get the best of
the best or should I say will prove that
in the review which is coming very soon
now it has been a very slow time for
smartwatches mainly because these
haven't sold by crazy but fossil is
still up two more devices we know about
the Q Wonder and the Q Marshall two
devices that are 45 millimeter available
for 259 bucks starting very soon August
12 you can begin pre-orders we don't
have an exact date as to when you're
getting it but then again it should be
just the probably a week later or
whatever we'll keep you posted these are
very good smart watches and specs we
cannot wait to give one of these a try
at least I'll starve out the lgb 21 of
the most highly anticipated devices of
the year for both us and LG after the
debacle that happened with a g5 we see
some leaked renders device this might
not be so good because apparently it'll
keep the modularity of the g5 apparently
it will keep the tool camera the back
which is great the problem is mainly
that modularity because obviously the
implementation with the g5
so great we don't know about materials
just yet but these renders do show that
this device looks more like the g5 then
it looks like the b10 again it could be
that LG has polished this manufacturing
process it will take its time that's
really only needed with the g5 let's see
what we get and finally the very hot
deuces they have to do with what
analysts are predicting for this year's
iPhone and for next year's iPhone here
this one particularly according to
trusted sources apple pulled back from
launching three iphones this year just
six months before the launch meaning it
happened so around April March which is
not common for Apple this could mean
that Apple thought twice about the way
the market was going to behave obviously
the company has been losing a little
when it comes to its prediction and
sales oh but it does also prove a little
bit of instability for Apple which is
not a good thing the second one is that
the 2017 iphone is definitely going to
be a complete changer we do expect this
to be the 10-year iphone and apparently
Apple will approach it with a glass on
glass design which is rather interesting
as a company pretty much innovated with
it and then moved away from it after it
launched the iphone 5 and it leads me to
the question of the day i mean if you
have to choose do you prefer the
aluminum design or do you prefer glass
on glass for your smartphone in our case
I'll be honest I prefer aluminum I
consider it to be I don't think that it
handles scuffs great but then again
glass wasn't designed to be dropped
either it was a comment down below
what's your preferred material friends
