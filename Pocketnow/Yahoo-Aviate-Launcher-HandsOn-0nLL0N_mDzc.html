hands-on with a v8 launcher an Android
launcher from Yahoo we tried out the
Yahoo a v8 launcher on our huawei ascend
mate - overall it looks very nice it
looks right at home let's get into
exactly what it does first of all you've
got a big picture area that can be
shared with a widget or two if you're
lucky
unfortunately updates to this screen
aren't quite in real time as you can
tell our clock it's about 11 minutes off
and that's not uncommon now that's kind
of a battery saving thing we assume and
we hope that it catches up but in the
mean time it's more of an annoyance than
anything at all
you can also see we've got a nice
picture album you can put a couple
side-by-side if you want
down at the bottom of your favorite apps
and you'll notice you've got missed
indicators so I've got a missed call and
I've got an unread email that I still
need to get to you can customize these
and you don't have to have five you can
have less you can even have a couple
more depending on the size of your
screen let's go over to apps first we'll
scroll over to the side this is kind of
interesting it goes through and
automatically categorizes each one of
your apps into what you do at home
social productivity entertainment music
news transit photography and you can add
even more collections this will
automatically pull in app so that it
thinks belong you can even add your own
and if you want to find out more tap on
the icon and it brings up suggestions if
you want to add something you don't have
to go to the Play Store all you have to
do is add and all of the Play Store
stuff happens in the background while
you wait of course if you need
credentials you'll have to go ahead and
put that in but it's a relatively easy
way to get information and applications
into the appropriate categories
it's your full list of apps you just
slide one more time it's alphabetized
and it's got kind of this quick index so
you can see exactly where you are in the
list one thing that's kind of
inconsistent is the alphabet
kind of blends in with this first row of
icons and it's a little bit difficult to
see where one thing starts another one
stops so in the future we'd like to see
that moved over to the side even though
there will be a little bit of wasted
space panel to the left right now has
this cog now this is time location and
activity sensitive so right now it
thinks I want some settings informations
it's showing me my battery percentage in
the state of my battery saver it's got a
utilities collection my quick toggles
and a bunch of other things including my
home and work location so I can hurry
and quickly change those if I want to
here we can see this is morning time
I've got all of this other stuff in here
it's got my calendar it's got the
current weather and a forecast and it's
doing all this automatically for me it's
got some of my morning news so I can
quickly swipe through there just be
careful not to get too aggressive or
you'll come back over to your home
screen and then of course it's got
another collection we can add more
collections we can add more widgets just
like that any one of these while we're
moving I can quickly get directions to
my home which you saw pre-programmed on
my settings page directions to work
directions to the location of my next
meeting and a bunch of apps that fall
into the transit collection and again
the ability to add another collection of
widgets or add a widget nearby tells you
what is around you what's near your
location you can go in and find more
information about it very quickly and
easily including some nice cover art
that's sometimes accurate and sometimes
a pizza box so it means a little bit of
work there but very nice you've got tips
you can add icons you can add widgets
all kinds of stuff the really really
weird thing or creepy thing if you will
the other day when I first installed
this I was out to lunch I pulled into my
local burger joint and after I placed my
order I looked and there were tips down
in the field now unfortunately that
burger place isn't rated very well and
had I known that just a few minutes
before I probably would have picked some
else to go but it knew where I was and
it presented information to me
immediately almost when I needed it
you've got other things you can do
listening for listening to music and and
podcasts and whatnot
you've got work for what you do during
your work life and this is all going to
change based on where you are and the
time of day so it's very very context
sensitive and showing you what you want
now if you like showing this kind of
stuff off there's even a share button
tap on that and it'll let you share you
from your current home screen via
whatever social network that you want to
overall kind of cool really an
interesting approach to a launcher it's
something that takes a little bit of
getting used to but the nice thing about
it it gets used to you rather than the
other way around
and I can't tell you how glad I am to
finally see this because this is the
same way that I organize my icons and
folders this did it all automatically
for me which is nice because I haven't
had a chance to go through and do that
on this wall way yet to make it look
like my own and this launchers just
automatically done it and it's super
nice super happy gets you the
information that you need right when you
need it but we love it it's a nice
launcher and we think you should give it
a try you're into Android launchers and
want to see what you can do to customize
your Android head on over to
