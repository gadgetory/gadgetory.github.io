just left the surface pro 3 event when
they do surface pro 3 and I'm gonna
unbox it let's check that first of all
the new type covers are sold separately
and didn't get a box for that we just
had it thrown in with a bag the surface
pro 3 is box looks similar to the boxes
for previous surface pro devices but
without the angled edge and there's no
longer a secondary flip cover once you
slide out the sleeve the surface pro 3
looks amazing when you take it out of
the cardboard bed its new silver color
is very eye-catching and we had to test
out the variable angle kickstand right
away beneath the tablet is a new stylus
along with some documentation the stylus
feels more like a heavy duty pen whereas
the old surface pro stylist felt a bit
cheap and plasticky this one is much
more substantial it's got two buttons on
the side and the end where the eraser
would be clicks as a third button that
can instantly open one note on this
surface pro 3 even when it's in sleep
mode oddly the new stylus does not seem
to use Wacom technology since when
booting up the surface pro 3 it runs an
initial pairing of the pen right away
there's also a new power brick and yet
another new charging port hopefully it's
easier to attach than the previous
version oh and it still has a USB port
on the charging brick so you can plug in
your phone the new keyboard has a
redesigned trackpad which is 68 percent
larger and should be far more responsive
it also has a second hinge so that it
can snap to the front of the screen and
give the keyboard a slightly different
angle for more stability the keyboard
also has a little loop on the side tells
the stylus first impressions are very
positive
I'm loving the larger screen in the new
aspect ratio there's so much more to see
the tablet is very thin and much lighter
than previous surface pros it feels more
like a surface too and even includes a
new silver colored vapor mag body
holding that feels about the same as
holding a magazine with a lot of good
articles in it not a cheap flimsy
magazine but something with a lot of
content thanks for watching I hope you
liked this video
sure
thumbs up that's it now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
