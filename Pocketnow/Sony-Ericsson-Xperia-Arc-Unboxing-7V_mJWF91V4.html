Kakinada comm and the people at Negri
electronics have just sent us the Sony
Ericsson Xperia Arc so let's get to the
unboxing okay so after cutting open the
box we have these sony ericsson arc on
the front and this is supposed to be a
very thin device so it'll be kind of
interesting to see on the back of the
device we have the Exmor R for mobile so
that's their CMOS sensor and their
camera which allows you to view in
low-light situations you can take
pictures rather well 8.1 megapixel
camera HD and a 4 point 2 inch screen
that's powered by the Mobile BRAVIA
Engine so let's open up this box here
and on the top and the front I should
say we have these sony ericsson xperia
arc procedure very thin device we'll
look at that in just a second so opening
up the rest of the package so here than
zoom out a little tiny bit we have our
battery and that is a 1500 milliamp hour
battery we have our micro USB charge and
sync cable a pair of stereo headphones
our headset I should say and it looks
like they're in here headset we have our
European international charger with a
USB port and a little tiny bit of
documentation so I not too much that's
nice
so let's get to the device so this phone
feels very thin when you remove this
plastic though the screen feels huge I
didn't know that it was going to have
this this metallic backing on it it's
made of plastic but it looks metallic
and it goes transitions from a darker to
a more silver texture so if we compare
the Xperia Arc to a couple other devices
we have an iPhone 4 here and it feels a
little bit thicker while it's sitting up
but we do have this concave art design
on the back which actually is thinner
than the iPhone 4 in the very center and
about the same thickness on the edges so
it's about the same thickness as the
iPhone 4 compare this to a Samsung Focus
it does feel a little bit thinner feels
almost the same height here but if we
move it over its a much thinner in the
center and about the little bit thinner
at the edges
so I'm going to power this on and show
you the screen hopefully it looks
amazing since this does have the Mobile
BRAVIA Engine so the Xperia Arc is
running Android 2.3 and I did take a
couple minutes for it to boot after
starting it up so let's compare the
screen to a couple of other devices so I
have a Super AMOLED screen right here
and these tiles are supposed to be blue
but on camera they look rather distorted
and in comparison to the Mobile BRAVIA
Engine powered Xperia Arc the screen on
the Xperia Arc almost looks better than
the Samsung Focus here I have to compare
it at different viewing angles you can
see that the viewing angle is pretty
undistorted no matter which way I change
it so that's very a very nice feature to
have on any mobile device similar to an
iPhone 4 course this device has the
Retina display which does have more
pixels but the Xperia Arc has a larger
screen and the viewing angle is still
very similar if I compare to the iPhone
4 which does have a pretty amazing
screen as well so stay tuned for the
hardware tour coming up next followed by
the software tour this device is brought
to us by Negri electronics and you can
pre-order it by going to Negri
electronics calm this is the
International Version so this device
will not have us 3G bans and if you like
our videos make sure you give us a
thumbs up and also leave some comments
