pocketnow.com I'm going to try to show
you a little bit of the DLNA digital
Living Network Alliance music sharing
features in action so let's check it out
here I've got the Samsung Vibrant and
it's running all share which is an app
that's included on the device and this
is a DLNA compatible app that allows you
to browse and play music crowd laughs
this is actually streaming off of my
media center PC in the other room and to
put works pretty well when we posit for
now and if I go back this is what I
start out with I can choose play file
from server up on my phone then I can
choose my media center on my tablet and
it's going to bring up a listing I can
go to music
if you've got a really big library like
I do this can get kind of slow you know
browsing for the music that you want
play so yeah you gotta wait but anyway
once this comes up you'll see a listing
of artists and different ways to
organize your music and you can choose
to find your music that way and then add
it to a playlist that it will stream
automatically over the network you have
to be on the same Wi-Fi network this
work we're not happening here so I'm
going to put that down and show you that
Windows 7 actually supports this right
out of the box so if I launch Windows
Media Player here and I go to stream and
then there's many item called
automatically allowed devices to play my
media if I hit that this turns on DLNA
server just like that automatically
allow all computers to blah blah blah so
that's really nice that's built right in
to Windows 7 and then over here you see
these are the libraries on my on my
tablet here and here's another library
that's my media center which is another
room and you know I can browse that
library just very easily and here's the
phone here's the Android phone and it's
also listed here
and it will try to connect to that but I
don't think I'll work oh here we go
so here's the phone running all sure and
here's my PC with Windows Media Player
and I can see all the music that's on
the phone let's see if it works there we
go
now I'm streaming music on this phone to
my tablet PC computer so that is really
nice deposit and that's what DLNA is
about being able to share your music
your videos pictures etc very easily
between phones PCs and whatever other
kind of devices that are designed to be
compatible if you don't have Windows you
can download all sorts of other DLNA
servers that are compatible and if you
don't have all share on your Android
device there's all sorts of other DLNA
clients that you can download from the
marketplace and we've also heard that
Windows 7 there's going to be some DLNA
compatible software and devices for
Windows Phone 7 as well so pretty nice
and really great for easy music sharing
on multiple devices that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
