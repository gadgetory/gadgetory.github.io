separating today's to title tablets the
crucial difference between the stars of
today's show is that only one of them
was officially produced we'll talk about
that and will cover most of the big news
of the week from Motorola Apple Nokia
and all the rest on episode 04 six of
the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss smartphones tablets and the
state of mobile technology in 2013 I'm
your host Michael Fisher editorial
director at pocket now and today I'm
joined by senior editor Taylor Martin
from North Carolina good morning to you
hello everyone and I'm actually
surprised you remember where i live I
remember the state I do well I had to
say that because back after a long
hiatus all the way from the windy city
or the environment it's our resident
webos representative contributing editor
Adam Dowd welcome back to the show sir
what is vertically rising dogs man my
brain was working so quick I thought you
were gonna make a different joke there
good to see you sir good to hear your
voice rather on our audio only podcast
Adam is here specifically to talk to us
a little bit about a device he got his
hands on and wrote an editorial about
this week which I have referenced in the
rundown listeners if you want to click
on that link you can do so but first we
have a couple announcements to get out
of the way number one we've started a
new sort of section of the pocket now
insider it is not just a video series
it's about getting to know us from all
aspects all media avenues using all
types of communication to do that anyway
you can read an editorial and get to
know pocket now is anton d nadja he has
written an excellent piece about his
life and about what has conspired to
make him the man he is today so you
should read that it is linked and yes
you will be getting some from other
people on the site Taylor are you
working on yours is that what you're
doing I am I am not on that i'm working
on a pocket now insider today for what's
on my device
and stuff like that oh okay alright cool
well I don't know whose because next
then well cuz I've had I don't know how
many people I mean probably hundreds of
people asking how I set up my device
like I did over the weekend last weekend
oh really okay yeah I mean it's just
been uh nexus 4 oh yeah with your sweet
like text widgets down below the
Facebook Twitter Google Plus Ones yeah
those are awesome i want to know how you
did that how did you do that I mean not
you know mean like what what is that
widget spoiler alert it's just uccw
which is ultimate customized clock
widget or something like that and play
bars a theme for that app and basically
i just downloaded the tune I'm like hey
this looks cool and sweet but you're
gonna do a feature on oh yeah all right
good also there is a another episode of
the pocket now VIP has landed episode 2
features Phil Nichkhun sent who i
believe is editor-in-chief of android
central i don't know i know it runs
android central don't know useful to
have yeah he's a SE yeah okay so uh i
have not watched that episode yet have
either of you guys I am I watched about
three minutes of it none of my crap I've
got stuff to do but but but Adam has
watched it yeah I watched it although
granted i was at work but don't tell
work well because after all it was
better than work so yeah it was it was a
pretty date they talked about android a
whole lot less and i thought they would
oh yeah a lot of a lot of musical
discussion a lot of uh you know kids
just just just like okay that works well
good to know the wandering bus of the
bucket a VIP very much so now I love
that I love how conversation can just
just be liquid on some of these things
because you know you bring people from
other sites on and it's like hey let's
talk about anything because this is just
fun to do I mean we're going to talk
about we spent all week talking about
mobile technology there's no reason we
shouldn't talk about you know ice cream
or whatever thanks for coffee or a
coffee yes and have a delicious new
coffee yeah yeah I squeeze it in there
I'm so good at this I saw that you did
we were talking about that up on the
other side of the podcast with my
friends in Shrek FM would call it the
other side of the room let's get to
talking now the announcements are
the way let's get to talking a little
bit about webos Adam Dowd has in his
hands right now an HP TouchPad go now
we've talked about this device before
the fascinating thing to webos
aficionados is that it's one of those
products that was never actually
released it was due to land just a
couple weeks after the HP LED shutdown
of webos but the fascinating thing from
a broader perspective if you haven't
already clicked on to the next time code
listeners is that it was also one of the
first 7-inch tablets it was also one of
the first smaller tablets and it has
some interesting characteristics in that
regard Adam can you just give us the
rundown on your experience with the
touchpad go in the ten days you've had
it or so yeah so far its first of all
you need to hedge expectations because
after all this was a 2011 tablet it's
nothing really more than a touchpad I
mean it's just a smaller touchpad so if
you're expecting it to walk on water or
cure cancer you need to hedge those
those expectations but one of the cool
things about the touchpad go is it's
very much lives up to its name it is a
touchpad go it's tiny I mean it's like a
you know today's Nexus 7 or iPad Mini or
you know any number of other 7-inch
tablets that are out there but this was
back in 2011 this did not exist back in
2011 nobody wanted a 7-inch tablet in
2011 amazon hadn't even come out with a
kindle fire yet I mean this was this was
pretty this is a pretty bold move by HP
I mean this was a almost Apple like move
and biography didn't stop at the at the
size of the device it extended to the
form factor too because not only was a
7-inch tablet but it's a landscape
7-inch tablet mm-hmm with the four by
three aspect ratio instead of the 16 by
9 and the rear facing camera which you
know makes tech bloggers want to vomit
these days but there is a good argument
for it i'm going to throw i'm going to
throw a little shout-out out to the tech
chat mark mark Copic who wrote a little
thing based on my editorial about the
rear-facing camera how it is good for
documents game
it is good for QR codes not the camera
on this don't get me wrong but in
general a rear-facing camera tablet when
have its uses that's the res on that
rear facing camera it's pretty much the
same that came in the pre three it's a 5
megapixel I'm supposedly autofocus it
takes ok picture yeah I remember taking
shots with the pre 3 back in the day it
was ok is um is maybe a little generous
yeah it that's pretty darn generous
actually but one of the other nice
things is it had the soft touch back
which somehow we looted the it's bigger
brother the touchpad so no fingers
magnet you super slick back yeah that
that original touchpad I was just using
it last night there's a demo for this
play i'm doing and yeah it's it oh my
god you picked that thing up and you can
feel you didn't even have to look at the
back you can feel your fingerprints
forming on the bank indeed you can and
two other things that are noticeably
absent and i don't know if this is
because this is a production model it's
not a finished model or what have you
but wireless charging does not work nor
does touch to share oh so to hear that i
too like oh as you say it's a
pre-production unit i'm sure they would
have bet they would have made it I spent
10 minutes smacking this thing with my
33 saying sure sure sure come on and I
just I thought well maybe it's on the
bottom because that's where the button
is no it's not there maybe it's on the
side because that's where it is in the
touchpad no it's not there oh man so I
could not get touch to share to work so
and for all we know that could be a
software thing because the veer actually
has such a share capability that was
never released right so um you know and
there's a there's a couple of other you
know hangups you know it took me
probably about half an hour to get the
thing to recognize my palm profile
because it was a pre-production unit HP
servers weren't recognizing my profile
so i had to install preware and then
imposta and then a patch and then i had
to go into and pasta I had you know I
had tweaked it a little bit easier to
recognize listener these are these are
all these are all kind of a webos
homebrew you know tools and terms here
for design around palms established
system preware can be paralleled with
Cydia yeah yeah exactly an extent
previous was great back in the day I
loved it I loved it too Taylor what
webos to buy said you have back in the
day or were you just reviewing him I had
the original pre the pre plus the pre to
the touch pad and um well that's it
that's pretty one thing else there you
know I loved webos uh no i did not have
the beer it's your giant giant paws i
sold the beer to a big burly man who
came into best buy one day or the best
night really yeah he came in he's like I
would a really small smartphone I'm like
okay okay you're in luck sir I got a
veer foot yeah i bought the veer on
launch day I think it was March it
wasn't even a 15th or something it
wasn't the beer I'd quit bestbuy by then
it was uh was the pixie oh the posse it
was the brother had the pixie my brother
carry the pics you for like two years
you on purpose yeah that's why right but
he wouldn't call it the pixie cuz
remember one of his code named the EOS
the EOS has been the most like abused
code name in the history of mobile
phones but yeah like he thought yose was
a much cooler name and he had resolved
to buy it when I told him about the
leaks and then it came out as the pixi
he's like yeah I'm still gonna buy it
but I'm gonna call the EOS yeah that's
why it was so funny because it was this
big dude like this big burly redneck man
who came in for a phone and he walked
out carrying a pixie it's just like yep
y'all see my new pixie check it out well
it's it's awesome to hear first-hand
from from somebody who's got the go in
hand and I understand it's it's kind of
not exactly yours you have to rotate it
out to two other folks right at him it's
a temporary ownership situation so yeah
so how did this come to be that's what
I'm interested in so this won't there
this tablet was never released how did
you guys get your hands on it well um
that's a bit of a interesting question
um if you eliminate anyone I don't know
if you remember my my pod cat my first
podcast appearance where we talked about
the Windsor knot I'm going to use the
same story that I used for the winds or
not it's rather like when someone found
that iphone 4 in a bar only we knew
exactly where
what bar it would show up in so so it's
kind of it's kind of one of those things
and it was really cool because when we
opened the box it was hand numbered III
as far as I know I own touchpad go
number 30 really no no are that it when
you say open the box you're not talking
about retail packaging right it was I
wouldn't call retail packaging um it was
a box it was a box that was meant for
the touchpad go and it had you know the
it looked kind of like a phone box it
was all playing obviously there was no
carrier yeah yeah but the interesting
part guys you let you'll love this the
interesting part there's a bar code on
it with you know all the product
information stuff like that and the name
of the product is the palm none of the
HP palm pad really oh yeah that was one
of the names that was being tossed
around before the touch pad was
announced yes I looked at that in like
what you know that would have been a
raid that would have been I don't mommy
do that I exactly because touchpad is it
you search you you do a google search
for touchpad and like half your results
or like replace your laptop's touchpad
like trackpad trackpad replacements it's
like uh so yeah foam pad so man well
that's movies the foosh occult should
have called this podcast the HD palm had
verses about that weekly tablet see ya
well Adam thanks I wish we had a longer
show so we could discuss it a little bit
a little bit more because we love
hearing about this but I'm you know is
this the last we're gonna hear from you
on the touchback goers do we have
another there another piece in the
pipeline uh I am currently in
negotiations with Tony so we'll see
where it goes there should be more to
come I would love it if there were more
to come that would be so cool it would
be nice to do it a genuine versus like a
comparison video just for fun not for
any real conclusions but I thought it
would be fun to do a HP TouchPad go vs
HP slate7 just see you know come on and
now type right you are correct don't do
it if you don't give it to me though
because I'll just destroy that slate 7 I
remember seeing that thing and thinking
about the touchpad go and just let's not
talk about it again
yeah moving on yeah well let's talk
about the other the other tablet in our
in our title and that is the one that
I've got here in the Boston offices
which Boston with the passion offices
dude which which commenters correctly
and hilariously referred to as Michael's
house which is true the Sony Xperia
tablet Z I've had here for I think going
on five days now and I've been using it
extensively I've carried it to eastern
Long Island I've taken it in my travels
with me and I've put I've put the tablet
Z under so many running faucets dudes
it's not even like I just love scaring
my my parents I was like oh yeah you see
how is smudge it gets you just put it
under the sink and my mother you know
gasp and fall over and it was it's it's
been so much so much fun and one of the
things that struck me about the
comparison between the touch pego and
the tablet Z is that they kind of
couldn't be more different but in some
ways they're very similar like the
touchpad go back in its day was one of
the only 7-inch tablets I would have
considered and today the tablet Z is
really the first 10 inch tablet I've
actually enjoyed using in a very long
time not that I've used that many go
ahead you haven't had the nexus 10 i
have i unboxed it actually okay yeah I
inbox I loved that and i love that to
Joe for the review I know I've got it
now see now I would like to use it but
here's my thing about the nexus 10 and
this does relate to the tablet Z the
nexus 10 runs obviously stock Android as
nexus devices do so what you have is the
stupid situation where the apps like
home button and I'm talking we're
running stock or not talking about
running any roms the apps shortcut is
dead center in this bottom of the
display if you want to get to your
notifications you have to treat it like
a phone and reach up to the upper left
if you want the special settings how you
have to reach up to the upper right the
thing i don't like that version of
android running on a on a tablet that
size yes they should have kept it the
way it was they did it to keep it kind
of streamlined the experience across
multiple devices and multiple sizes
right but they should have kept it the
way it was because it was kind of
like a desktop mode exactly now on the
Nexus 7 I didn't even like it on the
Nexus 7 but it still made a degree of
sense because the next 7 is small enough
to where you can almost treat it as a
big phone but on something that is not
only 10 inches but also a landscape
device it makes no sense to me so on the
Xperia Z with this cool Sony skin on it
which you know I'm sure tons of people
will hate for its lag and it's blows and
all this kind of stuff there's actually
really n because I'm assaulting it and
because right shirts but no no but there
are really really cool elements like
keeping the notifications and settings
toggles in the lower right where it's
just a thumb swipe away like you know
putting the home button on the back key
and the multitasking button off to the
left on the bottom you know these things
are all these these make sense and
they're a little chaotic good I'm sorry
it sounds to me like the the the cm9 ice
cream sandwich that i have on touchpad
for a while seems very similar to that
also you know it is and i ran the early
alpha of that in my first video for
pocket now i think like a year ago and
so yeah it is similar to that except it
looks way cooler because obviously
androids visual style has improved since
then also has Sony's yeah and so many
skin has some really nice touches in it
actually that makes visually very pretty
but the other huge thing that I love
using about the tablet see is the weight
i read in bed a lot and when you use the
ipad 3 to read in bed you're taking your
life into your hands because if you
start falling asleep and drop that thing
on your face you're dead it's kind of
like dropping a truck on your face but
the tablet z is is so light that i can
actually hold it with one hand in
landscape and and flip pages the other
way Wow oh it's amazingly cool so
there's an obsession that we have within
things and light things as consumers and
as as gadget freaks but unless you're
talking unless you're talking Samsung
oops light like right oh and I / wait
and that's another thing right there's
no other waking in this thing there's no
it's not finished doing a hyper glaze
yeah you can try and twist it and that
metal frame underneath keeps it rigid so
I think it's pretty clear that I'm kind
of in love with the hardware so far and
also
could yet maybe a first maybe her
chariot don't you uh huh I had to you
gonna sing the kissing in a tree song uh
you know one of the interesting things
that I see on the tablet Z which is I
was going to say I hadn't seen on a
tablet before but that's not true
because we just got done talking about
the touchpad family is a notification
light and I had forgotten about it on
the touchpad which you know incorporated
it as a flashing light in the middle of
the home button on the tablet Z has it
placed in a less convenient place but at
least it's there it's off to the side by
the power standby button so there's a
little LED that flashes when you have
notifications which is a very nice touch
nice yeah so you know we're still at
first impressions here and the review
won't be out for for a little while but
it's I'm really enjoying the test drive
so far I'm thinking about ghostbusters 2
and I just want to say you're not
sleeping with it are you Mike I quite
literally I am I am an idiot I you sexy
shall we transition unless you guys have
another question on the Z I'd like to
talk about something else I'm going to
talk about just small tablets and
general really quickly yeah it's funny
because Adam was talking about how the
7-inch tablet was kind of taboo back
when the touchpad go would have came out
and how it was kind of an apple move and
everything and I had used several 7-inch
tablets i use 7-inch tablets before the
ipad came out would you use a galaxy tab
well i used to go it's eat at but that
was after the ipad yeah what else he had
had one yeah i used the galaxy I was
galaxy tab 7 and I had also used some
archos tablets way back in the day they
were running in game tomorrow oh yeah it
was i was an early adopter and that was
terrible but uh but but back in the day
I used to completely bash 7-inch tablets
they're not big enough they don't really
serve a real purpose they're just
slightly bigger than a phone and just on
and on they were awkward to use which I
still kind of agree with to an extent
because I can't type on one I used to
carry an iPad every day and I wrote
thousands of editorials on the on-screen
keyboard on my full-size iPad you're a
crazy person serious i would do it yes I
could I could write a full
1200 word article in 45 minutes on an
iPad that's pretty cool man I wouldn't
presume more than like three sentences
well well after I used it for a while I
got I get very used to that the soft
keyboard but the main I guess benefit
was the fact that I wasn't distracted
from everything because the multitasking
is so bad that I didn't want to do other
things I'm like oh I go I got the
notification I'm like ooh notification
not touching it just keeps hiding yes so
contextually it was really awesome but
then I got the ipad mini and it's the
first small tablet that I've just
absolutely fallen in love with now you
know and the display is just so awful it
is bad you making point though Taylor I
mean I was just thinking about so
whenever multitasking gets brought up in
on this podcast obviously we talk about
webos and this is a good show to to just
mention it on I still think webos is the
best multitasking solution for me it's
the kind of the one thing nobody has
managed to poach accurately yet from
webos hands down yeah however and I
wonder if you agree or disagree with me
Adam uh that phenomenon that Taylor
mentions that that you don't want a
multitask on a tablet because it's still
inherently less efficient than doing it
in a desktop scenario is still does
still apply to webos like I would even
though swiping up and go into another
card is fun it's still much more time
consuming than this layered window thing
I have going on on my desktop with tabs
in the browser and all this stuff so I
would still not want a multitask on a
tablet even if I if webos was so alive
and kicking I could one of the things
that Apple are not Apple but everyone
overlooks on say an ipad is how easy it
is to switch between apps because if you
use work with a four finger swipe yeah
four or five well 55 to go back to home
screen fordyce 42 to bring up the app
the back to take 459 you're right on
Tuesday no and you know what's so funny
used to make fun of those gestures but I
gotta tell you they are very nice you
might use the most time yeah like I used
for Tinker swipe to the to the left and
it pulls your most recent app from the
right he was going to bring it
should allow me to early in the morning
to the left I thought about i use the
four finger swipe all the time and that
took me when one road and then left me
down another Road oh man I need some
more this is why we record the weekly in
the morning stay for ice keep our minds
music donut shop coffee right that's to
Michael count'em I see it I see you're
dropping it yeah our surreptitious
sponsorship is alive and well Adam tell
me whether you agree or disagree there's
multitasking point of view before we
move on to other the tiny phone I gotta
disagree actually I I don't mind I i
actually prefer to multitask on my
touchpad you know the whole you know
open up an email copy text from a
webpage into it and you know I even got
to the point where I wanted to have
videos running in the background while i
was you know surfing or something like
that just like it listen to them so
there's a there's a patch for like
youtube where you could you know you
could actually pull up like a movie and
you could let youtube play in the
background why so yeah I mean as it's
not in its not intuitive and it's not
really built for a tablet but I i have
to say that i very much enjoy
multitasking on touchpad if i have more
than one thing to do obviously i also
have to disagree though that not not
with you Adam with Michael that the
touchpad that the webos is multitasking
is the best for a tablet yeah let's pack
floating apps hands down Oh what like on
the on the note 10 dot one or yeah or or
screen apps alright so that it that is
or a split screen on on window yeah but
not how they're currently implemented
what we were talking about before after
chat heads came out a quickly expandable
and and minimizing um floating app so
you just tap it and it opens up tap it
again and it disappears yeah there
there's a nice so right so but it
doesn't currently exist and we have two
different pushes happening right in the
desktop space we have apple kind of
leading the charge to to tablet if I the
desktop almost to iOS fi Oh
10 if we lose a clumsy sentence and
they're doing they're doing it
continuously but on the other side we
have samsung and and microsoft making
this push to to port desktop elements to
the mobile environment now i prefer that
latter approach I really do absolutely
most of the stuff that Apple is bringing
to the desktop experience that looks
iPad ish I don't use like right now I'm
looking at my stupid Notification Center
which I never use I'm just getting the
waiting dumb thing to the left yet it's
all just dumb cruft a like it doesn't
look good whereas I I've always thought
that bringing desktop elements to mobile
is the way to go unfortunately I think
that neither Samsung nor Microsoft has
really done it terribly well yet at
least for my use cases but I'm glad
we're kind of going down that road oh
yeah but speaking of things that can run
that are going to run those
modifications the samsung galaxy s4 mini
who thinks that that thing is going to
have multi-screen do we know anything
about this yet I basically have a filter
for anything galaxy s4 and then another
one of Samsung's buzz words so galaxy s4
active galaxy s4 zoom that's not what
it's going to be galaxies in a moment
all I'm hearing you say is galaxy s4 Oh
Paul oh good filter man you just are
driving that's nice yeah samsungsamsung
fans are gonna love you I i would i
would hope that would have that that
type of multitasking capability you know
the EVs why though what is it if it was
because if it doesn't it should not be
called the galaxy s4 anything it should
be its own the 12 we're already doing
that that's what this is what happened
with the galaxy s3 many everyone got
excited and then they found out no it's
just nothing like the galaxy s4 right on
the inside it isn't it does not resemble
it at all it's only on the outside that
it looks like a galaxy s3 so it's like
saying the breathe through and the beer
were the same phone just smaller what it
is basically saying that yeah that is
not the case but the downgrade and specs
looks to include a 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core processor 1.5 gigs of ram 8
gigs of storage ouch expandable via
microSD of course so listen uh
the all the specs do take it a step down
here but so is this wrong this is my
question I don't I see why they're doing
this I see why you would not want to put
a whole bunch of flagship class specs in
a smaller package that people are not
going to appreciate if people want the
flagship specs they're also going to out
the bigger screen they're going to buy
the real galaxy s4 so put it into a
smaller package take the specs away that
people aren't going to notice and sell
this to hobbyists to people who wants a
smaller device with the buzz of the
bigger one right is this what am I the
only one who doesn't think this is wrong
people no no hundred forty nine drew a
250 bucks to drop on the new phone I
mean that guy yet to yeah that cheers
part of me here's my thing there are
hardly any any any high-end smartphone
smaller than 4.5 inches and you're
making your Megan the argument i usually
make yeah yeah yeah why not make a small
high-end device there are a lot of
people asking for one there are a lot of
people with small hands mm-hmm I'm not
one of those but I'm fighting for the
people with small hands because I have
big hands and every phone is pretty
comfortable to use now yeah I mean why I
call it the galaxy s4 or the galaxy s4
me I understand why they're doing that
they're basically just munching off the
existing buzz and hype of the galaxy s4
exactly oh this must be the galaxy s4
and be a smaller version for those
people with no it's not it's not even
the same phone now see I here Benny and
I automatically assumed downgrade I mean
you know it's like you know like Austin
Powers mini me he wasn't gonna be beaten
on Boston powers by himself he needed he
needed dr. evil de to do a stuff and
same thing with the s4 mini I just I I
hear mini and I just assume that there's
going to be a drop-off in specs no true
we get all the opportunity there for an
oem to come in and change the game there
is an opportunity there still lying wide
open it's a risk because I don't know if
it would work I truly don't but I was
under to come out and say like yeah look
look at this we're doing a 4-inch
display so you can still use it with one
hand but look at these specs they're
exactly the same and that that's just
ripe for a tagline there you know it's
like you're exactly the same only
smaller you know the reason that's never
going to work
is because everybody has put so much
into display quality you know if you go
from a 1080p device at almost five
inches or add five inches and then you
make a mini you're going to have to go
down to 720p you make it four inches
you're gonna have to go to 720p because
1080 at which is ridiculous and useless
well what about 716 what about 720p at 4
inches like that's gotta amount to of a
similar pixel density right right but
people don't care about pixel density
all they care about is that resolution
like people who would be looking at the
mini yeah don't care about the resolute
or the density they're like oh this
one's 1080p in this one 720p they don't
understand how it works yeah I have to
be part of the crazy part of the crazy
would have to be four inch 1080p display
which I be compendious and then we have
a charitable our ears out we were all
our hair out and be like why are you
doing this yeah exactly why are you
ruining my life why are you giving me so
much to write about wait wait yeah so
that the galaxy s4 mini continued is the
the argument that that has that arose
with the galaxy s3 mini blah blah blah
blah blah so we're sitting here bashing
this or at least I'm down stadia yeah
i'm bashing the idea yet i own an ipad
mini and it is the exact same thing from
from apple it is a dumbed down version
of an ipad it is right but but the
utility there is is is different right
because well somehow I think mini
tablets vs. tablets is a very different
argument than mini tablet many phones
vs. phones maybe but but my biggest
complaint with the iPad Mini is actually
not the display it's the processor
because you know on a tablet I wrote an
article about this last night and I was
talking to you about it Michael phones
are you know overkill our aren't EADS
yeah they're overkill but that doesn't
apply to a tablet because I do so much
more with it i play games and do other
things on a tablet that i don't normally
do with my phone and the ipad mini has a
older chipset in it and it's not nearly
as powerful as the ipad 3rd generation
of 4th generation i went from an ipad 3
to the ipad mini and playing the same
games they stutter and actually do not
play well at all ah see that's that's
irritating yeah so that that is the
exact
same case that we would see here with
the galaxy s4 mini while we're talking
about apps on tablets Adam have you
tried to run sparkle on the touchpad go
I have not yet so actually I don't even
know if I is that a free app do I even
own that I think I think you have to buy
it but if you buy it i will i will buy
you a beer whenever we meet in person
which may be never but because I lastest
there but okay Farkle HD with my out by
him of your favorite games ever on webos
it was incredible never played that well
it is on iOS too if you guys want to
check it out it's it's you know it's not
like a one of a kind of anyway we're
good we're getting off track I tell you
mentioned the x-phone a second ago I
want to get it that so are you are you
implying that the motorola yet that the
Motorola MOTO X or the X phone as the
rumors were referring to it is maybe one
of the first examples of this unicorn
we're talking about no I just said
motorola I didn't say moto x don't don't
mix up my words here and Sam I'm saying
i'm putting that words right in your
mouth that's not what i'm saying but it
does look kind of small from the
pictures we've seen it does and it looks
kind of unremarkable from a hardware
perspective too but that's the point
that is no longer the most interesting
thing about the motorola phone at the X
phone which is actually being called the
Moto X by the way and that's the
official name I think that's a little
nerd yeah and that's the thing every
moto x is according to I believe this is
CEO dennis woodside who said this or
maybe this just is the motorola press
release but every moto x sold in the USA
will be married anxious Fort Worth Texas
catch making a pile of bone ever
assembled domestically now that's
interesting I i I'm not fact-checked
this I mean there may well be another
one that was assembled domestically that
we don't know about but you know that's
fascinating to me now I'm they may their
views very careful phrasing every moto x
sold in the USA will be assembled in
Fort Worth so they're probably going to
build some for overseas markets and
whatever but would you guys now the
price increase is probably going to be
like a given monumental right it's more
expensive to build things in America but
thousand-dollar phone that has decent
specs would you guys buy it like how
much more
hey for an american-made phone as we
were as Americans if you were eight
hundred dollars that would be my limit
only because one I support motorola
because they're a little different they
always have been and to their an
american company and everyone always
talks about you know if this was made in
america by it my grandpa was just a huge
huge proponent of made in America mmm he
would it didn't matter what it was if
you bought something where was that made
China you know you're like nobody's
actually made Mike's Mexico China so you
know when it came to put a woman push
came to shove and you know there are
things that were made in USA he wouldn't
buy them because they were expensive and
he was a penny pincher so it was uh
that's kind of the case with a lot of
people same thing with the Nexus Q well
this time oh it was this discussion
always puts me in mind of of that
argument but also of Adam one of the
most like I don't know morose
commercials I've ever seen I always
remember it I remember seeing this
commercial when I was like six it was
this like 30 second spot with this
mother and daughter like doing laundry
and there was like a gray filter over
that lands and it was just all really it
was immediately very bleak but they're
having this conversation is like why did
dad he lose his job as like well daddy's
gotta go find work and all this kind of
stuff and it ended up with the most like
this this gravelly voiced sad guys like
if you think looking for the made in
America label doesn't matter it matters
not like my god that's fantastic I'm
like six years old being like oh my god
I don't know why but I believe you do
you know I'm having two thoughts on this
on this particular thread the first
thought is I Drive a Mitsubishi made in
America is not exactly the most
important thing in the world to me and
my second thought is I'm flashing back
to the movie crazy people with Dudley
Moore where they had a Sony commercial
where the tagline was Sony because
Caucasians are too damn tall I've never
heard of that film and now I need to see
it apparent yes you do you absolutely
need to see it it's fantastic so it's
basically the gist is an advertising
company turns over the
the other market advertising ideas to an
insane asylum movies no so you know this
is a much bigger conversation and it
could go on for a long time and you know
there are the other side is of course
that we are no longer in this kind of
old economy model where it's like you
know we're confining production and
purchase two single countries is a
really good idea it's it's kind of not I
don't I I'm obviously straying outside
my bakery of loyola Nations good I maybe
it alone on this but I'm the kind of
person who really doesn't care for four
nationality ya like like I would rather
the world be just one big major
ecosystem like a not a microsystem what
is the episode most like almost a
federation yeah like a United Federation
well I'm telling what I'm saying like
right on that bandwagon didn't yeah I
saw that coming but do you get what I'm
saying where I mean we don't really pay
attention to where somethings made we we
just kind of like does that make any
sense at all does know it absolutely
does and that's that's what I think the
future is I think that's what the future
has to be unfortunately it's not the
present and and for people that you want
to grab as an oem for these people that
you wanted that are saying what are you
doing for our country which is hurting
you know which is a hilarious statement
for anyone listening from a country less
fortunate in America so we're not you
know we're not oblivious to that but you
know it fruit for those to try to
capture those customers can make sense
for an oem to do this oh yeah that's how
we started the call today with the
accents that was what happened tonight
hey what happened hello where's the
htc's big marketing push asked asked i
will it'll be interesting to see what
happens with motorola but i want to talk
about HTC real quick because steven jen
has a good piece here didn't Peter Chou
say that he was gonna double down a
marketing and double down or something
like that that's their favorite I'm
gonna double down every time somebody
says that yeah everybody every time
someone says that I think of the
sandwich at KFC Oh see good for you
every time somebody says I think about
HP and and webos they merged actually
an excellent editorial about doubling
down they talked about any time a
company says they're doubling down on
something it means that it's about to
die yeah I was like that's like war
there go on or they're just really
hungry for a double chicken sandwich
buddy it's like putting the show on CBS
at nine o'clock eastern that's it sits
on the chopping block yes oh god never
become invested in a show on CBS at nine
o'clock it's a bad idea if this were a
if this were in a text piece I would
have put a strikethrough through
everything you said after the word CBS
and said fixed that for you thank you
for poor CBS I wish they could make
something good let me talk about let me
ask you guys about this now Stephen
makes the point in his editorial that
HTC promised a big marketing push for
the HTC One unlike anything that we had
seen before from them but it is the same
it is the essentially the same exact
marketing effort just with different
material now I was longer for the same
length of time that's the problem is
they said this huge marketing push
behind the lawn to know like Oh what was
that phone I don't even remember we see
you contend that it is dropped off well
I mean do you see any ads anywhere ever
see I do I still do that this is why
this is just where it lives ya know
maybe this is a regional thing but I in
Boston I would just get are getting
nailed with HTC 17 broadcast I Brown a
movie theater pre-roll ads everywhere
it's it's really all we have any kind of
marketing for here is like tractors and
now what about it we have a flower stuff
and bass pro shop what about in Chicago
not a dang thing real yeah it's it's
crickets out here as far as the HTC One
is concerned I mean in the stores
there's a lot of signage in like the 18t
stores and whatnot there's signage and
you know there's a you know I went to
the 18 when I when I got my lumia
actually there were probably four or
five demo units of the HTC One around
and there was a couple of s4s but
granted the s4's were in the middle of
the store and the HTC one's were around
the periphery but still there were a lot
HTC one's Roland
around there so but but or you're not
seeing any outside the store no
billboards no commercials no radio
nothing see that's interesting isn't you
know in Boston it's getting recognition
and it's getting enough recognition to
instill some mindshare and actually that
applies to eastern long island as well
strangely enough i was on the ferry on
the way back writing some part of a
review and I had all these phones spread
on around me so this is like random dude
rolls up and he's like hey is that one
of them new windows phones and I'm like
yeah and we start talking about it and I
start telling them about all the phones
that I you know because I'm just talking
about all the full all the fun all the
phone I start talking about the HTC One
and immediately he picks it right up and
this guy is not a self-described Luddite
but immediately is like I was at the one
with the front facing speakers and I'm
like yeah yeah yeah yeah it is so says
the grills on the front that looked like
speakers hailer come on before before I
even got my demo unit out is the thing
so it is cool so I you know I think it
is generating more mindshare certainly
than the 1x did I don't think anybody
knew what the hell the 1x was when I
pulled that out last year so I don't
know I agree that I'd like to see more
but it's interesting to hear from I
wanted to take a little sample set on
our podcast from Chicago and the
carolinas and it seems like Boston is
Boston in the New York area are getting
a little more representation from our
unscientific poll yer I don't I don't
spend enough time in Charlotte iced I
mean I live in the know I live in
Concord where i live in NASCAR country
when people think of NASCAR they think
of Charlotte and Concord Charlotte Motor
Speedway which is in Concord all the
racing teams all of them all the any
racing team that's anyone for NASCAR is
in Concord or mortal I mean it's just
everything is right here and all your
marketing you see coca-cola 600 signs
everywhere you see NASCAR this NASCAR
that billboards for NASCAR that's have
you also had a lot like next tail back
in the day oh my gosh everywhere next
tool everywhere but the only place you
would go to see stuff like that is
actually into the heart of Charlotte or
maybe to the racetrack on race day
probably have a ton of ads inside but
outside all they're doing is trying to
get people inside yeah they don't care
about anything else here I just the
first yep guess except for camouflage
and mossy oak this is yeah but it
tangentially related but motive we
talked about motorola before and we used
to ask for it when next out came out
with the I 730 it was like a huge Dawson
device and people loved it and people
came in to buy and throng so we were
always running out but they also had
something called the nextel the nascar
nextel cup series where they had a bunch
of like custom painted i 7 30 s and
different driver colors from NASCAR and
yes people got that Jeff Gordon phone
and we can sell it to the people you
know there were a hundred dollars more
than a regular I 730 so we'd sell those
people but the thing is people would
come in not wanting those they've come
in just one in the I 730 but we'd be out
but would be like well we have the I 736
we got the NASCAR one they're like okay
which one is the least NASCAR whoa what
is that that was my phone sorry it was
like 30 rings at once yeah what is that
like a landline is that like a cisco
business phone what's up no no no no
that was just that was my house phone
and yes we have the stupidest phones in
the world that ring each individually
about half a second apart from each
other so you'll actually hear like that
but it sounds like a bunch of trick
crickets chirping know it sounds like a
bunch of crickets beating you in the
head with a hammer that's exciting the
message is for next you know I'm gonna
unplug my phone okay yes that is a
landline by the way I knew I couldn't be
a film my attempts to my attempts to
talked my wife into getting rid of the
landline have thus far failed it's like
the conversations I have with my parents
mmm so here's my thing we talked about
HTC we're almost done with Android but
Taylor wrote a piece which I like 20
which I like to call the piece I wanted
to write a long time ago and for some
reason I never got around to write
this but it was going to be called the
case for Android skins and I'm glad well
can I stop you what will we get into the
night why even ask why not yeah what um
I got flame for calling them skins
because they're not technically skins
and i know this i know that i knew it i
thought about it when I right or when i
wrote skins they're not skins they used
to be but they're not anymore they are
completely different builds of Android
but proceed fish kids yeah yeah you know
what's funny like I was looking in the
comment thread to find who was
complaining about that but you know
you're coming through it's actually
fairly positive on this one which I'm
good to see that's the first in weeks I
know because you kept bashing Microsoft
on a week where we inexplicably had like
four Microsoft bashing pieces lined up
God the comments will net 1 Peter last
Windows Phone piece I wrote was just oh
my god there were like a hundred and
fifty just ya idiot comments I'm like
okay yeah okay you didn't even read you
didn't have to read so with this piece
what's nice about this piece is that I
completely agree you know we have the
tech press got itself into a habit for a
long time of criticizing then the things
that were then called skins and now
which you can call whatever you want
custom layers custom builds OEM builds
of Android and I think it's very
important that we kind of periodically
take a step back and realize how
important these layers are and how much
they bring to the experience I love some
of the examples you cited Taylor about
the camera no longer functioning
properly when you put cyanogen mod on
one of these devices or what was the
other thing the sound quality on the the
HTC One it's there's audio clipping and
boom sound it's awful like every two or
three seconds it just it's not even like
a little clip it's like pop yeah like
okay well and you know it's a good time
to talk about this too because when the
samsung galaxy s4 Google edition was
announced I would like the the instant
reaction of the geek part of me was like
yes awesome and then about eight seconds
later I was like but wait not even the
same phone yeah and and also a lot of
the stuff that Samsung is
yes a lot of it was cruft and chrome but
a lot of it made them made the phone a
lot more usable in particularly the
camera so a camera sophomore especially
yeah the camera software would not say
that I don't mean like what you're
seeing on the front side I'm not talking
about panorama and all those things you
can add those aftermarket using apps
yeah i'm talking about samsung's auto uh
oh wow auto exposure auto focus all of
these things are Samsung's code and that
that's the difference you see when you
take a picture with the galaxy s3 galaxy
s4 a HTC One it's not just the sensor
difference it's how Samsung and HTC
optimize the sensor and Google doesn't
do that that's why the nexus for the
Galaxy Nexus the nexus s and the nexus
one all had pretty much terrible cameras
yeah and it's not necessarily the sensor
it's that Google doesn't really optimize
the camera they're like here it is and
have fun and actually speaking to your
point about you can get third party apps
to replace all the samsung features I
have yet to find a third party app that
does best face on my gs3 so yeah that is
true now I wish I wish schelotto would
release a nap but I guess they don't
because they license their software I
don't know you know I I just think it
was a good point who's worth mentioning
if you haven't looked at the at the
article you should check it out in the
rundown it's already got a bunch of
traffic to it I think it's pretty
popular piece and I may even share it
twice if Taylor Taylor stops
interrupting me on the air yeah you
don't know not doing it not doing it I
was being your hype man yeah I'm joking
with you can I talk about iOS very
briefly well I was just gonna say that
yeah kill that Segway kill it kill it
with fire Taylor Norton not martin
taylor martin commented Taylor Martin
has no clue what he's talking about and
this article confirms it no offense I
responded rational grade troll and yes I
responded or maybe I do and you don't
understand what I'm saying no offense
it actually works in this case because I
didn't say anything offensive nice boom
BAM my flame is back alright well
proceed you know what you know what that
was a that was a response that was
neither flat nor colorless but that may
not be the case for the new version of
iOS yes Wow from everything we've heard
Apple's iOS 7 says Stephen shank in this
latest piece is set to be the Jonathan
Ive show with the Ted designer tearing
into the ski of morphic heavy look we've
been familiar with so we're seeing
reports basically that that that the new
iOS maybe not just flat and and light on
textures but it may also be heading
toward a more monochromatic black and
white approach now I don't think that
Apple is going to make the mistake of
going like the Metro route when you dig
into the settings menu and just seemed
like black you know white text on a
black background but yeah meet me too
because that's one of my least favorite
things about Windows Phone just like if
to read every entry instead of your I
register your color or a shape it's
boring and in it is dull yeah on that
know how flat it's awesome i love flap
that is very apparent in the home screen
setup i have but black and white kills
it but look at bills like look at what
Google has done recently an Android
where they've they've really tended
toward the white side which I've found
an interesting choice because we saw
this push toward black in hollow are
risky well in hollow but first in
honeycomb I think and even though
honeycomb was a total train wreck it was
still very Tron like and very futuristic
but it did that with darker tones and
now Google's doing the opposite and it's
making everything just kind of
whitewashing everything but it's doing a
me with splashes of color what do I mean
yeah like okay go go get your not
talking about you're not talking about
Android you're talking about just Google
just Google yeah like all of their
sources right so Melville now jellybean
itself is today all right but I'm talk
about their service yeah okay and I'm
talking and I think they're gonna
they're gonna push that into android too
i think andrew is gonna get a lot
brighter in the next version I don't
know only because black is more
power-efficient well on an AMOLED screen
yes not in an LCD even on LCD it's a
little more power efficient if i'm not
mistaken well LCD you running that back
like the whole time it kind of doesn't
I don't think I think we're talking
maybe a percentage point or two but then
again I I can't source any of that you
may well be right but I don't know
regardless I mean aesthetically speaking
you know I there are ways to do there
are ways to do minimal color that look
really good and I think Google is doing
that nicely with its services right now
by whitewashing it so an apple you know
is no stranger to good software design
we've been complaining about iOS four
years it's like you a morphism yeah no I
know but but it's you know Apple knows
how to make beautiful stuff and
especially when they've been kind of
abused about it for at least two years
and maybe even three was we started
hearing like boy I'm tired of iOS you
know so I'm hopeful that they are gonna
bring something really interesting to
the fold here I have I have a fear I
have a fear that they're gonna make iOS
gorgeous that it's gonna look great and
then they're really not going to add
anything to it that they're going to
focus on the look and add their three
four five hundred new features that
really don't mean anything hmm like I
was afraid they're gonna pull us Samson
well I think they're gonna pull an apple
because look at iOS 5 and iOS 6 they
really didn't add much of anything I
message which is good I use our message
but I can't send pictures using it now
I'm a sob weakest none yeah I hate it
because it's closed down and and I can
only message my friends and they're like
why don't because I phone breaks all the
time and then it makes I go I far don't
like I've advocated the iphone to people
in my life who need simple phones and
then they're like all right now what now
it's green now it's blue now why is it
blue when I text her and green will text
you it's like I did like uh for the same
reason that only works when you text me
because it's using a standard anyway
let's I'm sucks so that notification
center that was a much needed change but
they did it very very poorly oh yeah so
the multitasking they haven't added
anything super compelling it's just been
kind of catching up all this act like
exactly they've been they've been
catching up they did the apple thing
right where they they they released a
feature lite version first and then they
now they've
catching up with a feature but I agree
now we're seeing some of that in Stevens
kind of story here this is from 9to5 mac
by the way but we're saying not
everything will be getting a huge
makeover mail is largely unchanged we
hear while others may be barely
recognizable so mail needs to be changed
more than any of them so bad i don't
know i don't think mail is bad you got
that side painting inside well uh yeah
what I Tim Cook we've confirmed though
it's coming out of wwc so we are going
to say this in um Tim Cook said that
he's not opposed to opening up api's
which is amazing because that's
something that that Steve Jobs would
have never have done is opened up api's
they said they're probably not going to
do it but they're not opposed to it
which means it could happen in the
future and what I mean by opening up
api's is sharing that is the biggest
biggest problem with iOS right now at
least for me is I on my android phones I
can from any app that provides sharing
options so the browser or an RSS reader
Twitter Google+ doesn't matter what it
is I can hit action overflow and share
and I can share anything that I'm in any
link or anything to anything that
receives sharing so Twitter Google+ the
browser Facebook anything I can do it
from anywhere which is on iOS yeah you
have to go into a nap copy a link or sin
you can share to mail messages Facebook
or Twitter and those are only the the
stock facebook and twitter apps that's
not if you use tweet but or anything to
that degree right so you can share to
those and then if you want to use
anything else you have to copy a link go
into another app and paste it and chair
and that might you might be saying you
know that's not that big of a deal but
when you share a lot it's a big of a
deal it's a big deal it's a big deal
like pocket i use pocket religiously
just to save links for reading later and
i have to go into the browser copy the
link and then go into pocket to save on
android i'm in the browser hit share at
the Pocket done did you mainly use
pocket in the past or do you use pocket
now
oh you're welcome I know you saw what
Evers wate what I love is when we do a
story about pocket or we mentioned
pocket and an editorial in like there's
always that one door commenter who's
like who owns shameless self promotion
that our way to play to plug yourselves
dudes and it's like we don't we don't
own pocket vote for someone yeah we've
nothing to do with pocket in one of the
articles Leverett last week blaming on
windows phone was I included the app
pocket casts oh yeah that's what away
yeah yeah and everybody's like oh you'll
pocket cats what we don't Oh internet
hey speaking Windows Phone let's jump to
it before we get out of here because we
do have to go we are very busy there are
two stories in the Windows Phone run
down one of them is going to be removed
because it's from last week sorry about
that gentlemen the news that we're tired
of Nokia EOS rumors by the way oh my god
are we sir you just want to see the
thing the Nokia amber wp8 update which I
actually just learned about I know this
is kind of old news but I had been
conflating it with the general Windows
Phone 8 gdr2 update but there's it's
going to go I guess it's nokia sourced
and it's going to go hand in hand with
the gdr to update and this is going to
deliver apparently some extra nokia
specific enhancements so we have some
photos from who who's this from my Nokia
blog but it's also then they source it
from WP central forums and it's from do
SP why com deus by anyway we're seeing
some modifications to a Nokia Lumia 925
with a camera ISO settings of 3200
there's an on-screen clock that stays on
I guess even when the device is off or
I'm in standby and there's some tweaks
to the display saturation is what we're
saying I'm sure we'll see more but boy
I'm looking forward to seeing what is
the what a major update guys well hold
on a second my it might well be because
first I'm looking forward to two major
things in the Nokia amber update
and I am NOT I'm gonna tell you them but
first I want to ask Adam doubt who is
better versed in Windows Phone than
Taylor Martin about what features he's
most looking forward to anoka amber
ought to be honest I want the radio back
so what the FM radio when I go to uh
when i go to my gym um they have you
know the TV's going across the top of
the thing and they've got the
frequencies down below I don't have a
radio who has a radio anymore that's on
their car 3 to listen to this channel
yeah yeah so the one time I went to my
gym and this is when i saw the lumia 900
and i'm just like wait a minute my lumia
900 has great oh wait so i plugged it in
and I turned on the radio and i watch
the Blackhawks game while on the
elliptical it was beautiful yeah so and
so and then when windows 8 when I got
the Lumia 920 I'm like I don't have that
anymore sad panda although I'm much more
of an AM person myself but now it was a
windows phone 8 that broke the FM radio
or was it Nokia's new hardware what what
was it that because the hardware has it
right it's Windows Phone 8 then that
that doesn't have it for whatever reason
okay so all right but but the the Lumia
920 hardware is capable of supporting it
it is my understanding yes yeah why
would why would Microsoft take features
out I'll tell you why I'll tell you why
because they had to rebuild windows
phone from the bottom up with a new
kernel yes right yeah and I'm sure they
had to throw stuff out and order what
did they say they used that wonderful
metaphor they're like this is like
trying to change the tire on a race car
while it's moving down the road and I
get why they would they would be like FM
radio we who uses that yeah about 450
people let's say right for the next
update so I get it right that's all we
ask their users right oh you Oh stamp
wow there's there's also third-party
apps that will let you do to get FM FM
feed though they are right but they're
streamed over data connection exactly
there to like tunein radio you can tune
into you know the FM channels but you
can't do custom FM channels because the
hard work because the hardware support
is there or the software support isn't
there for the hardware so that's where I
would particularly enjoy having it so
that's interesting to the FM radio and
my thing is because I've used the
blackberry z10 so often this past month
because we did the after the buzz on it
is the double tap to unlock which you
know every time we mention it somebody's
got to come up and remind us that the
nokia n9 was the first to do it or oh i
miss visible to do it and ya know and so
it's it's cool I don't care who did it
first it's awesome like after using the
blackberry z10 for like two days you
will do it on every other phone it's
like the webos thing where you use the
pre for a couple days then on every
other phone you're doing the up swipe to
get back to Cardinal well first of all
black person you see that happens to the
blackberry too but uh but it's the swipe
to unlock on the screen and the double
taps unlock on the screen is just going
to be the but it's going to be amazing
but the biggest headache solver that I'm
waiting for a nokia amber and this is
not confirmed we don't know if they're
going to do this but if they redo the
camera viewfinder this is not Nokia's
fault it's microsoft's fault but oh my
god i once again this week for two
freaking days shot images on my lumia
920 or 928 I can't remember within in
backlight mode or in night mode oh oh
yeah yeah yeahs doesn't tell you there's
no icon in the viewfinder to tell you
that it's in a different mode and it
remembers the last model was in and that
that's persistent across I think that's
even persistent after a reboot yeah yeah
and actually do you think I would ensure
that remembering any camera settings to
remembering every to remembering
everything and not telling you it's like
there should be something if you're not
gonna do an icon then at least make the
camera viewfinder smarter to where it's
like hey I notice you're shooting at 1pm
in broad daylight maybe take a night
portrait mode off yep there's a yeah
well you only see it until you take a
picture and then like hesitates for a
second and then brightens the picture
you're like wait why do that process on
are you doing that right exactly but if
you are if see if you're taking chats
quickly like I think people assume that
like the counter-argument to this right
is to be like well why don't you notice
the picture sucks you should know that
but you know we don't take pictures in
in laboratory conditions all the time as
I just reminded somebody on YouTube a
little too sniffily i should add at that
comment was mean came out meaner than i
meant it too but you
we're doing stuff we're living life you
know that's the way you should review a
phone is by integrating it into your
normal life I feel so I'm out unlike the
boat you know I'm like crossing from one
side to another and there's stuff going
on and I'm grabbing a beer or whatever
and it's like oh I want to take a
picture real quick I don't always notice
until i get home later like why is there
so much noise in the shot o son of up
you know and then I look it up and it's
like that because you were on a boat i'm
on a boat like a boss I don't know
that's right well with that thing said
that we've gone a little over our limit
here I want to mention as I frequently
do that your listener mail is not going
on red folks we do have it piled up in
the podcast inbox and when we have a
longer time slot we will get to it but
right now like I say I'm doing two
reviews you gentlemen are very busy with
your own stuff we've got a jet but final
thoughts before we sign off from Chicago
ah I wish the touchpad go had come out
it would not have made a difference in
the ultimate fate of webos but at the
same time I'm kind of happy it didn't
because as I concluded my editorial if
it had come out then this would have
been a very boring article about a
failed tablet instead of an interesting
one about a gold-plated unicorn oh I
loved that lead out by the way that is a
great piece folks it has 8 comments on
it if you want to get your opinion out
there that's the piece to go to wait I'm
up to eight yes god it's so depressing
the right webos pieces because the yeah
cuz it's time is past but god it's so
nice to see things just popping out of
the woodwork still from from that
vaunted ii but failed effort so thank
you very much Adam for coming on the
show today it's nice to have you better
Taylor as always it was a difficult and
trying experience and um you know I
usually like me thank you for your

pressure thank you love me and no I need
to make it clear I do not hate windows
phone that was all point of some of the
articles I wrote last week at don't hate
windows phone but it lacks some of the
things I need and it's an easy target Oh
wolf just you know have to change out
your D levels you dig those nails in
deeper and
