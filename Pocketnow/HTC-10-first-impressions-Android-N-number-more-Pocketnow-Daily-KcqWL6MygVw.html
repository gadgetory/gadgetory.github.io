a lot of promise LG decides that take
its friends a step further and invites
developers and we learn more about what
to expect for Android n I'm hi Mary vera
and when you mix the first Mario with
the first ghostbusters the t-shirt just
becomes an impulsive buy this is parking
out daily there are a ton of official
news today let's begin with LG back when
we were in Barcelona we were told that
we would see friends extend to third
parties and the company has just
announced its developer forum where it
will be allowing third-party developers
to attend and build something cool for
the g5 so far that is the coolest part
of the phone the fact that it's
modularity allows it to become more than
what you currently see let's just hope
that it also includes better build
quality of the process other official
news come from google the company has
just launched a new accessibility
feature for hands-free operation with
the phone in a nutshell it allows you to
set numbers to your applications on the
home screen in the settings menu in
order for you to be able to call them
them with numbers through either
hands-free or a number it is rather cool
but it's not the only accessibility
feature that's coming you get more
details in the links of the description
I'm speaking of google and android
samsung has just pushed an update to its
sdk for developers to be able to build
more multi window support applications
and obviously because Android n is
coming this is all in preparation to
Android and and within the documentation
we learned that Samsung is already
dubbing this Android 70 so for those of
you that are wondering if Android n was
really just a couple of steps up to
Android M actually know if it's going
all the way to 7 dot 0 it means that
there is a lot more coming let's see
what we get I was will the spotlight
over to Qualcomm we get to hear more
information on the Snapdragon 823 which
we can expect on smartphones later this
year specifications don't really change
much except for the fact that it will
allow up to eight gigs of RAM give it
the fact that we heard of the galaxy
note 6 might include a lot more RAM in
the galaxy s7 this is a rather
compelling processor let's see if we do
get it in the end and finally the very
hot news that they have to do with HTC
the HTC 10 is now official our hands on
video is already live we have been
testing the phone for the past few days
it is a rather compelling smartphone
totally different to the HTC that we've
seen over the past few years which is
great no longer compromised it actually
brings specs that are on parts
everything else and obviously the only
question now is if it performs our
review will be live very soon to tell
you more but so far I can tell you this
much it is a very very good smartphone
pre-orders already live sadly the launch
is still not confirmed only we here
early May but it does lead me to the
question of the day tell us what you
think about the HTC 10 through our hands
on video do you think that this is your
next smartphone in my case I'll tell you
this much this was the smartphone that I
have been waiting forever HTC for the
past two years I believe and so far so
good leave us a comment down below we'd
