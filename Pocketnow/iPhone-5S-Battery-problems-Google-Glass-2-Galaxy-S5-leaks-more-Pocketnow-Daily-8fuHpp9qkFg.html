issues and dapple is apparently dealing
with it vogue last version 2 goes live
even if you still can't buy the damn
thing and yeah we already get rumors of
the galaxy s5 I'm hina iveta and please
Leaguers really I mean why don't you get
us details of the galaxy s 10 while
you're at it this is out daily
let's start off with some official and
awesome news as Nokia finally begins
detailing their new refocus application
for lumia models you know that new app
like the Lytro camera where you can take
a photo and then zoom to different
places after the photos taken you
actually edit it and do whatever you
want with it after the photos ticket
it's really cool technology and it's
coming to the major lumia smartphones
very soon in the next coming weeks
bahama is obviously there are 52 weeks
in the year and we don't know exactly
which one that will be now to Sarah bout
some more official bad news as Apple has
now confirmed on their own that they
have detected some battery issues on
some iphone 5s models some specific very
small amount of models and they're
apparently already contacting customers
to give them a free phone swap for
whatever troubles they've had now
obviously since we do not know specific
details as to which phone batch was it
it could be that our own phones right
now are having trouble I mean do any of
you have battery issues because I can
invent some of mine and get a new phone
now let's go through some rumors and
specifically Amazon we've heard about
their smartphone project we've heard
about them working with HTC we've heard
about a design that includes a 4.7 inch
display a 13 megapixel camera etc etc
and we've also heard that we aren't
getting the phone anytime soon but
apparently some motion tracking
technology software will be included in
the felt is the second time we hear the
sleek apparently there will be some
other cameras in the corners try to
track your eyeballs but the question is
and please take your guests what exactly
do you think Amazon is planning with
this leave us a comment now let's talk
about some hilarious news from Samsung
and the reason why it's hilarious is
because we're probably almost a year
away from the launch of the next Galaxy
s5 and we're already getting leaks about
it first of all that apparently we're
getting four gigs of RAM on a 64-bit
processor which are expected fine that's
probably what's coming but even more
interesting is that it
only Sampson will ditch optical image
stabilization for another year on the
camera of the smartphone which is really
interesting and kind of sad but still
when you get the iphone 5s no optical
image stabilization and great low-light
performance you get to wonder if you
really need that thing in the first
place so we'll see how that goes and
finally for the interesting news of the
day Google is already demoing the second
version of Google glass you know that
specific gadget that's out there for
some people that you'll most probably
not be able to afford and you can't buy
right now well apparently google has
made some minor changes to it including
some design changes to be able to
accommodate normal glasses not
necessarily just the cool glasses from
google glass and also there's an
earpiece for better audio except for the
bone conduction hardware that was there
in the first very into but still you
know that leads you to the question of
the day we're by version 2 of google
glass and do you care anymore about this
running less because in my particular
case honestly the more time goes by the
less buzz that i find on glass you know
I really don't care about that product
anymore unless they press it on like
twenty dollars or something whenever
they launch that thing but leave us a
comment down below how do you feel about
it and friends if you want to get the
news earlier before this video gets
filmed make sure you follow us on
