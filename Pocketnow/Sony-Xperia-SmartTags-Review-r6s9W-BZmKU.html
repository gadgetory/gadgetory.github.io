now and well now that we're back from
Barcelona let's continue talking about
the Sony Xperia S now that the old what
they experience is that there are a
couple of really cool innovations with
the device and it wouldn't really be
fair to just film one video as a
software tour now it turns out that well
in this little red bag in the box well
we had what the sony xperia smarttags
and well this is just to show a new
approach that Sony has into NFC it's not
just about payments so there's so much
to talk about that let's begin now out
of the box there are two smart tags
included one in red and one in black
probably in other regions there will be
other variants and the way these smart
tags work is that within the Android
operating system there's a new widget
that includes your ability to program
them so you have one in the red one and
black you can program them for you
whatever you want to you can actually
name them on whatever you want so let's
say in my case in particular I name the
smart tag for car and one smart tag for
bedroom so it actually includes an
adhesive that you could place on your
dashboard in the car and then you can
just go into car and I have a couple of
three already programmed things that I
like like for example I don't need Wi-Fi
when I'm in the car so I turn it off
then I have sound mode to loud because
obviously I'm not gonna be hearing the
vibration on the phone whenever my
music's loud and I could also ask it to
start an application so in my case in
particular what I like is navigation and
I just activate navigation whenever I
touch the thing so the way it works this
is this is the red smart tag all I do is
just simply swipe the phone within it
and it'll automatically start launching
everything that you asked it to do turn
off Wi-Fi start navigation the whole
nine yards if you set it to do music
it'll also give you the option and
you'll notice that if you try to add
more options you can actually turn on
and off Bluetooth GPS open any URL play
tracks
send a text message set wallpaper sound
mode to obviously go vibrate loud or not
start an application text-to-speech and
within text-to-speech there are a couple
of really small not very good options
but they're there you can actually turn
it on and then tell it to speak incoming
text messages speak the current time and
well that's about it for now but it's a
really good option if you're driving
the other option that I have for the
xperia smarttags in black is that I use
this for the bedroom the way it works
when I go to the bedroom is what things
do I care about when I'm in the bedroom
well I like for my Wi-Fi to be turned on
because I back home Bluetooth I turn it
off not really needed sound mode I
turned it into vibrate because obviously
I don't want any of this sound to become
a problem and I wanted to start Netflix
because that's what I do in particular
every time I come back home so it all
depends on you the cool thing about the
smart tags is you don't have no limit as
to how many you can buy or what you
could do with them you can actually
leave one at the exit of your home
whenever you touch it because you're
probably going to the gym you could
activate your music and for it to play a
particular song that you want or you can
have it in the office and whenever you
come into the office you just swipe the
phone to the new smart tag that's in the
office and I'll remember that you want
your email application to be launched
that you want sounds to be set to
vibrate it all depends on your specific
needs that's it for a review of with the
sony xperia smarttags thank you very
much for watching remember to give us a
thumbs up if you like what you saw and
leave us a comment down below if you
have any doubts on what it can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
