calm and we are going to take a quick
look at office 2013 preview running on
the windows 8 consumer preview with a
touch-sensitive tablet so let's check it
out ok we're going to start with what I
think is the best new office 2013 app
OneNote MX and here we see the interface
and you can pan like this to see all
your notebooks and all your sections and
pages and right now I have the test page
open which has a few things that I used
to see what kind of support for
different one note features is available
here so we do have attachments those
work fine we have a table checkboxes
list everything there works this
actually does work that's pretty easy
let's get back to the test page
I blink all this stuff works we got ink
even movies audio files clippings
equations they have is a little
different here but basically everything
is supported when it sinks to one no MX
now here's the new cool new interface
this little button over here so if i tap
that we get all our little options we
can choose to insert a picture from the
camera you can pay stuff you can do
table bullets but you'll notice a lot of
things are missing like recording the
video or screen clippings here's a
really cool thing if I just swipe up
like that it's going to paste it so you
don't have to just touch it to see all
your options you can remember where the
locations of the commands are and just
swipe there's pace there's pace so
here's an a table and we'll see the
buttons change a little bit when we're
in different areas so there you have and
if I swipe like that you see we really
easily get some more rows down there in
the table there's your picture and we
see a different button for the picture
and there's your picture options not
very many so that's one note MX we can
also tap and hold pages and rearrange
them like so we can put them in a
different section maybe that one there
you go so there's a lot of functionality
here there is a lot better than the one
up version on iOS Android and Windows
Phone however it does not have all of
the functionality of OneNote so when you
need all the high-end features of
OneNote you have to launch the desktop
version so this is it and it's a can be
used with your finger there's a full
screen button up here
it's kind of small but it'll make a
larger area and those three little dots
of the middle bring up your normal
toolbar it has all of the features that
you need web clippings video recording
audio recording and do all the normal
stuff d you expect for the money
high-end one note version next up we
have outlook and we still have the full
screen button up here you can get all
our buttons appearing right away there's
your view you can double tap those to
shrink them but fullscreen brings up
everything in one screen with that
little dots up there and instead of
being in the middle like one note they
are over there in the corner and all
this touch sensitive stuff works pretty
nicely it's a little laggy in the email
list but it's pretty smooth in the email
preview until you do the pinch to zoom
let's see if you can see that it says
tech with zoom with a percentage instead
of just doing it right away which is
kind of weird so that's outlook it works
okay next we have access is right here
not a whole lot has changed
functionality wise and we're also
missing the full screen button up there
so you really have to use this with all
the tools showing however you course you
can collapse them like so and it pretty
smooth touch scrolling their next is
word and again we have very smooth
zooming there you see it rear enders the
text
and this one does have a big full screen
option so here we are in reading mode
and it has a really nice to pain layout
where we can flip through and read your
document Excel again we got zooming
works really nicely and we have the full
screen button so in some ways it can
look like a metro app but it really is a
desktop app and we have our task bar
hidden and it's totally full screen and
I can go like this to get back to
Windows 8 apps however you can't use
that to switch between desktop apps you
have to use the task bar down there
which is pretty annoying here's
publisher not a whole lot has changed we
have a slightly different design and we
have full screen file menu just like all
the other apps and we do not have the
full screen menu button up there so
there's a lot of inconsistencies and
here's power point where we do have a
full screen button does not have the
little dots it has a little note that
says click here for more commands so
that's office 2013 preview on windows 8
consumer preview will expect some things
to change before a full release but you
can see so far there's a lot of
inconsistencies and since the apps don't
run as Metro apps it's kind of annoying
that you can't really switch between
them using the normal windows 8
interface the exception is one note MX
which works really nicely in the Metro
tablet mode and I expect that to be a
quite a great program hopefully you can
buy separately from office 2013 I'm sure
you can so that's a quick look at office
2013 preview on windows 8 consumer
preview I'll be sure to give us a thumbs
up and thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
