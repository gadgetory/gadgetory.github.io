calm and today we'll show you a neat
little application that will help you
keep track of all your data on your
android device so let's get started and
the program is called netcounter and it
is free on android market and with
certain changes that have occurred
specifically with AT&amp;amp;T where they no
longer allow you have unlimited data
this application will allow you to keep
track of your data per your billing
cycle or whatnot so we can either expand
our cell phone data or Wi-Fi data so if
i go down here click on this arrow you
can see my total data for the month as
well as my total data for the device
since i installed this application my
past seven days and of course today i
can also look at my Wi-Fi data so if
they want to keep track of how much data
i am transferring on my device through
my Wi-Fi network i can do that as well
and i haven't used that much I you
mostly use it when i'm out and about so
i just see i've only used 11.4 6 in the
past month on my Wi-Fi now ur so i can
just minimize those if I like I can also
go down into settings and I can change
the preferences I can check this box
here to have it update on my Wi-Fi
network every 30 seconds but it does
require more power but it says it's more
accurate I can also import and export
the data to my SD card or from my SD
card and I can show a debug log if I'd
like I can also go back into the
settings and refresh so my billing cycle
starts on the twenty-sixth of each month
so if I wanted to refresh this all I
would have to do is set that on the 26
and keep track of all my data because
with current data plans on 80 as well as
i'm sure will occur on other service
providers in the future you will no
longer have unlimited data so you'll
want to keep track of how much data
you're using and if you don't use that
much data per month it's also a good
idea to get a less expensive plan
opposed to a 5 gigabyte or something
like that plan from
this is another Android Market pick to
help you keep track of your data usage
per month and the program is free on
android market thanks for watching and
if at any time you want to download this
program directly to your vice just
navigate using google goggles to the QR
code on the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
