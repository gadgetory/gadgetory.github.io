you're a technology blogger in 2014 or
really any kind of white-collar worker
odds are these are the tools which
dominate your workday so when a company
like Samsung decides to focus on Fitness
with its new flagship smartphone it can
be tough to fully evaluate those
features while well trapped behind a
desk so while we've already given you a
quick look at Samsung's s health suite
in our galaxy s5 review we're taking you
much closer with this video I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and I spent a day
with the Galaxy s5 and the gear fit
becoming the person that s-health
wants me to be sort of I kick off the
day bright and early only about a half
hour later than I planned and thanks
mainly to the arrival of the FedEx man
who delivers a shiny new samsung gear
fit to my door while the fit is charging
and getting to know the galaxy s5 a
shower and locate my only pair of shoes
not made by Sperry Top Sider
and then like any good fitness fanatic I
go to a fast food coffee shop for my
breakfast I input the sandwiches brand
name into s health and I'm surprised to
see it's actually in the database then I
spend a minute telling s Health's
judgmental life coach exactly what my
life is like appropriately there's
actually an option in here for reassess
lifestyle which you could argue that I
should be doing given that most of my
scores fall in the failing range except
for sleeping I'm really good at sleeping
when I'm done getting shamed by the life
coach I make sure the gear fit is ready
to measure my heartbeat and step count
so I can work off these 600 calories of
coffee and sandwich heading out on the
town for my first bit of exercise I
think why don't I kick things off right
with a run but without a cameraman I'm
carrying a lot of equipment so a brisk
walk will have to suffice and brisk it
is 44 degrees and overcast because it's
the beauty of New England
okay yeah wine a lot but not all of that
is belly akin for belly ache in sick
while the previous generation Galaxy s4
has an environment mode built into its s
health app that uses the phone's ambient
temperature and humidity sensors to tell
you whether you should be working out
outside or inside
Samsung stripped those sensors from the
s5 fortunately there are still about
80,000 ways of looking at the weather
and anyway the walk wasn't all bad I was
even able to pick up some artisinal
water from a small locally owned
business I decided to cap my walk at 2.5
miles just to see how I'm doing and I
come away disappointed by what the gear
fit reports I worked up quite a sweat on
my walk and I kept a steady pace for
most of an hour but according to my fit
I've only burned off about half my
breakfast the news is more agreeable on
the phone which tells me I've burned
many more calories and while that sounds
like nicer news I don't know who to
trust
now this confusion doesn't last terribly
long you do get to know as health after
a while but using the software with the
gear fit can be a bit disjointed for all
the similar iconography between them
it's not entirely clear when they're
working together and if not why they're
not either way it seems I need a more
laborious exercise regimen on the train
I set a course for an adventure more
befitting my nautical roots and
fortunately it's a mile walk from the
train station allowing me to get the
blood flowing again the start/stop
button on the fit comes in handy for
this it's very much a session oriented
exercise device welcome to Newton
Massachusetts the only place near Boston
you can get a kayak when the air
temperature is 45 degrees and the water
temperature isn't much higher
but I'm not just here because of my
pathological obsession with novelty I'm
here because both the Galaxy s5 and gear
fit are rated for immersion in water and
it makes sense to test them in an
environment that Fitness mavens would
probably want to use them at and I'm
happy to report they perform beautifully
on a two-mile expedition despite this
kayak being a particularly wet one and
its pilot being almost completely inept
adventure unfortunately almost no
unconventional exercises are included in
the s health database which heavily
favors walking hiking biking and of
course running there doesn't seem to be
a way of logging the 450 calories you
burn while you kayak for two miles which
is a little disappointing this is where
third-party apps like lose it enjoy a
bit of an edge over Samsung's offering I
run into another letdown when logging my
lunch
the Galaxy s5s battery is taking a
pretty hefty beating from the pedometer
and the Bluetooth link to the fit yes
I'm listening to music and taking
pictures too but these are things you
could reasonably expect someone to do on
a workout by the time I get back on the
train I'm at 5% and I'm forced to plug
into a power pack seven hours after
taking the phone up charge now listen
that's not bad at all most workouts
don't last that long of course but it's
definitely something to keep in mind if
you plan on a longer expedition remember
there is a hiking mode available here by
the time I get close to home it's 42
degrees and dropping and I have no
desire whatsoever to be outside seeing
as my gym membership lapsed years ago
the only solution is to drink beer and
then sleep but unsound as this choice
may be s health can help here too I use
it to log my two over five beers and
then I activate sleep mode on my wrist
the gear fit is small and light enough
not to bother me while I'm sleeping and
s health keeps a log of just how well I
slept based on movement it recorded over
the course of the night
okay obviously I'm not the ideal
candidate for this a real fitness person
could tell you more about how viable s
health and the gear fit are as exercise
companions which is why editor-in-chief
Anton D Nagy will be taking a look at
this combo soon but millions of galaxy
s5 buyers are a lot like me people who
don't get off on working out but who
like to be active and do things
nevertheless and enjoy anything that
helps them track that and s health does
a pretty good job of that I don't know
of any other smartphone manufacturer
shipping anything like s health as a
standard option out of the box to say
nothing of offering a phone that's
basically impervious to sweat and
splashes along with a waterproof
accessory that not only reads your heart
rate and tracks your steps but also
shows you notifications and lets you
control music as you workout sure there
are frustrations here and there and
specific third-party apps will doubtless
be a better fit for some but Samsung was
wise to pursue the nish of the fitness
fan with the Galaxy S five and gear fit
if I were someone shopping for a
smartphone and actively trying to get in
better shape s health compatible devices
and these two products in particular
would definitely be on my short list one
more Samsung coverage check out Anton's
unboxing at our 24 hour impressions on
the gear fit subscribe to pocket now
here on YouTube and social media and
stay tuned for more Galaxy S five
coverage in the days ahead thanks for
watching
I sort of like this roguish no glasses
look what do you guys think they're fake
anyway
horrible day to do this this fighting no
fighting hey hey
