due to the iphone 6 plus Sampson
protects quarterly losses even with the
success of the galaxy s6 and so he
doesn't seem interested in selling its
Xperia lineup I'm hi mera neta and boy
am I happy that I won't be the
laughingstock of the NBA this is parking
out daily the official news today start
with Sony as the company's CEO which
name I won't waste my time trying to
pronounce has just confirmed that the
company is committed to its smartphone
lineup he admits that selling the vile
lineup was not a very good idea to the
point where it seems that Sony will
continue with its Xperia lineup we just
don't know when the best of its
smartphones are gonna come to the United
States eventually we'll keep you posted
on that one other interesting news are
rather negative HTC just said it had
losses and Samsung is also predicting
quarterly losses of four percent and
profit from since point to six billion
dollars to 6.16 and the reasons are not
being said obviously we would have to
wait for the conference call but it does
seem that the galaxy s6 was not as
successful as they were expecting and
speaking of HTC let's move away from the
losses and talk about its future product
the HTC arrow that we have been covering
lately seems of the company will bring
this flagship later this year we've got
some Flyers claiming information on its
display apparently it will be a gorilla
glass 4 display quad HD in resolution
and apparently it will be 2.5 be glass
something we've seen with the iphone 6
and we've also seen with other products
like the Oppo r7 indeed it would be cool
to see these products or additions to
the spec sheet of this device let's just
see if it happens for Eva and for those
of you that have been following Windows
10 it seems that everything is on track
according to trusted sources Windows 10
rtm or release the manufacturers will be
ready either yesterday or today because
that's when it was reported and it seems
that we might get it or at least sorry
manufacturers will get it by the end of
this week meaning that everything is on
track for Windows tend to be launched on
new computers by July 29th up let's just
see how many products will be getting on
launch date and finally for the
hilarious news of the
day and I'm sure you just notice that it
took me a couple it takes to record this
it seems that NBA star from the San
Antonio Spurs Matt Boehner and I hope I
got his name right is apparently
complaining of tennis elbow due to none
other than the iphone 6 plus according
to him the phone is so big that he's
having trouble stretching his fingers
and that caused them to have tennis
elbow issues and that caused him to had
of a very bad season injury very
interesting surely the phone is
humongous definitely but it does leave
me to the question of the day do you
feel that the iphone 6 plus is too big
too large i mean do you think that Apple
should tone down its bezels or something
in my case I do agree this is definitely
a large phone but hey at least I'm not
in the NBA and I don't have any injuries
