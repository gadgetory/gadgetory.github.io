the second episode of pocket now VIP the
show or we sit down with the coolest
biggest names in mobile tech and just
kind of talk about stuff I'm Brandon
minimun editor-in-chief of pocket now
and with me I've got a guy from a site
that I visit all the darn time Phil Nick
it's an editor in chief of Android
Central hello Phil who are these mobile
experts you're talking about so I don't
have any of those here we're going to
pretend like we know stuff and and we'll
go from there Phil and I see each other
a few times a year at phone events and
industry trade shows i think phil
travels more than a CEO of a
multinational corporation god I hope
that those poor guys you uh you must
have racked up a lot of frequent flyer
miles by now I I do okay I just got back
from Alma not quite two weeks straight I
went home for the weekend between a
google i/o and ctia but i'm i'm now home
and it's it's good to be here sorry are
you heading back on the road Sooners I
did a little bit of a wall I've got a
week head home and I gotta go to New
York for a few days yeah we're we're in
the thick of it for sure awesome so so
before we talk about phones I'm
something sort of off-topic viewers Phil
does a column each weekend if you
haven't seen it called from the editors
Dex desk it's a great mix of what
happened in the past week what's coming
up the next week and also some personal
bits about Phil and something I learned
yesterday is that Phil you're a fellow
Queens of the Stone Age fan yeah I mean
off and on and I was hanging out with a
friend of mine out in the desert this
weekend actually he's like dude you got
it here then I hadn't heard the new one
yet so I picked it up and really really
good really really enjoying it it is
really good it's good it's kind of dark
a little bit dark very dark yet but
that's that's kind of I guess my people
like Queens of the Stone Age I tell you
that column was actually I mean that's
just a fun thing that's a place for me
just write whatever the hell I want yeah
when people get upset about that it's
like oh don't read it it's fine don't
don't pay attention yeah yeah it's a
great column speaking of music are you
using google music all access mm-hmm I
am have you determined if it's better
than Spotify for you I you know I hadn't
used streaming music for
I'll since soon passed died actually I
just I kind of didn't want to throw
money into anything else for a little
while and maybe because it wasn't you
know one of the big major companies
things so you just don't know how long
it's gonna be around I mean I say that
like it's not like I haven't used
pandora right like Pandora's not good or
something and it's not like spotify and
rdio there was anything wrong with them
I just for some whatever reason I never
got around to trying idiot um so you
wanted to commit to a music service that
would be around for the next ten years
well I mean you would think so right
everything else is in google music
anyway that's what i've been using since
it came out so it's kind of made sense
to start using it but it's very much
like having zune pass back for me which
is great i'm not so much into the the
you know explorative playlists it's like
if I see something I want to listen to
it I want to listen to a whole record
for out the back yeah it's something
else I was talking about with my friend
in the desert like that's how I listen
to music I don't need just you know mix
tapes anymore I'm grown up now yeah this
is it this idea of a instant radio it's
just it's it's so pervasive now but it
doesn't it doesn't work for me it
doesn't like it works for you either you
just like to pick the music and play it
yeah I mean it's not a bad thing to each
his own but that's just how I perfect
you know I'm not going to listen to like
Led Zeppelin and then Pink Floyd and
then you know the door like I'm gonna
listen to the wall front to back that's
just how it's meant to be done like
nature handed right exactly awesome so
what I what phone are using these days
um so I've been going back and forth
between the HTC one on the gs4 partially
just because of review cycles um you
know and I'd use the the HTC One for
about a month before the galaxy s4 was
available so it's it's funny how and
folks need to not like pay too much
attention to what phone i'm using at any
given time rakes it's going to change
its going to change again another month
but we're in that great awesome period
where it almost doesn't matter what
you're using because they're all really
really good on so many different levels
yeah i mean back in the day it was kind
of a crapshoot you got an android phone
and there was lag and the other one of
other problems the cameras luck but now
it's just like galaxy s4 HTC One they're
both
be really good yeah I mean galaxy s4 I
think has the better all-around camera
we actually just put up our list of best
phones right now and at the HTC One one
out but that's not to say the galaxy s4
is bad like by any stretch of the
imagination I think it's got a better
all-around camera it's gonna be a better
answer for a lot of people and actually
I just recommended the galaxy s3 to a
soccer mom for an fine and she is
totally happy with it and rightfully so
that's still a really good phone the
nexus 4 is still a really good phone you
know they they each have their quirks
and I think some of the newer ones have
fewer quirks that something is a year
old but you'd probably for the last
eight ten months we've just been one of
those positions where the top tier
phones are that good it almost doesn't
matter what you get yeah absolutely and
then and then HTC has a hit on their
hands and you know we write about the
HTC one being the best phone we've ever
reviewed and you'd think that the the
fanboyism would be a little bit less now
that the playing field is a little bit
more you have a song lovers are HTC
haters and it gets it gets dirty out
there that's going to make no that's
going to make it even worse I think
because with no one clear winner
everyone's just going to be going back
and forth and back and forth and back
and forth and it's a good thing and it's
a bad thing I like the enthusiasm I like
seeing the conversation I like the
arguments right but so quickly as things
tend to do on the internet they have
escalated and I mean forums are just a
mess right now and I think we're doing a
yeoman's job of cleaning it up as much
as we can but people take the stuff so
personally it's like they're just phones
guys yeah you know I kind of go back and
forth on that because they are kind of
just phones to us but to the average you
know person out there it's like it's
like the the your lifestyle choice it's
it's like buying a house almost for two
years yeah and that's something I think
we need to remember that you know
somebody will buy a phone and inhabit
for you know 18 months two years and I
wish the carriers would tend to remember
that a little more to it they are
important but the phone doesn't make you
who you are by any stretch in the
imagination I don't look down at
somebody because they're using an iphone
or z10 or whatever at all you know you
people look at what I do and then they
look at my wife using an iphone
like I don't care she can use whatever
she wants you know whatever works best I
I have a seat n sit here windows phone
8x sitting here it's like you know what
enjoy these settings I'll just live in
perfect harmony it used to be true that
if you had an Android you were kind of a
more deaky kind of tinkerer but but
maybe that's not the case anymore
absolutely not the galaxy s2 i think is
what really started that especially here
in the states and then the gs3 i was
thinking about it just in Vegas this
week and just the sheer number of
Samsung phones that I saw notes in gs
threes specifically I saw I had one
person hand me a motorola phone to take
their pics to her and I had to look at
it sideways and I'm honestly still not
sure which one it was ya know you by far
it we are into the mainstream with
Android now absolutely i mean when
you're activating what 900,000 devices a
day or whatever the number is now I mean
it's insane yeah and the penetration of
smartphones in this country is is over
the fifty percent threshold so
everyone's get getting them and they're
going to likely to land on the Android
if they spin the wheel because there are
a lot more androids than than windows
phones or iPhone certainly exactly and
honestly that has as much to do the apps
as it does with anything else right so
much more parity on the app front I
think the iphone will still tend to get
easier at Union just overall better apps
Windows Phone apps I think when they're
done well they're beautiful just some
really gorgeous Windows Phone apps out
there so if you weren't if you weren't
using an android phone you have to use a
phone from another platform what fun
would you be using it's a really good
question i think i might well be using
the windows phone um in and i say that
having the luxury of having used all
these but i think windows phone has has
really become a very attractive platform
with a lot of really good services um I
just I love the UI and I fell in love
with that font when I first I remember
being in Barcelona mobile Congress when
they announced windows phone 7 series
with that horrible name and falling in
love with that fun it was just beautiful
really nice attractive you I windows
music has always been you know really
good so you have all these features now
these options and all these services and
for whatever reason Microsoft just took
forever to
bring it all together and they're
finally doing it and they've done a
really nice job do you think do you
think they're they're happy with their
current rate of market share increase um
you know you can always do more I think
is the right answer but yeah I have a
feeling internally they said all right
we're doing really well what can we do
to to do better and it's I think they're
doing it right and they're putting a lot
of eggs in one basket but at the same
time they're looking at it long term and
that's important to do and in this
business it's so easy to look at oh this
phone is a flap the company is going to
fail or this phone's not the most
popular phone ever the company is going
to fail and we have this two-week you
know viewpoint that's just it is so
short right the long-term game is so
much more difficult to control its I use
it in terms of a ship right it's a big
ship it takes a while to turn and for
these companies that's what's going on I
mean never mind the next round of phones
that's you know 8 10 12 months out there
looking even farther than that right and
they're looking at manufacturing
schedules and carry your schedules and
all these things that have to come
together so it's important for us to try
to step back every now and then it'd be
like you know what uh you know pick a
phone so the galaxy s4 is not a huge
difference over the gs3 well they just
did something really good with the gs3
how many tens of millions did they sell
they've already sold 10 million galaxy
s4 is worldwide are they really going to
go messing with that formula and doing
something radically new I was of course
not the beeper attic do you think
there's a point at which and by the way
I smell something that's burning my
computer might melt in a second okay do
you think there's a point at which the
whole industry slows down a little bit
and we get a little bit away from this
yearly release cycle which is doesn't
seem to be sustainable because as you
mentioned the galaxy s4 it couldn't have
been a leap because there's just not
enough time between the release of the
three and the four I don't think yearly
is unsustainable I think anything beyond
that for the really major major releases
probably in and that's not to say you
can't have you know your big platform
the gs4 and then they base you know
another half dozen dozen phones off that
it's also important to remember that you
know we're us-centric right but it's a
big world out there you know you have
billions of people in India and China
which we know even less about
just so many more you look at the
numbers right so when I rode something
last quarter I guess what Verizon came
out with this numbers and they had
activated I think it was less than two
million phones or something in that
quarter so when you look at it on a
global scale what we deal with on a
daily basis here is really i means
literally drop in the bucket it's not
literally drop in the bucket it's
figuratively literally very much a drop
in the bucket right yeah so so looking
ahead to some devices that we know are
coming out this year that might be small
iterations or might be big steps what do
you think the note 3 is going to to look
like and be like um I really think LG
might have paved the way for the note 3
the optimus g pro i'm i'm expecting
probably you know still something around
five and a half inches but with a
smaller bezel so the whole form factor
gets a little more narrow you know so
you probably a lot of the same features
that we haven't GS for software wise
it's funny how I reports are kind of the
hot thing of the year are you are you
using your ear infrared ports on your
ear One and Galaxy s4 I have I mainly
use it to screw with my kids I i was
gonna say i use it to screw with my wife
yeah i was getting this close to turning
off CNN in the airport yesterday but
never remember back in the day they had
those those wristwatches that you can
control TV with and yeah I I had those
in elementary school and the teachers
became very upset it was in the 90s and
every classroom I got the zenith
television the 27-inch tube and I just
sit there all class long turning it on
and off and no one gonna figure it out
yeah they're they're definitely fun it
is fun to mess with things so Samsung
event is coming up June twentieth way I
just woke up and saw that today um what
do they say in a team and maybe what was
the other thing I new galaxy of some
sort yeah um probably the active of the
mini maybe I you know I think it's still
too early for the note 3 um yeah
probably probably some other you know
tan gentle line there what's with these
mini phones having mini specs why can't
we have a mini phone with
high-end specs well I mean you've only
got so much space to work with right it
at some point heat dissipation is going
to be a big factor when you have the
smaller case it's weird I mean ever
since was it the first I think it's my
first year in Barcelona four years ago
sony started doing the mini phones and
they never really took off here but I
you know know few people in Europe you
just love the things yeah they're great
form factors I don't think it's a
technical thing more than it is a
marketing thing I think people want big
screen phones and that's what they
that's what they look at at this store
that's what stands out when it's it when
it's next to another phone yeah what
does around this I HTC em before might
might be is that the yeah so that was
the that wasn't to the new desire line
with it but they just announced know
that the m4 would be that the 4.3 inch
it basically the mini one okay um yeah I
mean we'll see I I know nothing about it
so other than it's got a code name so
we'll see i just i get i get very giddy
at the idea of a smaller phone with boom
sound with with the ultrapixel camera
speaking of ultrapixel you think the
galaxy s4 has it has a better camera it
sounds like based on your tests what do
you think about this whole megapixel
thing meg epistle caleb has always been
just kind of a little bit of a red
herring that's not to say hi resolution
isn't necessarily better I think
something to remember is as you're
dealing with a higher resolution you're
dealing with a higher file size and the
HTC One is doing a whole lot about real
time that you know real time edits
basically right so between the Zoe's and
creating the highlight videos I mean
it's moving a lot of files around at one
time so i can see we're moving around a
format for megapixel resolution file is
going to be easier on what's going to be
easier processing on battery you know
than doing some five megabyte you know
12 12 megapixel picture when you're 13
megapixel picture or whatever sub so
look at it from that perspective no I
mean my experience with the HTC One
camera is it's it's either really really
good it still struggles a little bit
with
rest I've got some really great pictures
out of it I've gotten some that are just
ok but for me having kids you know the
video highlights function is just too
awesome love it we need some we need
some more songs in the and the little
picker right yeah so half a dozen themes
is a little light one of the first
things i think we all said when we saw
it was well it'd be great to be able to
upload your own music but at the same
time I kind of like that you don't just
because I mean you get some really
crappy stuff out there's oh it gives it
a different field because it's this HTC
music and themes so so how often you
share the video highlights what do you
do with them it depends on what it is
i've done i was on a school field trip
with my first grader a couple weeks ago
so i shot a bunch of stuff out there and
then shared it with everybody so it kind
of depends on what i'm shooting I mean I
don't actively do them all the time I
guess I could do one from Vegas this
week if I wanted to and I wanted to
share that's it no it's contextual right
you don't have to say that's the funny
thing about google glass right now it's
like I must take a picture from I level
like we've never seen that before you
know so just because you have this
feature doesn't mean you have to use it
all the time but I love out it I'm glad
you brought up glass do you think that
that is the future or it's a proof of
concept of a future that might come but
probably won't the product itself right
now it's a developer device it's proof
of concept that's yeah I mean it's a
prototype I'll call it a prototype right
it's not meant to be bought and used by
everybody and I think a lot of us have
kind of forgotten that and you know
here's google glass here's why it will
fail and you're seeing all these
definitive poster here's why it's the
greatest thing in the world it's like no
its prototype it's number one you know
they're obviously working on this and
that they're inviting everybody to work
on that with them is pretty awesome of
google i think it is pretty awesome but
you can kind of a scan it you can kind
of extrapolate the future that google
envisions where we do where this this
device and it presents real-time
information to you and there's less of
this glancing to your phone thing do you
think this is going to change the the
constant glancing that we do on our
phones or do you think we're always
connect phones and and maybe a wearable
device i like the idea of wearables
do I mean that's not to say there's not
a place for the larger screen because
there absolutely is it it's going to
come down to workflow I don't wear a
watch so I need to figure out if i want
to start wearing a watch again just to
be able to glance down you know and save
myself poem phone out of the pocket I
don't know that's going to be a personal
decision for a lot of people there's no
right or wrong answer with that I think
do you feel addicted to your phone do
you ever stop your stop and say I just
checked my phone two seconds ago this is
unhealthy I'm checking it again I'm
having dinner with my wife this is not
good there are definite social hurdles
we have to overcome with these things
and yeah I mean especially in this job
right in with a news cycle and even I
say that with a wife who's you know my
wife and I worked in a newspaper
together we're used to just absorbing
news all day long especially in my
previous job there yeah it's something
you have to learn and as you have kids I
think about my kids growing up and just
seeing me looking you know the phone all
day long instead of playing with them
instead paying attention to them even
more important I think right now is the
push that all the carriers are doing and
that is not using your phone in the car
never mind not texting and driving I'm
saying just leave the damn thing in your
pocket I'm having to force myself to do
that I hear it ring or I feel it vibrate
and it's like no it's just going to stay
in my pocket it's just it can't be that
important something something I kind of
worry about I'm expecting you have how
many kids I have two kids two two and
six and a half it so so there do they
have they phones yet no well my my
six-year-old has an old iphone that uses
an iPod so nice pretend it's a phone but
you know they both use iPads and
everything that's just laid around so at
the age that they do get phones and I
think about this all the time there's
got to be restrictions they can't be
sitting there at the dinner table
playing with phones they can't be
looking at stuff that is adult content
how do you deal with that do you give
them a phone that's that's locked down
and they can only access kid mode or do
you sort of give him give them the
freedom I think well yeah I'm very
hypocritical about it actually with what
I say is always make sure you're in the
room with them when they're using this
stuff that said I will freely admit I
use these things as a babysitter
because it's just ridiculously easy
right they're still young enough where
it's not an issue we have to actively
you know watch how much through using
these things and we fail at that my wife
and I were talking you know in the past
week that they're watching too much TV
and too much time on the iPad just
because it's easy and it's a babysitter
it look not to say it's not entertaining
and educational I mean the kids love the
new Reading Rainbow lap and the iPad and
it's a great app and they're reading and
stuff but still they need to go out and
play they need to read a real book and
it's important for us as parents to
remember that and to force ourselves to
force them to do it we're going to have
another show contact parenting with
gadgets it was no hair in the future I I
think this is a really big thing I mean
one this is kind of unrelated to Android
but one of the things i think about is
that i like the ability to track the
person that has the phone and if if my
daughter is out with her friends and
she's nine or ten years old i kind of
want to know where she is for safety
reasons and and so forth but is that a
breach of trust between me and her if i
say honey i'm tracking you so don't do
anything stupid because I know where
you're going to be I think not if it's
part of the social contract between you
and your children no I wouldn't do it
without telling them because that's just
a whole other thing you know you know
but the characters have applications
that need I know sprint does i think 18t
does as well and maybe the others that
let you know where the phones are on
your plan you know in the number of
reasons you could want that another
thing we didn't talk about with zoodles
HTC bought zoodles in the past couple
years and that's an app that lets you
lock down the tablet and only run
certain apps or only work at certain
times of the day or only for a certain
amount of time and that's I hate having
that sort of gadget cop I would rather
you know me tell my kids hey here's long
how long you can use it here's what you
can do and then you know we have that
level of trust but kids are going to
break that trust absolutely that's what
kids were designed for yeah it's Joey
that's yeah sure and it needs to be a
mixture of both I think awesome well
let's get off of kids and talk more
about Android let's talk a little bit
about key lime pie and maybe even about
4.3 we some people were disappointed
that google i/o there was no new version
of
how do you read that what does that mean
to you I think there was a new version
of Android it just didn't get a point
release right it didn't get a point
increase I think the addition of of
these new services outside of ROM
outside of needing a full-on update is
huge it is a big deal I've always
thought that you know worrying about
what version of Android you're on is
kind of the easiest way to get a
headache you know enjoy the phone you
have enjoy what it can do if it doesn't
do what you want get a phone that does
but if you worry about having the latest
and greatest update and if that's that
important to you and there's nothing
wrong with that but if that's that
important to you you have to have a
nexus phone or something that you're
comfortable running a custom rom on
otherwise I mean these things take time
right companies don't get the code ahead
of time and it takes time to re-engineer
this stuff once you do get it and that's
just a fact of life right that's like
saying I love kids why can't I have more
than one you know one more than every
nine months these things take time to
cook yeah absolutely so if it's that big
a deal to you get a nexus and then you
won't worry about it now me I you know
I'm more worried about what I can do
with this phone you know i'm still using
the HTC One what is it on for to
remember what it's on for 12 see that's
my point right I don't even think about
it because I'm doing the same thing on
that as I do on the gs4 or as I do on
the Nexus 4 you're right the only thing
it's missing is what lock screen widgets
not the only thing and I know that but I
casually that's one of the big things
little things they don't really matter
at the end of the day but I I think it's
been a while since we've seen a big
change uh you can argue or in my face go
sorry oh its back I think I think it's
been a while since we've seen a big
change in Android jellybean was awesome
it didn't really change the look in the
end the feel of the operating system you
have to go back to a four-point-oh and
so logic would hold that key lime pie is
going to be a leap of some kind and do
you agree that it's going to be leap and
if so in what areas interface or
architecture um it's good question
honestly I have no idea I don't think
you're going to see a huge change in you
I and and look we've seen a change of
the chrome
but we haven't seen a big change in the
way things work in the UI um if anything
I think like what ACC did with the HTC
One and and saying look we know most
users out there and when I say most
users I don't mean probably anyone
watching this I mean normal people who
walk into a store and buy a phone aren't
customizing their home screens you know
I can use my parents as that example I
pic with your phone it looks the same
way did six months ago it's me again
from the story they bought it yes they
don't need seven home screens right it's
been interesting how many people have
said hey you know what I like blinkfeed
and it actually works pretty well for me
I'll i use one home screen I'm using and
I don't use stock i'm using action
launcher right now i have the app drawer
in one home screen and that's it that's
all I need so I I don't think they need
to really change the paradigm of hey
here's a home screen and in here widgets
and here icons I i like the way android
does it over iOS because i have the
option to do more things and instead of
just a giant grid of icons that's that's
tough for me to follow I don't think you
know Google's going to say well we're
not going to do which it setting works
nobody's using them or well you know
we're just going to go to all icons
instead of an app drawer right they're
not going to fundamentally change the
way it works maybe maybe there will be
some more enhancements of this google
now thing which is so incredibly
delightful as you promised me know very
well one of my biggest complaints about
Google now and especially on the phones
that aren't a nexus is it so much
tougher to get to you know I can't get
to a staple in lock screen on the HTC
One I need to haven't use the gs4 in a
week so I need to try it some more but
you know it's an extra step as opposed
to nexus where you're just opening it up
from the lock screen which is great for
me that's the way Google now should work
I think Google now in some form is
really going to be the future of where
all this is going in fact I wrote
something at google io 2012 when i said
look how long before this becomes our
home screen of some sort between google
now and google+ at some point you know
in the next year to its going to merge
even further so do you think that that
might mean that there's a home screen
that is google now but it has even more
information
it could certainly happen I I think
whether it looks like the card metaphor
or whether it's something else I mean if
that's the information that you want if
that's the information that is that
important you know the most important
thing to you why wouldn't it be on a
homescreen so we'll see and having on
the lock screen is really good too um do
you find it creepy that your phone knows
where you where you live where you work
what time you leave for work when your
package ships only what I only want to
gets it wrong and it thinks I work at
like Arby's or something you're you're
close to taco bell would you like to go
home now no I don't taco bell no I I
think it's a good thing I think context
especially that's one of the big things
we brought out of Ohio this year is
contextual search when I search for you
know show me where San Jose is now tell
me how to get there and it says oh you
said there well you just said San Jose
so you probably want to go to san jose
now so that sort of contextual search is
a huge deal not just in in shaving time
off what you're doing but but making
these things seem more personalized
working a bit more realistic absolutely
I want to jump off google now it's got
about five minutes left want to talk
about one more topic project shield hmm
which a longer project that the shield
is is shipping might June and you've had
a chance to play with it on multiple
occasions right I have I have what do
you think about the the see the future
of this thing I think it's a really
interesting product um alright so it's
$350 night I get for a lot of people
held it and that's not an insignificant
amount of money I get how a lot of
people are a little bit shy of spending
that on what is essentially an Xbox
controller with a screen on it right I
would kind of like to see a slightly
larger display on it but you know what
is it five inches five and a half is
what we have now it's it's a really
really neat idea right so you have these
really powerful games that can run on
its Tegra 4 it can output at 4k which is
ridiculous so it's running all these
Tegra 4 games it runs any Android game
you already own actually runs any
Android app you already
your own because it's essentially stock
Android on the thing it's essentially an
unlocked or unlockable device you're
going to be able to hack it they'll be
interesting to see what people do with
it the sound on it is incredible if you
think the HTC One sound is good you
should hear these bigger you know
speakers with bass ports great the being
able to stream or play games from your
computer over steam and using this as
the controller and the discipline okay
and watching it that way it's pretty
incredible that's a beta feature not
everybody's going to do it but if you're
hardcore gamer and then make no mistake
that's what this is marketed toward it's
a really really neat concept I can't
wait to actually use one all day long I
can't wait you know with hand it to my
kids and see what they do with it you'll
never mind shooting people I want to
find some game for them to play and see
if they enjoy I don't know if their
hands are going to be big enough
actually now that I think about it it's
but it's a really really cool device it
is a cool device I just fear that it
will have a little sheriff 822 the
Nintendo that the flippy thing with the
dual screens and people just hat they
have their phones and they think why do
i need this other device especially you
know the high-end phones they play
android games very well yeah but not
with you know controls I hate on-screen
controls if you're trying to emulate you
know buttons and a d-pad or an analog
stick I hate that on a phone so so so
you have a game so for example did you
did you download sonic i did it i flayed
it so sonic has these two joysticks on
the screen like many android games do
have if you play that on the shield will
it take those off the screen let you
control it with hardware or how does
that work it's a really good question
i'm not sure and i'm not sure they know
yet either for existing games they can
work with the developers what was the
one i forget the one that that they were
working with somebody on but yeah i mean
their api is that you can use on this
stuff so i would imagine it's probably
not going to be a huge deal to recode an
app to take better advantage of all the
triggers and joysticks but it's going to
have to be done for some games sure and
the developers will probably do it and
we might run into a kyocera echo
situation know that i don't think this
is gonna going to be the city the echo
if you don't remember
we're dual screen hinge thing it's not
going to be that that bizarre I think
you know what's weird we haven't seen
any Tegra 4 hardware announced um yeah
what was the one this past week the HP
what's it called slatebook no it's the
you know Lenny little mini laptop that's
tiger for is that runs windows no no
it's running Android they had one there
so you have that I want to say that
hisense one that was just announced the
tablet just announced this past week I
don't think that was Tegra 4 they're
coming I mean look we new Tegra 4 was
going to be toward you know the fall
later end of the year so that's what
they said Tegra 4i is still shooting for
the first quarter of 2014 I mean part of
this is I think NVIDIA has done things a
little differently and they're being
very open about development cycle for a
lot of their products right um I mean
they announced Tegra 4 back at a where
was at CES Mobile World Congress they
showed it to us you know another little
detail we saw more Tegra 4i last week
last but yeah to which I can remember
where I wasn't when I was there you know
so they're slowly marching along this
process but they're doing it in public
and that's not something you see a lot
of time so it's easy for us to be like
well where are the devices where are the
devices not quite there yet there will
be Tegra 4 devices by far the shield is
one of the first ones tablets in these
little laptop day it's coming well
hopefully hopefully it impresses because
Qualcomm is killing it right now and
they're they're even there even
advertising on TV on YouTube ads and
they're getting the name out there yeah
I really you know there's Sam there's
Sam saw me i'm trying to use samsung of
some sort of breath there's samsung king
to nvidia yeah kind of like Samsung does
the HTC because HTC doesn't seem to
advertise well you know waiting until my
mom says you should i get an nvidia
device or qualcomm device i'm just gonna
face palm and go home at that point
just get an iphone please that's what I
that's what I told my parents and they
all have iphones and they they never
bother me to like oh my widget froze or
something or you know well anyway so
we're at the end here of pocket now VIP
