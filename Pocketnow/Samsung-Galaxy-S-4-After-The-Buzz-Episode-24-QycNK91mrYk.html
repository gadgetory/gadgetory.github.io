new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all onto the next big
thing already so let's do something
about it let's have a look at a device
after a couple of weeks after release
and when it's not shiny anew anymore I'm
Hina Ravenna with now this is the
samsung galaxy s4 and this is episode 24
of after the buzz
love it or hate it Samsung's Galaxy s4
dominates the market more than almost
every phone out there you'll hear a lot
of people in the tech media complain
about it and still you'll see it in the
hands of a lot of people on the street
if you're still wondering if this phone
is worth your money after being in the
market for more than three months you've
come to the right place
now hardware is a topic of much
discussion when it comes to Samsung
phones we all complain about the
excessive use of plastic and all the
fingerprint smudging in the hyper glaze
and still I'll admit that this phone has
aged better than almost every other
phone that we've reviewed no matter if
it's made of aluminium or glass and
glass and stainless steel it isn't
scratch proof don't get confused but
since the battery door is replaceable
the scratches do have a solution and if
you buy the phone in white for example
covering those scratches is actually
much easier now that said this is not a
rugged phone so we do recommend that you
buy a case if your hands are slippery or
if you just give it a lot of Ruffins of
usage some people also complain about
this phone being too light or feeling
too cheap and they're kind of right but
I actually like it because it's made one
hand and usability possible with a
5-inch display and actually the display
is where it's all about till this day I
find this to be one of the best displays
in the market even with new competition
the color accuracy in detail in this
AMOLED panel is state-of-the-art then
the 1080p resolution is just awesome
overall if you're in the market for a
thin and light phone with a good display
this device is still worth your money
software is more of a polarizing story
but since this phone is more about its
software it is actually a big deal some
people like TouchWiz but I do feel that
it's dated its appearance is fake and
toy like and I just find that convoluted
when compared to new and more simplistic
you wise in 2013 now that's said and
just like with the Galaxy Note lineup if
you want to enjoy the benefits of a
galaxy phone you just can't replace the
wrong or by a google edition of this
phone after the buzz is about telling
you what'll really be useful on this
phone and what won't so here's the
verdict most of the software
enhancements are gimmicks and like in
the case of air gesture for example
you'll require more of an effort to move
your whole palm in the air to slide a
photo than to simply slide your finger
the display or smart scroll where it's
easier to scroll with your fingers than
to have to look at the bottom of the
display for the device to scroll down
this is the reality of almost all motion
and gesture services aside from the
smart screen features but your mileage
may vary here these are just my personal
opinions based on my usage still being
fair to Samsung I'd rather have these
features when my hands are dirty then to
not have them at all now what makes this
phone important for me are things like
the multi window supports this should
really be an industry standard of OEMs
keep pushing phones to be bigger I want
to do more with a big display than just
to see things bigger and Samsung nails
it perfectly and it even solves some
bugs that I hated from the note 2 with
third-party keyboards features like
airView that we love them the note 2 are
still here to some degree sadly not as
extensive this phone is also loaded with
a lot of apps out of the box the watch
on remote control is surprisingly
simplistic and great and the range of
the IR blaster is awesome honestly it's
superior than what I expected
I'm also really into fitness and s
health is a really complete service that
seems compelling but sadly in a world of
social media the fact that I need to
have a galaxy phone to use it just makes
it not very attractive for me
other services like the Samsung hub and
the Samsung Apps and the yes translator
etc are all good things to have but I'd
stick to the Google Playstore services
if I were you since probably your next
phone won't be a galaxy and it's best to
not be stuck in the Galaxy ecosystem you
don't need to and if you notice that I
haven't talked about s voice here well
that's because I really have nothing
positive to say about it it is the same
thing a little faster but the same thing
overall Samson crammed everything but
the kitchen sink here some of the
features you'll use and some you
probably won't depending on your needs I
just like the fact that they're there
it's better to have them than to not
have them at all I guess my only concern
is the fact that Samsung has been really
terrible in updating their legacy phones
from last year to newer versions of
Android and newer versions of TouchWiz
and that could mean that this phone will
be revamped soon and really TouchWiz is
getting old
and daily use there is a lot to liken
some things that couldn't prove it's
more powerful than my old no.2 in galaxy
s3 and still I find it odd that it's
sometimes stutters here and there within
TouchWiz still for hardcore gaming the
Snapdragon 600 is a champ in every way
so I do recommend this phone for gamers
and especially because you have a
removable SD card to pack your media it
does run hot at times but the plastic
makes that less annoying that if this
phone are made of aluminium which is
another point in that favor its battery
is also good it won't go past the full
day of hardcore use but if your user
just tougher than mine which I find it
tough to believe you can always swap the
battery which is also great to have the
camera is probably one of its highest
points and no you don't have optical
image stabilization and yes though life
photography is not the best thing for
this phone but still I found this to be
the best Android camera I've ever used
then this is not the first 13 megapixel
shooter I've been using since I also
have the Xperia Z L and before that I
had the Galaxy camera still
the level of detail I see in these
photos and the color accuracy is just
awesome and good lighting as much as I'm
a fan of the iPhone 5s photos um I can
say this camera is actually superior HDR
may be too slow for my taste but I do
recommend you hold that phone a little
longer while taking an HDR photo because
the results are superb the fact that
Samsung also bundled the Galaxy camera
auto modes the UI and just about
everything or really what makes the
camera on this film great it's the
little things like being able to pause a
1080p video recording and then continue
the video without having to record two
separate clips and then figuring out how
to snap them together is really what
makes the camera on this phone awesome
when it comes to video as well internet
speeds over data and Wi-Fi are as
expected from a flagship smartphone
there is nothing to complain about here
though I wish I could say the same about
phone calls to the state there is no
galaxy phone that has ever impressed me
and this phone is sadly on the list
caller say that I sound okay and I wish
I could say the same about them but the
fact that there is a target on the UI to
enhance the audio on the earpiece when
you're on a phone call
and the fact you have to press it
everytime is a clear indicator that
Samson really needs to go back to the
drawing board in this department now one
thing I will admit is that calls for
with a speakerphone are quite good the
speaker on this phone is very loud
probably one of the loudest I've heard
this year but obviously these are not
stereo speakers you can use this for
music and it sounds good but don't
expect this to be so much easier so
bottom line
what I still recommend that you buy a
Samsung Galaxy s4 after a couple of
months in the market the answers
absolutely it is still one of the most
popular phones out there and even with
samsung's choice of construction
materials I find that the added features
when it comes to the software and the
replaceable ones in the hardware when it
comes to storage battery and the battery
cover will give you more for your money
when compared to other smartphones in
the market if you don't mind the plastic
and you want a phone without compromise
when it comes to the cameron the overall
user experience this phone still toughs
my personal list of devices that I'd
purchase even now that we know
everything about the iPhone 5s and other
competitors for the Fall that's it for
today is after the bus thank you very
