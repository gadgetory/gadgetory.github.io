aneta calm as one of the first
android-powered smartphones in the
states to have a 3d display the evo 3d
also has many other hardware features
that will make this appealing to many
consumers so let's get to the rest of
the hardware review
so the dimensions of the evo 3d is 65
millimeters in width 126 millimeters in
height and 12 millimeters in the
thickness so I'm not the thinnest device
but it's still pretty good in terms of
that this device is a 4g device so it
does have that rather thick form factor
what we've seen on other carriers and
like sprint and verizon which of course
we've reviewed other phones for them the
evo 3d has a 1.2 gigahertz snapdragon
dual-core processor along with one
gigabyte of ram and 4 gigabytes of rom
the screen is a 4.3 inch qhd glass
capacitive multi-touch LCD and of course
that does have the 3d display and we'll
try to show that on camera but you
probably won't be able to see it too
well of course we're using a single
camera right here with no 3d so let's go
to some of the other hardware features
on the phone itself on the top we have a
light sensor we also have a proximity
sensor and we have our earphone speaker
underneath this a metal grill we also
have a notification LED right here we
have a 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera
we have our HTC and sprint emblems on
the top on the bottom we have there are
capacitive buttons and we have our home
button our menu button are back and our
search so let's go to the top of the
device we have our power standby button
up here we have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and a secondary
microphone for noise cancellation
speakerphone on this side of the device
we have our USB 2.0 and an MH l so
you're able to broadcast up to I think
it's up to 720p video resolution out of
this little port here so it's a dual
function pork unfortunately I was unable
to find any cables for pricing and it
didn't come with any cables with the evo
3d itself on the bottom we have our
primary speaker our primary microphone i
should say and we have a little tab here
to remove the battery cover on this side
of the device we have our camera shutter
and we also have our toggle switch here
that allows you to switch between 3d and
2d camera modes and we also have our
volume rocker on the back we have our
HTC emblem and
this is a little texture if you can hear
that it's kind of like our I guess a
ribbed texture on the back we also have
our dual 5 megapixel cameras
unfortunately if you're recording in a
3d you're only able to record up to 720p
video and 2-megapixel of still photos
for the 3d function so we can pop off
the battery cover one neat thing about
the battery cover is it is this
rubberized material let me see if I can
actually get it off okay but it's kind
of weird because it goes around the
entire circumference of the evil 3d
itself so you can see some of these
buttons here let's see here's like one
of the volume rocker buttons you can see
the internal mechanics of the phone
itself which is kind of neat if you're
into that will have a 8 gigabyte microSD
card that comes pre-installed on this
device the battery itself is a 730
milliamp hour let's see is this a
lithium-ion yes it is okay so we have a
lithium-ion battery right here so we can
just pop that back in and power back on
the device be like so the radio is
keeping the EVO 3d all connected is we
have cdma 807 fortunately this isn't a
world phone so you won't be able to use
it outside of the states or other areas
that don't have the CDMA radios we also
have Wi-Fi b/g/n n bluetooth 3.0
assisted gps and an FM radio the audio
output is a stereo speaker which I
didn't mention on the back way also this
dual LED flash for the camera itself and
the micro SD card is expandable up to 32
gigabytes so this has been the hardware
review of the HTC EVO 3d and if you like
our videos make sure you gives a thumbs
up and also Lee's comes down below stay
tuned for the software review coming up
next and in case you missed it you can
check out the unboxing and i'll post a
link right about here so you can just
click on that and go directly to the
unboxing of the evo 3d thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
