guided tour of the s-pen Samsung's
special stylus for the Galaxy Note
family of devices well that's not the
only stylus Samsung has cooked up for
its smartphone family I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow comm and this is the
Samsung CE pen for the galaxy s3 let's
check it out so one of the most telling
things about a technology product or any
product really is the expectations it
sets with the blurbs on the packaging
the C pen according to the back of the
box here offers the comfort and style of
a premium writing instrument the tip of
this stylist is designed to simulate a
finger touch tap or swipe giving you
full touch navigation functionality and
allowing you to leave your touchscreen
fingerprint free that is right the last
point on the marketing copy is talking
about how it helps keep fingerprints off
your screen so you can tell right away
that this is a product that's not going
to blow your socks off let's go ahead
and open up packaging here discard the
box here is the C pen itself the second
indication that you're not going to be
too blown away put that aside for a
second comes when you pull out this
little pamphlet here and realize that it
is not an instruction sheet now if
you're coming into this like I did
because you didn't pay attention when
Samsung announced the C pen in the first
place you might think there's something
special that requires instruction like a
battery or a button or anything but no
this is just a warranty card because the
C pen is simplicity itself we have a
nice attractive finish here with the
Samsung branding on top of this pewter
pocket clip here you can see the entire
unit is finished in a very dark shade
it's got good weight and a good material
feel in the hand but checking out the
front you can see this big soft nib on
the tip just gives this one away this is
just Samsung's take on the same
capacitive stylus as we've seen for
years so how
does it work well we've got our galaxy
s3 here to test that out now in normal
use you can see we can swipe tap and
flick to our hearts content
responsiveness is just as good as with
finger input and the feeling of the nib
on the glass display is actually very
very nice there's a lot more friction
than with the s-pen on the note it's a
bit like dragging a felt-tip marker
along a piece of glossy oak tag it's
actually very very comfortable and as
you can see it works well it doesn't
necessarily work with every device
featuring a capacitive display this is
the Motorola Droid Razr m and as you can
see there is positively no
responsiveness on this device which I
thought was interesting whether tap
flick or swipe nothing going on there
let's try it out with the lg optimus G
just to have a little bit of fun here
also no responsiveness whatsoever this
is very clearly it's very easy to see
why Samsung branded this as a Galaxy s3
accessory but it does work with Google's
Nexus 7 so that is very interesting
although I should note that it does not
work terribly well with this device as
you can see taps and flicks are often
confused for each other so very obvious
why Samsung labelled this an accessory
only for the galaxy s3 so returning to
the device that the s-pen was designed
for we can see we've gotten our
responsiveness back and we feel a whole
lot better than we did on some of the
other devices here but it's not all
perfect if we happen to Chrome real
quick will show you that the capacitive
buttons flanking the home screen here do
not always respond to the c-pen as a
matter of fact if you tap right on them
they don't respond at all you have to
find the strange little edge area that
will activate there we go the Menu key
and that tends to move around a little
bit the back key is even more finicky if
that's possible we've got to find where
it likes to be as you can see I am
actually tapping here no response from
our friend the back key menu Keys being
a little bit might have gotten the back
key to activate before but obviously you
can see and we can just press the Menu
button
physically but very very annoying we
complained of a similar problem with the
s-pen on the Galaxy Note and ago
- no - it's not a problem it's a design
deficiency we suppose but it's really
annoying because you have to go from a
pen input here to a finger input here
and then a third input methodology with
this physical home button here to mash
that down it's just a very disjointed
and awkward experience now let's check
out how the c-pen fares in note taking
the galaxy s3 of course shipping with S
Memo the same thing essentially as s
note on the galaxy note 2 and the galaxy
note hopping into S Memo we can see the
default paintbrush size is too thick so
let's go up here and thin it up some so
maybe we can write a memo and you know
actually that's not too bad it actually
you know it works it's not pretty by any
means but neither is my writing on the
Galaxy Note 2 so that doesn't say much
however the thing to note here we'll
just clear all is that there's no
pressure-sensitive digitizer on the sgs3
or in many phones out at all outside the
note in Note 2 so there's no difference
in the digital link right now I'm just
as softly as I can just barely grazing
the display there's that what that line
looks like and then I'm just going to
mash it down and draw straight across as
hard as I can go as you can see there is
no difference at all in the thickness of
those lines because the screen has no
way of knowing that you've pressed it
with a different pressure level for each
of those lines there's no digitizer here
so that is not a surprise to anyone
everyone knew that going in but it's
just something that renders the
note-taking features of this device a
little well no not a little
significantly less impressive than those
on the note family and there's also
nothing fancy like floating cursors or
hovering or track scrubbing it's just a
really really really tiny finger tip
folks that's all we're talking about
here
finally there's just no place to put the
thing obviously the galaxy s3 doesn't
offer any kind of a silo and the C pen
is just massive so it's obvious that
Samsung wants you to carry this in your
pocket like a traditional ballpoint pen
or something like that which would be
fine if it offered any real utility to
everyday people I mean sure and
certain nisha applications like for
workers who need to wear gloves all day
long or for those in cold climes in the
same situation or for those who really
really don't want a fingerprint up their
displays it's useful sure but for 30
bucks or slightly less if you shop
somewhere other than Samsung com you're
better off spending your hard-earned
money elsewhere bottom line if you're
looking for a device with a stylus
you're better off snapping up one that
was designed from the ground up with a
stylus in mind in this case getting your
s-pen confused with your C pen is a
recipe for disappointment that's going
to do it for our special tour of the
Samsung Sea pen for the galaxy s3 if you
