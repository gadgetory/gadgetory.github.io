fourth-generation ipad the HTC droid DNA
renders emerged in the galaxy note 2 is
sold like pancakes at Denny's I'm hi
Mary vetta back from a crazy two days of
editing reviews and this is parking out
daily that's right the world wants
phablets and three million of them to be
exact Samsung has just published their
sales figures for the galaxy note 2 and
after all reviews of the device even
though we're kind of thinking how
awkward it is to use phablets around
well it seems that people do like and
then we actually did like them in our
reviews the galaxy s3 has also sold 30
million units worldwide and believe it
or not I trust them this is a really
good phone and if you had any doubts
about the HTC j butterfly variant coming
to the united states we've just seen
some marketing photos that were leaked
and yes it's going to be called the
verizon droid DNA that we're still not
sure if it's going to be an exclusive
just yet Sally these are the only
renders that we found now it's kind of
interesting that we haven't seen the
phone being announced just weeks away
from black friday so anything can happen
from here to there though now if you
were looking for any sort of
notification center on Windows Phone 8
in our review well look no more because
there isn't any and according to Thomas
spinel from Microsoft the reason why
wasn't included is because they ran out
of time but they're working hard on
pushing and further next version of the
OS or its dot one upgrade now an
interesting note is that apparently
there is another thing that they ran out
of time from launching and it's their
own Microsoft Surface phone their own
windows phone 8 so could it be that we
will be seeing a new device being
launched spring next year along with a
new version of Windows Phone 8 points
something it could be also make sure you
catch our microsoft surface review which
is already live though spoiler alert it
didn't go that well for the surface now
do any of you remember the HTC chacha
and the HTC salsa if you don't I don't
blame you they were terrible
implementations of a facebook phone that
HTC did a while ago and apparently
Facebook an HTC are back to working on a
new facebook phone that's being dubbed
the opera are you well brings a
dual-core Snapdragon s4 along with a
720p display but we still don't have
information on the camera and just think
about it
camera isn't great it has no point in
being a facebook phone but we'll keep
you posted on the rumors and finally for
the hot news of the day Apple has just
launched their Wi-Fi variants of the
ipad mini and ipad foreign stores are
unboxing videos are already live and we
even have a comparison video that's very
revealing about the ipad 3 and the ipad
for that i do recommend you watch now
the interesting note here is that you
didn't see these crazy lines of people
trying to get these ipads this year as
you saw in previous launches of the ipad
so that leads me to the question of the
day do you think there were one too many
ipads this year or could it be that
people are just waiting for the 4g
variant of the ipad that's going to come
in two weeks I'm waiting for that so
leave us a comment down below and if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
time every better thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
