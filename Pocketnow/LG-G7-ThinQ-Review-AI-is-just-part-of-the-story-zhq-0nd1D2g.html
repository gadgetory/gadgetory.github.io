for companies like LG two years ago the
company was one of the pioneers of the
concept of dual cameras which most
phones have today last year the company
pretty much brought us the first 18 by 9
aspect ratio on a display which most
phones have today so being such a
pioneer why is it that LG doesn't have
the popularity that it deserves maybe
it's the fact that some of all this
innovation needed iteration and
refinement and I think this is finally
what we have today I'm hey my leave it
out with pocket now and this is our
review of the LG G 7 thank you one of
the main comments that I've heard about
the LG G 7 is that it brings nothing new
to the smartphone space I back to the
FIR with that opinion mainly because
even if the g7 is an iteration it does
bring a couple of new tricks up its
sleeve the hardware is a very
interesting sandwich familiar designs
inspirations from the iPhone 10 in the
hand of the notch on the display in the
vertical arrangement of the cameras
though with less of a hump the glass is
curved much like the Samsung Galaxy S if
you saw them both flat on the table
still the feel of this phone is quite
different given the taller body the
phone does feel slimmer to hold and
brings unique tricks like no speck a 10g
drop resistance even with all these
materials now an interesting changes the
infamous notch and the fact that the
company chose to do it with an IPS LCD
think about it is this is actually a
really good screen the new RGB W pixel
arrangement provides a color vibrance
that's really hard to see on competitors
at 6.1 inches diagonal and quad HD plus
resolution out of the box it is also
very crisp
if you don't like the knotch head on
over to the second display settings I
know who came up with his name and
switch it off or notice some other
options that you can actually use to
embrace it bear in mind though even
though this phone reproduces black color
really well it's not as great as OLED to
assist with content consumption LG has
two unique tricks for you one is of the
new boombox speaker yes just one but the
trick is that it uses the phone's
weather-sealed chassis to create a
residence chamber a little wireless
headphones which the phone quickly
detects and they provide even if you
cover the speaker you can pretty much
still hear what other competitors
provide with the earpiece speaker well
pretty much like these other flagships
and then there's also the 32-bit quat
deck included for all of you audio files
out there
bear in mind though you need a good pair
of headphones to drive that and they
weren't included in the box and turtley
it has most of the latest specifications
we have a new Qualcomm Snapdragon a 45
64 gigs of expandable storage a 3000
milliamp hour battery fast charging
capabilities with the bundled
accessories wireless charging and about
the only spot on the spec sheet is the
four gigs of RAM and B's current trends
the hardware runs on LG's proprietary UI
on top of Android 8 Oreo sadly we're
still a decimal behind when it comes to
upgrades the aesthetic is not really my
favorite as well with some weird spacing
for icons and widgets on the launcher
things I praised are the flexibility of
the navigation bar allowing useful
one-handed tricks like a notification
tray button at the bottom and if you
slide on these buttons the UI becomes
smaller for whenever you need reach
ability now even with the name thank you
LG isn't really trying to WoW anybody
with the AI user interface instead all
you really get as a button to call on
the Google assistant and I love that you
can press and hold it to call on it
whenever you're in a noisy environment
just as much as you can just press it to
activate it as at the time of this
review you can't really remapping but
you can also double press it to activate
the Google lens and I'm not gonna lie
I'm actually finding this very useful
I've been using the final retail version
of the LG G 7 for a week in New York
City and the prototype for five days
prior even with the four gigs of RAM and
the skin on top of Android I can't
really say that I notice any stutter in
the user interface you can play
graphics-intensive games just fine
there's really nothing to complain about
the experience probably my first
complaint with the prototype was
noticing odd gaps in third-party apps
with the scale on the lg notch in this
whole tall screen aspect ratio but after
a couple of software updates on the
final retail version it seems that all
this went away my testing period has
been on t-mobile's network with
reception being very good and phone
calls being really crisp as well and I'm
sure it has everything to do with LG's
tweaks in the hardware side now what I
will tell you that I'm really impressed
with is the battery life LG somehow has
really outdone itself with optimizations
that get this phone to end of day just
fine something that's surprising
considering the mid-sized power pack the
camera experience on the LG g7 is
probably one of the most useful in my
opinion we have 260 megapixel sensors
one of regular f 1.6 aperture the other
wide-angle
F 1.9 aperture the company continues to
push for more megapixels at a smaller
pixel size than most flag ships and yet
manages to provide some incredible
photography this is what I'd call good
and saturated eye candy for those of you
looking to filter less of your photos on
Instagram at night the company uses
pixel bidding in its ultra low light
mode meaning the 16 megapixels become 4
in order to provide more light a is a
big deal in this camera being able to
detect objects in the scene and have the
camera adjust but what I like the most
is the fact that this is an optional
toggle tortured mode on the primary
camera and the selfie shooter is
actually really good as well but
probably one of the most natural results
I've seen and yes everyone this also
means the selfie camera actually got an
upgrade the video is probably not one of
my favorite features our recent
comparison shows that it's not the most
stable and you can't really switch
between the white camera and the regular
camera while you've already begun
recording like you did in the past I
could tell you that I like the selfie
video now bringing civilization though
the crop is horrible and the colors look
a little washed out once you pull them
into the computer there are manual
controls for both photo and video though
if you want that in order to fix these
shortcomings
overall even if it's not a perfect
product the LGG seventh in queue is
still a great flagship I love the design
I love the display believe it or not and
man that wide-angle camera should be a
standard across all other smartphones I
feel that it's probably the most useful
approach to dual cameras if it wasn't
for the software aesthetics the sluggish
software adoption and the average video
results then this would be my favorite
phone we even decided to delay this
review a full week just to make sure
that the final retail unit brought the
same problems and we're confirming the
feedback do we recommend it yes
definitely
is it the best at everything it can do
sadly not for 2018 let us know what you

video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw
I'm hi mentally but I think so much for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
