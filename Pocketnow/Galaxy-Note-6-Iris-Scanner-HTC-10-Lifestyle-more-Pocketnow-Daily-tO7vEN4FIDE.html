few unique tricks up its sleeve analysts
believe that the Apple watch too might
be better for sales in the first and a
list of rumors for the HTC 10 just
continues to arrive I'm hi Mel Rivera
and when being told that you can't drink
on a Monday just follow the t-shirt this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals those of you
still interested in a SmartWatch I would
highly suggest you go to ebay and look
for the LG watch urbane in the seller
that's in the link in the description
mainly because you could currently get
it for 150 dollars and this continues to
be one of our favorite smartwatches sure
it does not have all the versatility of
the huawei watch but then again it still
is a great SmartWatch 450 bucks and
speaking of smartwatches we have two
very interesting developments with the
Apple watch too number one is that
analysts predict that people are going
to be willing to upgrade to the Apple
watch too carolee sixty-two percent of
the people surveyed said that they were
satisfied enough with the Apple watch to
buy another one which is amazing since
I'm not but even more interesting we
were expecting a redesign for the Apple
watch this year and no the analysts are
predicting that that redesign is
happening until 2017 which makes sense
that's the way Apple does things we'll
see what we get and we are just a day
away from the announcement of the HTC 10
we cannot wait to see what we get but we
are already seeing rumors of another HDD
10 lifestyle unit that could be making
the cut not necessarily at this event
and it makes sense we saw some previous
rumors that there was a watered-down HTC
10 and then the HTC 10 with the full
specs and then another one so it could
just be a variant for a specific region
we will keep you posted as we learn more
if you remember we told you that if you
were in the market for a ereader this
would probably be not the best time
because we've got rumors that that
Amazon is about to revamp the kindle and
the kindle continues to be one of the
best readers out there if not the best
we hear about the kindle oasis and what
makes this product interesting as two
things number one it's extremely thin
number two it's not symmetrical wonder
exactly how that things going to work
stay tuned we will learn more soon
and finally the very interesting news of
today have to do with the galaxy note 6
as we had to rumors number one
apparently it'll be water resistant
which is something we expected that's
the way it follows trend the galaxy s7
rings that it comes to the galaxy known
six but one thing that will be unique in
addition to the S Pen is an iris scanner
for additional security if not for
anything else and even though that the
feature was a really popular in the
Lumia lineup the problem is the Lumia
lineup wasn't popular at all it was just
a cool feature on the Lumia so it would
be awesome to see this on a mainstream
smartphone but it does lead me to the
question of the day do you care about an
Irish scanner coming to your smartphone
because I will be honest with you like
recently because I've been in New York
and I've had to record videos with this
cold and with gloves it would be awesome
to have an alternative that doesn't
require your fingerprint meaning you're
having to take your gloves off to be
able to unlock the smartphone but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion and friends you know
the way it goes who want to get these
nukes earlier before the video was
filmed Paolo was I'm talking out calm
