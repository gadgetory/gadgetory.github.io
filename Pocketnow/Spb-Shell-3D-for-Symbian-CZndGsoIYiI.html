calm and i'm here with the new spb
mobile shell or rather the spb shell 3d
for nokia symbian so we have it on the
nokia n8 right now and i'm just looking
at this 3d panels right now and they're
doing a little our animation so it's
actually going through its little thing
I could interact with it right now if I
wanted to but let's just take a look and
see what it does right now there's some
cool things going on those are text
messages I believe there's some people
floating around see some cool
reflections down below
and there are some birthdays anyway this
is our 3d interface similar to some of
the other versions of spb shell that
you've seen before you can spin it
around we got all sorts of panels and we
can choose one just like that and I can
also swipe like this similar to Android
and also older versions of spb mobile
shell so these are all our home screens
we have little dots down there that
represent each one there's the home one
we have some little shortcuts web
browser email phone calls and this is
the app drawer this is the custom
version so it's not the native symbian
version but it has all the programs
there and this we can go back
interesting lead if you press this
button we get the old the normal symbian
program launcher let's go back here now
if I tap and hold you get the home
screen customizing menu you can add
programs we can add widgets a folder
change the wallpaper go to settings list
these settings so here's our Thane auto
range widgets with our calendar panel
panel settings and if i want to just
close out of the shell 3d i can make
exit right there so tap and hold let's
look at some widgets here's our widget
options yeah weather phone Wi-Fi
Bluetooth blah blah blah birthdays the
usual
let's do the phone so there's my phone
would ya if I tap and hold it turns into
the editing mode where I can move it
around or trash it by holding it down
there and some of these widgets are
resizable let's try this one see now I'm
in edit mode and there's the glue green
arrow there and that will resize that
widget see this one is also resizable
okay some of them just take up the whole
screen like the weather picture isn't
clock here's the pictures panel and it
actually looks pictures from flickr not
loading pictures that I took or that I
load it onto the device so get out of
edit mode with the checkbox let's go
back into the 3d now here's something
cool this little button down there let's
meet edit the panels so say I want to
let's see I can move that one down there
so that's going to be odd out of my
circle this one is a extra miscellaneous
ones I can put that back up there I can
put more up there I can put like tons of
them up there and i can rearrange them
so I want this one over there
and I can change the color maybe that
one should be black and let's see i'll
put the calendar back there there we go
and I hit this and we're back to the 3d
mode and you can see my colors changed
so that's pretty cool everything else is
pretty standard fare all these icons go
to the native programs calendar goes to
the native calendar same with email
whether you can just choose the
different days and pictures we can just
load different flickr pictures
and there's your bookmarks websites but
that's pretty much it for the spb shell
3d not a whole lot in shell 3d that is
terribly useful since you know symbian
anna already is very android like with
the same multiple home screens kind of
thing and widgets as well you do get a
lot more customization and a few
different widget options but the regular
symbian widgets are not here either
let's exit out for a second
so now I'm going to exit shell 3d and
here we are back on regular symbian and
you see some of these widgets are not
accessible from shell 3d so there you
have a STD shell 3d available for
fifteen dollars for symbian and hope you
enjoyed this video that's it for now
