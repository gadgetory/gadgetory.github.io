price points for the four gigabyte model
apples 12.9 inch iPad could pull some
new tricks when it comes to features in
same thing seems to be shuffling
suppliers to be demand with the galaxy
s6 I'm hematuria vetta and you already
know that I hate mondays don't make me
repeat it right now this is parking out
daily the official lucid I have to do
with apple as we've got some information
on how the company is doing in China and
believe it or not the company is one
point away from being China's biggest
smartphone seller yeah I know that's
crazy but Apple is currently selling
twelve percent of the market share
compared to cio me which was first or
still is first at twelve point eight
percent they're just a hair clothes and
if you're asking what ever happened to
Samsung they felt a fourth place right
now but obviously remember this
oscillates for every quarter we're not
sure what will happen in the next
quarter especially because Apple sells
phones every year vertice arrow me so
let's see how that goes and speaking of
Apple a lot of people are curious over
how the company plans to differentiate
its 12.9 inch ipad that's being rumoured
apparently it's the iPad pro in order
you want but ports claimed that number
when you're getting a bluetooth stylus
and we wonder exactly how that's going
to work in addition to the force touch
capabilities that we've heard for the
next iPhone in addition to what we get
with the Apple watch and apparently
you're also getting NFC because paying
with tablets is something that people do
it seems we'll see how that goes as well
now let's talk samsung we know that the
company is probably not wowing many with
the sales of the galaxy s6 they are
underperforming right now at least in
Korea and certain parts but it seems
that the company is still struggling to
meet demand in some way we're not sure
how but it seems that the company is
shipping certain galaxy s6 units with
Sony sensors for the camera and Samsung
sensors for the camera in other phones
and we're not really sure what the
differences are the galaxy s6 is so far
probably the best smartphone camera that
we've reviewed so far and we wonder if
that affects things in any way we'll
keep you posted if we learn more now
this is interesting even though HTC is
not selling the one of nine plus
anywhere but China we've got some tina
certification documents for an HTC
One m9 e which is pretty much the one m9
plus only in a plastic chassis and we're
a little confused here since there's
another variant with a plastic chassis
looks almost identical and we're not
really sure what actually see is doing
with their flagship phones but this is
pretty much almost the same phone and
probably they're just looking for a
cheaper price point turn markets will
try to dig in and see what we find about
this and probably for the very hot news
of the day I know a lot of people are
interested in the asus zenfone 2 not
necessarily because you get a lot of
options when it comes to the back plates
but because this is a very very
affordable phone up to the point where
there is this retailer that is
apparently going to be selling this
phone only 2000 units up to 4 gigabyte
64 gig model and storage for 337 dollars
but this is only happening on May
seventh May seventh alone only two
thousand units will be on sale licks
illustrated for the retailer but it
leads me to the question of the day are
you looking out for the su-7 bone to is
this your next smartphone in my case I
don't know I've been yeah I've been
getting a lot of requests from people to
review this phone and hopefully we will
the device is not gonna be on until May
eighteenth by the way but leave us a
comment down below it's your case
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is so much you follow what I'm
talking about chronic subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well you can follow
