Android versus Android I'm Michael
Fisher with pocket mountain here to
compare two of the leading smartphones
of 2015 LG g4 vs samsung galaxy s6 as
Captain Picard's so eloquently reminded
us touch can connect you to an object in
a very personal way and the very first
thing you notice when you touch these
products is just how different they feel
in the hand whether you're holding the
galaxy s6 or it's more flashy sibling
the s6 edge the cool glass and aluminum
sandwich of the Samsung phone conveys
the sense that what you're holding is
expensive high quality and with all that
glass maybe a little bit fragile it's
the kind of phone that attracts
fingerprints and makes you want to
consider a case or a protective skin
like this example from D Brad by
contrast the g4 feels like it can handle
being tossed around a bit take the hits
with no problem whether you choose the
plastic ceramic or leather backing
material it's all pretty rugged stuff
and the choice itself sets the g4 apart
as well while the s6 has no shortage of
color options once you choose one you're
stuck with it with the g4 you can
maintain an arsenal of different back
covers to swap in and out depending on
where you're going and what you're doing
and while you're at it you can also swap
in a fresh battery or pop in a memory
card to upgrade your storage on the g4
none of that is possible on the galaxy
s6 which comes in a fixed capacity and
ships with a significantly smaller
battery that can't be swapped out lest
you think LG is going to run away with
the hardware prize here keep in mind
that the g4 s versatility comes at a
price while it's fit and finish is solid
it also features more plastic in its
construction than the galaxy s6 so it's
not quite as impressive in a tactile
sense the rear keys are cool but they
don't feature the same travel and
feedback the same click enos as their
counterparts on the s6 not counting the
sizable camera bulge the s6 is also
almost three millimeters thinner and
it's nearly 30 grams less massive and
while the g4 features double tap to wake
the s6 unlocks with a fingerprint
scanner that lets you get past the lawn
screen without the bother of a password
once those displays flare to life
Samsung's lead gets more pronounced the
GeForce quantum IPS display is larger by
nearly half inch making it the roomier
of the two canvases but Samsung's Super
AMOLED panel has it beat in pixel
density side visibility black levels
color saturation and above all
brightness the galaxy s6 can overpower
to overcome direct sunlight while the g4
will have you squinting to make out
what's on the screen in darkness the
galaxy s6 display can also get dimmer
now there is a case to be made that the
chief for display may be delivers more
accurate colors given its use of the DCI
color gamut and it's really quite a nice
display in its own right but when you're
not examining the subtleties of color
reproduction you're just trying to use
your phone and the galaxy s6 display
lets you do that in a wider range of
conditions with this generation of
smartphones Samsung's passing a rather
dubious torch to LG at least from my
perspective here in the States that of
the most vim owned user experience
Samsung upped its game with the galaxy
s6 by streamlining and accelerating its
TouchWiz skin transforming it from a
lumbering laggy beast into something
much more enjoyable to use while it
retains some of its long criticised
cartoonish elements it's fairly easy to
fix that by applying one of Samsung's
downloadable themes while they impart a
performance penalty at least they offer
an escape hatch from Samsung's aging
software aesthetics there's no such
respite available on the g4 well it's
not a total dog's breakfast but it's
also not great
there's no unity to it bright colors
bubbly animations and rounded toggles
contrasts sharply with right-angle
folders and boxy pop-ups feature wise it
very much resembles the Samsung of years
past with limited or half-baked features
taking center stage like the smart
notice widget and it's verbose weather
forecasts and some of the features the
two phones share are just executed
better by the galaxy Samsung's multi
window supports more apps than LG's dual
window for instance
LG's feature loading lets it land a few
jabs on Samsung here the resizable
keyboard is still a fantastic idea cue
memo is handy for making quick finger
sketch notes on a screenshot and the
toggle that lets you deploy the
notification shade is a huge convenience
that every Android phone should feature
but some of these are consolation prizes
for the g4 being a fairly difficult
device to use one-handed and all things
considered I think I'd rather have the
faster cleaner and thema Bowl galaxy s6
software from my daily driver
both of these smartphones are trying to
make a big splash with their cameras and
you know what both of them succeed LG
plays up its slightly larger aperture
size and comparisons with the s6 and
that sure does seem to make a difference
in some low-light situations in other
settings
the s6 actually manages the brighter
shot but at the expense of more digital
noise in the image which is common for
smartphone cameras also it's easier to
get focus with the g4 in low-light
probably thanks to LG's laser assist
module the g4 tends to produce warmer
photos while the s6 skews in favor of
the greener side of the spectrum but
each one can get right up in a subjects
face for macro shots these were taken in
automatic mode with no software effects
the depth of field you're seeing here is
all happening in camera in brighter
light it's easier to get a sharper
picture with the s6 than it is with the
g4 but the difference is often very
minor and out in the Sun the disparity
all but vanishes
on the front side each fund can take
beautiful selfie shots but despite the
g4s higher resolution the s6 wins the
day here with its wider angle and
broader color range i tend to prefer
samsung's video output as well
it's auto focus and exposure tend to
wander less than LG's more video samples
are available in our full review of each
phone at PocketNow where the g4 pulls
ahead is in viewfinder software with an
array of manual tweaks much more
elaborate than Samsung's so-called pro
mode including a histogram and an
artificial horizon that said I don't
want to dwell too much on this rumor has
it Samsung is cooking up some intense
camera improvements in its 5.1 update
for the s6 regardless of what happens it
seems likely these cameras will remain
neck-and-neck for the foreseeable future
optimization is the name of the game
with the silicon in both these
smartphones LG and Qualcomm say they
work from the beginning to optimize the
g4 for the Snapdragon 808 processor and
the galaxy s6 is the first Samsung
flagship ever to ship with all Samsung
silicon in all of its variations the
galaxy's octa-core exynos Spanx the g4
is a six-course Snapdragon on most
synthetic benchmarks and its graphics
processor seems to handle some heavy
games a little better playing asphalt 8
with maxed out graphics on both phones
the g4 did seem to stutter on a couple
occasions while the s6 wasn't without
the occasional choppy animation and got
much hotter in the hand
it didn't lag much at all during
gameplay when we weren't intentionally
trying to trip these phones up the g4
and s6 offered equally snappy
performance responsiveness only matters
when the phone has enough juice to
function of course and Samsung and LG
deal with the power issue in totally
different ways samsung's battery is
smaller but you can also charge it from
zero to full in just over an hour or
forego the cables entirely and charge it
wirelessly the g4 doesn't offer quick
charging it takes an hour and 45 minutes
to bring it from dead to full and
wireless charging requires a special
back cover but in our testing the g4
does last longer
about four and a half hours of screen on
time between charges versus about three
with the Samsung that could be due to
manufacturers including possible
software enhancements in the g4s newer
build of Android so as always your
mileage can and will vary of course with
the g4 is removable battery you can
carry around a fully charged battery
pack and swap it in in a matter of
seconds so which will be better for you
will depend on your lifestyle if you'll
be on the road on the boat or in the
woods a lot the g4 will probably be the
better option rounding things out with
the odds and ends I find the g4 the more
comfortable phone to talk on thanks to
its curve for the speaker phones LG's
rear firing module is kind of a shame
compared with the s6 and its edge
speaker but the g4 redeems itself when
you put the phone facedown on a table
and its rear mounted volume controls
work with the rear mounted speaker to
make for quite a little boombox so let's
sum it up the galaxy s6 brings more
refined construction a brighter display
a beefier processor and better honed
software the g4 brings a larger display
bigger battery that can be swapped out
on-the-fly expandable storage and more
customizability inside and out each has
an awesome camera which one wins is a
toughy given how much time I spend away
from power outlets in places where I
might drop my phone it would make more
sense for me to choose the g4 it's more
versatile more adaptable to a range of
environment but honestly I do think
Samsung has the tighter product overall
with the galaxy s6 considering its
beautiful hardware and slick software
it's a solid enough phone that I'd be
willing to carry a battery pack if it
came down to it whether you'd be willing
to make the same sacrifice depends on
you and your life call it a cop-out if
you want but by either of these and
you're buying one of the best phones
around either way you pretty much can't
wrong if you want more detail on each of
these phones pocket now has what you
need check out our video reviews of the
g4 Galaxy s6 and s6 edge here on YouTube

pocketnow.com as well linked in the
description below until next time this
has been michael fisher captain two
phones on twitter reminding you that
whether or not you embrace the next big
thing everybody deserves to feel good
feel great or something Adam it's
buzzwords it doesn't make any sense
