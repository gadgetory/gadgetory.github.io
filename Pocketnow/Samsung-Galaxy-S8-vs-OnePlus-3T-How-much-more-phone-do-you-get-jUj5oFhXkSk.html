against a mid cost option we landed on
the phone which helps popularize the
premium mid Ranger category what was
tough though was deciding which galaxy
to use for the comparison the one plus
3t lands somewhere in between
traditional smaller and bigger flagship
phone options ultimately we decided on
the smaller Galaxy s8 keeping prices a
bit closer and it gives us an
opportunity to look at the differences
in display size from Samsung's new form
factor kicking things off with design
it's going to be difficult topping the
galaxy this year it's a stunning example
of engineering against these curves the
oneplus is an attractive handset but
falls into the same trap as many other
manufacturers releasing a phone which
resembles some combination of HTC and
Apple hardware it's pretty clear which
device is breaking new ground here and
taking a quick look at the specs these
two represent top-tier offerings of
their time the 3t was one of the first
non pixel phones last year to use the
Qualcomm 821 and pack six gigabytes of
RAM for multitasking junkies the Samsung
is brand new for 2017 trading two GBS of
RAM for the newest 10 nanometer chipset
in the USA that's the Qualcomm 835 we'll
talk about performance a little bit
later but Samsung ultimately takes the
win here for including more stuff iris
scanner heart rate monitor SD card
storage expansion and a nice bit of
lifestyle protection with ip68 water
resistance it's rare I meet someone who
uses everything on their galaxy but
there's almost always one feature which
in owner loves that cannot be found on a
competing device the vote for the
oneplus in this case it might emit all
of those options but consumers won't pay
for Hardware they might not use chief
among these Hardware differences are the
displays on paper a 5.8 inch screen
sounds like it should be noticeably
bigger than a 5.5 inch screen so it's
shocking when you hold the s8 and it's
shorter and thinner of course making the
screen skinnier does change the overall
area calculation of the display and the
two phones are actually a lot closer
than the diagonal measurement alone
would indicate so what do we get for
this extra space it's most readily
noticeable
and web browsers and vertically
scrolling apps where you get more
content on your screen but if an app
isn't coded for the taller display
Samsung can crop it in for you but that
often carves into controls in many apps
if you don't zoom in your effective
screen area is closer to a smaller phone
like the galaxy s7 another advantage for
Samsung is the higher resolution and
more pixel dense display that's tempered
by the fact that out of the box the s8
is set to 1080p the native resolution of
the 3t for folks who care about the dots
on their screen they can dig through the
settings to use all the hardware they
paid for but it's an interesting place
we arrived at where Samsung is somewhat
making the case for one plus that 1080p
is good enough for most people and why
pay for dots you're not really going to
use outside of that both are colorful
AMOLED panels with excellent contrast
and top-tier outdoor brightness a slight
lead to Samsung for driving the screen
brighter in Auto mode but the oneplus
has more accurate whites to my eye the
most polarizing category for our
audience might be software samsung has
tweaked skinned and customized nearly
every aspect of the s8 additional
functionality like the edge panel can
come in handy but that also comes with
more overhead at any given time there
will likely be more background processes
running on the s8 the three t on the
other hand feels a bit stark out of the
box but it's a cleaner blank slate to
custom-fit the phone to your specific
needs the bigger qu4 one plus though
this leaner approach seems to help the
smaller company deliver more timely
updates the three T running Android 7.1
while the s8 is still on 7.0 at the time
this comparison was shot on the whole
interactions on the oneplus feel faster
more fluid swapping between apps
multitasking the 3t feels like a
lightweight track racer the newer phone
of course has a newer chipset but this
comparison requires a bit of nuance the
s8 often feels like it's got a limiter
on while the 3t feels turbocharged we
shouldn't overly rely on synthetic
benchmarks but the oneplus often wins
for single core performance and the si
will often take the crown for multi-core
only the die-hard techies and our
audience will know which apps of theirs
will benefit from that multi-core
processing yet another showdown pitting
a Qualcomm 835 against an
twenty-one we would hope that the
galaxy's newer hardware would better
offset Samsung's additional software but
my real-world use of the 3t has been
surprisingly impressive that there's
really no current app we can point to
which taxes last year's chipset we're
not particularly concerned with how the
3t will aged over the next year the s8
does take a leave for wireless
performance though getting better cell
and Wi-Fi reception around my neck of
the woods the camera battle is a handy
win for samsung not much evolved over
the galaxy s7 but the s7 also scored a
win over the 3t last year a better
low-light performance crazy quick
autofocus more complete manual controls
and crowd-pleasing color processing the
3t delivers some great Stills and videos
for its price and this is one area where
the more expensive phone can outperform
the less expensive phone the audio fight
though is a very close competition both
phones compete well for mono bottom
firing speakers and this is a nice
update for Samsung given the water
resistance
the headphone fight is also a close
battle nearly identical numbers for
noise and almost identical amp output
the galaxy taking small leads for
dynamic range distortion and stereo
crosstalk but all well beyond most human
hearing the main advantage is the
Samsung's ability to playback the full
frequency range of 32-bit audio files
people who take care and saving
high-quality audio will get a little
more out of those files on the galaxy
but folks listening to mp3s while this
is a statistical dead heat and the
battery comparison is a handy win for
the one Plus which shouldn't be a
surprise given the larger battery in the
3t but more than just overall run time
it also seems to use that capacity a
touch more efficiently the recharge race
also wins for the less expensive phone
let's say you need a fast top off
plugging both phones in for 15 minutes
the s8 charges a smaller percentage of a
smaller battery the oneplus - charger is
formidable and the system helps the
phone stay cooler while refueling so
let's wrap this up where does that leave
us between the Galaxy S 8 and the 1 + 3
T these cross category comparisons are
tough ultimately the s8 wins right
incredible design newer components a
sexy screen more stuff well pump your
brakes there tiger the three T's focus
on streamlining delivers comparable real
world use and while we don't get the
plethora of additional hardware features
or software additions oneplus is selling
this phone for $300 less at the time
this comparison was shot do you get more
phone with the Samsung of course you do
no questions there do you get $300 more
phone well we can't say that you do if
you want the best you pay for the best
but as prices keep climbing those
flagship returns are ever diminishing
and of course we want to hear from you
with the 1 + 5 right around the corner
do you think oneplus can keep the
pressure on pricing will mid rangers eat
up more of the flagship market this year
