pocketnow.com and this is the unboxing
video of the toshiba g 9 10 this device
has two screens one of them supports 800
x 480 resolution that is the highest
resolution that Windows Mobile will
support so let's see what's inside the
box all right we got the Box open here
looks like a another package inside and
get this open wow it's going a nice box
I guess this is the top ha nice
packaging for it to shave a device all
right there's the device will take a
look at that in a minute let's see
what's inside the box looks like
everything is inside of this part and in
the bottom we have some software
warranty and a user guide not in color
ok let's see what we get inside of this
okay so you have to open it from the
bottom here and inside we have looks
like headphones and what is this it's a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and here's
the sync cable which uses mini USB
excellent charger and let's see how big
the battery is hopefully the battery is
large because we're going to need a lot
of power to power such large screen 1320
a milliamp hours that's not as big as I
would have thought and we have a cover
for the battery alright so let's take a
look at the device I'm going to zoom in
a little bit smaller than I would have
thought ok now this opens like a
clamshell little keyboard cover
small screen on the front it's an oled
screen wow it looks like the stylus is
up here it's huge stylus very large
alright let's see how it compares to
other devices first I'm going to put the
battery cover on put the battery in it's
got this fake leg leather texture on the
back that I really don't like very much
okay finally got the cover on take a
look how it compares in size to other
devices so we're here we have the
eighteen t tilt take a look at the
difference in the keyboard sighs much
larger keyboard on the g nine ten let's
take a look at thickness I like the
sound that this makes when it closes its
thinner actually the g 9 10 taller and
wider look at the iphone about the same
height as the iphone thicker ok and next
to the HTC touch of course it's going to
be significantly larger this device is
made for power users that's why it's
unapologetically large very interesting
I can't wait to see this extremely
high-resolution screen more on the g 9
10 soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
