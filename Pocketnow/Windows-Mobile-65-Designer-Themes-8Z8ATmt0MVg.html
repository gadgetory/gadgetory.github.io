pocket now calm and in this video I'm
going to show you some of the custom
designer themes that are coming up in
windows mobile 6.5 Microsoft first
talked about this at ctia 2009 when they
talked about designers such as Isaac
Mizrahi and by the way I don't know who
that is but if you're in the fashion
world you probably do who will be making
custom themes for windows mobile 6.5
devices in addition there will be a
custom theme maker that you can use to
make your own themes now Windows Mobile
has been able to have custom themes all
along but it's not apparently obvious
how to do that and a lot of people don't
do that so hopefully with this theme
maker will finally be able to do that in
an easier way so let me turn on my
device and this is the latest touch HD
windows mobile 6.5 rom that comes from
XDA developers so here we are we have
that kind of plaid look this is the
Isaac Mizrahi theme it's a little bit
feminine I think this is this is
targeted towards females because it's
got pink and it's kind of a got the
reddish colors in there but it looks
kind of nice and of course with windows
mobile 6.5 you get the transparent top
and bottom bar so you really get a large
view of the whole desktop background so
let me go into settings and I'm going to
go through the other ones that are
included on this rom so I'm going to go
2d VF green right here and i click ok
and it takes about a minute to refresh
or probably about 15 seconds i should
say ok here's the next one it comes from
diane von furstenberg if you've ever
heard of her then you are probably
familiar with why this looks the way it
is so that's the next theme and let's go
back into settings and change the theme
again the next one is rock and republic
black
here's a rock and republic black is a
very bland a theme I think that I don't
particularly like but some people may
the same like the simplicity of this
particular theme so let's go into the
next one run errand orange Ron arid
orange all right and this is the next
one and I think it looks quite good
actually on the whole the wvga screen on
the touch HD and I think it'll look
really good on devices like the touch
diamond2 in the touch pro two so let's
go into the final theme which is Vera
Wang red now i have heard of Vera Wang
I'm not exactly sure what she does but
apparently she's a designer so let's
look at the Vera Wang theme so that's
pretty much it for the tour of the
windows mobile 6.5 designer themes I'm
sure there will be more than what I've
shown you here when the devices start
shipping later this year for more
