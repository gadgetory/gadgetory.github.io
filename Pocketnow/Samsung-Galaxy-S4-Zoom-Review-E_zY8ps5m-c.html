answer since day one with the Samsung
Galaxy s4 zoom is whether we are using a
phone with a zoom lens enabled camera or
a camera with a phone attached needless
to say people were shocked curious and
intrigued to see us taking and placing
calls on it the s4 zoom is the last
Samsung device announced at the premier
2013 London event that we are reviewing
now to check out our galaxy s4 active
and Galaxy s4 mini reviews head over to
pocket now and also subscribe to our
social media channels to stay up to date
the samsung galaxy s4 zoom provided to
us by our good friends at Club that code
at UK arrived at our doorstep on July 15
meaning we've used it exclusively as our
daily driver over the course of 10 days
just enough time to answer the phone
camera dilemma
however we instantly concluded that
aside from the name the s4 zoom has
nothing to do with the galaxy s4 it's a
Galaxy camera galaxy s4 mini crossover
on the outside it looks like a galaxy s4
mini if you look at the front if you
turn it to the side or to the back it
looks like a pointer shoot a galaxy
camera the same design is being used or
overused and the same materials graze
your fingers hyper blaze polycarbonate
put s4 like textures if we assume you've
never seen another Samsung phone in the
past two years we can describe it to you
there's an earpiece up top above the
samsung branding
flanked by the sensors and the webcam
below there's a 4.3 inch qHD screen and
the bottom pulls the obligatory home
button with the capacitive back and many
shortcuts to its left and right that's
about it as far as the phone part is
concerned all the rest can easily be
subject to a camera hardware tour
there's even a tripod mount on the left
side together with a microSD expansion
slot and lanyard hole power button
volume rockers and a two stage camera
button on the right side microUSB port
on the bottom with a flap to access the
slide and battery and micro SIM tray
there's also a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack I are blessed er and the secondary
microphone on the top the back is
dominated by the huge Samsung made zoom
lens
it offers 10 times optical zoom and it
extends quite a bit the camera itself
also has optical image stabilization
focus assist light and the xenon flash
near the lens on the back there's your
speaker grille and yes there's a camera
grip which is tipping the scales and
this is a camera with a phone statements
favored under the hyper glazed
polycarbonate there's a 4.3 inch Super
AMOLED screen with qHD resolution which
is 960 by 540 a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor one and a half gigs of RAM 8
gigs of internal storage out of which
five usable of course expandable a 16
megapixel main camera on the back with
10 times optical zoom and xenon flash
1.9 megapixel webcam 23 30 milliamp hour
battery and Android 4.2.2 jelly bean
with TouchWiz on top of it other specs
include Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC as well as
3G and LTE capable radios as far as
software is concerned everything is
similar to the Galaxy s4 mini which is
similar to the galaxy s4 if you want to
know about the details make sure to
check out those reviews will now focus
on the differences and new camera
oriented editions the overall looks feel
functionality and user experience is
identical though probably the most
talked-about feature of the s4 zoom is
its camera ring while in camera mode you
can use the ring to zoom in or out but
while you're anywhere else twisting it
brings up a special screen with some
camera modes you can choose from use the
ring to navigate the modes and jump
straight into the camera app in order to
shoot using that particular mode while
in a phone call twist the ring to enter
the in cool photo share feature which
enables you to quickly snap a shot and
send it to your contact the one you're
on a call with there are specific photo
and camera oriented applications bundled
like photos suggests that places you on
a map and shows you other pictures shot
in your vicinity and story album
which unfortunately crashed on our
review unit upon launch but it should
enable you to create slideshows and show
off your skills probably the most
important and different part of the
software is the camera application you
can launch it by holding down the
shutter button but unfortunately only
when the phone is unlocked no windows
sound like what picture taking here
launched the camera and the lens will
extend on the back from there you have
to make a choice shoot an auto mode
smart mode or one of the three expert
modes auto mode lets the camera the
sight of how to shoot under those
current conditions smart mode allows you
to choose one of 25 existing shooting
modes but advanced photographers will
probably want to use one of the three
expert modes program mode which adjusts
the exposure by setting the shutter
speed and aperture values manual mode
for manually setting the previous values
or color wizard for setting the color by
manually changing brightness color
saturation contrast and sharpness there
are a ton of settings you can play with
Samsung's latest TouchWiz user interface
runs on top of Android 4.2.2 whether you
like it or not
it is however snappy even in the
software department the s4 zoom looks
and acts like an s4 give or take a
couple of things like the missing LED
notification air view and air gesture
you won't find as health either and the
keyboard just like um yes for mini is a
four row input panel instead of the five
row keyboard on the s4 the rest is the
same we strongly encourage you to check
out both the s4 and s4 mini reviews for
more details we've used the samsung
galaxy s4 zoom over the course of 10
days well this is no powerhouse it will
manage to do everything you throw at it
though occasionally you'll have to wait
a second for heavy tasks to finish with
our regular usage we got more than a
day's worth of battery life out of the
2330 milliamp hour pack which is
powering the phone or camera we're
talking about phone calls text messages
social media and Facebook Twitter
Google+ taking pictures browsing the web
instant messaging Google Maps YouTube
videos Spotify music and even workout
tracking you will definitely get at
least one day's worth of action of the
s4 zoom that is if you're not too heavy
on the camera the zoom lens and the
xenon flash really drain your battery if
you're abusing the shutter button to say
that the galaxy s4 zoom is the best
camera we have ever used on a phone is
an overstatement and it will definitely
raise heated discussions and debate it
is however right there in the top you
can't go wrong with its pictures and
with
heavy advanced customizations and
shooting modes you can also only share
creativity thanks to the physical
optical zoom lens Samsung didn't need to
go with Nokia's or a similar approach in
terms of huge megapixel sensors 16
megapixels is more than enough for the
images generated and the lens zoomed in
or not give you great quality clarity
saturation and sharpness will leave you
with some more samples playing in the
background while we tell you that voice
and data performance was also good we
experienced no problems at all
earpiece performance was good and so did
our voice sound over the microphone
speakerphone is loud thanks to the
fairly large speaker on the back
regardless if you are using it for calls
or music we wish the Galaxy s4 zoom had
a 720p display we wish it had a slightly
faster processor but please double the
internal storage and yes we wish it had
an LED notification light it's time to
draw our conclusion regardless of how
much Samsung would like you to believe
otherwise we think that the galaxy s4
zoom is a camera with a phone slap on it
rather than a galaxy s4 with which it
has absolutely nothing in common with a
zoom lens attached as for the pros the
gs4 zoom is definitely something you
want to get if you are into a device
that delivers everything phone and
camera there are of course other
solutions out there the bigger brother
the galaxy s4 the main competitor the
HTC One are also great camera solutions
not to mention Windows Phone with its
Lumia 1020 and the good old iPhone 5 if
you decide to go with the GS 4 zoom you
will not be disappointed because of all
the aforementioned
we are rating the galaxy s4 zoom and 8.2
out of 10
