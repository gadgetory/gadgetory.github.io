come Tony behind the camera another one
of the points that the huawei CEO was
making was the fact that his media
panics one was even smaller and more
pocketable than the Nexus 7 so Frank
hey we got a Nexus 7 right here we're
comparing it this is our originally the
first generation Nexus 7 sadly we had a
little trouble getting the other one
here but you'll notice that yes this is
even smaller than the Nexus 7 in every
single aspect this is a shorter tablet
it is also much thinner tablet as well
but again one of the key points about
this product is that it is a 7 inch
tablet exactly like the Nexus 7 and you
will notice that there is a huge
difference when it comes to size this
has 80% of usage of the canvas meaning
80% of this canvas is taken by this
tablet whereas in the case of the Nexus
7 I believe it was 74% or 64 percent I
believe it was so yeah we have a
quad-core processor here it is a very
capable tablet but again another one of
the benefits of this tablet is the fact
that it has phone functionality that the
Nexus 7 doesn't have it has expandable
storage that the Nexus 7 doesn't have
and yeah you can buy two Nexus 7's for
the price of this tablet but you won't
have to buy a phone and again if you
think about it it's a really compelling
tablet I do commend Huawei for this this
Huawei media paddocks one does show us a
lot of innovations especially with the
fact that there is pretty much no bezel
here and yeah it looks like an iPhone
when you compare it to it you've got a
13 megapixel camera here when compared
to the fact that you also have a flash
and you have a 5 megapixel camera at the
front when compared to even the iPad
Mini the iPad Mini barely has a 5
megapixel camera at the back so we do
have a very compelling tablet obviously
we will have to test it first expect
that our full review for this tablet
very soon and Tom behind the camera high
in everything that I hear in pocket now
MWC sweating a lot it is full of people
