watching a phone review and when the
reviewer gets to the cameras action all
they poster a couple of mediocre shots
while writing the phone off because it's
not one of their favorite iPhones or
galaxies don't you want to know more
about a phone camera than what you might
learn from a handful of lame HDR shots
let's do something about this we live in
an age where the only camera a person
might own is the one bolted to the back
of their phone so shouldn't we review
that with the same attention we might
give a standalone camera there's more to
smartphone photography than just
megapixels and selfies shooting in
real-world conditions we're going to
cover color saturation exposure optics
image stabilization bulk a low-light
focusing video and any other fun
features the manufacturer might have
packed on I'm Juan Carlos bag now for
pocket now and here's our real camera
review of the Asus zenfone zoom buckle
up folks we've got a lot of ground to
cover and I'm gonna move pretty quick
first of all a little housekeeping the
zenfone zoom is utilizing a 1/3 inch 13
megapixel image sensor with a native 4
by 3 aspect ratio this is similar to
what you might find in the iPhone 6s and
is smaller than what you'll find in
phones like the LG v10 note 5 in lumia
950 this lens has an aperture of f28 at
the wide end which closes down to f/4
point 8 at full zoom to fill this video
frame we're also shooting in 10
megapixel mode which essentially cuts
off the top and bottom to create a 16 by
9 aspect ratio video quality maxes out
at 1080p at 30 frames per second but
there is a slow motion setting and we'll
talk about that more in a bit starting
with exposure and saturation during
bright daylight conditions the zoom is
fairly well restrained I think most
phones tend to overexpose off and around
two-thirds of a stop to a full stop the
a sous camera app is trying to produce
punchy bright colors but I found I was
rarely adjusting more than around a
third of a stop to rain in highlights
any adjustments made to photos or videos
will be noted in the upper left hand
corner by the way blues greens and
browns are usually pretty easy for our
cameras to expose for the zenfone
performed well in capturing those colors
though the image processing would
occasionally exaggerate the sky
especially when the frame was
predominantly green which resulted in
the cyan stripe near the horizon white
objects are the hardest to expose for
and I did need to drop the exposure a
full-stop to retain petal detail here it
makes the overall shot too dark but
that's what it took to prevent clipping
in the highlights yellows were
fantastically captured warmer colors
like yellow and red in direct sunlight
are very challenging to expose for
without clipping and the zoom performed
very well here Reds also fared well
they're starting to sizzle but the
camera is preventing these from clipping
fine details and morphing this color
into an aggravated magenta its juicy to
be sure but we do have HTC style
controls to adjust output like contrast
and saturation it's easy to dial this
color pop back a bit if we need to and
as you can also increase saturation here
we can show you that too much color
means losing detail and that's what we
mean by clipping we've set the photo
quality defined for all of these shots
but the average JPEG size was between 2
and 4 megabytes I think we are seeing a
subtle loss of detail when zooming in
thanks to that compression there is no
raw setting that I could find on the
zoom so no luck in shooting a larger
photo which you can edit on your own
through Lightroom or Snapseed looking at
the lens it's a bit on the dull side
it's absolutely fine and preserving
details across medium distances or
landscapes happily we only see trace
amounts of color fringing at the borders
of high contrast areas
this subtle hazy green color which pops
up on the edges of these flowers this
lends dullness though is most noticeable
at macro distances which I'm
particularly sensitive to as close-up
photos are my favorite things to shoot
when you do nail the focus up close you
get pleasant shots but it's easy to see
software artifacting and sharpening with
even a subtle crop that this camera has
a smaller sensor and smaller aperture
means it's not going to be a depth of
field champ at minimum focusing
distances objects yards behind your
subject will still be easily
identifiable the zoom won't help you
here as much as it extends the minimum
distance you can focus from your subject
and shrinks the aperture which just kind
of balances out the amount of background
blur you might be able to create lots of
cameras have difficulty focusing on tiny
details close up to the lens and the
ASIS is no exception
focusing system here is really twitchy
after you log focus you have about a
second to take the pic before it resets
unless you long press the focus area to
lock that focus point in place it's a
fast performer but even with laser
assist it still doesn't have the same
sure-footed feel that a phone like the
LG g4 has it jumps in pulses instead of
rolling and locking it's also a pet
peeve of mine when there's not better
error reporting another common sin is to
report a focus lock even though I
haven't actually properly focused on the
area I tapped on now I tapped here but
the phone actually locked here because I
was too close but I still got a green
circle telling me it had a lock here the
ASIS will report when you're too close
so it does a better job than most but I
had a handful of shots like this where
it just missed with no warning minimum
focusing distance is above-average
getting your subject within two inches
of the lens when shooting fully wide but
when zoomed out the closest you'll be
able to get is just under 12 inches
looking at white balance performance for
the most part this camera gets it right
though shadowed shots will often view a
bit cooler and bluer than I would like
it doesn't approach the icy look we
sometimes get from the iPhone but
thankfully we can adjust the white
balance here pretty quickly those manual
controls are fantastic another gripe I
have with most Android cameras is how
they process HDR photos high dynamic
range means we should see more details
in darker and brighter areas of our
frame but more often than not Android
HDR just becomes a shadow brightening
mode we don't see bright sections
improved this is precisely what happens
with da soos we pop extra detail in the
shadows but highlights either stay the
same or get brighter which gets worse as
we have a full suite of manual controls
I think you're more likely to land the
shot you want with a quick exposure
adjustment rather than by firing up the
HDR mode panorama performance is fluid
and stitching is terrific
a soos is using the same kind of pan and
scan setup as phones like the iPhone 6s
or galaxy s6 the zoom did a terrific job
and stitching together fine elements
throughout the frame like these power
lines on
landscapes weekend saw that odd
inconsistency in color where one pass we
got a perfectly natural looking panorama
shot on his second pass the shot was
completely overexposed now I don't spend
a lot of time on the selfie cameras it's
usually there's a tool of convenience
rather than it being a proper tool for
content creation the Asus has a rear
camera selfie mode which beeps at you
when it detects a face but I was kind of
shocked to see that the rear camera
selfie mode saved a far lower quality
pic than what you can generate from the
front-facing camera and and of course
beauty mode makes you look super
plasticy that I have terrible skin but
this doesn't really help me here we have
a handful of other fun features to play
with I tried to make the depth-of-field
mode work which should better blur the
background behind your subject but I
honestly can't see any difference when
using it I did like the super resolution
mode though it takes a little bit longer
to scan through your shot but it
quadruples the resolution this could be
great for situations where you think you
might need to crop after the shot now
looking at some nighttime photos again
I'm pleasantly surprised to see how
little this camera over exposes it does
over expose to be sure I still think
it's over by about a third of a stop to
a half a stop but this is where cameras
like the g4 will often completely blow
out street signs and billboards on its
own the Asus is producing a bright image
but is just barely holding onto those
highlights I think Asus has found a
happy balance here between exposing in
low and mixed lighting and reining in
noise I don't mind a little grain in my
low-light shots I greatly prefer a
little more noise over blurring out all
the detail with heavy-handed noise
reduction but I did run into a few shots
though where the camera radically
boosted the lighting when it completely
didn't need to like on this creepy
tunnel shot it's almost two stops
brighter than it needs to be which
produces a ton of ISO noise moving to
even lower light this creepy gate which
is lit by a really gross
yellow security light the Asus is
splitting the difference between the
white of the gate and the yellow
lighting whenever I have to choose I
usually side with the colour of the
lighting now think about situations like
concert photography do you care more
about accurate skin tone or capturing a
cool shot of crazy light
on stage thanks to the manual controls
here I can get a little closer to what
this gate looks like in real life on
this walkway shot the asu's absolutely
nailed the color differences between
these two lights which aren't the same
color temperature I think overall we're
seeing good dynamic range for example
the amount of wall that still has
visible texture and isn't completely
blown out below those lights it's not
class-leading performance but I'd say
we're doing better than mid-pack getting
into an extremely low light situation
this yellow flower lit by a porch light
a couple yards away
I just couldn't quite land a clear shot
even with the image stabilization
helping smooth out my handshake what is
impressive though is the laser focus did
lock pretty quickly on the subject even
in bad light this kind of lighting is
very difficult for iPhones and galaxies
to lock focus and Asus joins LG in
providing a pretty consistent lock in
low-light and if you're worried about
maximizing available light there is a
low resolution low light mode it works
by cranking the ISO and then shrinking
the image down to a two megapixel shot
to help reduce noise it's also somewhat
inconsistent though it made the street
scene and creepy tunnel brighter but it
made the walkway shot darker and kept
the flower photo about the same and not
talking about a gimmicky mode but having
full manual controls gives us the
ability to easily play with long
exposures and the ASIS delivers up to a
32 second exposure that's absolutely
overkill for a streaking tail light
photo but you could probably use it to
produce some fun star trail nighttime
sky shots just a couple indoor shots to
check out keeping my office cosy with a
single lamp the zenfone lands a pretty
respectable capture of stationary
objects this is one fifteenth of a
second though
so people moving around would certainly
blur the flashes on the back of the zoom
aren't the most powerful I've ever seen
but they might help you lend a slightly
faster shutter speed
I just think most phone shots with a
flash look kind of terrible we use the
flash because we have to and again
indoors with comfy lighting the
front-facing camera shot looks awful but
it did perform better than I thought it
would now moving over to video I am
disappointed to see the zoom is saving a
fairly low bitrate the bitrate is the
amount of data stored per second and
just like mp3 the lower that number is
the
the quality scenes with lots of fine
detail just look buzzy and I'm seeing
some banding and compression artifacts
in the blue of the sky it's not quite
uniform we see the same performance in
terms of exposure and saturation that we
saw with still photos and again I'm
happy to see how restrained the
brightness is during daytime shots but I
still think most shots are overexposed
by around a third or a half and we do
still have access to manual controls
while shooting video which is pretty
great exposure and white balance
adjustments are easy to perform while
composing a shot now here in video we
can get a better look at the zoom a 3x
zoom doesn't sound like a lot but it's a
healthy amount of reach compared to what
we usually get on our phones by cropping
an image as the lens is shifting
elements around we will usually lose
focus and need to refocus once the zoom
pull has been completed and we're
actually changing the focal length of
this lens not just cropping in on an
image for video and stills Hardware zoom
retains the full resolution and image
integrity we can also take a better look
at the optical image stabilization
trying to walk as smoothly as possible
we see active lens elements trying to
rein in my hand movements but still
jumping on individual footfalls this is
pretty good performances walking is
really hard to smooth out and we don't
see that crazy jell-o shake from cameras
like the lumia 950 or LG v10 we can
activate a hybrid hardware and software
stabilization which reigns in my
footfalls but I've always hated how this
combo stabilization looks on any phone
Hardware stabilization is shaking the
lens which does subtly warp the frame
and then software takes that crop sit
and pans through the frame to eliminate
larger movements or gestures but the
results always look buzzy err or Twitter
then standalone software stabilization
like that found on the iPhone 6s I would
really prefer being able to use one or
the other but I never like using both in
sunlight we have a respectable 30 frames
per second HD but no option for 60
frames per second so folks looking for
liquidy smooth action will be
disappointed I am seeing occasional
stutters or dropped frames but on the
whole performance has been pretty
consistent audio is surprisingly solid
it
approach the work being done by HTC or
the Microsoft Lumia team but we have a
high quality stereo audio track with
good noise reduction which avoids the
warble e distortion we sometimes hear on
LG's phones
now twirling through an exposure
transition test moving from dark to
bright and back the zenfone makes
adjustments in small steps which are
fairly nice these adjustments don't
happen as quickly as I would like but
they are even-handed we just won't see
the really pretty blooming adjustments
that a galaxy or an iPhone can perform
though it was in moving from bright back
to dark I started seeing more
twitchiness and an unpleasant shimmering
effect in high contrast parts of the
frame now this made me nervous
and unfortunately the reason for this
was confirmed while shooting at night
that the zenfone will scale back the
frame rate when in lower light
situations this is a huge pet peeve of
mine and makes footage from this camera
very difficult to edit at night we can
drop as low as 20 frames per second now
this is done to give each frame a little
more light one twentieth of a second as
opposed to one thirtieth of a second but
it also reduces the quality of movement
in your video everything is just going
to look a blurrier or streaky err and
this is very disappointing
I know consumers are going to be
impressed by brighter looking video but
scaling back the frame rate usually just
ends up looking a mess the slow motion
mode is also disappointing the zenfone
doesn't seem to slow down time as much
as it just creates a really slow playing
slideshow I just can't see anyone really
using this or liking it on the flip side
we have a very usable time-lapse mode
setting the zenfone up in my brento pan
lapse it was super easy to get a panning
shot representing hours of real-time
scale down to less than a minute of
footage so where does that leave us with
the camera on the Asus zenfone zoom but
so much of this analysis comes down to
price when I started playing with the
zoom I could only find unlocked models
on Amazon for around five hundred and
thirty bucks and this is simply not
acceptable performance for that much
money however a soos did promise a more
reasonable price for the United States
unlocked model and now on B&amp;amp;H we can
find them for $399 at $400 I'm more
inclined to say this is a good camera
this phone is built around one specific
feature a hardware zoom which is a
rarity and is well executed here
for the most part where I have concerns
though is in comparing the output from
this camera to other devices around this
price point ignoring the hardware zoom
for a second flagship phones from 2015
are dropping far enough in price to put
pressure on this Asus looking
specifically at a phone like the LG g4
we of course lose out on the reach of
the Asus lens but we'd get a higher
resolution on a larger image sensor
giving us better dynamic range and
shallower depth of field this puts me in
a bit of a bind for who I would
recommend the zoom to it would have to
be someone who cares enough about
photography and video to want a
convenience feature like a hardware zoom
but someone who is a little less
discerning about lens clarity and video
performance I'm sure that person exists
and they will be really happy with this
camera but I'm not sure I can point to
anyone in my circles of family and
friends who fit that mold as always
folks thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe for our full coverage
of the Asus zenfone zoom now this camera
review is a new series on pocket now and
it won't continue without your support
it takes a significant amount of work to
produce this much footage so above
commenting and liking sharing will be
greatly appreciated galaxy s7 s and LG
g5 s are right around the corner and you
know you want to see real reviews of
those cameras right for pocket now I'm
Juan Carlos bag now you can tap me up on
Instagram and Twitter as some gadget guy
and I will catch you all on the next
review
