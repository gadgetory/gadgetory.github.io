about a month now so I've got a pretty
good grasp of how it works
this is Adaline for pocketnow.com and
this is our full review of the Microsoft
Surface pro with Windows 8 let's check
out Microsoft invented the tablet
category and even though other companies
have had better success at it it's hard
to call any of these tablet computers
yes they are tablet devices but only
windows-based tablets are real computers
that do everything you need instead of
needing a computer for work and a tablet
for play the surface pro is Microsoft's
answer to those in need of getting
everything done with just one device and
so far it has lived up to that promise
start with the space surface Pro has an
Intel Core i5 1.7 gigahertz processor
with 4 gigs of RAM and either 64 gigs or
128 gates of solid-state storage the ten
point six inch screen runs at 1920 by
1080 with a 208 pixel per inch pixel
density and wide IPS viewing angles
front and rear cameras are included but
they're only 720p HD resolution of
course you've also got a microSDXC slot
USB 3.0 dual band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
4.0 terms of hardware the surface pro is
just as beautifully designed as the
original surface RT it weighs only 2
pounds which is lighter than many other
ultra books with similar specs but if
you're going to compare that to less
capable arm-based tablets you'll find
that a bit heavy still I found carrying
it around in my cam bag using on the
subway or couch to be absolutely
acceptable the kickstand that's fully
integrated with the casing is extremely
useful it's very easy to stand the
surface pro up on any flat surface and
if you've got a keyboard cover you can
turn the tablet into a nice mini
workstation on the go the surface pro
does not come with a keyboard cover but
it's certainly a distinguishing feature
if you do buy one the extremely flat
touch covers are very thin and light but
typing on them may be uncomfortable or
inaccurate if you really want to type
accurately without any learning curve
go for the tech cover instead or plug in
any other USB or Bluetooth keyboard you
want the stylus is a unique feature of
the pro it's based on the wake up
technology which supports harbor states
right click button and an eraser the
stylus also magnetically clips the side
of the surface Pro right on the charging
port which might be annoying for some
since you have to unclip it in order to
charge the battery
speaking of battery life the surface pro
is on par with ultrabooks running core
i5 processors that means about 5 hours
of continuous use
that's not much compared to the 10-hour
battery life of some of the other
tablets out there like the iPad however
comparing the battery life of the iPad
to the surface pro is like comparing the
battery life of an iPhone to a Nokia
3310 sure they're both phones but one is
much more powerful surface pro comes
with Windows 8 pro and that's a big deal
it's a full powered desktop operating
system designed for tablets as well as
other emerging form factors since its
full Windows 8 that means you've got
access to the largest computing
ecosystem in the world
yes bigger than Apple and androids
combined if you're a graphic designer
digital artist or photographer you can
easily take your native files with you
and work on them on-the-go sync them
from SkyDrive or any other cloud service
or simply access them through the
network engineers architects video
editors software developers doctors
lawyers practically any job you can
think of with specialized software it
can be supported easily on the surface
pro you can even run Android apps using
BlueStacks or boot up other operating
systems using hyper-v virtual machines
if you want to design a custom nokia
lumia 820 case for 3d printing check on
the inventory database or write some new
programs of your own it's not a problem
then if you want to relax on the couch
with some Xbox games in neo magazines
ebooks or web browsing the surface pro
is pretty great at doing that kind of
thing to the surface pro is for
professionals or people who might want
to be professional someday now there are
a few things I did not like about the
surface pro the magnetic charger can be
difficult to line up properly maybe I
was spoiled by wireless charging with
the Nokia phones but it shouldn't be so
difficult to plug in the charger
the other big problem which might be a
deal-breaker for many is the fact that
Microsoft did not build the wind tab
compatible drivers for the stylus to
sport pressure input many of the high
end graphics applications fortunately
Microsoft announced that they would fix
this problem a day after the surface pro
is released but that hasn't happened yet
if you're a digital artist you might
want to try to wait for the driver
update but using the stylus and
Photoshop on a crowded subway is still a
hundred times better than using the
trackpad and Mouse on a laptop
overall the surface pro is the better
tablet non compromise no excuses
computers that'll give you the best of
every world in the market today
whether you're professional and amateur
and newbie or a computer veteran it's
hard to classify the surface pro as a
computer for just a specific niche this
is a computer for everyone and as such I
do recommend it our final rating is
going to be in eight point seven out of
ten the surface pro is a great device
that can finally act as the poster child
for Microsoft tablet form factor
initiative that started about eleven
years ago
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
