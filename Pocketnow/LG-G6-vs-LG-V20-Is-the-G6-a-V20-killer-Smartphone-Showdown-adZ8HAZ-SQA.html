let's see if we can answer the question
is the LG G 6 ad 20 killer it catches up
on lifestyle features while pushing the
boundaries on screen
well boundaries and the G sex is a bold
move from a company which has been
struggling to nail down a brand identity
as LG on point or should the discerning
smartphone fan stick with the bigger
phone starting off with design there's
just no contest the g6 is one of the
prettiest phones we've ever held
excellent attention to details terrific
fit and finish gentle angles and tapers
it looks good it feels good the V 20 was
built along more practical lines and
throughout our coverage of the phone the
kindest description we could deliver was
that it was charmingly ugly because it
is what surprised me though the g6 is a
little easier to hold on to sans case
it's ever so slightly thicker giving it
broader sides and if you have dry skin
the v20 satiny finish is slicker if you
have sweaty paws expect glass to slide
more readily depending on circumstances
either phone might be fairly droppable
so we're happy to see both phones rated
at milspec 810g drop resistance checking
out the specs this battle is a bit more
competitive the V 20 wins for base model
storage doubling the G 6 and includes
some fun lifestyle features like the IR
blaster and a removable battery the g6
trades those last two for enhanced water
resistance and wireless charging we also
benefit from a newer chipset that
welcomed 821
doesn't represent a dramatic change in
power but the g6 bench is better and is
generally a snappier performer overall a
special note on displays the g6
represents the first phone to change
aspect ratio to deliver more real estate
in a smaller form factor while these
both have 5.7 inch diagonals the V 20 is
broader the screen on the g6 is a
terrific achievement but in terms of
area it's closer in size to a 5.5 inch
16 by 9 display so if you want the
really bigger screen the V 20 is the
better option it's technology in
transition we're waiting for more apps
to really support taller displays sure
you can see an extra line of text in our
browser but you're also likely to see
fair bit of pillarboxing especially in
video apps LG makes better use of this
height in the camera app organizing
modes and square photo features and if
you do a lot of multitasking the g6 is a
champ when displaying two apps on your
screen at the same time but if you only
have one app on your screen the v20 is
going to maximize that real estate a bit
more efficiently a quick look at battery
performance and the two phones run
neck-and-neck the small capacity
advantage on the g6 does not seem to
deliver any significant advantage in our
tests even with the V 22nd ticker
display drawing extra juice and this is
mirrored in our recharge test where both
phones use quick charge 3.0 and both top
off pretty fast shifting over to audio
and taking a listen to the speakers
onboard
there pretty much a wash
where we hear a bigger difference is in
headphone technology LG still has the
courage to include 3.5 millimeter
headphone jacks and this is an easy win
for the V 20 still the best output we've
ever heard from a phone extremely
sophisticated in detecting headphone
impedance and it packs an incredible amp
to drive nicer cans in the markets where
the g6 does not have the super quad DAC
the g6 is still plenty competitive
against galaxies and iPhones which is a
huge step up from the g5 but it's just
not gonna beat the V 20s killer audio
now audio photography and video major
focus for the V 20 so it's no surprise
that the phablet takes the win for
camera attack the larger main image
sensor delivers better low-light
performance and ever so slightly better
bouquet especially when working at macro
distances
the v20 produces higher quality video
and the microphone array can be tuned to
focus the direction of your recordings
the g6 is a formidable photo fighter
still representing one of the most
flexible camera systems available on a
phone but the only cut-and-dried victory
it can eke out is the wide-angle camera
higher resolution and a slightly less
wide field of view the g6 secondary
shooter is a little more useful and a
little less distorting than the one
found on the V 20 so let's wrap this up
where does that leave us between the LG
G 6 and the LG b 20 for the die-hard
individual who wants the absolute best
in photo video and audio performance
there's really no competition in this
market for the V 20 it's a monster and a
phone we rely on regularly to shoot
video reviews on this channel the g6
really is the better overall lifestyle
device though it's prettier it's just as
drop resistant with rated water
resistance it's snappier and though
camera and audio tech are compromised
against the big brother LG there's still
more than competitive against the rest
of the smartphone market it shouldn't
come as a surprise when a newer phone
outperforms an older phone but what's
exciting for LG is the shift in
execution over successive generations of
product from the misstep which was the
g5 to the v-22 the g6 one year that's
pretty nice refinement whether one of
these is the winner in this showdown and
which one might be the better fit for
you this is a much better track for LG
and we'll always be happy to see
progress as always thanks so much for
