smartphone space over the last couple of
years particularly because of companies
like blue this company has focused on
making some really nice smartphone
offerings at a very affordable price tag
and today we get a glimpse of its new
flagship I'm high memory better with
pocket now here at CTIA in Las Vegas
with the blue pure excel alright so off
the bat my first impression was that I
couldn't believe that I was holding a
350 dollar smartphone the Blue pier
accel sports a gorgeous 6 inch W quad HD
Super AMOLED display at 490 pixels per
inch and some very nice viewing angles
because yes Super AMOLED displays to do
that the black vessels on the display
are convenient for immersive video
consumption and this particular gold
variant that we just received sports a
very nice aluminum trim on the sides and
a plastic removable back that does a
good job of deterring fingerprints
powering this device is a 2.0 octa-core
MediaTek Helio x10 processor 3 gigs of
RAM and a crazy 64 gigabytes of storage
that's also expandable via microSD yes
those two slots that you see on the
sides are indeed dual SIM modules and
that ring at the bottom is a touch base
fingerprint scanner will obviously need
to spend some time testing it to confirm
that the scanner is accurate like
competitors but the placement alone is
rather convenient the Blue pier Excel
also supports a 24 megapixel primary
camera protected by a sapphire lens
cover and you also get an 8 megapixel
selfie shooter at the front the battery
is sadly not removable even though the
back cover is removable but you get a 30
500 milliamp hour battery so that
shouldn't be a problem for many people
handling all this power is android 5.1
lollipop with a very minor blue skin at
the top that actually enhances the
experience though again we will really
need to test this if you're thinking
that all this sounds just too good to be
true for $350 we agree but given the
fact that we just received this unit for
review you can bet that we will be
reporting back on just how well it
performs
we've got more coverage coming from CTIA
