Park geun-hye calm and if you notice the
notepad on your windows mobile device
it's pretty generic it only allows you
to draw type or record so you can just
draw a message or if you wanted to you
could also type a message so just
deselect that and go down here and type
so we can also type a message or record
so you can also go down to record and
record something but it's pretty limited
it doesn't do too much you can zoom in
and zoom out but that's about it and
today I'm going to show you vs notepad
2.5 and all the features that it has so
we'll go into that so the first thing I
notice is a large notepad as well as a
clock with the date so that's nice and
windows and noble notepad doesn't allow
you to have the time so our to see what
date it is so that's nice you can also
if I just start writing so if we just
want to say Oh anything i guess i could
just jot down some scribbles here the
cool thing about this program is Elijah
to change the size of your of your pen
so you can do that so we make different
ones you can also add different colors
and if I can pick any color if I go into
this palette over here I can pick this
so any one of these colors i can pick so
that's nice s'okay pick this color got a
kind of a brown also erase everything so
if i don't like any of that i can erase
it i'll just take a second and i can
start over or i can just click next and
i'll bring me to another page so as you
can see here i wrote this is page 2 on
this one and go to this one this is
another page that i made another cool
powerful feature of this program is that
it gives you drawing tools so you can
make different shapes as well as let's
choose different color here you make
different shapes so if you wanted as
well as lines so that's nice there's
also a spray paint tool so if i wanted
to spray paint something i can do that
and add four thick lines or thin lines
or whatever I choose you also undo
I will continually undo until the page
is all empty another cool feature at
this programs it gives you a calculator
so if i wanted to say 25 x 3 and just
enter that and i can text it onto the
page and i can move anywhere i want so
if i wanted to say this 175 and i'll
just do that in hit ok and that's nice
it's nice to have a calculator directly
write tied into a notepad program
because sometimes it is pretty annoying
to have to go back into a calculator and
then come back into text note ok kelso
going to draw what this gives you other
features for so if you want a larger pen
you can do that as well as well as shade
so if i wanted to make it darker it'll
continually get darker for as a me as
many times as I draw on the page you can
also go back to book and this will allow
me to have many different books so each
book is filled with number of pages so I
want open one I can do that or i can
save them as a jpeg and delete the book
make a new book and change the title so
just open this one this one says pocket
now reviews are fun nah yeah ok so go to
the menu features and go down the page
and we can also set an alarm for this if
so if we wanted this to come up on a
certain day I can select this day or
something and change the time as when I
want it to come up onto my today screen
so I'll just return and we can also say
this is a JPEG as well so just go return
again we go to book making your options
and this allows us to have our 24-hour
clock so as you can see changed or a
dark status bar so long that light
status bar exchange to light so you pick
those features you also pick your
language so we have english french and
italian and you can also change your
keyboard so if you wanted it to be one
of the separate languages you can do
that as well pull your back this way you
register your product so it's already
registered so that's nice so this is vs
notepad so this is vs notepad the
program does cost 1995
for the full version program but for all
the features that you get it's well
worth it now posting Linkin Park another
