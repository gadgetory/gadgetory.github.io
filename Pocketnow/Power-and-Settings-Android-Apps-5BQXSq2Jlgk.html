calm and in this video we are going to
go over to powerful settings and power
management applications for the g1 while
each is just as good by itself they both
serve different audiences toggle
settings is for those of us that like to
adjust settings on our own but want to
do so quickly the power manager you can
use the preinstalled profiles or create
your own so that your g1 will
automatically change settings based on
different triggers let's take a look at
toggle settings by default there are two
pages with easy tap buttons for access
from everything from screen brightness
and screen timeout to turning your GPS
and Wi-Fi on it tapping at the top of
the screen will switch to page 2 which
has more options to customize the app
tap on the tool but where you can select
the application settings change the
number of toggles on each screen or even
turn off page 2
additionally you can go to the page
settings and change which apps show up
on which page now let's look at power
manager while its interface isn't as
slick as toggle settings it's still just
is useful if not more from one screen
you have quick access to main functions
most users want control over you can see
the status of your battery switch
between 2g and 3G turn on or off your
Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS or cell location
additionally you can also enable the
monitor when monitor is enabled power
manager will automatically switch
between the default profiles based on
your power settings the default profiles
range from battery power to low battery
to AC powered and USB power as expected
you can edit these profiles or create
new ones our manager also gives indepth
info about the battery and allows you to
export statistics as well there's also a
few application specific changes that
you can make if you have a hectic
schedule where you might forget to
charge your phone then go with power
manager if you want more manual control
over your settings than use toggle
settings both applications are free and
available from the android market that's
