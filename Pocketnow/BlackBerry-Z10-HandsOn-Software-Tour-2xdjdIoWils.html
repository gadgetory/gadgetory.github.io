it's January 30th I'm in Toronto Canada
and in the building behind me blackberry
maker Research In Motion is making one
of the most important announcements ever
one so important it will determine
whether the BlackBerry brand lives or
dies BlackBerry 10 I came here for a
reason
so let's check it out
and it okay you see well like you I
almond speaking there it's all gesturing
focus so as you saw me sweat
go over your head
very smoothly
featuring decades
okay so it's all controlled by an up
swipe from the bottom there
if I had other things if I have more
open
so you can afford multiple pages of open
application
and you just scroll down whatever else
like your most recent application stayed
there you just saw I've had a little
bread like flat sheet if we scroll over
I can see what's up I will accept your
application
facebook messenger there exactly right
in my house read it directly into the
hub I swipe out and I'm back to my
account now you can select different
accounts so sometimes what I like to do
is
I don't really care what's going on in
my personal life I really need to see
what's important for good work
so I can see if I'm missing any
important emails
you know see what I've changed in my
black bear ID or I could just go to
everything and when you reply to one of
those and we see there's some of the
enhanced keyboard we can swipe
we're getting work suggestions right
over the keyboard there
something wrong
smacks face
anytime you
that's a magnifying lens they're very
intuitive which is quite nice you got is
French
you're never hiding in the French
without having to use the keyboard mode
at all there's
it is automatically detected that you're
using French word
and your tiles are live and active so
you can see recent updates of anything
so
now contact now there's like an
animation or a video playing and you've
minimized it with Cardwell the video
keep playing do you know so and it's
also great for pod so you can look at
the taken to trailer
and I can keep going to my hub
you can see it's still flying the
trailers
and look it doesn't like it fits
that's multipad everything in the
side of things you can see my trick
background I like the color yes
I can go into my work side so it's just
a simple swipe down from anywhere in the
screen and the application view menu
changes everything instantly were
corporate so I can still access my
personal items on my work side
I cannot copy or paste or spin things
from my personal accounts
through my work things
so you wouldn't be able to accidentally
send a personal email through your work
account
and say like you get a notification when
you're in the middle of all this can you
just peek right at it
you can just pull it over so that's an
essence up and over right there you have
all your stuff and then if you don't
need it you don't need to look at actual
content
right here in the left side if you
account for a patient came from
I know I'm waiting on a really bbm
know that I only need to see if the
notification came from my bbm rather
than an email or Facebook in this
message you're not to worry about it
lighten and you don't know how much it
weighs do you I don't actually
for you definitely
yes it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
