the iPhone 11 and it looks better but
it's still ugly
it looks like intel wants to sell their
smartphone modem department to Apple or
at least they wanted to and then azan
wants to make one day free shipping a
standard for all Prime users I'm hiding
that ugly vetiver pointing from Aoife
GPC day one it's been a crazy amount of
power briefings this bargain out daily
sponsored by the oneplus 7 pro the
official lose today begin with deals
Apple watch series 4 is the one I
recommend most for Apple it's currently
available in refurbished options in the
Apple Store and you can get from sixty
two hundred and ten dollars in a
discount again this is the one that I
would recommend you get you can learn
more in the description now let's talk
about the Verizon Galaxy S 10 5 g which
pre-orders have pretty much just begun
you're gonna get your unit by May 16th
the price tag if $1,300 for depending on
the storage variant that you want up to
1400 or 15 if I got it right obviously
yes it's 5g but no there is no 5g yet in
certain areas where it's transitioning
so yeah that's the price I'll start out
Amazon is the company's CFO just came on
record stating that they're working hard
on making Prime a one day thing
currently it's a two day in the past you
had the option to pay a little more for
a one day I don't see that option in my
prime account now but apparently the
company is working hard on figuring out
how to making Prime a one day thing
across for every user now obviously it's
gonna take some time and then it's not
gonna happen on for every user at the
same time so check your account now
let's talk about Apple and Intel as well
you know all the drama that happened
between Apple and calm and the fact that
Intel is no longer in the modem business
or the 5g business pretty much for that
matter as it turns out a new development
arise it turns out that Apple was trying
to buy the business from Intel
apparently info is currently losing up
to 1 billion dollars in it so obviously
they were looking for a buyer and yeah
apparently Cupertino wanted to work on
this there are rumors that they might
still buy as a solution for you know
what so we'll see about that
and finally the hottest news today if
you would account for the fact that the
new camera huh
on the iPhones is going to look like a
stove pun intended
definitely my god okay so we've got
video renders of the iPhone 11 the stove
design in the back which is totally not
Johnny I have no symmetry whatsoever in
that camera design but apparently it
will be getting more flushed to the
chassis it seems that the notch is
getting smaller it seems that we've got
a new mute slider you know I asked Diego
and he's like oh my god this design is
growing on me I don't like it but in the
comments down below let me know do you
think that this looks more bearable or
not because again I my god this is ugly
but this is just me
