pocket now reviewed the galaxy s4 zoom
back in the summer shortly after it was
unveiled at Samsung's premier 2013 event
in London and the task of reviewing it
fell to the same man who'd just gone
hands-on with the unit our own Anton
Dino Jia he proclaimed it a camera with
a phone slapped on it and said if you
decide to go with the galaxy s4 zoom you
won't be disappointed I agree with half
of that and it's not the last half this
is PocketNow I'm Michael Fisher and this
is my review rebuttal for the Samsung
Galaxy s4 zoom as a reminder the review
rebuttal is not a rejection or a
revision of pocket Mouse official review
stance but a second look at a device
meant to give added perspective
sometimes these take the form of
editorials and other times their videos
check out Jaime Rivera's review rebuttal
for the LG g2 at pocket now and follow
us at all the usual squak boxes so you
don't miss future installments the
galaxy s4 zoom was launched on AT&amp;amp;T in
the United States less than a week ago
and when it arrived at our office it
immediately conjured memories of our
experimental weekend using the Samsung
Galaxy camera as a daily driver much
earlier this year that's not a good
thing and sadly it's mostly due to the
form factor AT&amp;amp;T says the galaxy s4 zoom
has the best qualities of the galaxy s4
smartphone series combined with the best
of a compact point-and-shoot camera but
that's not true because one of the
standout positives of the galaxy s4 is
that it's light and thin at 280 grams
and 27 millimeters thick the zoom is
neither that's fine for a
point-and-shoot but its unforgivably
clunky for something sold under the
galaxy s4 smartphone brand it's very big
even for a pocket it's awkward to talk
on as a phone and it's cumbersome to
handle while texting or browsing
especially when the camera Hardware
fires up erroneously is it sometimes
does and deploys that Canon like zoom
lens right between your fingers there
are ways of tacking a big camera onto a
smartphone without venturing into
absurdity like this Nokia's Lumia 1020
is a solid example the Lumia maybe a
little on the ugly side but next to the
zoom it's a beauty queen of course an
aesthetic cost is the price you pay for
a really great camera right well yes the
zoom is aptly named
it's resolution is a fairly standard 16
megapixels but the big deal is the big
lens which is capable of 10 times
optical zoom with Hardware stabilization
for steady shooting that's a huge deal
and it means you can have a lot of fun
picking out small details in faraway
scenes with this device it even performs
reasonably well in low-light with
Samsung's typical bevy of software
options to meet the needs of almost any
situation including a dedicated mode for
food photography if you really want to
be insufferable in public if
picture-taking is your all-time
number-one obsession and you absolutely
don't want to carry a camera in addition
to your smartphone then the galaxy s4
zoom is totally worth your $549 off
contract or $1.99 on a two-year totally
unless that is you look at all the
compromise that's gone into making this
thing Anton put it best in his original
review this thing isn't a galaxy s4
it's an s4 mini made it to a Galaxy
camera
the screen is qHD the processor a lower
power Exynos backed up by a smaller than
usual amount of RAM and the Android
build is despite its jellybean
underpinnings pretty laggy at times
thanks to that middling hardware
and the things that look at first like
conveniences often turn out to be
nuisances like the ring control you're
accidentally bumping all the time or
half-baked like the shutter button that
can't even bypass the lock screen to
quickly launch the camera so you're left
with the device that takes good photos
and delivers optical zoom that you can't
find anywhere else but which is
uncomfortable and generally irritating
to use for every other function broadly
speaking that's not a great trade-off
for the price AT&amp;amp;T is asking you could
get an iPhone 5s a Nokia Lumia 1020 or a
real galaxy s4 all of which deliver a
superior smartphone experience and
comparable photo quality in most cases
yeah you'll be missing out on the
fancier optical stuff but you're also
not being forced to deal with the
downsides of a camera masquerading as a
smartphone which is what the zoom is I
hate criticizing new hardware sometimes
it seems all we do is complain that the
modern smartphone landscape is nothing
but an endless parade of featureless
slabs so part of me feels compelled to
automatically embrace a bold move like
this but it's not enough to be bold the
product also has to make sense and the
galaxy s4 zoom doesn't unless you're
gonna use it as a dedicated vacation
phone you can swap your SIM into for
excursions the zoom doesn't get enough
right in my view to justify its
existence I stand behind Anton to review
on the whole but given the chance I'd
give this device a much lower score of
course I don't really care about numeric
scores as a reader I much prefer the
content of a review but I know a lot of
you out there disagree with me so drop
us a line down in the comments let us
know what you would have scored the
galaxy s4 zoom in numerically or
otherwise if you were given the chance
to review it and after that be sure and
check out Anton's original review of the
device which includes some awesome
photos
from Romania that's here on YouTube and
at pocketnow.com but before you go
anywhere please drop us a like if you
did enjoy the video and stay tuned for a
lot more from PocketNow until next time
this has been Michael Fisher thank you
for watching and we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
