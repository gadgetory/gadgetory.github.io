this is amazon's first smartphone let's
unbox it and see if it gets us fired up
our demo fire phone comes to us from
AT&amp;amp;T but it's clearly amazon which has
provided the packaging here and this is
a phone you'll want to unbox yourself
don't let the store rep do it for you
from the beautifully textured outside
sleeve to the striking black and red box
itself this is very high-end packaging
through and through that continues with
the included literature limited to just
a pair of get-to-know-you cards and some
very lovely cardboard cladding around
the included accessories a USB cable
power adapter and some very space-age
looking headphones no warranty booklets
no rebate cards no extraneous stuff
whatsoever the fire phone delivers a
great first impression coming to the
device itself once we strip away the
protective plastic envelope we get a
device that feels familiar very similar
to the LG Nexus 4 in look and feel in
terms of size it hues very close to the
middle-of-the-road
most closely resembling a device from
another manufacturer whose name starts
with a the fire phone is already
starting to collect fingerprints barely
a few minutes after the unboxing and the
cameras that enable it's fun dynamic
perspective are very visible in certain
light but our first impression is that
the phone is comfortable to hold with a
display that's big enough without
seeming overwhelming and a logical lay
out the power standby key is up top next
to one speaker and the headphone jack
there's a USB port and another pair of
speaker grills down below and on the
left side is the volume rocker a SIM
tray and the camera and Firefly key
powering up the device for the first
time Amazon's unique dynamic perspective
is the very first thing you notice it's
refreshing that it doesn't need any sort
of initial setup or learning phase it
just pinpoints the position of your face
with the four front-facing cameras and
then the screen does its funky 3d thing
the interface is new and unconventional
enough to trip us up a few times we get
a welcome message for
and it takes us a second to figure out
how to get back to the home screen
despite that pronounced home button down
below we've become spoiled by Android
and Windows Phones persistent back key
which isn't present here but a quick
jaunt through the fire phone tutorial
reminds us that the back action is just
an up swipe away and we get comfortable
with the interface fairly quickly
setting up our Google account to play
nicely is as easy as on any smart phone
and digging into those inboxes is
approximately forty times more fun on
the fire phone thanks to the flick to
open side panels combined with the tilt
to scroll in the browser and a number of
other UI quirks we think this device is
sacrificing function for form quite a
bit but we're also really thankful to be
dealing with a refreshing new interface
here and we're very much looking forward
to giving the Amazon fire phone a proper
review now if you don't want to wait for
that join us for episode 106 of the
pocket net weekly airing July 25th at
2:00 p.m. Eastern and we'll answer your
