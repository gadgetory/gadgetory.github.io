unnecessary after all most people don't
need help deciding whether to buy a
smartphone or a refrigerator door right
but it's not that simple
HTC's one is one of the most visible
most highly reviewed smartphones of 2013
and so it would follow in the mind of
the mythical average consumer that
something called the one max might be
better maybe much better right well no
but also yes sort of let's just get down
to it I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is HTC one max versus
HTC one now folks if you're looking for
a deep dive on the one Max alone allow
us to point you to our social feeds
where you'll find pocket now is full one
max review also posted here on our
YouTube channel page and at
pocketnow.com this video is not a review
but a comparison and spoiler alert it's
a testament to the old adage that bigger
doesn't always equal better take the
hardware here there's precious little
that's different under the hood so we
don't need to dwell on the spec
comparison the phones are similarly
outfitted and while we don't
particularly like benchmarks they do
bear that out
so do app launch times which are very
nearly identical so the obvious
distinction here is size yes the max is
bigger in every dimension it's so big
that it's comical while the one fits
nicely in one hand the max has trouble
staying put in - it's just massive
but that's evident just by looking at it
there's no surprises there
the real difference here and the real
surprise is in build quality physically
the one max is not a souped-up one it's
an inflated one mini instead the
beautiful chamfers and edge-to-edge
metal build of the one is gone on the
max replaced by a plastic band that's
nowhere near as attractive yes this
makes room for a removable back cover on
the max and microSD expansion a very big
deal to people who've been loud
demanding this feature four years and
yes we've finally gotten our
side-mounted unlock button because HTC
is not insane but the trade-off in build
quality doesn't seem worth it the max is
bigger than the one but it feels cheaper
there are some compelling things you can
only do on a larger device though and
the one max is size plays to its
advantage in a few areas its 5.9 inch
display has a lower pixel density but
it's also over an inch larger on the
diagonal than the older phones and it's
just as crisp and vibrant as ever also
though the speaker components are the
same between the devices the larger size
of the One Maxx allows for much louder
sound and that more than makes up for
the lack of Beats Audio on the max which
we've never considered a terribly
compelling differentiator both of our
test units are running Android 4.3 but
only the one max has been loaded with
the new version of HTC Sense 5.5 and HTC
informs us that almost everything that
currently makes the one max special from
its blinkfeed enhancements to its
improved gallery experience - it's fun
new Zowie features is eventually gonna
trickle down to the one anyway the only
major asset that won't make the leap is
the fingerprint scanner due to that
special hardware that's required and
it's probably a good thing it won't make
it to the one the bottom line is that
unless you absolutely can't wait to try
out the new jiff making feature of the
new Zowie sweet there's nothing in the
software that would lead us to advise
you to buy the one max over the one that
trend continues in terms of the camera
where HTC has not only recycled the same
4 megapixel sensor from the one but it's
also removed optical image stabilization
from the assembly on the newer device if
this blows your mind you're not alone
and the company had no comment on the
matter when we asked them about the
decision in the real world the
difference isn't as striking as we
expected though and the max even turns
out better shots than the one in some
conditions in particular low-light
photography is almost a draw which we
didn't expect so HTC does deserve some
credit here for
a rabbit out of its hat performance
isn't quite as impressive on the
front-facing camera side where the max
produced more washed out results than
the one but then it also includes
support for dual capture as well so dump
all that into a pot and you come out
roughly equal though we still prefer the
one camera for stills in terms of video
there's also precious little difference
here the software stabilization on the
max makes for a somewhat janky warped
feeling compared to the ones Hardware Oh
is but both cameras deliver a pretty
noisy picture with many overexposed
areas and doors
speaking of noise the one does a much
better job of capturing quality audio
than the max does probably owing to the
so called HDR microphones HTC has been
forced to stop using mines to a Nokia
injunction neither of these devices
would be our first choice for capturing
videos and considering what else is
available on the market but nothing when
all this is taken together we think the
one edges out the max just by a hair
sure is if indeed that does apply in
this situation on one of these devices
HTC One versus a 3d audio capture is if
indeed that does apply in this situation
on one of these devices HTC One versus
HTC One max pocket now doc the
difference is much more striking when it
comes to voice calls where once again
the HTC One delivers the superior
experience using a T's network callers
said we sounded crisper and clearer on
our Google Play edition one than on the
Macs though each device did excellently
in suppressing background noise about
the only area the max outperforms its
predecessor in this category is in terms
of battery life where it mops the floor
with the one and any other
conventionally sized smartphone that's
because the max is power pack is massive
an excellent value add for the kind of
folks who watch movies on their phone
all day long so if you're that kind of
person the max will do you much better
than the one in our full review we were
obligated to score the HTC One max based
on how well it filled the gap it aspired
to fill
no matter how weird we thought that nish
was here we have no such constraints
despite being eight months older beyond
middle-age in phone years the HTC One is
a more attractive more practical and
depending on your region probably a more
affordable device unless you really need
a giant screen and boombox speaker
performance there's no compelling reason
to buy the One Maxx over the one so one
of the tech presses unofficial favorite
Android flagship phones remains safe
from its would-be usurper got something
to say about that I bet you do
