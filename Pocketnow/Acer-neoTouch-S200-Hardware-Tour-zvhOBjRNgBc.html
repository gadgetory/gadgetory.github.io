pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to take a hardware tour of the
acer neo touch s200 but first some
specifications this device runs on
windows mobile 6.5 professional the
latest it also has a Qualcomm one
gigahertz Snapdragon processor which is
really really high for a mobile device
in the next video we're going to go
through the software and see if that
actually makes it faster and we're also
going to talk a little bit about battery
life it has 512 megabytes of storage rom
but you can also expand that up to 32
gigabytes with a microSD card plus it
has 256 megabytes of RAM which is a good
amount but it's not as much as say the
touch pro 2 or the HTC touch HD it's got
a GPS Bluetooth Wi-Fi the stuff you
would expect from a high-end smartphone
and it is 12 millimeters thick and if
you remember the touch HD which is a
very similar device to the neo touch it
was also around 12 millimeters thick but
side-by-side and in the hand the neo
touch actually feels a little bit
thinner even though there around the
same size probably because the edges are
actually more pointed so let's take a
look at the device the screen is 3.8
inches diagonal just like the touch HD
wvga resolution so that's 800 down and
480 across it's a resistive touchscreen
so you got to give it a little bit of
pressure but the screen sensitivity is
quite good that said the screen is a
little bit too mushy compared to other
devices like the touch pro 2 and the
touch diamond2 that now have more firm
screens that kind of fear feel closer to
capacitive then kind of the older style
resistive touchscreen devices let's look
closer at the top here up here we have a
speaker plus a front-facing video camera
a proximity sensor to turn off the
screen when you're on a call and a light
sensor going down here it says acer and
then we have some kind of cryptic
buttons here that light up when it's
dark so if calls start and call end
obviously and then we have a back button
and then a square which is actually the
button to take you back to the home
screen
this book button in this bunk button
pretty much have the same function they
both will take you back home though
obviously call and we'll end the call if
you're on a call let's take a look on
the side has a chrome strip all the way
around the side that's just a huge
fingerprint magnet here we have the
standby button which will turn on the
device going on to the bottom we have
mini USB which is great because it's not
proprietary and we have a microphone on
the other side we've the dual action
camera button for the 5 megapixel camera
a soft reset hole which is nicely placed
outside of the device not under the
battery cover and a volume rocker which
is on the right side usually we're
pretty much used to by now the volume
rocker on the left side thanks to HTC so
this is a little bit different than
other devices on the top we have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack which is good
and we've also got the stylists over in
this corner which is unfortunately
collapsible really cheesy fuelling
stylist and unfortunately if you put the
stylist in wrong you can actually get
jammed so you have to get it just right
so it fits but if you put it in kind of
turn to the side you see this is how it
ends up so you got to get your
fingernail and pull real hard so not a
good design in terms of how they put the
stylus up in its silo here on the back
we have a huge shiny black piece of
plastic which picks up fingerprints and
scratches way too easily and i say
scratches because i've had this device
for just a few hours now and it may be
tough to see on camera but there are
already tiny little scratches on the
back of this device and it's literally
been in my pocket for about 15 minutes
so the back is very successful
susceptible to scratches which is very
unfortunate here we have a 5 megapixel
camera with autofocus and an LED flash
let's take off the battery cover which
fortunately isn't a sliding battery
cover it's more of a pop-out cover kind
of pry your finger now back here we have
the slot for the microSD card battery
which is of size thirteen hundred and
fifty mili amp hours and slot for your
SIM card so overall the hardware on the
eastern neo touch is thin and it looks
great unfortunately a search still
hasn't gotten it right in terms of build
quality it's not up to par with what HTC
produces for example there's a lot of
use of plastic
materials that really pick up on
fingerprints and its scratch very easily
and it feels kind of cheap in hand
fortunately the neo touch is an
inexpensive device right now you can go
to klove co uk and pick one up for about
270 pounds which comes out to about five
hundred dollars depending on the
exchange rate of the day which is pretty
darn cheap for a high-end snapdragon
powered windows phone so that's really
the saving grace for the acer neo touch
s200 and kind of makes it more
compelling coming up in the next video
we're going to talk about the software
on the device see how fast the
Snapdragon platform actually makes this
device and how well it's optimized take
advantage of that one gigahertz CPU will
be back soon with more that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
