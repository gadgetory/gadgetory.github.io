the first smartphone i ever owned was a
blackberry back then one out of every
five smartphones sold was built by the
juggernaut known as Research In Motion
but a decade later blackberry is on the
ropes with less than 1% market share and
it hopes to revive its flagging fortunes
by focusing on privacy and on once again
making it a privilege to own a
blackberry does the BlackBerry Prive
deserve a place in your holster let's
find out the BlackBerry Prive is a
fusion of new and old concepts unlike
anything else on the market today its
quad HD P OLED display is absolutely
gorgeous its Gorilla Glass 4 lens
curving at the sides and stopping short
of the bottom lip to make room for a
front firing speaker with a voice as
loud as its grille is wide up top is the
BlackBerry brand name flanked by that
old BlackBerry trademark the
multicolored notification light on the
other side the glass weave back cover
has some disappointing give to it but
it's finished in one of the grittiest
soft touch coatings we've ever come
across it means it sticks to your
fingers when you use a thumb to slide
the screen up and out of the way
revealing the prigs most distinctive
feature there are two ways to look at
the pretty board if you're coming from
another BlackBerry you'll probably be
disappointed because they're crammed
into such a thin casing the keys don't
have the travel or mechanical feedback
BlackBerry's come to be known for these
keys aren't as clicky as those on the
classic and they're not as spacious as
those on the passport but the Privy is
one of only a very few Android phones to
pack a physical keyboard of any kind and
it easily beats what little competition
remains though it's a little cramped
it's still designed very well after
about a week of practice we're now able
to type more words per minute with
greater accuracy with the physical
keyboard than the software one now
BlackBerry's virtual keyboard is just as
good as ever with excellent predictive
text that lets you swipe directly on the
keys to autocomplete but we really only
use it when we need to use the Priven
handed the rest of the time we prefer
the physical keyboard
and not just for typing BlackBerry has
used capacitive sensors along with
androids Mouse framework to make the
keyboard into one big trackpad that
means you can place the cursor exactly
where you want it just by moving your
thumbs across the buttons it also means
you can scroll lists webpages menus and
more without ever touching the screen
considering how tall the privy is when
it's open that makes for a much more
comfortable experience then there's the
shortcuts you can program any of the
prigs keys as a quick launch button to
open any app you want
and each supports either a short or a
long press for a total of 52 possible
shortcuts or you can set any keystroke
to open device search letting you jump
right into a contact and app or a google
search okay so we've been focusing on
the upsides of the privy experience
unfortunately things do start getting
substantially bumpier when it comes to
software this is a custom interface
built atop Android lollipop and that
older foundation means the privileged
significant improvements brought by
Android marshmallow things like
performance upgrades battery saving
measures and most crucially for a phone
that bills itself as a private device
individual app permissions BlackBerry
has promised a marshmallow upgrade
sometime in 2016 until then it's D Tech
Security Suite will have to do and much
of what this offers is generic simple
stuff like using a lock screen but it
does let you know which apps are asking
for specific data like your location
which is useful the prytt also comes
with device wide encryption enabled out
of the box and a variety of behind the
scenes security measures though taken
together they don't provide much more
security than comparable offerings from
say Samsung or Google oddly there's no
fingerprint scanner in sight the
BlackBerry launcher is peppered with
custom enhancements many carried over
from blackberry 10 most prominent is the
hub which aggregates notifications from
various sources into a single stream if
you like getting all your alerts in one
list this is the best way to do it
longtime blackberry users will feel
right at home here
unfortunately that means they'll also
feel right at home waiting for the hub
to catch up to them it's sluggish even
more so than it was on BB ten and like
much of the Privy experience its
inconsistent the Google Hangouts isn't
supported for example that inconsistency
isn't confined to the hub it bleeds over
into third-party titles as well while
the Gmail app recognizes keyboard
shortcuts the inbox by Gmail app does
not keyboard scrolling works in
Instagram and Twitter but it's inverted
in Facebook and it doesn't work at all
in Google Maps it also makes Google Docs
interesting to say the least the mere
presence of the keyboard makes games
like asphalt 8 basically unplayable at
least until they're updated and
otherwise useful features like device
search are hobbled by a mixture of
performance issues and bad design
decisions there's so much lag that it
either doubles up on the first letter
you type or drops it completely and it
doesn't clear searches between sessions
like in BB 10 these problems are ashamed
because the BlackBerry launcher has some
really smart features if you're using a
trusted device like a SmartWatch you can
set the Prive to automatically wake up
when it detects it's been picked up and
it'll go to sleep when you put it
facedown anytime you see an app icon
with these three dots beneath it you can
swipe up on it to reveal its
accompanying widget and then tap
anywhere else to close it when you're
done which is so cool
swipe in from the edge and you get the
productivity tab quick shortcuts to
tasks email contacts and calendar all
this makes the Provera complex
smartphone but also one you can tweak
more extensively than most androids
blackberries have never been known for
their cameras and the probe looks to
change that it's the same sensor from
the Moto X pure edition cropped to 18
megapixels and given optical
stabilization and it's capable of some
solid photos with accurate colors and
crisp detail in daylight it can even
make waning autumn afternoon light work
for it in some cases with HDR helping
out in the shadows at the expense of
saturation
colors sometimes suffers in general
especially in low-light where everything
just gets kind of washed out full of
grain we shot a few photos side by side
with the Nexus 6p whose camera did a
much better job of preserving color and
contrast especially at night so the
probe is capable of taking decent photos
as long as you stick to the primary
camera we can't say the same for the
selfie shooter an anemic 2 megapixel
module whose main distinctions are
digital noise and poor low-light
performance in camcorder mode where the
privy out at 4k and 30fps the output is
so-so
on the bright side the stabilization
does a really nice job compensating for
footsteps and handshakes and auto focus
and exposure keep up with even quick
pants audio capture is pretty nice to
able to separate the sound of a sneeze
from the sound of a breeze nice video is
notably sharp as well especially in 4k
where you can just freeze the playback
to get a really nice frame but in smooth
expanses like a clear sky there's an
awful lot of digital noise almost like
compression artifact ting it's not
enough to make the video unwatchable but
it's definitely a little distracting
fortunately you can shoot all the 4k
video you like if you invest in a memory
card the privies a microSD slot to
augment the 32 gigs of on-board storage
we've used the BlackBerry prefer 7 days
on t-mobile between rural New York and
Greater Boston and we've actually made
more phone calls than usual in that time
part of that is because the previous
just subtank comfortable to talk on with
its tall display deployed neither we nor
our callers had any complaints about
sound quality over either earpiece or
speakerphone and the dedicated mute key
which at first struck us as kind of dumb
is one of those features you have to
experience to understand how convenient
it can really be
we touched on the system lag a few
minutes ago and well the privet is much
smoother than it was out of the box due
to a recent software update there's
still plenty of room for improvement in
terms of fluidity throughout there are
also just weird annoyances that you
don't see on other flagship smartphones
apps crash pretty regularly and every
time it boots up it takes several
minutes to get itself sorted during
which time it runs the processor like
crazy just like on the Moto X the
Snapdragon 808 runs pretty hot on the
Prive under even a moderate load and
maybe that has something to do with the
battery life we're getting which is
undistinguished we were only able to get
more than four hours of screen on time
over a 16-hour day once in seven days
now we routinely run our phones pretty
hard here at the pea machine and this is
a Canadian review unit not built
specifically for t-mobile but that's
still a pretty lame showing given the
phone's huge battery the BlackBerry
Prive is a device we really want to like
and not just for nostalgia sake
it packs an innovative keyboard and a
beautiful display into a unique form
factor and it brings some really
thoughtful software improvements that
make Android more useful and
customizable especially in terms of
messaging for enterprise users with
specific needs for the BlackBerry
faithful willing to sacrifice
consistency for a broader ecosystem or
for Android users desperate for
something different
the Prive is absolutely worth of by
everyone else though we'll want to wait
a bit there's probably no device out
there right now that more badly needs a
marshmallow update which seems likely to
fix many of the issues we have with the
Prive but that won't happen until
sometime in the new year at which point
the price might be a little more
reasonable than its currently exorbitant
$700 for BlackBerry's sake
we hope that price drop and that
software update comes sooner rather than
later
for much more of the good bad and ugly
concerning the BlackBerry prim folks pay

length review available November 19th

until next time this has been michael
fisher captain to phones on twitter
reminding you to keep your privilege
private for your privacy privilege
whatever thanks for watching see you
