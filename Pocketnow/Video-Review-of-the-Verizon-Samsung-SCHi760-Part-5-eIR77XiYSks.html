pocketnow.com this is part 5 of the
video review of the verizon samsung i760
today we're going to take a look at the
camera quality and we're going to
compare it to a picture taken with a
sony DSC w70 camera which is a 7.2
megapixel camera and a tmobile wing
which is the HTC Harold which has a 2
megapixel camera and we're also going to
take a look at how fast the screen
rotates between the samsung i760 and the
tmobile wing so let's take a look at the
camera quality the i760 has a 1.3
megapixel camera with a flash associated
with it so it's a it's a very nice
little camera so what I decided to do
was to take the i760 retail package and
take a picture with the i760 t mobile
wing and the sony DSC w70 which is my
point-and-shoot seven point two
megapixel camera and then print the
pictures and we'll take a look at them
to initiate the camera mode on the i760
you press this button and all you have
to do is press the d-pad works like most
windows mobile cameras so I have all
three pictures here this one obviously
is the best of the bunch and it was
taken with the sony DSC w70 the second
one i was very surprised about it's the
tmobile wing which is a 2 megapixel
camera and the picture is actually quite
washed out and the third picture which
is quite good for a 1.3 megapixel camera
is the one taken with the i760 so i
would rate
the quality of the camera very high
especially compared to a 2-megapixel a
camera from HTC okay so let's take a
look at the screen rotation so on the
Left I have the i760 and on the right I
have the tmobile wing so on the count of
three I'm going to flip them up and see
how fast each one of them rotates so one
two three you can see how much faster
the i760 is over the tmobile wing that's
quite impressive in same on reverse I
mean the tmobile wing is almost two
seconds behind what is almost
instantaneous on the i760 I thought it
would be fun to take a look at the
iphone in the i760 s screen rotation
speed so the iphone uses an
accelerometer which is set it senses the
motion of the device turning while the
i760 uses software and a switch on the
keyboard so we'll try it out here go one
two three and you see the i760 actually
beat out the iphone so we'll try it
again here same thing so one two three
and it takes a little while for the
iphone to realize that it's been turned
and the angle i found that the angle of
the iphone also matters but the i760
beat out the iphone and screen rotation
so i'll be back when one last segment of
the video review which we'll go over the
included software that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
