think my I think they will okay I think
we should I mean Jules can blur the face
but babe can you return e Issa
sorry it's just if you don't want your
mouth completely open on camera buddy
and this is a special episode of the
bacchanal weekly episode number 341
brought to you by xda-developers and of
course plugin now i tried to do a bit of
an intro at the beginning of this as
this is a car cast hai meetha Vetta and
I were driving back from CES from Las
Vegas back here to Los Angeles and we
also had ISA Rodriguez in the back it is
another look at CES 2019 as Jaime and I
talked about some of our memories from
the show and why we actually think that
this might have been one of our favorite
CES is that we've ever been to so why
don't we go ahead and just cut over to
the car cast is this legal I don't think
so
[Laughter]
yeah I was trying to think of an intro
as I was feeling up the car because I
know that we always we want we want to
have our our jewels esque intros oh this
is the best one I can come up with in
the desert you can't remember your name
but after a sea of business cards and
meetings throughout CES 2019 there's a
whole lot else we don't remember hello
everybody and welcome to this episode of
the pocket now weekly brought to you by
XDA end pocket now of course XD
developers and pocket now i don't know
what episode this is but this is of
course our CES are we supposed to
remember with all the alcohol I know
right exactly
we're on our way back from CES 2019
driving back to Los Angeles I have all
of our belongings in tow of course over
here to my right is I'm not one of your
belongings I said our I said our
belongings uh and in the back seat over
there is Isla Rodriguez of glad you met
who you might hear chiming in from time
to time I'm getting onto the 15 freeway
right now as we are coming back from Las
Vegas so how did this
how did the show turn out huh better
than expected yeah it was a good time
think it's the first time that I can say
I like to see yes really yeah well it's
what would attribute to that because
we've always this is a topic I wanted to
dive into for for this because we're
gonna be when this episode comes out
it's gonna be something of like a week
since we came back yeah so what I'm
looking for here is like everyone says
that CES has been losing its luster it's
been losing its relevance almost but
it's not truly the case like did we feel
that way this year I think we should
just
oh do me one favor can you bring it up
so that's more in line with your mouth
there all right sorry um I don't know I
guess I have leveled my expectations of
CES yeah um in the past we were like oh
we're mobile focused and there is you
know there was no mobile there was no
phones and so our opinion was to find on
that but now we are making a shift out
of that yeah we are gonna cover mobile
we will continue doing that but you know
as technology is evolving with 5g and
everything that's coming
we've got 8k TVs we saw some amazing
monitors and it's just technology is
evolving in such a way that you know you
have to understand that the smartphone
is now just one of the many terminals
that you could use I've been using
products like a Google home hub lately
that I love to death um and so I'm just
I'm very enthusiastic and I am also I
think I love the fact that we didn't
overdo Vegas in the past there was all
this rush of getting content and we made
a conscious decision when we arrived in
Vegas that Vegas was not gonna be about
the content that the content was gonna
be there um but there's even more coming
out maybe even right now exactly but we
decided that we wanted Vegas to be about
the content and the relationship yes and
the technology and just enjoying the
show we slept
we worked mm-hmm we did party and yet I
don't feel overworked and that's
something that I really wanted
and obviously like the relationship
building like just go yes going past
just the Samsungs and lg's of the world
yeah like there's so many new players
and CES is a perfect place for them to
showcase themselves that says I mean you
have people coming from all over the
world and Vegas is like one of the most
accessible cities in the world
indeed um so yeah you mean we just did a
bunch of stuff with like we were getting
in more with Razer we got to look at oh
yes all right live god I love lasers
offerings with that razor we'll just
have so many cool things like they
focused on the chroma RGB aspect but I
have a great shot of you loving those
headphones oh my god you know I wish I
wish that that our timing and razor was
not as tight as it was yeah because I
would have loved to make a video but
just you know the video just didn't
allow itself for filming um not so much
ya know I mean it also was like you mean
obviously with pocket now it's it's been
a mobile focus but yeah and I know that
I owe you my razor phone review but now
that I have the riser controller I'm
willing to do the review yeah I'm super
excited because I was very clear I will
if I can't do a gaming phone review if
I'm not willing to game with it and I'm
not willing to game with a phone on its
screen
give me a controller and then we'll talk
okay so razor was very clear that I was
gonna wait until the controller to do my
review and that's now's the time I have
not tested it yet but but I feel like
different from all the other shows like
with yes the razor phone 2 came out a
while ago yeah they had some chroma
stuff to show off but we were like
playing games on desktops and Expo I
love playing - man ok so a game like
doom will totally make me go back to
playing on a PC and I have a gaming PC I
just I needed a good monitor and oh my
god
LG oh yeah yeah oh I already told them
that ultra-wide man I really want that
ultra wide it was the 49 inch what 49
inch ultra wide it was fantastic and
it's just for me it's not just about the
ultra wide bragging rights
LG knows how to do monitors their color
accuracy is top-notch I love the in the
case of their game
monitors how they've already built in
the LEDs like they noticed that we are
sticking LEDs in the back of our monitor
so they're just doing it for us no I
love that you didn't get to see the
monitor that razors developing no
they're actually developing one I don't
we couldn't get a full answer as to who
they're partnering with to make it but
the bottom of it like the worst Sharpe I
assume that probably will be the bottom
of that the stand has that same chroma
lighting that the the razor two wireless
charger has but their cable and you know
what this is this is the highlight for
me is that this is probably at least for
me maybe for yourself also since there's
like a shift in the way that things are
working a pocket now like this there's
so much more I I had a day where I
looked at so many things on the show
floor and like meeting with people and
not one of them had to do with the phone
yes it was fantastic yeah I love that I
it's just isn't it refreshing yeah is it
a refreshing I uh it's just if we go
back to every single podcast that we've
done ever since we started day one of
CES it's all a cry show it is all all I
didn't like it oh I was disappointed oh
I was just the ranch story and you know
we made a conscious decision this year
we actually Josh and I made this
decision in Hawaii that we were gonna be
happy that we were gonna go enjoy the
show for what it is that we were going
to you know just embrace whatever it is
the CES has to show yes and I think that
we succeeded at this and I think that
CES succeeded at showing us what we
wanted to you know be showing us what
they could do I mean surely you know
companies are not doing major
announcements or at least the companies
that we focus on aren't but that's the
problem it's just the companies that we
focus on just don't you see yes yeah and
we have to understand that it's not C
ESS problem yeah they had enough TV
announcements they had enough oh my god
art home smart home they had everything
there their vehicle announcements as
well Qualcomm did an announcement of
what they're focused and focusing on an
automotive and so it's not like if there
is no technology no we're the one
that needed the shift the focus yes but
also it's not hard to know what I feel
like a lot of people don't realize is
that even if there's no mobile focus at
CES or or even shows like Aoife for
example there are so many products that
link into it
yeah smartphone has become the home of
it's become like the the epicenter of
what the rest of tech ends up being yes
so even then like I don't have it right
here but I even have like a microphone
that I was able to get ahold of that
it's supposed to make vlogging with a
smartphone even better yeah that's not
really a phone announcement but it has
everything to do with exactly that's
what CES is all about and make that
mental shift it becomes a really
exciting show
exactly so I'm actually you write it I
feel much happier with how this one went
because I was a because we were able to
focus on way more than that but even
then the shift is not hard now it's like
a it's like a really easy pivot and you
know I would really love comments what
do you guys feel about our brand name I
mean do you think that we so by the way
it's funny when people are like yes but
it's not pocket now I'm like okay so the
brand was not born out of the concept of
what fits in your pocket I was born out
of an operating system when pocket now
was found that the major operating
system was Pocket PC oh I actually
didn't know that exactly and so if you
remember pretty much every website back
then was Pocket PC thoughts and it was
not the concept was not mobile it was
focused on Pocket PC which eventually
became smartphones so we started being a
PDA website that eventually evolved into
a smartphone website that you know it
just drifted into becoming a mobile
website because Android was the
predominant operating system but we
didn't even cover Android I remember
when we made the conscious choice to
move to Android because at some point we
were the top Windows Mobile website it's
stuff like that and so what do you do
you feel that we should change the brand
we've been considering certain ideas I'm
not saying that we're gonna do it it's
just obviously feedback is the best then
if you could shine in the comments and
let us know what you think that'd be
fantastic yeah absolutely I I feel like
you and I have had a couple of
conversations as to like what it could
be instead yeah not an easy question
to answer it's not an easy question
because I feel nostalgic for it Brandon
feels nostalgic for it yeah we've it's
taken us forever to grow it and to take
it to what it is and definitely it's
it's very difficult to let it go but
sometimes you just need to and say oh I
I'm not saying we will again it's just
the question and you know suggestions
and everything or or do you feel like we
should just remain true to the brand and
extensors and things that's also welcome
let it know and I still think it fits
the name does but just it's just that
people need to understand that what is
in the pocket control so much exactly
and that's and that's really what the
focus of like all the smart home and all
that is it is involved with um but yeah
indeed I wave opening that up do we have
a bottle opener
I think it's a twist-off I don't think
it is I'm pretty sure it is here let me
see mine this is we are multitasking
like fiends right now on the road but
you know what there's no traffic that's
something that I'm actually really
surprised by no it's not alright so this
one's yours
I'll take that one fine make fun of me
okay I have delicate hands
the well they have to be on camera so I
don't blame you so so do mine for that
matter I don't know why I'm making that
joke okay that one's rough this one's
rough yeah told you oh so weird anyways
here's chips by the way this is root
beer doesn't judge a diet root beer on
the road yeah cheers Cheers hmm you know
why that's what's exactly what I wanted
it to be I think I have had root beer in
ten years oh good old sassafras right
there Jules you're gonna have to be
editing all the burping man all right so
on that note I swear I can open the beer
the piers the root beers a little bit
just in case we're gonna see if we need
to do a tiny break before we get into
the actual device stop the bacchanal
weekly is brought to you with support
from caseta by Lutron and today I want
to talk to you about casita by Lutron
brought to you by Lutron pioneers and
smart home lighting with casita you can
schedule your lights to come on at dusk
so your family always comes back to a
well at home and you can tell Google
assistant alexa or Siri to turn the
lights on or off bright or dim or
anywhere in between
these are dimmer switches we're talking
about after all coming from Lutron the
company with over 60 years of experience
in illumination and you can integrate
them into your smart home routine by
connecting them to your Sonu sound bar
your kness camera and thermostat and
plenty of other devices
our producer Jules wakes up with and
goes to bed with the help of casita
every day with winter bringing on late
sunrises and early sunsets he times his
lights to turn on with alarms and tells
his assistant to turn them up when he's
about to fall asleep
that's smart lighting the smart way you
can get it to search CAS ETA or head to
Lutron comm to learn more coz theta by
Lutron welcome home it's a peace of
mind.we we were just talking a little
bit during this particular portion of
the ride like I was I was I was saying
for a bit that we're on this road we
have things like self-driving cars now
and obviously we're in a vehicle with
all this technology in front of us and
only about a hundred years ago where
were people like on dune dune buggies
but like horse-drawn carriages or steam
um locomotives steam locomotives yeah
and like the kind of progress that we've
made because I just look around it's
literally we're in the desert right now
yeah and it's a beautiful it's a
beautiful scene don't get me wrong but
we will from there we were talking a
little bit about the different
innovations that we could have seen at
CES or may have seen or may not have
seen because you did not really get to
spend time with the Flex part the flex
buy oh my god everybody please go watch
my buddy's video bored at work and a
bong
the colonel duck colonel hey what was
the title African Prince been his
smartphone with his bare hands
oh my god that guy's a character it's
great
yeah so they had a they had a little
area in the back where they had press
media even anyone who was just attending
the show look at the phone okay um and I
did get to like hold it and mess around
with it I have a lot of footage in a
video that you should be up by now so
you could check it out yeah it's it's a
foldable not a foldable it's a flexible
display you're not folding it because
you're not creating a crease yeah so
it's really important to make that
distinction but it's not glass it's not
a glass display it is the entire thing
is plastic yeah so that you can actually
bend it and it's it is a responsive
screen I can't say I can't say how
responsive what kind of quality it is
yeah but once you fold it you have what
they call a three screen parents of ice
yeah so you have the backside and then
you have the front side where the main
Android OS lives and then you have this
like little not crease but fold or bend
in the middle that if you were to look
at it in like a tenth view that's where
your notifications appear right
and then when you take it out well when
you fold unfold it rather there's a
hinge on the back which is where it all
happens and then a very strong magnet
actually that keeps it together when you
fold it interesting
can I ask you a question go for it why
why will you ever use a product like
that okay so that I I did not really ask
the gentleman there in those terms but I
was like you know I really like it as a
tablet this is so this is probably what
a tablet should be like it's really thin
it's easy on the hands because it's
super light I had it and and it's it's
easy to use so if you made a tablet that
looks like this I would be so in it's
like a eight seven or eight inch and
when it's a taxi I but he said that one
of the people because they did start
seating out the devices to like certain
VIPs in China
yeah um one of them noticed that those
magnets on the back were so strong that
he's using it as a display for his
refrigerator I thought that was dope I'm
trying to think of an example
I think that I think that as a phone
it's weird though I agree with you it's
the weirdest thing okay so I you know
you'll never see like a transformer car
that is a sedan at some point and then
you can turn it into a 4x4 unless you
bought a Subaru and even those it's it's
just it's very difficult okay a
smartphone has been proven for the past
decade 12 years that there is one form
factor flat slab there there is one form
factor and then the tablets have been
proven or I mean Microsoft experimented
with so many types of designs for
tablets and then came Apple with the
iPad and boom that the form factor was
just the fine
so I'm not saying that these are not
cool products they're very cool yeah and
it's nice to have this like Vanguard
product that's gonna pull publicity in
your direction because that's what I
feel that they're gonna be there's only
one reason why we visited that booth and
it's because we were curious to see the
Flex thingy but I it serves no purpose
it serves very little purpose other than
at being good PR a good way of actually
presenting what their other product and
what they're capable yes because they
have these flexible displays on other
products where they make perfect sense
there was that smart speaker that they
have where they actually wrapped a
display or that makes it that makes
sense yeah but it's just for me I for
example I love my iPad and it all it
also bends now I love my iPad but one of
the things that I love the most about
don't have a bend all right there's no
bent right have you checked yeah but but
what I love about the iPad most is I
could put it you know it's there's my
computer and then I could fit the tablet
in front and it doesn't bother like it
feels like if there's nothing there okay
doesn't weigh anything and so I can't
imagine using that flexi thing in my
pocket or putting it in my bag without
wanting to extending it but then if I
wouldn't but but then if there's no
purpose for it to flex then why would I
ever flex it exactly
so how is the experience any better when
you can flex it is the question the
thing is that it that is a that's an
almost impossible question to answer at
this juncture because Android simply
does not play well with it like apps
were opening in the wrong orientation it
was confused about like what
configuration the phone was in but that
you know this is an early product
obviously so it's a concept phone that
they had examples of but it may never
prove itself on the market and when it's
flexed it feels weird in the pocket
little as it's asymmetric let's try to
remember another case of a product that
was a vapor we're like why like I'm
trying to remember of other products or
other concepts and ideas that were
either too late for their time or too
early for their time or just flat-out
we're cool but didn't make sense well in
in in the vein of what we're talking
about right now I'm inclined to say the
axon M but it just wasn't it just wasn't
implemented right was its biggest
problem exactly and so I mean but what
was the biggest problem with the X on
him it was the software wasn't ready and
then the phone was just too thick it has
a design is so the design was made to
benefit the the whole idea of making a
two screen tablet that's a phone this
and that but then if it completely
disregards our economics and becomes
this thick product then you simply it's
it's just I mean when was the last time
that we used holsters in our in our
belts to carry a phone yeah I'm done it
yes make fun of me all you want in the
comments I didn't know no Michael Fisher
for that oh that's it we need mr.
michael fisher with as a mature like
yeah LD us LD us holsters I use
Poulter's holsters and I love them but
we've been so used to using smartphones
in our pockets that yeah that it's like
what so we're gonna go back to using
holsters
well you know the man bag is back the
what you know the man bag has returned
what is that like they're dudes that
walking around with like oh sorry in
Spanish we call those well yeah like
there are like small sling bags that
people are you that guys are using now
to carry stuff and you know what I got a
save probably the reason why the man bag
is back you know you can thank vloggers
for that they got a carry gear on the
daily tunnel I mean can you see that all
this yeah I use I use a camera a small
cameras messenger for that peak design
so yeah but anyway yeah well we're
probably going to need stuff like that
as we figure out how to streamline all
these designs and that's the reason why
I don't think CES gave us any real
indication that these trends like
foldables or actually good Idol I don't
think they're gone I don't think they're
gonna go anywhere and it's great I mean
I love that they're experimenting with
the technology because it might lead to
something else yeah I mean if you think
about it the iPhone was the result of a
tablet project hmm you know Apple was
working on a tablet project three to
four years prior to the launch of the
iPhone and then they were like you know
what this is a nice idea but it would be
great if we had this on a phone hmm yeah
and so that's how the that's how the
modern smartphone was born it was so
fine there there is no reason for this
product to exist right now but it could
lead to something eventually
yeah I agree now and that's what I
that's one looking forward to and that's
the reason why like I said like I I
applaud yeah sounds like right in my
face and that's why I applaud where
we're going right now in terms of just
like what they're going back to normal
phones I have to agree yeah where we
were going right now we finally got a
look and the videos been up for a bit
now we finally got a look at a real punt
hole punch punch hole something like
that by the way phone manufacturers
thank you so much for picking the worst
name for it because the YouTube
algorithm immediately Flags videos with
the word hold because they assume that
it's going to be inappropriate yeah so
thank you for that yeah phone
manufacturers one of the worst things
you
could have done for us youtubers so
that's why the video says goodbye knotch
I couldn't say hole-punch is here yeah
because it warns me that whole depending
on what the algorithm thinks it might be
monetize the video anyway we got a look
at our first punch hole display and that
would be the honor of u-20 yeah um we
have I have it in the bag and we're
gonna do our full review are you gonna
go to the launch do you know yet or are
you deciding it now it's too tight okay
because there's a lot going on too tight
I mean there's a lot going on and to be
fully honest with you I like Michael
Fisher's uh we had a good conversation
with him and he was like dude I need to
learn to say no to all the travel yeah
yeah because if I have to define how
much or what how is this turning over I
can't really say that it's becoming
beneficial for me it's very hard to say
no to travel because I love to travel
yeah Sam um and it also leads to great
opportunities to - I love going to
briefings and I love going to briefings
because you get to meet the people that
design the product and it's not like
when you stand in a presentation and
whenever you watch a keynote this
presentation was designed for consumers
it wasn't designed for press and so I
love going to briefings because that was
designed for us and and and so we get to
have a real conversation we get to ask
real questions and we get to provide a
more educated opinion whenever we review
the product or tell you about it and so
that's the reason why I love to take
these trips because you get the
opportunity to spend some time with
these people and sometimes in an
informal in an informal environment
which makes them loosen up and tell you
even more about why this product came to
be yeah you know sometimes and and it's
the reason why it's I have a really hard
time bashing products um I will be very
critical and tell you like the keyboard
on the on the pixel slate is terrible um
and but it's just when you get to learn
when you get to learn the amount of work
that goes into a product in all the
stages that a product goes into it's
very hard for you to just come to
companies and be like your product is
trash yeah I mean how many phones have
you built
Josh exactly I mean I mean we know
people who do that though they just come
right in and they're like this is just
not
good yeah you know and that kind of
feedback is important to them but you
gotta find a way to say it so that it's
not just well it it's the more you learn
why I mean I think every company would
like to create the perfect product oh
yeah
but every company has either a defined
budget or constraints in material or
they can't secure enough chips for the
man of their project picture you know it
says it's just so many hurdles in the
industry but you you get to learn it's
not empathy but you get to to understand
more of where the product is going and
again it just helps you provide a more
educated opinion about it
mm-hmm yeah and that doesn't mean that
we don't say what we want of it oh my
god no we do there were plenty of those
opportunities during this trip as well
because we were hanging out with a lot
of people but I will say the going back
to our topic
we have the Vanar of you 20 I hope the
video looks okay with the Sun right in
our faces but there's only one way to
find out my friend I think we're okay I
think we are yeah the GoPro Hero 7 by
the way which is what we're using to
record the video portion of this podcast
it does a pretty good job so hopefully
it's safe you have two black and I
couldn't get the black that gave me the
silver I knew I needed to like get this
I get I get it it's just you can replace
the battery on the silver in some like
you know that the battery on your
product is trash and I'm not I'm like
you can't bash products but yes now I
have to say right there that battery on
that camera is trash and I can replace
the battery like seriously we have a we
have a straight-up like desert road trip
look to us right now in the video I bet
so if you're listening to this right now
you're gonna want to watch the video
because this is one of the most unique
I've been trying my best I have like as
unique podcast as I possibly can this is
definitely one of them sure okay so
going back to the honour view 20 by the
way why is it V 20 in some places and
then interview 2000 companies tailor
their products to market I mean they
even launched it with different specs in
different areas it's crazy you know it's
crazy right but what we have here is a
very high powered device you obviously
have the the latest snap drag
you had that 48 megapixel Snapdragon
latest cure oh sorry I don't know why
but in my head I crossed the - yes
you're right the Kirin 980 polygons that
the latest Sony sensor that 48 minutes
yeah that's what I want to try out yeah
I hate you right now
it comes like it comes with the it comes
with also that 3d camera on the back
that uh what do they call it a time of
flight camera time of flight camera yes
cuz I but we're gonna have to see what
it is yeah you could do 3d modeling with
the phone but I mean we all know we all
know that that doesn't always translate
to like an actual user experience true
that um but on top of that there's this
display and the display itself is like
what 6 point something inches and it's
really it's a really nice display yeah
that has this tiny hole at the top now
my number-one concern about these whole
displays these punch hole displays was
that that actual hole was going to be
too close to the back button of many
Android apps how is the experience been
for you it's been good because of the
punch hole is it's small they did they
they're making a big deal about the fact
that this punch hole is so small
compared to what other punch holes will
will be or are and it's nestled right in
the notification area interesting that's
where they put it and if anyone died of
into the the deep settings of Android
the latest version of Android oh yeah
you can see it in the pixels a developer
setting yes you can see where the
notches are meant to be so it makes
sense that they were able to like put it
in nestled in that corner yeah so
hopefully everyone else follows suit but
if their holes are bigger it might pose
a bit of a problem
it's been fine honestly it's been fine I
have to say the punch hole I will get
used to way quicker than I did for the
batch do I love it still remains to be
seen like I haven't come across any
content that it would actually cut and
if you obviously if you hide the notch
quote-unquote or hide the whole corner
quo it's still called notch though in
the settings because they don't have a
name they don't have a name for a whole
yet yeah um when you hide the notch in
this device it just goes right all
content just renders below the
notification Infinity oh yeah Oh
rather so we have that first look I
would love for you to like you know
we're gonna be hanging out a little bit
I'll make sure you get some time with it
but I'm gonna be doing the floor review
on it oh look at this look at this
blessing of a thank you for of a big rig
in front of us
[Laughter]
but yeah the I'm gonna start tailgating
this big rig just so just for the show
he's slow no no kidding
I'll go around a little bit but we
should probably stay behind it for a bit
yeah so that was our first look and that
was a mean one which is funny because um
wasn't it Hisense who actually had a
phone at their booth that he did they
didn't I didn't have the time to go look
at it
I was just alright so what uh one of our
sponsors for this trip was hi since but
before we accepted the sponsorship I was
like I first I need to see your product
um okay they're android tvs or they're
really good
obviously my impression is just from the
show floor okay so it's not a final
product yet I mean they're not launching
until May and June but they're they have
a proprietary u LED technology that oh
my god like reds are red blacks or
blacks um and I just I never took
Android TV seriously because it always
seemed like sort of a like a bloated
version of something that just I don't
know and we'd also seems somewhat
bastardized compared to real exactly
yeah and so now it's not that it's like
if they grab the user interface of the
Google Home Hub and they turn that
interface so you can control your home
from your television because it behaves
like a home hub um obviously you can
talk to your assistant through the
control and there are a ton of
applications because obviously there is
a platform for it now and so I was just
reach the blend of both things because
the other thing is my biggest problem
with with Smart TVs I have a Roku TCL oh
nice it sucks really it got it minds
okay and Here I am saying that I
shouldn't bash products but I bought
this TV and he said well you know what
just to be just to be fair I'm new to
TVs because I've been working for six
years it's probably the one that I
bought you know I didn't go all it all
expensive with that 50-inch that I
bought so it's a 1080p variant it's just
the user interface of Roku is very
sluggish okay it is very clunky I'll
give that I'll give that it is very
clunky and so for me it's frustrating to
be like you know just pressing the
buttons and it doesn't move and it's
that and it just really upsets me yeah
and so I I was like okay so I want to
try android TV on your least expensive
tia television and so they took me to
the a h8f on android TV
it's a 399 television in 4k which that's
how much I paid for my TCL in 1080p Jude
no lag nice no lag and so I'm like okay
uh okay I'll do the video how how much
is that thing 399 - what okay 399 4k you
led
Wow I'm down for that's what I'm saying
yeah yeah that's what I'm saying man I'm
like how can I not sound like a fanboy
of this video hard but it's just their
product was really good yeah you know
and they're they it's I was doing
research on them they've been in the
market for 50 years it's just they've
been more noti'm in the past and now
they're bringing in their own Frank
pretty much like what HTC did pretty
much like what wall we did at some point
as well and so you know I was like am I
gonna get a unit for everything like
sure sure
I can't wait ah there there there punch
hole phone was called au 30 you may not
you may not even hear about this phone
no neither did we until we just walked
around the booth and just looked like Oh
a lot of people made disappointing
comments like the fact that it was using
Samsung's 48 megapixel I don't remember
Samsung launching a forty eight
megapixel sensor there that's the thing
with sony has and that's yeah that's the
things these companies sometimes don't
really have ducks in a row wait I
remember now yes I did cover it in the
daily but a while ago that you thirty
you mean yeah yeah a while oh good what
so then yeah we're in the know at least
but I mean it's obviously it's not gonna
be a splash of a phone no not the way
that the view 20 was not the way that
the Flex PI was and then there were a
few other phones on the on the show
floor that we kind of came across one in
particular so you got a look at the
Nubia oh yes
yeah the dual screen once I finally saw
the video I was on the case yeah I
should have gone yeah okay so it does
not look like a cheap phone yeah it
looks like an expensive phone and I I
just I don't know if I like the idea of
dual screen I the good thing is you
would not be able to tell that it has
two screens unless you tried to take a
selfie or you activate it like it looks
like a regular phone without bezels then
that's just that you grab it and it
looks like a regular phone without
bezels but then when you activate the
secondary display it turns on and it's
you know it's not the sharpest display
in the world but I don't care I hate
selfie cameras so this is like the
perfect solution for a selfie camera
yeah you remember I mean
we've seen companies fumble with like
rotating cameras for the longest time
and stuff like that I will try which I
honestly miss yes now I don't think that
the secondary display should be as large
as it is I mean it serves very little
functionality I mean if they gave me
like a small little heads-up display but
look below the camera or something like
that or a square you know what's the
phone that did that right um they call
it the he says the sleeve she Oh a sharp
yes yeah I was sharp there you go yeah
he says asleep she loved that thing she
would be able to say like that um but
it's a small little screen that just
shows you your face yeah well you know
what I did see I'm to remember who had
it oh that's one of the okay this this
show was a major win in all fronts not
only for Pocket now but also for myself
there's one company that I did not get
to see I think it does he pop suck it I
gotta go oh I'm so sorry oh no don't
worry I didn't know where they were
um I shall run around showstoppers Mart
of try to find them you can have all the
pops off as you want I uh I saw someone
have a pop socket where the actual like
disc in the pop socket was a mirror
that's a perfect idea okay that's a good
idea yeah that's a great idea and that's
good for like the selfies and one on
anyway I digress but like VEVO did that
concept too right they have the rear
screen yeah they even have a ring light
around the thing and it's it's it's
funny how things are getting so weird oh
you want to hear weird I love it you
want to hear weird grab a Sony Xperia z3
on its default settings and try to take
a selfie if the beauty find the
beautifying modes are set by default one
of these is how is it like face ah like
it makes your face slimmer yeah which I
totally need it makes your eyes bigger
I'm like oh look like an anime character
I literally look like the aliens that
were in the store that we just have we
went to alien jerky oh my god which is
why we have the root beers in the first
place yes indeed
but yeah it's it I love where the
experimentation is going I just hate
that one particular design is going to
become the de-facto and that's the whole
punch we're gonna lose the slider before
I had it heyday yes I don't mind losing
the slider Oh honestly I don't mind
losing this I don't mind losing the
slider unless you do it like vivo
because but it was so the problem is
it's it's not water resistant I know and
for me I value water resistance more
than a selfie camera okay that's then
that's fair I I think that's that's a
that's a perfectly good reason yeah
because the water resistance ipera
certifications are almost like there's
almost system I would rather deal with
the punch hole I mean come on essential
did it okay I mean essential was pretty
much the company that came up with the
concept of the knotch yes um and then
everybody else followed in their own way
this is just another notch man I'll put
up with it I don't care just give me a
water-resistant phone okay that's what I
want you know these are things that I do
value okay fair enough
this might be a slightly shorter podcast
considering we have daylight kind of
escaping us so for the last like 15 20
at the most any of
highlights from CES as a whole you
always tell me you don't like Vegas I
don't I never have I love it I love
Vegas you're young that's why well maybe
that's part of it but I do think that
Vegas is just like it's one of those
places where you could wake up in the
morning and if you want to do something
you can do it aside from go to the beach
they like a fake beach beach for you oh
yeah I mean you could go to a beach club
which all I mean I've never done because
I don't have the body for it but I
digress um the the thing is that the
resources in Vegas are so vast that
that's the reason why it's a perfect
place for a convention sure though you
can go places you have transportation
that's easy we didn't get to do any
self-driving cars some taxis no I tried
I tried the lifts I I accepted the whole
program where you can do the
self-driving lifts but I never you never
got was never received by one I think
Jules did and I would love Jules did
that's true
yeah I want I wonder what his experience
was he said mostly his his post on
Instagram which Jules is probably
pulling up right now I he said that the
trip was mostly done by the self-driving
not the entirety yeah so they probably
had to like take control at some point
yeah how are you on the so as far as not
just like how you feel but also um are
we as a let's say brand gonna be looking
into stuff like automotive and
self-driving and autonomous vehicles I I
do I do feel so it's just obviously
right now we're a very small team
smaller than ever so we're gonna need a
lot and we're gonna believe a larger
team to be able to cover all the
technology that's coming
I do feel we will it's just right now
again this vehicles are in a level of
experimentation that's you know not
necessarily even close to its full
potential yeah I mean particularly when
it comes to self-driving cars there is a
lot more to go
mm-hmm a lot more to go did you ever did
you ever check out like a Tesla or
anything like that yeah
okay yeah one of my buddies just got one
and I want to make a video so bad really
yeah but did you feel about all of that
type of word what do that tech is going
cuz automotive has a big presence I see
yes I again man I Drive a Honda Accord
the latest model in New York um and even
that cruise control in that car is
pretty much a self-driving car already I
mean to a certain degree it detects what
cars in front of you
it will literally maintain a distance
from it it'll detect the road it'll
steer it'll do pretty much everything in
cruise control except change lanes I
mean that's if that car can do that
without all the cameras and all the
technology the Tesla's have you know I
think it's fascinating it's just there's
so much work and then you know obviously
there will be the naysayers that believe
that the best thing is to have somebody
on the wheel which by the way the person
that's talking to you right now
I already had an accident because I fell
asleep on the wheel all right and I put
a lot of people in danger because of the
the reckless driving that I did that day
because I was totally tired and so to be
fully honest with you would I have
wished to have a self-driving module in
my car back then I was driving ten hours
with my son in the car and I put his
life in danger because I didn't choose
to just stop and not drive so do I want
self-driving cars I do do I want
self-driving Ebers no because honestly
they provide jobs
hmm okay they provide new new levels of
income and I think it's unfair for a
company to just do you imagine like
everybody that already has a car having
a car and then self-driving cars as well
and and like they're only gonna congest
the the road a lot more and it's less
people making income only to make
somebody's some CEO but the person in
that in the seat for emergencies like
they're good right now yes but the whole
idea is that eventually the person is to
be removed that's the problem that's
true
and said so for me it's like alright I
don't need to help the CEO buy a new
yacht economies need people to have jobs
in uber uber and lyft have been a good
way to mediate some of that over the
last couple of years as jobs in this
country haven't been great mm-hmm all
right so I I will support the
self-driving technology I will not
support it in any way well where will
reduce income in in people's pockets
that's just me that's my political I
know for me I guess other technologies
that I liked I love the laptops that
Huawei mate book 13 mmm-hmm I love that
I'm getting one very soon well done sir
dude I really that make book X Pro man
it's it's really it wasn't it was our
favorite laptop last year I mean and
people can say whatever they want about
Huawei sure that they sponsor some of
our content again we wouldn't have
accepted the sponsorships to the daily
of their products would have been great
yeah what was the best smartphone camera
of last year well I'm sure people will
argue that it's the pixel 3xl for me
it's not for me it's to may 20 Pro hmm
they're in a dead heat for me they're
not absolute dead heat and yeah
definitely like while we was putting on
some amazing stuff they're even trying
to make sure that tablets are still a
thing yeah oh my god so I love like I
honestly I would love to give my kids
those tablets because there's a kid's
mode and then there's the regular mode
and what defines it is the fingerprint
scanner so I don't have to worry about
my kids going into my you know whatever
history or or for them to have access to
applications that I don't want because
Android is not necessarily the best when
it comes to parental controls I have to
give that crown to iOS okay and so I
love that Huawei is
taking that to another level I feel that
that's the way it should be I honestly I
have a hard time giving my kids
technology because of that because I
can't fully control what they do
hmm how about as far as tablets go I got
a good look at this and again there's
gonna be a video I'm talking now about
it
lenovo did bring out another tablet now
I got a little disappointed because it's
so Amazon forward true
I like Google assistant better to be
honest and also for the next five
minutes we have to be careful not to say
hot words right but basically what they
created was a tablet 10 inch tablet that
goes into a smart dock yeah that is a
speaker and when you put it in it
becomes a show yeah becomes an echo show
is that is that one of the highlights
quartz okay yeah I liked it
I think it's cool and I I like the
concept of it I like the idea the smarts
the the smart dog can be a speaker when
you're not using it as a show yeah
that's the cost of that I want to see
and speaking of docks or base stations
that can be used without a display that
LG rollable TV
now oh I didn't see that I see it so the
rodent will what I love where that was
their protector their wall projectors is
this thing that you could just place
very like a foot away from the wall and
it projects up to it
oh that any sort of aberration or
anything it's fantastic nice but tell me
about that rollable because we thought
we saw the concept but now we have the
product now we have the product and the
thing that I loved about it is that they
found practical ways of using it in
different configurations like for
example instead of instead of it being
like a wallpaper TV that has a cord
coming out of it and it goes into like
this big piece of tech that's is still
bulky it's all one big thing so what
happens is it'll can it can actually
roll all the way in and it rolls all the
way out but you can also roll about a
third of the way and it becomes an
interface for the speaker interesting
you can also have it do ambient stuff
like maybe you want a fireplace it'll
show a fireplace and you can hear it
coming out of the speakers when it's
rolled all the way down that does it
also heat the place maybe that maybe
that skeuomorphism at its finest and so
the when it's rolled all the way into
the base station that whole thing can be
used as a smart speaker as well say the
same concept but when it's when it comes
out it's just the OLED goodness that you
always love from LG and it's as
beautiful the beautiful display mmm
thing now put that right up against the
micro LEDs from Samsung oh yeah I did
not know much about micro LEDs until
this show yeah I'm not going to use
there's only one way to find out and I
mean why not yeah that's true why not
now let me ask you this what did you
think about fossil I I oh yeah yeah it
was a good briefing that was a really
good briefing um I okay so I'm actually
kind of excited would this help these
lights at least one of them no both of
them whatever yeah what I find think
this would help yeah I think it's fun
that I think what I what I'm excited
about is the truck lane I think it's
exciting that smartwatches are more or
less making a bit of a resurgence I will
I would not really I would not really
tribute that to where OS 2.0 no but I
also have to admit that where where OS
2.0 is a vast improvement from anything
that came before it
it's a better user interface that still
requires oh my god am I the only person
like I've been using this what this
fossil queue Explorer HR um and I'm
honestly I have like I told them because
they they asked me like genuinely how do
you feel about that watch and I'm like
the battery life man of course my sign
is a single night no smile my watch is
dead yeah every like we start the day at
10:00 a.m. and by 9:00 p.m. it's dead
yeah I mean come on man I and then they
come up with a 3100 which they're not
really fully adopting except on the
sport and the battery life is also bad
yeah I mean okay and that's one of my
problems the battery life I just
resigned myself to they're not gonna
it's not gonna get figured out for a
while yes but then you've got Apple and
Samsung with their offerings figuring it
out yeah they're trying to Italy okay so
here's the thing I have a problem with
where OS not just in the battery life
this has been the first time that I've
been using where OS non-stop for a month
because I'm doing the google fit
challenge clearly Vegas didn't help I'm
sorry about that
I'll get back as of tomorrow but the
thing about it is dude that user
interface is so clunky it makes sense to
me but it's clunky yeah if I'm training
oh my god I like sometimes I want to
pause my workout and I can't because
it's it's stuck and it's it's refreshing
and it's like and so your tits it you
know we were at the presentation from
Qualcomm for the 3100 yep and then you
get the the presenter saying no this is
the perfect chip we don't need to do
anything with it all we needed to do is
add a module for it to be more power
efficient whenever you're not using the
watch and I'm like you're wrong you're
wrong where OS is a clunky mess
well where OS aside what a what I really
enjoy about smartwatches right now is
that we're finally at a place where the
actual watchmakers themselves kind of
clued into it like what if we have the
watches that people love from us just
connected and we had a whole generation
of them last year that came out that
yeah kind of a lukewarm response people
kind of liked it but now they're going
all in with like a second gen they
really want to make the body smaller
they want to make them accessible to
everybody so yeah there's a lot of
choice now and that's exactly what
smartwatches needed yeah but you needed
a no DM like fossil you need you needed
them as he's needed that because fossil
has so many brands Michael Kors Kate
Spade exactly you know they've got
Skagen they're doing they're still doing
hybrids I yeah you know it's just funny
I've been trying to use the krona be
mm-hmm
Crona be sent me their most beautiful
watch my biggest problem with with uh
with these hybrids is I am so used to
being able to see the time in the dark
with the always-on displays at the
moment that I go back to a regular watch
and I can't see the time because it
doesn't really glow in the dark that
much yeah I feel it feels weird to me
now I've been using smartwatches as the
original pebble it's it's kind of hard
for me to go back yeah III don't believe
me they're my favorite thing about
hybrid watches which the reason why that
I really love them is because it's that
entry point that I think people overlook
you know if you're just a timepiece fan
then you have options you can get a
timepiece it just also happens to do
extra stuff you can I just I that kudos
to you though fossil for really brick
for you continue to push and it's great
it up to us to educate about hybrids but
as far as far as actual like full-on
smartwatches are concerned that fall so
sports a great example of what the
future can hold it is a good example
it's just I wish that okay we have Apple
where they just came up with that s2
chip for the Apple watch series for okay
the Apple watch I will never recommend
Apple watch series one or two series
three I can if you don't get the
composite back which is in the new
generation they
swap the back and they don't tell you
yeah that's a bad move on Apple and I
call it out but if you grab an Apple
watch series three this is the first
time that I'm away from my Apple watch
and I miss it and I miss it because it
actually works you raise your wrist you
know hey whatever works you call on
whatever apps I asked for it for walking
directions it works it's tracking my
workouts you it's such a versatile watch
my problem with the Apple watch is its
durability if you're going for the
entry-level model that that aluminum
oxidate s-- so I feel that oh you know
companies need to understand that you
know people like to collect watches you
know people like to collect watches and
have more than one and so it's a problem
when you buy a watch that won't last you
more than a year or two because of the
hardware and so that's my biggest
problem with the wear OS if the
operating system is clunky operating
systems don't get less demanding over
time they get more demanding yeah and so
in batteries the problem with these
lithium lithium ion batteries is that
they degrade over time and so you
something someone has to find the
solution for a timepiece that can be a
little more timeless than what some our
watches are currently because it's very
hard to tell people oh yeah pay $400 for
a watch that's not gonna work well two
years from now yeah I agree I agree you
know yeah I do need to give one shout
out to another smart watch we have take
using the tick watch right where's my
sample tick watch Bob boy was out in the
sand but oh you finally I understand how
you pronounced that yeah ma boy ma boy
ma boys finally not finally ma boy was
out in the sands with their booth and
they had a lot of stuff to show and they
announced the updated versions of their
tech watch s and E now let me preface
this real quick like I'm gonna have some
content on these watches so you can stay
tuned for that there's not only the tick
watch S or the e there's also the
earlier take watch see the c2 is the one
that ISA is wearing because it's the
most fashion-forward one of the bunch
it's the highest not the highest end
model because that's the pro but it
definitely looks more fashion-forward
than the one I'm wearing which is the e
- yeah this is the point of the s and
the e -
super low barrier of entry into a
SmartWatch true these are these are sub
$200 and they they'd they're not they're
not really any amazing bells and
whistles or anything like that but it's
a great showcase oh it's good design
exactly I mean I love the tick watch Pro
yeah the trick watch pros is is
definitely up there these you may not
feel that way because they are thick
they are large bodies they're
polycarbonate yeah but they're light you
they're they're light as a feather you
know it's like it's like the old days of
the pebble when it comes to materials
yeah but it's good enough mm-hmm so if
you if you're skeptical about a
SmartWatch and you don't really know
like I actually think this is a
wonderful entry point because you don't
have to spend so much money to get like
a fossil Sport for example no um you
know so sub 200 that's this is actually
not so bad so I will you know what I
like that we ended on that because CES
is a good this was a good example of how
a category like smartwatches
they're not going away no they're not
and I'm actually kind of happy about
that or not and and just fossil they
reiterated their commitment like people
are liking smartwatches I just again
this is and I even when they asked me
for feedback I'm like okay I don't need
to give you feedback I've given Google
my feedback apparently doing the fit
with Google project they finally got the
workouts right I'm like I'm not gonna be
counting sit-ups dudes and then then
ending the workout and then counting my
push-ups on a separate workout I just
want weight weightlifting yeah I want
one module for weightlifting one module
for running one module for spinning
that's it I don't want one who's Jenna
yeah I didn't know you spin I was a
spinning instructor man what yeah I
didn't know that are you kidding me I
had no idea what would you like a class
why where'd you where would you teach ya
LA feathers if you want okay I'll think
about it uses actually been thinking
about doing some spin I mean we could
totally do Bluetooth five connect a
couple of headphones and I'll give you
the class let me go because it's all
about the music but yeah yeah I was a
spinning instructor wow that's cool had
some odd jobs but ya know here's the
thing it's it's they finally got that
Fitness part right what they need to
work on is just like
Capel with their s2 chip I'm sorry
Qualcomm you know we give you a lot of
love for certain things you do right
like 5 g and the 855 and that's all
great but your wearable approach needs
work yeah it does need work I I don't
feel that that what is it a it's a 14
nanometer chip or no it's a 20 nanometer
chip I think it's something ridiculous
like that it's all technology man I mean
and you can totally tell and how clunky
the watches are so Google is doing a
better job in fixing the user interface
OMS are doing a better job at designing
designing better smart watches but then
we don't have the most powerful chip on
these watches yeah I think that I needs
to change or even then the most
efficient chip or it could just be that
because my mom belongs on a two-sample
number haha and I wasn't able to go to
the fossil briefing and that's the
reason why I don't have a fossil sport I
just haven't experienced a 3100 that
could also be it I've heard that it
wasn't the massive leap that perhaps BAM
Qualcomm I heard it wasn't the massive
leap that everyone was expecting but it
did help a little bit but that fossil
support is definitely where we have to
try it out there's only one way to find
out that's right and on that note that
is it for now on the pocket now weekly
as the Sun is going down we have a
wonderful gradient over on the side
we're coming through I think we're in
Bakersfield Lynwood we're in we're
coming through Leo we're in Barstow
we're coming through I know is this
Barstow yeah this is Barcia yeah it is
we're coming through Barstow I don't
think we need an in-and-out run right
now we can we can get to the our final
destination and figure it out that our
next show is technically going to be MWC
but we also have some events coming up
because that Samsung has 10 in early
they may talk about that we didn't talk
about that but I'm sure there would be
plenty of time to speculate wildly let
us know what you think about that's
gonna be in our recap we did react on
the recap okay there you go yeah well
they're gonna be some thoughts on that
for sure I have one and that'll be my
hot take while we as we leave the show
the way that the invite looks that zero
looks a lot like the oculus logo doesn't
