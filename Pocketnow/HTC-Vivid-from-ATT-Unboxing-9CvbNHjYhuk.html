pocketnow.com and today we're gonna do
the unboxing for the HTC Vivid from AT&amp;amp;T
so sit back relax enjoy the show so the
HTC Vivid is a 1.2 the Earth's dual-core
processor I believe it's the scorpion
processor using a Qualcomm chipset it's
also a 4g device as you can see here on
the documentation the Quick Start Guide
here and then here's the actual phone
and then underneath here we have a wall
wart and the USB charging cable and then
some other documentation let's go ahead
we'll take a look at the phone a little
closer so the HTC Vivid has a 4.5 inch s
LCD display running 960 x 540 is the
resolution the oddball thing here is
that it's only got two hundred and sixty
two colors k 262k colors versus most
devices these days have 16 million
colors so that's going to be an
interesting twist on the device once we
really start taking a closer look at it
screen seems pretty pretty bright now
we've got the standard four buttons down
here across the bottom a little bit of a
lip going around the outside of the
display here we've got the front-facing
camera up at the top and then it's got
kind of an angled look on the sides
there and pivots background to a
hard angle on the back at the charging
port right here and then on the back
we've got a kind of metal faceplate with
a little bit of a textured bump here but
not more visual than actually providing
any grip then we got the rear facing
camera with a dual flash that rear
facing camera is an 8 megapixel on the
top here we've got the power button and
the headphone jack here in here and then
on this side we've got the volume rocker
there on the bottom nothing more there
the battery cover
slides with a little push here like this
little metal plate seems pretty solid
but it's kind of an odd build there when
I actually looked at this I kind of
wondered if that was supposed to be
looking like that we got the speaker
pour it up here and then the battery and
this is the sim card slot and then right
here is our micro SD card slot but you
can't get access to it without pulling
the battery so you can't put a new card
in there no card is included it is
expandable up to I believe 32 gigs of
the external memory ATT's documentation
says that this device has up to 16 gigs
of storage the total space on this
particular vice at least that is showing
is 8.8 3 gigabytes and with the
available space of being 8.83 and then
the phone storage internal storage I
show us three point eight two gigabytes
we're probably looking at 16 gigs total
plus whatever is used up by the OS and
you see there's no available space there
for the SD card because there's not one
installed here so then if we go here and
look at our software information we're
running Android 2 3 4 and HT sense 30 on
this particular device weight wise it's
six point two four ounces compare that
to say the samsung galaxy s2 which comes
in a much lighter 4.60 ANZ's it does
some have some heft it feels a little
odd in my hands this strong taper and
the this harsh edge here really is it a
little different after using the epic 4g
touch from sprint this is going to be an
interesting device to see how it feels
in my hand size-wise I've got very large
hand so really this is not an abnormal
screen size for me I like the display so
far that will compare the colors and
take a look at how that turns out so the
HTC Vivid does have all the typical
Wi-Fi Bluetooth
capabilities it does have an
accelerometer or a proximity sensor does
have the compass gps support I can't
find any of the documentation that says
that it has a gyroscope but we'll make
sure to test that with some of the tools
we've got to verify what it really has
as far as internals and the hardware
tour touchscreen obviously in so far it
seems to be fairly snappy but I haven't
installed anything or put any other
applications on it and we've got you
know the HTC Sense here you can slide up
and down through the apps and that wraps
up our unboxing of the HTC Vivid from
AT&amp;amp;T if you have any comments or
questions would like to look at
something specific in the hardware and
software tours leave a message below and
we'll get back to them make sure to give
us a thumbs up if you like this video
