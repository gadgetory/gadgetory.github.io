pocket now calm we've got jellybeans
running on the samsung galaxy note
doesn't make the device as fast as it's
making the 1x and the galaxy s3 and
every other device is getting the
jellybean port in this video we're gonna
find out let's do a walk-through now
this is a CyanogenMod 10 preview just
like the other previews that we've shown
you the other ports on the galaxy s3 and
the HTC One X these are all cm10
previews and the preview is there to
remind you that it's not final things
aren't going to work and so far we found
the performance and the daily usability
of the galaxy s3 cm 10 preview and the
1x CM 10 preview to be very good and the
same can be said here for the Galaxy
Note with its massive beautiful screen
now there are a few performance hiccups
right out of the bat and we'll show you
that and then we'll show you how it
looks when you're when you're doing web
browsing so here we've got a more stable
what I think is a better build of CM 10
watch this okay it's a little bit choppy
here on the galaxy note again this is
very early I think this is the second
preview available for the galaxy note so
the notes a little bit far behind but
it's going to catch up and this is going
to get awesome but if you want to use
this as your daily driver you probably
definitely could now let's go over to
pocketnow.com just get a sense for how
web browsing speed is you get all the
the advantages of jellybean with project
butter with the advance notification
shade with Google now and overall
compared to Android Ice Cream Sandwich
on the Galaxy Note it is still faster I
mean look at this it's very very
responsive there's just a few different
places like we showed going back to the
homescreen and opening the app tray
where it's not as good as some of the
other ports that we've shown you already
so let's go in to say this link and see
how long that takes and one of the
downsides is that screen rotation does
not work yet in this port so so you make
some sacrifices if you want to use
jellybean early on the Galaxy Note
probably in a week from now all of these
issues
be resolved so very smooth indeed
definitely smoother than what you would
get with stock TouchWiz and all of that
even faster than what you would get with
cm9 RC - especially in the browser maybe
not in some of the other areas of the
operating system
so overall the notes are running pretty
smooth here on jellybean it's not
perfect this is very easy to install if
you're rooted and you've got a if you've
got clockworkmod recovery installed as
your custom boot loader we'll put links
up so you can do this on your Galaxy
Note and we'll keep an eye on the
development of the note to see how this
progresses and we'll hopefully see it
getting better and better with each
passing nightly so if you hate this
video please shoot us a thumbs up and
thanks for watching
see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
