function on video rumors on the Windows
Phone tango up they begin to appear and
why can't mango update old office
documents all this and more coming up
right now have over when I'm high meadow
be better with talking I'll calm and
welcome to the Windows Phone view the
show we talk about all the things good
and bad inside the world of microsoft's
windows form platform let's start this
week off with a good alright so we'll
start off with what's got everybody
crazy lately and it's these videos of
nokia windows phones coming up around
and even images now it's interesting
about all these designs is that it they
look look credible they look look like
nokia material but then again some of us
believe that they are fake why don't we
think they're fake ball because the
video was going well everything was nice
everything was credible but then at the
end they had this microsoft's vision of
the future for 20 19 videos that came up
years ago on youtube and you'd wonder
why did they add these videos i mean
these platform videos have nothing to do
with nokia windows phone videos so again
the designs are gorgeous we do expect
that nokia at least hires the guys are
designed these phones but sadly we do
think they're fake if they are not fake
and hopefully I'm wrong than yes we do
have some really good phones coming up
in the future hopefully we do see really
good things on our cat 17 but we have
this nokia windows event that's being
planned okay so wait a second Windows
Phone 7 mango isn't out on the streets
yet and already we're hearing about this
Windows Phone 7 tango or should we say
Windows Phone tango we're not really
sure if it's going to be a 7 after that
but it does seem that Microsoft loves
things that are exotic not necessarily
fruits for these names because we got
mango and now we got tango but we're
going to cut that argument off because
the next generation OS is going to be
called Apollo whoever comes up with
these names but anyways they're already
rumors of a windows phone 7 tango in the
mix and it seems that it has a lot to do
with making the OS friendlier for
cheaper hardware now you'd wonder why
but remember Nokia's king of feature
phones and there are room
or confirmation should I say the nokias
bring out all their Symbian phones from
the US market because they're going to
focus on Windows phones now obviously
they're not only going to offer Windows
Phone 7 devices because they're
obviously not affordable to the whole
market so it's interesting to see what
Nokia will bring to the table with tango
probably some cheaper Hardware cheaper
phones probably a different UI something
different elements but still Nokia
hardware with Windows Phone hardware
software I mean interesting okay so i
must admit many of us were disappointed
with motorola when they confirmed that
they were not going to be supporting
when those phones on the initial release
though we gotta admit that Motorola's
doing a great job in putting android on
the map with their droid lineup now
imagine that droid hardware with some
Metro UI must seem fantastic so it seems
interesting that their CEO just came on
record recently mentioning that they are
actually open to adopting Windows Phone
as long as Microsoft could cut them a
deal that's different to what's
negotiated with Nokia not really sure
what they mean by that difference but
still it's interesting to see that
Motorola's open so Microsoft's really in
need of putting the platforms in the
pockets of everybody so most likely they
will come up with some sort of agreement
and let's hope it's beneficial for
everybody because yeah I would live with
I would like some motorola hardware with
some windows phone Metro UI okay so
after we reported some bad news about
skype not making it to Windows Phone 7
and having no probable release dates
rumors have it that as of mango skype
will bring some really deep integration
with Windows Phone 7 interesting though
is it's not included in beta 2 yet so
we're not sure if it'll make it to
mangalore probably some other release
afterwards but it seems that the
integration will be superior to what
we're already a custom in android and
that's kind of a tall order because
currently android offers this really
good integration with Gingerbread where
you can actually choose whether you want
to call from the land from the phone
line or from skype so really interesting
to see what they'll come up with let's
hope it doesn't only have to do with
integration with the OS or chats and
stuff like that or phone calls but also
probably bring something as more cheap
calls that what we're currently paying
on you know phone lines probably some
really good deals for windows phone 7
owners I know that'll be a massive hit
okay so that does it for the good let's
start off with what's bad sad news has
it that Windows Phone 7 mango won't be
supporting editing of Office documents
that are earlier than office 2007
meaning of your files bill men with xls
X doc X or pptx you pretty much will
only be able to view the files and not
edit them if you ask us it makes all the
sense in the world for Microsoft that go
off with the old and start off with the
new obviously they're a software company
that's after selling more copies of
their office 2010 but still you know a
lot of you will be affected by this
change so it's important for you to know
that you have to put these documents to
a new version if you want them to be
supported unless you only want to view
them and think about it I mean these
office documents that our previous to
2007 are actually larger files than the
current ones so on a office phone you
know on a smartphone where your storage
is really limited it's actually a smart
move to actually change but still not
good okay so if you all remember one of
the darkest hours of Microsoft with
their initial Windows Phone 7 release
was that the platform had issues in
logging on to yahoo servers customers
were complaining of these crazy data
plan usage fees because of obviously not
many of us have unlimited data plans
anymore and current mango beta testers
are having the same issue not
necessarily with Yahoo but it does seem
that they are having issues with the
phone coming up with some crazy data
usages not really sure what to make of
it yet because it's still a beta so
Microsoft still has time to fix this
problem though it's a word of warning if
you're using the data to look out for
your data plan usages probably just look
out for them because probably you could
come up with some surprises obviously we
do hope that Microsoft deals with it in
time for the official release that's it
for today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm high middle you better
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now
