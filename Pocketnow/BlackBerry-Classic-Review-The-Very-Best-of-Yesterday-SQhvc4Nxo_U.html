is an invitation to be interrupted
you're bound to be asked by some
well-meaning friend or nosy stranger is
that a BlackBerry do people still use
those
and while the answer to that question is
an unqualified yes the more interesting
question is what's that like
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and i
spent a couple weeks finding out this is
our video review of the blackberry
classic this review was made possible by
the folks at gsm nation offering
unlocked smartphones and top-tier
customer service at gsm nation.com and
by US mobile providing simple
fully-customizable wireless service at
NGO us mobile.com as its name implies
the blackberry classic is meant to evoke
the best of times gone by for berry
heads it's heavy chassis combines cool
metal rubberized plastic and Gorilla
Glass 3 for a package that feels
high-quality durable and above all
important in the hand even tiny details
like the travel and feedback of the
metal side Keys contribute to the
premium feel it's like a moleskin of
smartphones an instantly recognizable
institution that commands respect
if largely from the old-school in the
best tradition of a blackberry this
feels like a handset for work for
getting things done when the little red
light starts flashing central to that
perception is the 35 key backlit
keyboard one of the only physical
keyboards you can find on the market and
almost certainly the best this of course
is BlackBerry's bread-and-butter a
keyboard for pounding out everything
from emails to essays and while I'm
still faster on a touchscreen I find I'm
often happier typing on the classic
physical Keys lets you type by feel and
the tactility of the whole experience
elicits a sense of the familiar a
comfort that modern touchscreens just
can't reproduce and even if you're not
susceptible to such romantic notions
there's a practical advantage here to
the BlackBerry trackpad has made its
return as part of the resurrected tool
belt even after so many years of
touchscreen dominance it's still easier
and faster to visit
a cursor or highlight text with the
trackpad like the physical keyboard
itself it may seem like an anachronism
but it's actually a very useful tool for
those whose mobile lives hinge on the
typed word of course the touchscreen
still persists and here we see the
classic fall more in line with modern
concepts if not modern specs the LCD is
small a 3.5 inch perfect square at 720
by 720 not exactly ideal for the
widescreen world of media consumption
but serviceable for everything else and
sitting behind it is the same processor
we saw in the blackberry q10 backed up
by the same basic memory loadout yep for
the most part this is a spec sheet from
2 years ago
classic indeed but blackberry fans
hoping for a full-on throwback won't
find the stodgy software of old running
on the classic is the latest build of
the new BlackBerry OS and that's both
good news and bad on the positive side
the software is very fluid and in terms
of animations quite responsive
considering the older hardware it's
running on active apps are contained
within frames on the home screen which
can be closed or kept running a handy
feature for those who like to leave a
youtube video playing in the background
to the right set the cascading pages of
apps and to the left the BlackBerry hub
a unified inbox for every single
notification no matter what happens from
conceptually speaking the hub is still
the smartest part of the new BlackBerry
OS as with the hardware the classics
software shines brightest when it
leverages the keyboard you can unlock
the phone with two key presses rather
than relying on the lock button or a
screen swipe just start typing on the
home screen to jump right into Universal
Search scroll webpages emails or social
feeds a page at a time with the spacebar
or turn a page in Kindle the same way
jump to the top or bottom of lists with
T and B search a web page for a specific
word with s the list goes on
pair some of these shortcuts with other
BlackBerry conveniences like the
browser's no frills reader mode and you
get an interface that's refreshingly
devoid of gimmicks or tricks at its best
the BlackBerry user experience is one of
powerful
simplicity but BlackBerry 10 isn't at
its best in a critical area apps it's
commendable that the classic comes
loaded with both blackberry world and
the Amazon Appstore and it's awesome
that you can sideload almost any Android
app you want but compatibility isn't
synonymous with quality here running
Android apps within blackberry 10 is a
sluggish buggy experience at every level
from installation to everyday use that's
a natural consequence of running Android
apps on a non native platform with older
hardware but it can be very frustrating
if you're used to more powerful
mainstream smartphones even outside the
Android runtime BlackBerry 10 just isn't
a fast OS the BlackBerry hub still drags
its feet on tasks as simple as opening
messages or marking items as read and
Facebook Messenger is so slow to update
conversations within the hub that it's
almost unusable Universal search one of
my favorite features of the platform is
prone to missing the first few
keystrokes if you're in a hurry even
apps coded for BlackBerry 10 like
Twitter and Evernote are much slower
than their Android iOS and Windows
counterparts and you can forget about
hardcore multitasking grinding the
classic to a halt is as easy as trying
to snap a photo while you're streaming a
podcast through stitcher even if you
really want to like this device
shortcomings as fundamental as these
don't make it easy
once again the ship starts to write
itself when we return to the
fundamentals I tested the blackberry
classic in both Las Vegas and Greater
Boston over the course of two weeks us
mobiles connectivity is provided by
t-mobile us and aside from a capacity
crunch at CES the network's coverage and
data speeds have been impressive and the
BlackBerry hasn't had any trouble
holding on to signal be it 3G LTE Wi-Fi
or the Bluetooth connection that powers
my LG tones phone calls are bright and
clear on the earpiece with ample side
tone that evokes memories of old
landline telephones speakerphone
performance is loud and clear as well
there's not much to say about the 8
megapixel camera except you'll want to
keep a steady hand while shooting
autofocus is not the fastest colors can
be quite saturated and rather nice and
good lighting turn the lights down and
you get the usual digital noise creeping
in along with diminishing saturation and
an even slower focus performance one
notable thing about the viewfinder
software is that it'll auto detect
challenging lighting conditions and
suggest HDR automatically also it's got
a time shift mode to compensate for a
blinking or talking subject take the
BlackBerry home or back to the office
after shooting a few photos and you can
use the BlackBerry blended software to
view the photos on your computer then
check your calendar for your next
appointment and even tap into your hub
to answer the emails you missed it's a
lot like Motorola's connect or a pared
down version of AirDroid and it's
convenient if you do spend a lot of time
in your desk though I wish the file
manager made it easier to bulk transfer
media finally battery life seems fairly
typical for a 2500 milliamp hour battery
a BlackBerry's estimate of 22 hours of
mixed usage seems ambitious but I never
had trouble getting through a full day
even with fairly heavy use during my
time with the blackberry classic I took
pages and pages of notes over several
days and one of the world's biggest
technology shows I juggled traffic from
two email accounts as well as Facebook
and Twitter and used blackberry
messenger to keep in touch with my
iPhone Android and Windows Phone toting
teammates I kept the calendar in sync
took the occasional phone call kept an
eye on the weather
watched the odd video and even read most
of a novel in short I used the
blackberry classic for work about 80% of
the time and that's when it was at its
best in this respect the BlackBerry
diehards who shut down criticism by
saying it's not a toy it's a tool well
they have a point for a consumer who
wants a modern smartphone with all the
trimmings the classic is not the right
choice hell it's not even the wrong
choice it's a terrible one but for the
shrinking pool of workers for whom a
blackberry is an employer issued
accessory meant
to help get the job done and nothing
more the classic is exactly what it
needs to be and nothing more if you're
gonna be stuck in the past by personal
choice or by employer decree there's no
better smartphone to do it with than the
blackberry classic once again this
review was made possible thanks to a
device loan from GSM nation and us
mobile pay them a visit in the links at
the description below and be sure to
check out pocket now's other recent
reviews in the links above until next
time this has been michael fisher with
pocket now captain to phones on twitter
