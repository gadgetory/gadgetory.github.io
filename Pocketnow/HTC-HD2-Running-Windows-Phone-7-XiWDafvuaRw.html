pocketnow.com they said it could not be
done but we held on to our hope the HTC
hd2 can now run Windows Phone 7
seriously let's take a look so this is
thanks to the dark forces team it takes
a few steps to get this working but when
you get it working it works great let's
show it to you from beginning to end
here so we're gonna start up the hd2 and
just hold down the start button and it's
gonna kind of go through a bunch of
different screens it's going to go
through a special bootloader and it's
actually going to go into a Windows
Phone 7 faster then it will go into any
other operating system and this device
the hd2 is turning out to be probably
the most versatile device on the planet
you can run Android on this Windows
Mobile or Windows Phone 7 you can also
run Mego Ubuntu other operating systems
that are Linux based it's a really it's
really an amazing device so here you
have it Windows Phone 7 is working in
full glory this is literally Windows
Phone 7 on the HTC hd2 now you may be
wondering how do the buttons work since
Windows Phone 7 devices require those
three buttons and here on the hd2 we
have five well here is how it works the
button on the right here is power
standby so it turns off the device
obviously we'll slide that up
performance is very good by the way the
back button is still the back button the
Start button goes to the Start screen so
if we go to the calendar and we hit the
start button it's going to go back to
the Start screen the button here the
home button is actually the search
button so it's going to bring up the
Bing application here let's go back to
the Start screen and if we if we tap on
the call start button
pretty cool it's actually going to just
take you right into the camera since all
Windows Phone 7 devices have to have a
dedicated camera button so could you use
this as your full time operating system
answer is yes there are some things that
don't work but there's a lot of things
that do work you can make calls you can
go on the web you can use Wi-Fi you can
use Bluetooth in fact let's take a
little tour of what you can do here then
we'll talk about what you can't do so
we'll go into internet explorer here and
it's it's really amazing for us to see
this because a while ago when
News Phone 7 was announced there was so
much speculation on whether this would
actually work on the hd2 among other
devices most people said no but after
many many months we finally have it here
so here's pocketnow.com we are that's
something always going on outside we are
loading this over over Wi-Fi although
you can see I've got full bars on my
cell phone signal we can go into
landscape performance is as good as it
is it seems as an HD 7 or the Samsung
Focus I mean it works it works just the
same it's there's no other way of
explaining it than that so here we're
loading pocketnow.com and if we go back
into portrait we can open up multiple
tabs and sort of click around and do
that sort of thing so let's go back to
the Start screen and move around more
you saw it before the camera so I'm
gonna go back into it again so we can
take a picture of the the wood here so
there you go got the same same photo
features as you have in Windows Phone 7
on any other device you can swipe to the
right get the basic built-in
applications you can sync this up with
your email you can send text messages go
into the calculator it works if we go
into I keep hitting the home button
thinking that it's gonna take me home
but it actually takes you to the Bing
application Maps works just fine so you
can find yourself would allow them Bing
to use my location and yes it's working
there you go there's my location so what
doesn't work on here well anything that
requires a synchronization or
communication with Microsoft's clouds so
the app marketplace unfortunately does
not work you plug in your Windows Live
ID and it says we can't activate your
device so that means also that Zune
doesn't work the Xbox features don't
work so hopefully in the future that
those things are fixed because those are
pretty important to the core experience
of Windows Phone 7 but if you're trying
to just get a feel for Windows Phone 7
on your HD 2 and use all the basic
features plus email and calls and text
messages this works just great we're
going to post full instructions on
pocketnow.com on how to do this
it only takes about 10 minutes if you
know how to do a few things that will
make it easy for you but really really
really exciting news that when
phone 7:00 finally is on the HTC hd2
it's a good thing to have hope please
thumbs up this video if you liked it and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
