and fitness solutions to vive virtual
reality at the Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona but the company that got its
start in smartphones has a new one
coming to Europe I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is a quick hands-on
with the HTC One X 9 brought to you by D
brand
if you've spent any time with the HTC
One a9 the 1x9 will be familiar it's
metal chassis bears the same rounded
corners and a metamorphic finish it
really just a fancy name for HTC special
blend of tone and texturing that gives
the metal a soft almost velvety feel in
hand around back the camera is
emphasized with a pillow like protrusion
but it's the same camera as the one on
the one a9 a 13 megapixel F 2.0 shooter
with second-generation OIS around front
both the video and audio have gotten a
boost over the a9 the display is a
larger 5.5 inch full HD Super LCD panel
while the speakers have seen a return to
boom sound they're once again front
firing drivers with Dolby audio and we
tested them in a pretty loud room they
definitely brought the noise HTC has
also returned two capacitive keys for
the x9 which will either please you or
it won't
rounding out the phone is Android M
running on a mediatek x10 with three
gigs of RAM a 5-megapixel selfie camera
dual SIM support and microSD expansion
all of it powered by a 3000 milliamp
hour battery it all adds up to a phone
that feels just like what it is an
oversized One a9 with a hard ear spec
sheet the x9 launched in China late last
year and it'll be available across
Europe later this month in four colors
no word on pricing but given its release
price of around $370 u.s. unlocked in
China it's probably not going to break
