packing.com I'm here with our first
hands-on video of the Dell Venue 11 Pro
the
okay so this is a new Windows 8.1 tablet
we have a full HD IPS this is alloy
you have olympus and 20 inch
and let's take a look there's a core i3
or Core i5 processor
let's see if we can get some we're in
test mode right now
and let's see what kind of specs we have
your CPU we have two gigs of RAM seems
very like
look around it a little bit seems to be
the power but and have a camera on the
back looks like 8 megapixels
nice Dell logo Intel
this looks like it can come off but I'm
not sure if I
there's your connectors
so we can add a hard keyboard
and this is the surface of the road so
it's compared a little bit surface Pro's
much heavier and thicker it seems
and that's gonna I don't have a stylist
here but let me see if this one works
nope
and it's camera in the front
obviously if I can get a keyboard in
here
there we go
see what happened
magnetic
that's nice let's look at these keys
they are raised
and feel pretty nice
let's try it out
it feels like we could type pretty ously
with that
and look how pit it is not bad at all
sit down look up
trackpad feels pretty good
in the back
look at that starting
that we can turn that into a perfect
so that's one accessory
and there's another one that's stiffer
so here's a stiffer keyboard it's much
thicker we have battery in there
and it makes the device much heavier as
well
these are feel a little better too
yes much heavier with people
and let's see what the button does
there you go you gotta press the button
open it
and let's see does not magnetically clip
in there so you gotta actually kind of
get it at the right spot and then push
it in there so there's the Dell Venue 11
Pro pretty nice tablet - one with a
irritable option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
