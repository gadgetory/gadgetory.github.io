old iPhone as the battery ages facing a
class-action lawsuit how should
Cupertino respond magic leap is jumping
into the augmented reality space with
some new goggles and the pocket now
staff playing a silly Secret Santa round
with our favorite smartphones of the air
we've got a lot to talk we've got a lot
to talk about so make sure you're
charged and ready for episode two eight
four of the pocket now weekly recorded
December 22nd at noon pacific this
weekly podcast is where we dissect and
discuss those gadgets that make our
lives mobile smartphones tablets and
wearables it's all the stuff you wished
existed when you were a kid and the
beginning of your holiday break was
filled with limitless possibilities I'm
Juan Carlos back now senior editor at
pocketnow.com
joined as always by plucky podcast
producer mr. Jules Wong out on the East
Coast how's it going buddy boy you can
sled down that hill or toboggan down
that hill or I don't know I mean it was
a nice time back when I had there was it
was when my dad was stationed in
Massachusetts it was my all-time
favorite there was this one hill on uh
what was it it was at Hanscom Hanscom
Air Force Base that's gonna yeah yeah
that there's one hill that was amazing
for sledding and the entire the entire
base kids we would all go and and like
practically break limbs and snap spines
like Altoids conquer and I mean that's a
picturesque town itself it's pretty neat
it's lovely you get the crisp feeling in
the air it's and there's something and
there's something like dastardly that
happens with snowfall in Massachusetts
I'm sure on a lot of East Coast borders
but like every winter we would get this
amazing mixture of like it getting just
warm enough during the day to melt so
you'd get this like ice no ice no ice no
layer that was phenomenal for injuring
yourself but then also Ferb's you know I
mean it was really it's just one winter
thing and then sooner or later the snow
turns brown you have to walk through
trudged there in the streets dude
yeah everything's coming so it's just
not really it's super great the salt I
do kind of miss seasons but that's the
thing that's also really nice about grow
I you know having my home in Albuquerque
it's like you get the mildest version of
every season so like you snowfalls in in
New Mexico and there's just not enough
moisture so it's like this really nice
dusting this light misting of snow over
everything and and then the next day
it's gone yeah drive to your seasons you
have to drive yeah it's it's pretty
rough let me tell you this I think
California it got down to like I think
it's it's currently like just under 70
degrees so it's it's akin to freezing
here are those weird benchmarks for
weather down there that's weird well
anyways we're glad that you have decided
to join us here for our journey our
audio journey our video journeys to some
extent on this week's podcast and we
invite you to talk to us talk with us
get the conversation going especially as
we get towards some of the more
controversial topics here going to
Twitter and type in the hashtag p-n
weekly and you'll be able to follow the
conversation as well as contribute your
own comments albeit read them respond to
them live on the air at 3 p.m. Eastern
on this 22nd of December yeah whoo that
Christmas thing going on in a few days
anyways if you want to send something
along for we're still doing that then
technically next week is still the last
oh yeah I know next week is going to be
remembered at you yeah issue okay we've
got a magazine I'm already on vacation
brain so this is gonna be a fun show I
can feel it already
oh yeah definitely podcast at
pocketnow.com if you want to throw in a
letter into that bag but in the meantime
it's pianned weekly hashtag on Twitter
and already on the peon weekly hashtag
this is from hey is for David last week
we were talking a little bit about
different AI in sort of home automation
products and hey is for David rights I
believe the AI showcased in the Samsung
washing machine is Cortana and that was
debuted at Eva with the launch of the
Galaxy Tab pro as I had to look it up it
was called cue Raider and so it wasn't
fixed for you like we were stumbling
around last week when we had a TK babe
on the show Samsung's different AI for
washing machines is curator so you can
get a Samsung washing machine that knows
more about your clothes than you do has
all the dirt on your dirty yeah I'm not
sure if Laura Kwok Crofts just kind of
come in and do that but hey it sounds
like it sounds like an AI gone wrong
right cue Raider and then it takes over
you know your your mission base and
won't let you out of the airlock and it
won't open the pod bay doors and it's
basically just locks your all your
laundry in a tomb and you have to find a
way to get to it you have to read I am a
green light that movie Jules I think
that needs to be seen by more than the
people who just watch or listen to our
podcast
I married a green night balloon the news
if you're ready to talk about this is
actually a pretty decent news week what
do you got what are you drinking over
there another W they don't tell God cast
alcohol not yet I'm not there yet give
it a couple days the Rugrats on
Christmas break and maybe I'll need
something to numb for next week but
she's doing okay right now well for the
week of December 18 2017 this is all the
news that's fit to podcast we'll start
off this roundup with some news about
the iPhones of the future of 2019 Apple
has historically never Overland old in
providing big batteries for its devices
and some might argue that it doesn't
have to because the iPhones very power
efficient we'll get to that in just a
second but new projections out from
JGI securities claim that we should
expect to see an upgrade in 3d sensing
and a are related functions those that
sort of equipment excuse me will likely
tax the power cells more if we could see
to compensate the year after next
now there's another argument about Apple
and batteries growing up the company
hasn't admitted to slowing down older
iPhones like the success and seven after
third-party testing showed performance
throttling it stayed to TechCrunch that
the iOS 11 update brought stricter
processing limits to the iPhone 6 and
iPhone se as well I have said at one
point to you that is to prolong the life
of the devices as the lithium-ion
batteries start to age that these claims
about the devices having the potential
to hit performance peaks that they could
not happen
well that's they could cause shutdowns
and deterioration there are some new
ones to be had here and we'll get to
that as we go into detail with this
magic leak has finally published one and
it's out of the app some four kids will
be made available in addition to the
so-called light wear goggles and objects
are detected using light field sensors
the product will be available in limited
quality in the quantities next year Sony
is supposedly producing a new flagship
with Qualcomm's latest high power tips
at the snapdragon 845 it got a run on in
Geekbench and poll numbers as we haven't
seen before from any Qualcomm chip said
2400 points on a single core test and
8300 points for the fork or the
performance cores as we like to say
which can run up to 2.6 like to say the
performance cores
because the 3gpp eeeh meanwhile third
generation partnership or something has
reached its expedited goal of creating
the first standard for 5g networks this
week one more rules will be placed in
June next year this paves the way for
networks to launch 5g service in late
2018 and afterwards President Donald
Trump has just signed a tax reform bill
into law after much wrangling between
republican-controlled House and Senate
now what does this do you have have to
do with mobile technology well
corporations will see their rate drop
from 35 percent to 21 percent and big
telecoms like AT&amp;amp;T and Comcast are
celebrating by announcing new expanded
capital expenditure plans each company
is also giving out $1,000 holiday
bonuses to all of their non-executive
employees all together brand 400,000
working their ranks Amazon Tube is one
of the latest terms to show up at the US
Patent and Trademark Office Amazon
indeed is the applicant for that term
hinting at everything you can think of
for a user submitted video mastered
distribution platform it see as the
latest salvo to Google's unwillingness
to bring YouTube back to the echoes show
and to keep it on for fire TV users this
controversy stems back to some
retaliation for Amazon not stocking some
of Google's hardware peripherals finally
Microsoft has killed off an application
in its Windows Store now why would he
want to kill off Google Chrome doesn't
everyone want a lightweight version of
this resource hog of a web browser well
it turns out that the app is the egg
users to download the full program and
that didn't set out said it all well
with Microsoft it would not also not
make me any sense at hall's for Google
to create a friendlier Chrome Microsoft
requires JavaScript and HTML for web
rendering read but easy for you to say
in its apps while Google uses its own
blink engine there are a whole bunch of
things that
to developing Windows apps for Windows
10 as lightweight thing we'll get to
that as we come to it but in the
meantime let's talk about the batteries
let's talk about iPhones that just can't
seem to keep their charge that will
require more charge in the future what
does this look to you to shape the
future of how Apple describes all-day
battery life or something like that yeah
it's it's because this kind of goes hand
in hand what was it two weeks ago or
three weeks ago where we were talking
about Samsung and their graphene excuse
me yeah I probably shouldn't drink diet
root beer while I'm trying to podcast
because I'm gonna have like turtle burps
all the show right here no this kind of
goes hand-in-hand with that whenever we
see what I think is hilarious is
whenever we do see improvements to
battery technology I did a video on this
like three years before I joined the
PocketNow team it's the fallacy of
bigger batteries or more improved
batteries are gonna deliver longer
runtime it's almost always immediately
eaten up by more powerful processing
more resource intensive apps and we are
right at the precipice of that next
generation of services especially if
we're going to be doing more VR and AR
like apples talking about improving the
battery capacity or improving the
battery runtime or the battery
technology is really only going to serve
more weighty use you know and what I
think is hilarious is like you give
someone so like let's say you have a
current gen phone and you go from having
like a 2,000 milliamp power battery to a
four thousand milliamp hour battery what
I find really people don't last twice as
long they just use their phone twice as
much during the day right so even the
consumer behavior just very competitive
yeah it's just yeah
like Jules is on point there because
he's sort of locked up and frozen I
agree anyways the best live show ever so
you know like apples points here
especially like trying to anticipate
what what this use might look like in
2019 I think also Stan's is a small
commentary in like what do we expect the
longevity of our phones to be you know I
somewhat I Rock Euler iPhone 7 yeah they
used to have a pretty good sense of what
their phone of what an iPhone how long
an iPhone should or would last and and
this kind of leads us right into the
other story too about Apple now
admitting that they reduce performance
based on the battery age battery
degradation and battery longevity and we
have a big problem when it comes to
things like disclosure I think that's
really almost always a company's biggest
fault is instead of getting out ahead of
the story instead of what once Inklings
of this commentary are starting to make
it through larger publications Apple
waited until there was like a mountain
of evidence against them and then it
makes them look like they're withholding
it because they are they are withholding
a certain aspect of the performance of
this phone when they've always you know
sort of it in inferred not not inferred
insinuated that this wasn't something
that they were doing that you know it
was just sort of a psychosomatic
response to newer software being run on
older phones when in reality they were
actually changing up the performance of
the device and so had this just been
disclosed or had consumers been given an
option you know like hey your battery
will last less but you can have the full
performance of the phone and just flick
the switch I don't think there'd be an
issue here I don't think there would
have been a problem but now we're
talking about thousand-dollar phones
we're talking about top-tier performance
we're talking about the next generation
of services and
Apple needs to be disclosing what it is
that people are actually doing with or
what's actually happening with the
investment that people make in their
products well it's also about how much
information they want to give and not to
feed and see the whole other planned
obsolescence narrative that people tend
to have about these things but I think
tank crunch which was the one that makes
a good point here and how much how
customers react to this where they want
to know just have a set time for a
battery placement for their iPhone or
something that might not be necessary
for the sake of just knowing that
performance is gonna be maxed out or
something like that where I'm not sure
if iOS goes into the nitty-gritty and is
able to read into metadata about the
battery how old it is and whatnot
so there's a lot of implied you know
there's a lot of ways that people will
think around this situation and they'll
take action upon it it might be
ill-advised in the end they might not
get them more mileage it's just it's
just a situation where I don't think
consumers can even come up with an
ill-advised response to this if they
don't have the information that they
should I I think that there is something
scummy about a business practice where
the performance of a product is degraded
over time and one way to recover that
performance would be to install a very
cost-effective new battery as opposed to
buying a new phone and these things tend
to roll around two-year cycles where
Apple will finally disclose what the
problems of a phone were we saw this
with the iPhone 5 on the iPhone 5 had
battery problems and Apple didn't really
jump into the discussion or offer
consumers who were facing those problems
any any outlet until they were right
towards the to the end of the two-year
lifecycle of that phone and wouldn't you
know it well you know instead of getting
a new battery for your iPhone 5 you
could just buy a new iPhone 6 on a
tractor through some sort of payment
plan or you just refresh that way
wouldn't that just be easier than
maintenance insana Noldor phone why not
a better chipset that doesn't perform at
that level if it has to why doesn't want
to just freakin treat its batteries
better like theirs well but but even
just giving consumers the choice I think
there are a number of consumers out
there that will understand and they'll
opt for degraded performance for longer
runtime like the phone runs well enough
for me to do my emailing and my
twittering what do I need all this
horsepower for and then there gonna be
some consumers who choose I would rather
have the full the full force of this
processor even though I know I'm gonna
have to charge it up sooner but it's a
bad look for this company when people
could recover their performance by
getting you know by by paying for what I
don't even know how much a battery
replacement amount on an iPhone costs
through the Apple I mean we're talking
about everything since the six so
including the sick your beloved S II
which is kind of slowed down so I mean
it's just I mean the two-year limit I
mean is should we really commend Apple
for going a little bit early on others I
broke up in the middle of that so I have
no idea what you were trying to ask
there Jules even commit should we even
tried to commend Apple for going a
little bit early on the new work
products as well I mean it's just I
disclosed I don't think it's even like
you know can we say good boy or bad boy
Apple it's it's how do we expect this
company to do business in the market and
how do we expect this company to treat
their customers especially as there is
no competition for Apple there is no
other place you can buy an iPhone you
you buy an iPhone from Apple they have a
monopoly on the iPhone market if we want
to look at it that way and not
disclosing this to their consumers I
feel as a disservice to their own market
and this is also why I used to be so in
favor of replaceable batteries on
Android phones
it wasn't that I would buy extra
batteries to swap during the day it
would be around a year just as the
battery is starting to degrade a little
I would put in a fresh new battery and
then I'd have a backup battery if I ever
really needed it but it was like I got
that full charge that full new phone
feel all over again by swapping in a new
battery and now we can't really do that
we can't do that easily these all of
these products are now becoming glued
shut
so Apple you know they've always been on
that on that train but there could have
been a discussion with their customers
hey you're getting the new version of
the iOS operating system and your phone
battery is two years old for $100 you
can refresh the performance of that
phone and get you know new battery life
and recover the actual CPU processing
GPU processing of this phone but they're
not going to say that because they want
you to go out and buy the new iPhone
exactly and it could be just for that
sake - that the iOS iOS doesn't even
care about the actual battery itself it
just slows down regardless you know just
because of the age of the phone so we
just got a tweet from Jay Pasquale's on
using the PN weekly hashtag $79 for the
battery replacement 80 bucks I mean your
ex that's a decent chunk of change but
you know if you wanted your phone to
perform snappier and that was the metric
that Apple was using in terms of
degrading performance 80 bucks is I
think totally worth it to refresh an
older phone keep it running I get get
back to that higher tier of performance
prior to the degradation if you want to
keep it beyond two and a half three
years I mean I know that's that's what's
so frustrating is the average ownership
is somewhere around 26 or 28 months I
think the last time the reasons of why
they do it maybe it's because of a
necessity or because they just feel
comfortable with it but in terms of all
that experience that they allow
themselves that well not allow
themselves to have but you know just
being empowered with a little more
information that would be altogether
much better I agree with that one so
definitely listen want to what we're
talking about here with more power comes
more responsibility comes more higher a
number it's not dragon 845 these numbers
mean not much to me because they're
benchmarks but I mean what do you make
of it because you wanted me to you
wanted to talk about this dint you oh no
I definitely wanted to include it in the
news roundup so we're looking at the
numbers on the Snapdragon 845 and and I
think we're seeing sort of what we would
expect from another major processor
release depending on what phones were
comparing against somewhere around a
twenty to thirty percent improvement in
these synthetic benchmarks which in
real-world performance is probably going
to translate to very little but knowing
what we know especially from the
coverage that I'm a was producing down
in in Hawaii for that Qualcomm then this
is going hand-in-hand this this sort of
piggybacks on the story that we were
talking about with apples Apple and
batteries is looking at qual comes
influence over the android market and
knowing that the next generation of
services are going to be even more CPU
intensive even more graphics intensive
we're going to be looking a lot of
offloading of special services to
independent cores as opposed to just
general CPU computing and this is where
the a45 really comes into play that 20
to 30 percent performance bump doesn't
necessarily mean we're going to be
seeing significantly better real-world
performance like your your Twitter app
is gonna load a fraction of a
millisecond faster than it used to
instead it's it's this horsepower will
eventually be dedicated to services that
will really tax current hardware if you
caught someone posted just the
screenshot of the performance the the
was a geek bench the geek bench scores
on reddit and in the comments there were
hilarious because of course it instantly
had to become an Apple versus Qualcomm
debate oh my god a 10x fusion
total bullcrap out of the MacBook Air
and again we should we should always
treat synthetic benchmarks for exactly
what they are you know it's it's it's a
synthetic process it doesn't reflect
real world performance it's it's not a
one-to-one especially with how phones
will alter their performance when they
detect the benchmark being run but I
don't say that as could be also it's a
verified of tube so like this would not
be this is in line with what we'll see
especially you know Sony getting ahead
of the curve we know they're trying
going to be trying to make some bigger
changes in 2018 off the last generation
of this boxy XZ or you know xperia x
form factor III feel like this is
reflective of what will come to pass but
again it's it's always that hilarious
debate or that hairy hilarious nerd
fight that we see in those kinds of
posts where people are just at each
other's throats and I think again sort
of missing the the bigger picture just
the number of people like oh like I care
about having slightly faster email
performance and you're like well that's
not what this is about and if you don't
use your phone for anything other than
email why are you posting on our Android
about a top-of-the-line chipset when
like a snapdragon 614 from three years
ago would be fine for you because I am
on the internet and I have opinion and
someone else is on the internet and
they're wrong in the in the news bike
but I just wanted to circle back real
quick Jules what were your thoughts on
this magic leap announcement that
they're gonna be getting into the actual
hardware game with a pair of goggles I
thought this was an interesting time for
them to to take the wraps off what these
things look like um I I I'm not sure
myself because first of all this is
tailored towards traitors so there you
go it's the first look it's the first
field I how they
coming out but functional enough it
doesn't you don't have to look like like
you're fashionable like Geordi the five
the rifts they all have pretty minion
designs so I mean well until we get like
actual mesh form replacements kind of
visors that can adhere to your face and
then you could still have you won't be
weird with your eyes like being covered
ever let's just show your eyes and why
not I can tell we get to that in like
3027 like until then I'm not really sure
what the big deal is
I'll be curious to see because magically
made a whole bunch of noises they had
that control interface where you moved
your hands around and you could like
interact with things on the screen where
I was showing up like fruit ninja and
stuff like that I'll be curious to see
if this was the right time no one really
seems to benefit from being first with
any kind of new consumer facing
technology and I know that they're
saying this is going to be more for
developers and for creators and for that
kind of audience but there this is
another example like why I've been
frustrated with Microsoft Microsoft has
sort of been like their lead in this
market showing off hololens and how cool
hololens was now that that lead is
eroding quickly as phones are adopting
you know more AR aspects and developers
are really interested in AR core and AR
kit now we've got companies putting out
hardware and where where is the big
player response where is that vibe
response or that Microsoft responds
mixed reality is really just VR plus
it's not really AR or piggybacking off
of hololens in the way that we wanted to
see real interaction with real world
elements I thought it was kind of
curious that okay that's that a smaller
company like magically I think it's
trying to make the play make the
headlines get people interested in that
even though it's still a ways off from
actually shipping but this also seems to
reflect just how empty the competition
for AR has been since the company that's
most responsible for getting people
interested in it Microsoft has been
super quiet on that front since I think
the surface book was at the surface book
launch where they showed off that really
cool AR game and you have like a shield
and bugs would crawl out of the walls
and stuff like no it's really followed
up since then I mean it all depends on
with SDK allows you to do and just being
able to interact with I mean you have a
dedicated technology for detection of
objects of what you know what the do you
would hope that processing power.you be
able to know to have non body mounted
peripherals so that you can actually
play around with other things in the
room and just have it look awesome and
cool I mean I would love to play rocket
League in real life I mean and not just
you know like have a demo derby but III
definitely I don't know how much time we
need to spend on this eighteen but one
of the things that that that again
drives me nuts about this kind of thing
is we're talking about a company that I
think what pulled in 14 billion over
2017 and it's these tax breaks which are
allowing ATT to deliver bonuses but we
also just caught news this morning that
after the bonuses go out they're gonna
be looking to play off hundreds of
people yeah so it did all of these
stories sort of mash up in a really
obnoxious way without me getting to
soapbox II about politics like the real
world it made a lot of will get yeah how
do we get the holiday bonus anyways I'm
not sure we were to be like a thousand
bucks but anyways and this is not really
a meaningful wage increase so there's
that and a whole lot of metrics a lot of
tap dancing and not enough
you know substance yeah you know if
we're talking about these companies
getting these funds and improving and
increasing their profits I think a lot
of us would be hoping to see more
investment in their networks and their
infrastructures really building this out
and keeping you know talented people
employed as opposed to playing
shenanigans with cash coming in but you
know I I don't run a multi-billion
dollar organization gotta get that file
if you evolution network up and running
is here for 20 G right there in your
future now I definitely want to touch on
this one because you know we loves our
YouTube live streaming capabilities so
if you don't see us coming on to Amazon
to Amazon or whatever they're calling it
oh been two-bit tubing on open tube I
think this could be a smart play because
we've already seen Amazon both Amazon
bought out twitch so they already own
one of the web's most popular streaming
services if they could leverage their
market stands in their affiliate program
for advertising on user-generated
content this could be the best case
scenario for competition against YouTube
but again it's still the ongoing ongoing
battle of Amazon versus Google like the
two biggest data user user information
trafficking websites on the Internet
going head-to-head and and that the
third-place competition the outside
competition to the service would be
Facebook so again like consumers just
being the ping-pong balls in a three-way
battle of giant mega corporations
there's a whole profit in our info
it's petty stupid bull like you're
really going to mount something that is
all about oh hey we're gonna distribute
Amazon Prime video in our original
content
not to Google and you know Google's like
oh we're not gonna do YouTube then and
we're doing our original content which
you know isn't really the basis of what
we were founded on but you know what
whatever it's this is business and we
like to pretend that this means
something to consumers anything so yeah
and yet I mean and it's the conflict of
Awe so hoping like I would like to see
some better competition for you to I am
it makes me cranky and nervous when that
competition is coming from Amazon and
Facebook but until something arises
where Google actually has to develop and
support and better iterate for their
content creators on YouTube then I guess
the enemy of my enemy is my friend
I don't know it's not gonna come from an
outlet like Vimeo we saw numerous other
experiments shut down this year some
that PocketNow was even trying to play
along with in terms of monetizing
user-generated video but it is it is an
interesting place that we find ourselves
in going into 2018 that we could be
hoping for an Amazon competitor here
solely because of the shenanigans that
are being played at the top level with
their subscriber bases well speaking of
shenanigans you want to talk about
Google playing around with its
money-making big star freaking web
browser and how they're just not there
it's just a middle finger I know it it
was unnecessary it was a waste of
developer space you know there wasn't
even like spoofing going on for Chrome
on the Windows Store not not not cool
Google I I actually stopped using Google
Chrome as my primary browser I did a
while back and I went back to Firefox
and I've been fairly happy with Firefox
the new quantum update was really clean
and then they Firefox went and screwed
it up by side loading some stupid
add-on for mr. robot as part of like an
AR game that no one asked for but um
that way yeah I that kind of those kinds
of moves really sour I think a lot of
people on trying to shift ecosystems but
but i I've still been rocking the
Firefox and the most recent updates to
Chrome if not instilled me with a lot of
confidence so instead of wasting
people's time by engaging in these kinds
of shenanigans and putting up an app
which is not an app on the Microsoft
Store maybe Google could just make their
browser better maybe put time and effort
and energy towards that and really you
know rolling out improvements to things
like Android app support for Chrome OS
and eventually into Chrome browsers and
you could have like a really great
Trojan horse for Microsoft products
allowing people to run Android apps
through their Chrome browsers but
instead you know instead why not just
throw up a giant middle finger to
Microsoft because I know if Microsoft
were to do the exact same thing
everyone would would totally be fine
with Microsoft that's against you AB
strategy right now they have office and
everything so that's going out there I
mean there's also the potential for
Google to compete back in the connected
laptop space with the rumors of a
snapdragon 845 being working to the
repository for chromium right now so
this is a I mean they they didn't have
to rub this in I guess yeah um we have a
couple tweets here's just circling back
to a couple stories this is from Andrew
Wallace at fat produce hashtag P and
weekly with Apple admitting the slowing
its phone how much do you want to bet
that Android manufacturers are doing the
same things and I don't know that I'd be
terribly surprised if there weren't some
investigation into how bogged down
Android devices get I think one of the
dangers is if it's true that's bad if
it's not true then in progress because
right now
gonna I mean we're gonna crash over time
you realize that yeah this is bound to
happen when nothing gets done about it
so I would already put a solid no to the
whole throttling of performance that
like when you have a ton of custom
software running on top of Android which
is the skin for the Linux kernel or a
container for the Linux kernel I forget
exactly what the word is that I'm trying
to find there it's vacation brain uh
it's bad either way because either your
phone is slowing down by design or it's
slowing down because it's poorly built
and it's slowing down just this is a
this is also from from Peter Hayden yes
Amazon could create some competition
here but given the natural low adoption
rate it will likely have in the
beginning I would ask how many will
actually move I'm thinking of you at
pocket now surely you could spread but
only if it's worthwhile to try question
mark hashtag P and weekly and I it I
would actually be willing to take the
jump especially knowing how well twitch
works as a service for people who
stringing games low adoption rate
wouldn't necessarily bother me it would
be about what platform offers us the
best the best resources for producing
the highest quality show that we can and
we went through some real problems and
we're still facing some little gremlins
in how we broadcast on YouTube even if
the adoption weren't the highest
initially I'd still be willing to take
the experiment if it meant that we could
give you guys a higher quality show yeah
yeah and I'm not sure if we're not
mentoring them just because it's a under
some non-disclosure or anything but I
mean we we tried we have tried and I
think we'll guarantee we're going to
continue to try I mean most of our
income does does work out of a Google in
terms of the whole video sort of thing
but it's just it's not to step on like
you know whenever we've tried to we've
posted videos directly to Twitter and
directly to Facebook and the
monetization just doesn't work
for our main coverage but you know the
this video feed has always existed as a
way to interact in a real-time and then
we produce a higher quality audio
version of the broadcast for people to
use to consume through their favorite
podcast catchers I am les married to
YouTube for this podcast if it can live
somewhere else and it gives us better
capabilities then I'd be fine making the
jump obviously we wouldn't just jump
ship from YouTube for our main device
coverage that would require something
meteor or also just you know we'd
probably just double dip you know so
videos will be uploaded to YouTube and
to open tube that that I think would
make sense in terms of future
distribution but we'd have to take a
look at the numbers on that so lots of
plotting lots of planning there's always
the hope that something better comes to
long and that we take advantage of it in
the meantime you can see full details on
these stories and more hit pocketnow.com
and look for the podcast section to get
to this episode's rundown you can chat
with us about what you have been reading
up on with the hashtag P and weekly also
be sure to catch in the pocket now daily
on our YouTube channel yes and at this
point we should probably take a quick
minute to thank our sponsor support for
today's show comes from Back blaze
Backblaze offers unlimited cloud backups

pocket now and we thank them for
supporting the pocket now weekly yes
indeed we do now let's get into our next
segment here it's one that our former
host and current friend of the show
michael fisher wanted to put in for a
long time since episode 100 well he
never had the chance to do this two
years after he stopped so let's give
some background here so the story goes
this week that Apple is now requiring
game publishers for its App Store to
disclose the odds of getting items
within them that are loot boxes where
users make an in-app purchase take the
luck of the draw get one item out of a
possible few that vary in rarity ability
whatever the heck just helps the player
so there's been fresh controversy on
these leave boxes if you have not been
aware II a withdrew its microtransaction
economy for Star Wars where what loot
boxes could have been and were used as a
means to fast-forward through hours of
potential grinding through the story it
was just a bad look overall but where it
gets relevant here is that our own Juan
Carlos Pagnell has a very enthusiastic
viewpoint on loot boxes
as a means of gambling and whether it
should be regulated as such now I don't
have a particularly strong attachment to
playing games I don't know how to hold a
controller so yeah you've got like huge
hands every time we've given you one it
just sort of like snaps in half and then
like you know no one else can play
that's something that changes to admit I
figured that if we're gonna be a segment
I really think you should get it looked
at I just ya know that's not where we're
going with our fascitis we're going to
do a segment on one of Kwan's passion
points we might as well format it into
something pretty and work are calling
this segment defend yourself it's
nothing fancy we have sixty seconds each
for an opening statement up segments
lasting 30 seconds each it'll be a
rebuttal cross-examination and then
closing remarks otherwise this segment
would be 20 minutes and we'd be going
over to the same hole well you don't
want that you know what listen to that
do you know any ones that know exactly
so I'm going to let quad start off I got
the timer here ready and I shall begin
whenever you're ready so your time
starts now
so initial research into these types of
mechanics does demonstrate that it
really has little effect whether or not
real-world money is being received but
that the brain responds the same way to
these slot machines style plays there's
this huge dopamine release and it's a
very aggressive way to restrict player
involvement so my problem isn't
necessarily with microtransactions I
think this is the weaponization of
taking micro transactions to the next
level
it's that real-world currency is not
being applied to getting a thing it's a
rolling slot machine mechanic that can
be changed on the fly behind the scenes
so it's not that this percentage stays
the same if you're a while they can
juice up your winnings or restrict your
winnings to keep you playing more and so
this type of disclosure is manda
because what I ultimately do not want to
have happen is law enforcement to get
involved no entertainment industry wins
when laws are written about this the
industry needs so that's as opening
statements that's and I guess I'll try
and see if I can get mine up I just
don't have fancy sound effects for you
so well I can I can I can set at the
same time so I'm going to pretend that
this starts right now so in terms of
just being able to talk about it's the
whole microtransactions as a dopamine
release I don't really see that because
gambling it's just a set standard of
terms if we were to regulate this as
something more if I had mental health
issue that would be something else and
it would take a dramatic kind of
all-around approach to dealing with it
from healthcare necessities and all that
in regards to the actual gambling itself
where you're receiving either material
goods or money as a result of putting in
money for a game of chance I really
don't see the point to it there is I
mean you can do as well as putting in
the odds and make sure that the process
is as transparent as possible but in
terms of that I mean unless you're I
don't even think that a tournament would
count because you're not there's no real
entry fee and there'd be rules for that
so there you go all right so those
opening statements out of the way I'm
gonna try and see if I can work a
rebuttal into this working I think I
think I already rebutted a little bit of
your statement there that was that was
sort of a response um so do we want to
do another round on this is that is that
how you want to structure this you know
just another 30 seconds of well you know
what we can just go into the
cross-examination part okay
go straight through I'll try they were
just playing this by here so 30 seconds
on the clock and it starts now so if we
really want to dedicate a whole
government you know a bill to this and
make sure that how much money are we
going to are we willing as public to
spend on gamblers on so-called gamblers
I'm gonna say I'm still gonna insist on
well how I would oh sorry am i
responding to that is that the question
oh no I was just gonna ask that just a
couple of questions and but yeah then go
ahead okay my my major point is we
shouldn't be I don't want to see
unlicensed gambling in any video game no
gamer really likes these mechanics we
just deal with them because that's
what's been built into these games and
that we're starting to see them arrive
in triple-a title so you're already
spending $60 for the game then you're
spending real-world money for in-game
currency for a chance of unlocking a
piece of a player mechanic which is
going to improve your gameplay nobody
wants that and especially from our
conversation with dr. Timothy Fong at
UCLA when we talked about smartphone
addiction the outcome doesn't
necessarily matter we're seeing the same
patterns of behavior regardless of what
you feed into and get out of the machine
as if you were just playing the slots of
Vegas so because of that because of the
actual brain mechanics that I think
we're focused on here and because of the
fact that nobody wants this we might as
well find other ways of monetizing
additional monetizing games other micro
transactions that these companies can
continue to profit off of leave this one
alone and especially keep it out of
family friendly franchises I don't want
my kids introduced to this style of
gambling mechanic while playing a game
focused on Disney characters Marvel
characters Star Wars characters that's
just particularly insidious to halt
little kid player progress through these
types of gotcha gotcha workings and I
think we would all just be happier if
they were excised because game
developers cut them out is then we
wouldn't have to get law enforcement
involved we wouldn't have to get
legislators involved we don't want that
that's why we have movie ratings that's
why we have game rating
explicit lyrics warnings it's because
the those industries police themselves
so if those industries police themselves
I'm wondering what's preventing the game
industry from doing that to itself it's
because it's to profits but it's also
you know they also have something to
lose they realize that's the EA realized
that with this move but it's not
preventing the rest of the industry you
know they have different targets too
from teenagers that you are kind of
bordering on the independence level but
still might tend to go for the parents
credit card or something like that I'm
wondering what's stopping the rest of
the industry for more just mmm no I mean
after a point what happens in a
boardroom when you're getting an inside
peek is to the companies that are
actually producing and distributing
these games is it doesn't matter if the
games profitable it matters how
profitable the game is so if you
introduce a gambling mechanic in one
game and you see the percentage by which
the profits increase by that mechanic
then technically you are losing money on
future games if you don't also
incorporate that that mechanic it starts
to be discussed as if it's a loss for
the company even if the game sales are
still wildly profitable so it just
becomes this lobster pot effects for the
entire industry where more developers
and more distributors are looking at how
they can incorporate these because they
don't want to be seen as losing money
for their shareholders by not using them
and that's what again this is why this
has become so insidious as we've seen
this this escalation of micro
transaction policy and micro transaction
adoption
I'm actually not overly upset by micro
transactions if you want to buy a
bacon-wrapped gun with real money for a
Call of Duty go and buy it um to a point
I also don't I'm not particularly
bothered by short cutting on grind what
I'm mostly upset about is real world
money being put towards a game of chance
to potentially unlock game breaking or
game improving mechanics
for certain players cuz that right there
that for me is a bridge too far for this
type of incorporation I think it's
predatory on the industry and we've
already seen legislators start to get
involved in the game industry it's I
believe it's Chris Lee out of Hawaii is
actually doing a really crazy cool
YouTube series on what it takes to
introduce a piece of legislation and
he's focused on gambling in video games
so we already see this is gonna start
popping up at the state and the federal
level it's only to game developers
credit to get rid of this mechanic now
and then play ball with companies like
Apple so that you are disclosing
whenever there is a chance element in
one of your games that that's properly
disclosed to consumers well that's
interesting so what I perceived before
this argument was that you were in favor
of regulation whereas I was against it
but it turns out that the different
topic here the subset of the man kick
and the mccarran's coming in here I find
myself in favor of actually new
legislation where you're hoping for
inflation so I guess that's my name
because that's my position this is the
tricky this is so ask you a couple
questions just actually I think we can
probably cut to a conclusion here
especially in the way that we've both
sort of flipped on this issue is if the
game industry can't police themselves
then like your point now something needs
to happen to prevent this type of
mechanic from really growing roots in
our video games it's already a major
component of more Asian centric games
that's we call them like gotcha gotcha
mechanics yeah um we want to put a stop
to this if the game developers won't do
it themselves then I agree with you
Jules
I think someone else needs to step in
now where I'm concerned and where I
think a lot of our audience is gonna
agree with this as a sentiment is right
it's details well the government
involvement in any piece or creation of
media has never been to the benefit of
medium we saw that with the film
industry
what you know where there was policing
of morality in what could be filmed we
saw that with the music industry
especially during like the tipper gore
era of the music debate before explicit
warnings were put on on albums we saw
that with the comic-book industry in the
comic code as a response to government
oversight and censorship of our media
every single time we've seen this happen
it's been bad for that industry but if
the industry can't police itself then I
think something else needs to step in I
think another entity needs to step in
well that you know depends on the
government for example in UK there's a
reason why they have them for trade and
why they tend to you know it'd be a
little bit more loose with their parity
you're absolutely right it does depend
on the government but we're talking
about our government about why we have
government in the RIAA and the entities
that we do is because we haven't seen
I'm not an anti-government guy I think
people understand them I'm pretty
left-leaning and I'm about a social
democrat to be fair a lot of these
assets that games come from are coming
out of Hollywood and they have their own
regulations for that but if people if
you know these regulations started
piling on the US and he find that you
know game publishers find that to be too
overbearing they might move over to well
somewhere where it's less like London or
maybe even like a tax
Island shelter for for this kind of you
know you can make a movie in the UK and
not have it rated for the United States
and then your movie will just never be
shown in a movie theater in the United
States you can release an album with
explicit lyrics and not have it rated by
the agencies and just not have it ever
sold in the United States or listened to
through any medium in the United States
you're the only real thing that's game
somewhere else
it's the maps it's the most over sold or
not repeated for and if they're not
they're not passing along apps
and they're going to have a you know
ecosystem that's deprived of its to this
speck into that speck so I mean it's
really just about having the content
there for these a big ecosystems rather
than oh no ei doing something that
pisses off the US government first well
but it's more than just ei pissing off
the US government EA has backed off of
this loop box mechanic but they didn't
actually fix the grind in the game
significantly there's still a lot of
player grind that has to happen in my
own favourite mobile game what what I
used to sort of benchmark graphics in
all of our phone reviews is a marvel
future fight which also introduced new
characters that that relied on this sort
of gambling mechanic and I sort of had
to have a mini freakout about that too
because I find again I say that's a
bridge too far
especially for franchise that I should
be able to share with my kids and not
have to worry about what's halting their
player progress through real-world
currency mechanics so well if we're
talking about grind as part of the game
I think that's a it's part of the same
beast but it's a separate enough issue
for our purposes here to you know I I
agree if you ride should never be played
especially when it's artificially
applied to preventing player progress so
you know the the EA thing was was so
frustrating because it was I mean what
was it to unlock everything in the game
was gonna be something ridiculous like
over 2000 hours of play there's not
2,000 hours of game content but you
would have to play in a very repetitive
content so let's see this dropped by EA
for a Disney owned franchise we see this
mechanic in several Disney properties
like Disney emoji blitz has very random
elements and how you can move forward in
that game and we see this in a Disney
franchise the mobile game in Marvel
future fright so Disney is complicit and
Disney is okay with gambling mechanics
being utilized in their games they won't
produce a raid at our film but they're
fine with entry
using your kids to GIMP so yeah this is
all about the speedruns people and if
you get the top speedrun you get $5,000
well good luck to y'all and we'll see
you later let's move into our a segment
here that you've been playing around
with so it's been when it comes to these
a collaborative pieces that we do here
at pocket now we put it on the website
pocketnow.com if you didn't know and
it's it's kind of it's always fun trying
to you know wrangle their responses
together here but I feel like this one
came up pretty good so if you're not
familiar for the secret santa what what
that is basically me oh we all get
assigned a partner to give to we just
figure out okay what what do we want to
give in this case it has to be a
smartphone so there's that and you know
this is I friend this is a test of how
well we pocket now really know each
other as just people so um you want to
start off with your kind of the deal
here assigned Tony our editor-in-chief
to give you something and he chose peer
view what do you think well yeah so I
this I I was actually really happy that
you set this up because this was just
sort of a fun little diversion to the
end of the year videos and content that
we've been producing and just the idea
you know like if you could give another
editor on the team any device what would
it be and so Tony had me our
editor-in-chief and he sent over a pure
view 808 I mean not really but you know
just that if we could you could have any
phone and he nailed it I as someone who
has spent a ton of time I actually am
revisiting my lumia 1020 I'm gonna be
doing just a some light shooting over
the weekend after Christmas and and it
was just it's it's such a an amazing
phone to revisit but I never got to
spend a lot of time with the Symbian
the forerunner to this the PureView 808
so I mean it was totally the the right
fit that was the the perfect response to
where I've been for for phones and it
was just kind of funny that you assigned
Adam Lane to me he was like legit real
professional photographer on our team
and the first thing I thought of was
like I would love to see what Adam could
do with the Panasonic cm1 you know that
unholy abomination of Panasonic cameras
stapled to some cheap facsimile of an
inch but I thought if anyone could get
something cool out of this it would be
it would be Adam Lane so I that's what I
ultimately gifted him I mean that would
be about like of all the bullet point of
features they would date oh and it's a
phone like you'd have to go all the way
down for that but I mean he loves it he
loves raw he loves the manual controls
and the focus or after or whatever the
heck that you know the wheel can do whoo
you can set it to do whatever around the
lens and then there's a full one-inch
sensor which he's impressed with he
notes that the the attend 20 has a 2/3
inch sensor so only sensor on an Android
on any sort of mobile operating system
device that was bigger than the 1020
yeah it's kind of crazy this is a this
is getting into our Sony rx100 territory
right yeah I mean you know we've seen
seeing patents especially on a newer
device that's potentially going back to
smaller like 1/3 inch sensors like the
luma the LGV 30 actually has a sensor
shrink but they're making up for it with
a better lens element but I still am I
was i for that company that's gonna come
with another giant sensor experiment
like the 1020 I covered this last year
and I did we're having an actual
variable aperture where'd it go to for
the CM one yeah from the CM one I don't
know that it really had much of a
release outside of Asian markets like if
it no I mean the variable aperture
because oh I don't know I mean I I
haven't really spent any time with one
eye I always wanted Panasonic never
returned there my
see yes bothered about their booth
I might especially cuz you know I
switched over to the micro four-thirds
world for producing my coverage and I am
actually shooting on a Panasonic now
much to my chagrin over like well fine I
don't want to talk about any of your
phones you're dumb and then I ended up
just go ahead and buying their cameras
yeah and he and he tends to take a lot
of model fashion photography so you know
he would want a better flash in that he
didn't get a xenon on the CM one so he's
gonna get a standalone nitro torch for
that so I mean you pretty much got him
all the way almost all the way there uh
as for me who did I give to I gave to my
fellow news editor Adrian diakonos Q
which he you know easily I never really
get to talk to him I know I don't know
what do you know what he's like in real
life but no I just assume that he's
pretty great for no nonsense got them
dude and you know he always tends to
have bias towards the the muscle cars
and the muscle phones so I just gave him
1 + 5 t he seemed to be pretty happy
with it he said that he is sister 5x he
got on a discount and you know survived
a couple of bootloop episodes so that so
so snarky about Android I'd gotten
through it Nexus 5x boot looping you
know too bad the class action doesn't
include Romania cuz you know well
there's that so I got him pretty pretty
close to the mark there by the way he
was he decided to give time a a
blackberry keep one and the reason why I
wanna mention that is because let me try
and see if I could find the passage
because this is really gonna industrious
as he is the BlackBerry key one it's
also not
extremely expensive so if we were to do
this thing for real I'd have a chance to
get a pricier better overall package
from My Secret Santa gift giver and make
a little profit after all it's the
gesture that counts right so I sent him
the the oneplus party after he sent out
his gift so he didn't have the chance to
realize that if he got a key one now
which is like 450 right you know between
the five tees you know lower and higher
tiers he could be making 50 to 100 bucks
if we sold it it just happens time
exactly phone flippers but new on HGTV
show really tens of people might watch
oh 1.5 million people I would assume we
got we got we could host it our pocket
house channel that would be cool I'd say
actually primary I assigned jaime to
give me a little thing I own a cardigan
sweater I know where that is that went
because it's a long story
I'd say Jules is the king of candid
photography it leads me to believe that
if there is anything he'd care about
most is the camera on the phone candid
photos require a product that can
deliver with every shot involved much
playing around with and he been kin and
the Google who I'm running this show off
of a pixel to Soho to pixel tails for me
that would be great I'd appreciate that
thank you but I think think about like
what you could do
candid shooting like with a phone in
each hand two times the jewels we should
3d 3d photography candid photography and
community should be bet that out
definitely I mean just for contrarians
steak maybe I would appreciate the
iPhone 10
just a you know go around playfulness
because I know we don't you know you you
you typically don't get the same like
you know wealth of phones that hi may
gets but have you spent any appreciable
time with a recent version of the iPhone
oh no not really I mean I haven't even
I've played around in the carer stores
that I have not
I've yet to touch an iPhone 10 so but
recents a Twitter talk from you know I
think was Dietrich knows Dan Seaford and
he was just like trash and the cellular
reception we're covering some of those
stories about radio management and stuff
I just mean like I think right now hi my
hi may has the iPhone 8 the 8 plus and
the 10 it would be worth maybe sending
you the iPhone 8 for a week just to see
how you feel about it what a modern
iPhone feels like it was an interesting
experience covering the 8 plus this year
mm-hmm well I'd be I'd be done to go for
it especially because of the other
photos that I take let's see well what
have I taken recently I lots of subway
pictures well I've seen a few uh really
sharp coming from the pixel I I've been
very impressed few of them but I'm I'm
kind of just more of a putting people
carving up their knives in a ramen
restaurant but sure I I don't know what
to yes and a little bit I would
definitely recommend people checking out
the story just cuz like I said it's it's
a we don't often get to give you guys
the BTS or like talk about ourselves
we're trying to staying we're trying to
stay more focused on actual news and
editorial and stuff so it was just sort
of a nice way to round robin the editors
and producers on the team - Chris yeah
it's Christmas well and then also it's
it's like in the dating game like how
well do you know your compatriots and
and what would you give them we do have
a couple tweets here that I want to wrap
up before we finish up the show - Peters
first yeah well Peter has a couple but I
would
gonna mention his if this were down to
me I would definitely give a v32 some
catch acai no question but I would stick
a mate 10 on the back four-point Jules I
think I would get you a you 11 it just
seems to suit you but I think you might
like the design I mean no harm
I have no objections to you 11 I
personally want to carry a smaller phone
these days but the you 11 very sleek I
suppose you have a pretty good camera to
do yeah I mean I mean I've seen Plus
just to get that 2x1 screen but and you
know like I also know you're not opposed
to the dongle life so that wouldn't that
wouldn't mess you up too much
well Donnelly for the job relief little
thing it's slow right yeah you've been
rocking the neckband on that one too I
still I still have my LG's so I'm still
better the next you said Tech Beardsley
why would you diss I don't doubt like oh
you said neckbeard not tech beard okay
I'll shut up now this one this one's a
question I want to try there we don't
have to spend a whole lot of time
talking about this but sure I'm going to
butcher this name sack is careth and
Asus asked greetings from Greece hello
to Greece your your comments on the i7
core pixel book price when while other
companies stop mimicking apples insane
pricing policy and I had to look it up
because I remembered the launch of the
pixel book I did like 37 the core i7
pixel book with 16 gig of ram and 512
gigabytes 1549 dollars that does not
include the pixel book pen which is
going to be another hundred dollars and
then preferred care on that would be 249
so the grand total free fully outfitted
pixel book core i7 would be one thousand
eight hundred and ninety seven dollars
if purchased today in
the United States which means it's
probably even more stinking expensive in
countries around the EU $2,000 joules
does a does Chrome OS fit a $2,000
mobile computing lifestyle strategy I
would make it fit if it paid that much
money I would make it fit
Android apps sure I'll just I'll just
load them all onto it and yeah I'll be
I'll be hopefully not power washing them
for like at least a couple years so I
almost met dr. beer at my Panasonic
camera which is running this podcast
right now I have I'm really torn on this
because I really want to respect a
premium tier for any device manufacturer
I was onboard the surface before people
were like really getting onboard the
surface train like the surface one I was
in there saying like this is the right
move from Microsoft I wanted to see a
manufacturer offer a compelling product
at a premium tier not just compete with
Windows on price like you can buy a
$2,000 MacBook or a $400 Dell like
that's not the right way to always
position your product so I really
appreciated Microsoft taking the lead
and it took until the surface pro 3
before I think that that idea took off
with consumers I have a hard time with
the bang for buck ratio on a Chrome OS
device nearing in on that $2,000 price
point because it's just nice it is
really nice it's gorgeous hardware it's
really well-constructed I don't know
that that's enough to warrant what you
can get out of the Chrome OS ecosystem
right now and so that is a
recommendation becomes more difficult
I don't believe Chrome OS always needs
to live on $200 plastic Chromebooks for
kids like a grown-up
option for Chrome OS totally makes sense
III don't know that I could say by this
though I would have a hard time saying
this is the right fit for you I mean if
it's easier just valve bring steam on to
Android officially let's do that just
yeah was it that's you know or
steam OS or whatever it was just makin
that can run on Chrome that's and you've
got we bring all of your Android you
know android apk is just make them
specifically limited to Chrome OS or
something I don't know maybe Google
should do that oh I've been reading
through a lot of the people that are
that are like hash tagging mojo out
their mobile journalism and that kind of
on the ground on the on the run mobile
production lifestyle idea and there's a
lot of it that I find very compelling
and I think apps are getting to that
point where you can fulfill a lot of
what you would need from more robust to
x86 applications through a mobile
interface I've produced videos on the
road only on my phone you know shooting
all the video recording the vo cutting
up adding sound tracking and and
layering compositing transitions and
text all in 4k video and uploading it
directly to YouTube from a smartphone
it's not as fast as what I can do on a
laptop but it's more than capable so
that kind of stuff I'm not faulting
Chrome OS here it's just this to me if
my phrase for this podcast is a bridge
too far
$2000 for Chrome OS just feels like a
bridge too far and I and I don't know
this is just a feeling
like it's my own personal bias as to
what I think the value proposition is
here and I don't know that Google has
reached it just by delivering nice
hardware you can get a lot of nice
hardware for a more capable package get
a fancy case for like 50 bucks and then
just be happy with that laptop and you
know what I get out of that is an
investment near that two thousand dollar
price point is
phenomenally more robust and capable and
I think it's just as nice and I think
it's you know I'm not sacrificing
anything in terms of screen resolution
having a touchscreen and I can play with
both windows
appiy apps and full legacy x86 desktop
grade workstation grade software I don't
have to compromise and you know I'm
saving a hundred dollars by buying a
pixel book for significantly less
capability and in a shell that's
probably I in my opinion the aesthetic
that I like for my lifestyle not as nice
as what I can get from my gaming laptop
yeah I mean you can play Angry Birds on
both things just pretty or I just run an
Android emulator and still enjoy android
kitkat emulators because those things
are so gross but I don't know that I've
really answered your your your appeal to
