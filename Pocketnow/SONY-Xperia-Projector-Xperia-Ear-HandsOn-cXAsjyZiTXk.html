technology node like the film staff at
Mobile World Congress collaborating with
PocketNow I had found myself at the Sony
booth taking a look at some really cool
stuff one which is coming to market this
summer called the xperia ear and the
concept product the xperia projector
both were very well received by
attendees now the Xperia projector is
very much a concept with no actual specs
because Sony doesn't know when or even
if they will bring it to market I
suppose they are testing the waters to
gauge interest before following through
with it the gist is that it is a little
box that they want to be a standalone
product without needing to be connected
to a smartphone and without needing to
be plugged in so it will hopefully run
off of battery power it can be projected
onto a desk or flat surface or even a
wall we don't know specs on range per
size and projection however in fact
every question I asked was met with a we
don't know which shows how rough this
idea really is right now the model
currently being shown was running
Android but they don't know what OS
eventually will be used but a concept
idea would be for Android to run on it
and to be able to project apps the sky
is the limit with this they showed a
little bit of a mock-up interface and
what they envisioned can be done with it
so I kindly had them run the
demonstration over again just for me can
you run through that against everything
oh yeah I can do yeah
so the Xperia projector concept all
comes in function y all right you have
calendar which is the digital as well
and I looked element you can add notes
and you mark something and in first I'm
going to tell me I want to go to the zoo
with you on the 28th then they will sink
on a meditation my Google Calendar right
you can post it notes you can query on
those here so no that's not it right you
can also use it for any kind of
conference programs Rama yeah full sweep
of their minor friend is having a cup of
tea so is there a camera there's a
camera there you can see on top of
course usually we can pop it up voice up
right as well and then there's a demo
over there as well which throw the
picture against the walls recipes also
have option if you put this on a kitchen
table for combo right hook it up to your
home heating system the air conditioning
see you're a large power bill Wars I
don't but you can see here now you put a
more heating name thank you so much
watching hook it up to your home
security system check on the status of
the doors windows etc etcetera I know of
course you can play music with it as
well
it's the uncanny thing was that even
though this is a prototype
they had it tracking your finger
movement so well in convincing enough
for it to already feel very real so that
everybody was so much wanting to know
more so much wanting to touch it in
interact with it it's too bad that this
interface was really just a mock-up it
didn't have too much you can actually do
with it but this is a really cool
technology imagine being able to turn
any surface into a computer screen
essentially and that's really what this
is you don't have to worry about your
countertop being dirty or whatever for
example you're free to go and touch it
and interact with it and it really
tracks your hands well so I hope that
they go and do more with this because I
think I would buy it especially if it
wasn't really heavy and if it had a
pretty decent range on it now neither
they nor I would have any idea what this
would cost again this is extremely
prototype I am curious though what do
you guys think about this what can you
imagine being done with this where would
you want to see this take direction and
most of all would you buy this otherwise
we also have the Xperia e R that should
be ready for purchase this summer June
or July it's a smart Bluetooth headset
you can use it to send or receive
information as a personal assistant and
get info from your phone without ever
having to take it out of your pocket so
that is really nice you can choose your
voice engine as Google now or Sony
though they say a thin if it's use use
Sony's because it talks back to you with
search results for instance the voice
agent is launched by short pressing the
main key so it is not voice-activated
you can't say something like okay Google
it also has a proximity sensor so it'll
turn itself on if you put it inside your
ear and it will greet you
it feels pretty comfortable it kind of
reminds me of a SmartWatch / personal
assistant that you wear in your ear
instead of on your wrist I can't help
but think of cybus industries ear pods
for you dr. Pooh fans out there so sony
says it has 80 hours standby time 3.5
hours of talktime and it comes with a
little compact carrying case last
battery case that
charges about three times so they say
it's going to work with any Android
device we don't know about iOS just yet
and we don't know if price yet either
that's something that will be announced
a little bit later on so let me know
what you guys think of this would you
use this or would you rather use a
SmartWatch this has been designed to be
worn pretty comfortably for many hours a
day so it's gonna be kinder to whether
you want to walk around with a thing
sticking out of your ear or talking to
yourself looking like a crazy person or
if you'd rather talk to your wrist so
it's really one or the other a joke a
kid this is pretty cool so again this
has been Erica with pocket now
youtube.com slash Erica Griffin let me
know what you all think about these
products and whether you would really
like to use them and a special shout out
and thank you to pocket now for letting
me accompany them to MWC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
