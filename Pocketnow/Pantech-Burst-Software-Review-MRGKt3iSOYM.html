packing.com and this is the software
review of the Pantech Burst one of the
very first 4g LTE devices for AT&amp;amp;T and
surprisingly with Gingerbread and the
proprietary software that it comes with
it runs very quickly so let's check out
the software so the Pantech Burst is
running Android 2.3 Gingerbread and
surprisingly pantech has not included
too much proprietary software or too
many proprietary user interfaces on this
particular device so let's just go into
some of the live wallpapers and this one
is one that's available on the Pantech
Burst so we'll just go into the live
wallpapers so here we can go in and we
can view the Firefly which is one that
comes on the Pantech Burst we can go
down and view a couple of others that
come on the Pantech Burst and that's the
text River and you can change the words
if you can see it it says Pocket now on
here and we can also view the weather if
we like so it will update periodically
depending on what kind of settings you
have so let's just go back so here we
can view some of the widgets that are
available on the Pantech Burst so we
have all of our Android widgets and we
also have the pantech widget so we can
have the bookmark calendar clock
contacts email all this other great
stuff that's available to the Pantech
Burst when a social snapshot is pretty
nice let's go there I can show you how
this work so we can select a style and
this allows you to update all of your
statuses from various social networks so
let's just click on here let's say we
wanted to add let's choose this one here
so we'll click on that one
and now if the one can log in and add my
own social snapshots and then I can
create it through Facebook Twitter or
through MySpace if you're still using
that so let's just go into some of the
settings on the Pantech Burst here so we
have it personalized which allows us to
change our themes which is a pretty neat
so if you want to have many different
themes you can add them and you can have
your own user specific themes here so if
i want i can choose play and then i can
just go back let me just choose that
again so you can choose play and click
done so now we have the play theme and
as you can see it did change
some of my widgets of a scroll over it
added a music widget here and some other
news and weather information so it does
change your widget so you can have many
different widgets set up for your
various theme so let's go into some of
the applications here so we have a lark
lock which is a proprietary to the
Pantech Burst so amazon kindle we've all
seen that 18 t code scanner 18 t family
map a few AT&amp;amp;T proprietary software
titles that are available on this
particular device so they have google
books I added the Bluetooth GPS because
I was playing around with this device we
have our calculator calendar camcorder
and this does record up to 720p HD it
does not record a full 1080p but with
such a budget device it's a pretty still
a pretty good resolution for a camcorder
and go to camera and this does have a 5
megapixel camera so we can add our GPS
location we can change many different
settings we can change it directly to
the camcorder from here you can change
it to the front and as you can see will
view my camera so there's the front and
the front-facing camera is VGA
resolution so this is pretty good so
I'll just go back to the back one and go
out into the settings and you change
many different things we can add a
single shot multi-shot division shot and
we can change the brightness settings
and we can also go into zoom clock tools
allows you to view world times and we
can also add a timer and a stopwatch so
we have a digital compass and we can
have you that's pointing north this does
also lock onto your GPS location if you
want it to so here you can view that
it's pointing north and it will show us
our speed and our distance traveled we
have our contacts and we have a unit
converter so if I want I can change it
to length volume any one of these nice
units and then now we can change it to
here and we can input our units and then
have it calculate on the bottom we have
a document viewer I don't have any
documents on this particular device
right now it doesn't come with a micro
SD card but if you do have a micro SD
card with many documents you can view
them directly from your Pantech Burst we
can view all of our downloads that we
have downloaded from either the Google
Chrome browser on the device or whatever
other applications of use we have an
email a different email right here that
we can input our email address in we
have Facebook featured apps which 80
thinks are great apps to have we can
scroll over to different categories
and we can view some of those apps most
of them are free but a lot of them are
paid for we have a Flash Player of
course we have our gallery which is just
the stock Android gallery we have our
Gmail handy memo which allows you to
create memos quick and easily from your
Pantech Burst Google Latitude Lync pack
which I'll show you in a few minutes we
have live TV unfortunately they didn't
give me a live TV subscription to try
out on this particular device Google
Maps we have messaging which is our SMS
or MMS messaging application we have
movies which allows you to download
movies directly from the end spot
service so if I wanted to I could uh
let's say I want to download this movie
I can rent it for 24 hours for $4.99 or
I can also watch the trailer looks as
though there's a club price which is a
little bit cheaper our music player but
I don't have any music installed right
now we can scroll over my at&amp;amp;t we have a
navigation which is the google
navigation news and with pc suite
connector which allows you to connect
either through a USB or through Wi-Fi if
you're connected to a Wi-Fi network
we'll have our phone places quick light
which allows you to use the front-facing
camera over a Wi-Fi connection so you
can as use a quick you can share videos
directly from your Pantech Burst to the
quick service or you can also do a
streaming video s board which is a neat
application we should have same group
messages either through MMS or through
SMS so we can just go back we have
Google search we have sketchpad allows
you to draw something so if I wanted to
create a new sketch here and just type
oh I don't know hello or something like
that and save it directly to the Pantech
Burst we have stocks so I can view all
these stocks I can input my own stocks
and I can also view my mobile portfolio
if I have something on here Google Talk
Twitter video player which is the stock
Android player voice dialer voice memo
voice search weather our web which is a
little interesting that they use to
graph it for that we've got YouTube and
also YP mobile so we'll go into some of
the settings here and you can view all
these we also have a setup wizard which
allows you to customize everything we
have wireless and networks so one
interesting thing is this does allow for
tethering and portable
hotspots I'm not sure if the SIM card
that they gave me does have a portable
hotspot but it does allow me to connect
so if you have that on your plan and
you'll probably be able to use the
Pantech Burst to connect to a laptop or
a tablet device so there we have the
tethering activated as you can see the
little blue Wi-Fi signals will just turn
that off we have sound settings so we
can change all those we can change all
of our ringtones if we like and we can
change the display so we can have the
screen timeout or brightness all the
other great stuff language and keyboard
this device does come with swipes so you
cannot change that and it also has the
stock Gingerbread keyboard which is
pretty nice as well ATT software update
so instead of going into about phone and
then going checking update you just go
to the ATT software update and it allows
you to check for an update through the
18d software update service here one
nice feature inside the applications and
if you go down to menu can uninstall
directly from the application instead of
having to go to the menu and then
settings and all the other stuff - a
delete and application engine
application directly from the
applications folders so I'll run a speed
test unfortunately I don't have LTE
service in my area so I'll begin this
test just running on HSPA+ I was able to
get eight point one five megabits per
second download and two point four three
megabits per second upload so that's
pretty good speeds for just two HSPA+ so
now we'll run a few benchmark tests so
on smart bench 2012 I was able to get
2129 and the productivity index on the
gaming index I got 3,000 160s was really
fast so let's do another benchmark so
one quarter and standardized over to get
2947 so now I'll run the Linpack pro so
running a single thread on Linpack Pro I
was able to get fifty one point two
seven four in flux at one point six
three seconds now running multi thread
and I was able to eighty point five four
eight in flops in two point zero nine
seconds on that multi thread so this has
been the software review of the Pantech
Burst on eighty one of the very first 4g
LTE devices for eighteen t if you like
our videos make sure you give us a
thumbs up and also leave some comments
down below you can check out the
unboxing video I'll post a link right

right about here stay tuned for the
final review coming up next and thanks
