proposed hands-free experience on the
Moto X is useful look no further I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and these are the best uses for
touchless control on the Moto X Motorola
introduced a host of new and unique
features for its latest handsets such as
the x8 computing system and Motorola
skip which we've covered in a video
yesterday one of the unquestionably
awesome benefits of the x8 computing
system however is the low-power core
that's dedicated to natural language
processing it's always listening for
your voice and ready to answer your
commands or questions at any given time
essentially saying okay Google now
activates a local recording that is then
sent to Google service for decoding
once you finish speaking and the phone
unlocks the Google search application
then determines what sort of action
should be taken the brunt of what
touchless control as Motorola calls it
will be used for quick hands-free google
searches but that's only the tip of the
iceberg if you've spent any time cueing
voice action commands with Google Search
application you know the service is
equipped for all sorts of different
actions but paired with a totally
hands-free experience there are some
commands that become even more awesome
for example many of us stream music from
our phone well in the car changing music
on your phone is like it or not a
distraction and sometimes more tedious
than simply hitting a number for a
preset radio station on your car stereo
using touchless control you can simply
say okay Google now play Tears for Fears
you can name an album song or artist and
you can choose your preferred music
applications such as google music or
Spotify this specific application could
be more robust such as having the
ability to play one of your playlists or
an entire artists discography but the
ability to just speak the name of the
song you want to listen to is certainly
nice or say you're out somewhere and
hear a song playing and you want to know
the name there are a handful of
applications that will listen to a small
portion of the song and give you all
sorts of information on it but it never
fails I always seem to take too long to
open the app and miss the song but
touchless control you can start the
search without touching your phone or
fumbling through your home screens
trying to find this sound hound or
Shazam app simply say okay Google now
what song is this there
listen to a short clip of the song and
speak the answer to you this hands-free
ability also makes it possible to send
an email through voice commands which
may sound a bit silly and lazy but I
assure you it comes in handy especially
in our line of work
save the ok Google now command emailed
say the name of the contact you want
subject the topic of the message and
then message for a better example say ok
Google now email Michael Fisher subject
Hey message jerk period whether you're
in the kitchen cooking a new recipe or
sitting at your desk in need of some
unit or currency conversions Google
search can do all the heavy lifting for
you speak ok Google now and state the
conversion or simple math equation you
need answered in this case we converted
cups to liters but you can do all sorts
of math equations such as cube roots
simple addition and even fraction
conversions to decimals on top of that
you can use Google to fact-check ok
Google now how old was Nikola Tesla or
ok Google now when will the Sun set
today and if that simply doesn't do it
for you
you can also launch web pages without
ever touching your phone ok Google now
go to pocketnow.com and one of the
features motorola effectively showed off
was the ability to set an alarm
hands-free while laying in bed ok google
now set an alarm for 9 a.m. or you can
use this feature as a timer
ok Google now set an alarm for 24
minutes from now the best part of
setting an alarm is that it also works
for third-party alarm apps such as
timely but this isn't the extent of what
you can do with touchless control you
can ask for directions to somewhere or a
map of some place you can call people or
open applications set calendar
appointments and reminders or even post
to Google+ the actions we've mentioned
here are the ones that have stuck out
most to us in our short time with a Moto
X and touchless control the ones that
feel the most useful to us the question
we want you to answer though is is
touchless control a useful feature or a
gimmick so far we're leaning towards the
latter as it's come in handy in many
different situations in less than a week
it's also encouraging us to use voice
commands more than we normally would but
we're not certain that will last don't
forget to join the discussion below by
sharing your thoughts
touchless control and the Moto X and be
sure to give us a thumbs up they let us
know you enjoyed the video and found it
helpful subscribe to see more videos
