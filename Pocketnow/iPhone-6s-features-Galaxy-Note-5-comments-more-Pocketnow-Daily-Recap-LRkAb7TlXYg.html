like shabby at him on this no but then
that would mean he's a very good-looking
guy pocketnow Knightley and I should
probably consider that man I met I dare
you to do the Harlem shake and does that
mean that I could dare you to dance that
song from LMFAO that's right it's that
time of the week I am I marry that this
is pocket now and this is the parking
out daily recap the last week monday was
about voicemail oddly Apple has this
very weird patent where they want to
transcribe voicemail through Siri and I
asked you if you still care about the
service we had 487 comments we start
with one that says what is voicemail and
I have to agree I don't know either
voicemail what is this 2001 and yeah I
can remember the last time that I
actually visited my inbox there are
still some situations where you need to
leave a voicemail but no reason to
really receive one unless your grandma's
calling and that's the thing voicemail
can be much more practical to certain
people so it doesn't make sense for
apple try to figure something out even
if the receiver won't really care on
Tuesday we landed some very interesting
leaked photos of the galaxy note 5 and I
asked you if you would wait for this
phone or grab the note 4 or keep the
note 4 we had many of the comments
thanks a lot guys we start with no I'll
wait for the note 6 Sampson might learn
from its previous mistakes with the s6
and n5 and yeah it could be the case but
the phones are selling so who knows
we'll see how this one performs in the
end since it was already announced as a
note for owner the only reason I would
get the note 5 is that the software is
more fluent and toned down and true that
is the only reason why would leave the
note edge because the software on that
phone sucks and Samsung has done a good
job so we'll see once i give it a try as
much as i hate to say it I bet the
galaxy note 5 is justin s6 s6 edge no
expandability and no removable battery
it just seems too obvious at this point
in my opinion and it ended up being that
way which is very sad at this point
because this was the no holds bar
expandable smartphone power
oh Sh and now it turned out to be a very
cute boom and that was that once they
the news were about Apple music I asked
you if exclusive albums and deals with
stereo to Apple music since the new dr
dre album is exclusive to Apple music
and well we had 461 comments we start
with the short answer no the long answer
no and there were a ton of lights so I
guess everybody says no no it just makes
him look like a sellout and well he kind
of is he's an Apple employee now but I
do get your point and it would make
another point for other artists they
would pretty much just sell out to a
purpose and limit the availability of
their product to other users which is
bad music is also a business why would
artists release an album just for a few
million people when they can get 10
times more exposure by releasing it to
everyone well it is a business and these
deals are not exclusive for just
anything they're exclusive for money so
obviously artists look for the cost of
opportunity and find a way to get that
money from Apple so it doesn't make
sense for artists to do it it's just
really sad as back in the day there was
no such thing as oh the CD is only
available here and that's bad Thursday
was about the gear a and probable tablet
that we're supposed to happen it
unpacked in the end neither of both
happened but I asked you which one would
you want to be announced at this event
we had 358 comments out of which one of
them says honestly I don't care i just
want that note 5 and that's pretty much
what we got the gear a of course since
the current available smartwatches don't
provide a lot and there was a lot of
promise with the SmartWatch we ended up
getting a teaser in the end and even
though it looks horrible it looks really
functional so hey we could be in for a
surprise at Aoife I will take a samsung
tablet over a galaxy gear offering just
not convinced that a SmartWatch is all
that useful yet and it depends on the
SmartWatch gear smartwatches aren't
really that bad particularly the Tizen
models a lot more functional than
Android wear for example and I am
expecting a lot from this gear s2 again
even though it looks uglier than dirt
finally on Friday the sad news were
about HTC's job cuts and I asked you
what would you recommend
but he should do for it to return to its
limelight we had 883 comments thanks a
lot guys we start with make a deal with
Microsoft so they can promote the next
HTC flagship as a Windows 10 unit
Windows is in need of flagships yes
windows is in need of lectures but that
didn't work all well for nokia and it
didn't work well for HTC in the past you
have to remember HTC was one of the
first OEMs from windows mobile and with
the whole iphone thing things just fell
off it makes sense for hcc to move to
android it just isn't getting the
popularity that it was looking for they
need a bigger change than what was
brought with the one inmate and one m9
you can't make spec changes to a device
and call it new yes you can companies
have succeeded with the Samsung Apple
have done so the problem is that there
aren't things that are great about HTC
smartphones like the camera and that's
weird HEC had great cameras in the past
we don't know what's going on here so
again it just needs to be more reliable
one number two it just needs to have
more publicity and have more
availability just destroy all the lines
and then recreate new product lines that
have a logical name to signify low mid
and high end and figure out your camera
yes there are a ton of HTC smartphones
that just dilute the whole concept of
the one smartphone that is great and
these other material are phones aren't
really bad so that does dilute the
branding it's happened to Sam sing as
well I feel that HTC should stick to
their One m8 when am 91 and 10 but then
again make those phones really great and
publicize them again I feel that HTC
smartphones are amazing I've been a
really big fan since the old days from
compaq what HTC was just an odm and I
really do wish for HTC to regain its
popularity in the end that's it for the
parking out daily recap thank you very
