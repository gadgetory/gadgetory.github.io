major delays due to the dramatic changes
in its design Apple watch Series 3 is
rumored to not go beyond the 2017 launch
and for those of you wanting to use the
Google assistant on the Big C button on
the galaxy s 8 there's actually a
solution I'm Jaime Rivera and I could do
this all day when arriving to the gym
said no one ever this is PocketNow daily
the official news today start with deals
to a certain degree for those of you
that thought that $90 for unlimited plus
on AT&amp;amp;T was crazy it is but the company
is actually trying to make this a little
more attractive by bundling HBO within
the subscription and listen to this this
is now available to you even if you
don't have their DirecTV service clearly
AT&amp;amp;T wants to be more of a media company
now and that's right now how about if we
talk about Lenovo we rarely discuss this
company but the company made some
headlines with their yoga book we love
their Android variant we never got to
test the Windows variant but there was a
rumor of a Chrome OS variant and that
rumor just pretty much got killed the
company claimed that it was working on
it it killed it and didn't say why it's
sad it's just the yoga book is a great
concept but I feel that it needs a
little more work and for those of you
that join us in considering vixx B to be
much of a commitment with Samsung
actually adding a button to the galaxy s
8 well you can actually change this I
don't really think you need to because
the home button is still mapped to the
Google assistant on a Galaxy s8 we
proved that in our hands-on but if you
would simply like the Google assistant
to work on the bixby button you actually
can do this there is a tweak that you
would have to download you can learn
more in the description obviously you'll
also need to wait for your Galaxy as a
well one rather interesting twist is the
future of the Apple watch Apple took a
year-and-a-half to launch the refresh
just like it did with the first
generation iPhone and like it's done
with the first generation of many
products but it seemed that it was only
going to happen then we've got some
trusted sources claiming that the Apple
watch Series three is coming
September and that is a big deal mainly
because you pay $400 for a SmartWatch
that is going to be obsolete within the
next few months that's not how fashion
companies work Apple let's see how that
goes and finally the very interesting
news do they have to do with the iPhone
X iPhone 8 or whatever you want to call
this thing mainly because apparently
Apple is going to find delays and delays
our Apple is what I'm gonna state mainly
because the company will most probably
still announce the product in September
make it available later that month and
then just run out of stock like it
usually does but apparently the company
is struggling with OLED displays mainly
because of the forced touch technology
that have includes in addition to the
lamination that the company wants to
provide to this display it makes all the
sense in the world I mean if you're
giving us a better display obviously it
could take you some changes that's great
but apparently Apple's OLED demand has
been so staggering that Samsung is going
to need to repurpose certain of as'
display factories just to get this done
so it leads me to the question of the
day tell me something do you think that
if Apple would pull another one of those
stunts where the company just runs out
of stock of iPhones you think that it
would play well mainly with devices like
the LG G 6 and galaxy s 8 oh in my case
I think it won't I think the company
played that game for a while and it
worked for them but right now if Apple
doesn't figure out how to meet the man
I'm sure people will start looking
elsewhere but anyways there's a comment
