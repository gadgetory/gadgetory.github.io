[Laughter]
hello everybody and welcome to the
weekly recorded on February 27th here in
Barcelona Spain as the entire team is
here for MWC 2019 all right so I wanted
to start moving the podcast to a more
focused format and thank you by the way
for all of your feedback on it over the
last couple of episodes we have gone
ahead and done that with this episode
where we also have a special guest in
Nicole Scott of mobile geeks so
basically what I did was I wanted
everybody to think of their one favorite
thing from Mobile World Congress this
year instead of going through so many
different topics and talking about so
many things all at once I wanted
everyone to pick the one thing they
truly liked and that's exactly what
we're talking about in this episode I'm
not gonna spoil anything but we do have
Nicole Scott of mobile geeks as our
special guest I interview her in the
first half of this podcast and then in
the last half of the podcast we have
myself Adam from XDA and of course hi
mate of Ada and the three of us talk
about our favorite things at MWC cheers
gt-r's tea Cheers
day three trying to make sure our voices
don't go away oh yeah I've been doing
that by getting lots of sleep one of the
few I feel like not last night but the
other night I actually got eight hours
the other day oh really okay I didn't
set my alarm so I just naturally slept
seven hours and 45 minutes it's really
great to have you on the when was the
last time did I have you on after I took
on the weekly yet I don't think so okay
welcome back No thank you really happy
really happy to make the first happen
once again yeah great
alright so we're gonna get right into it
as I'm trying to make the podcast a
little bit more focused in terms of its
topics I'm going to have a segment a
little bit later actually talking about
my favorite thing at MWC we're also
gonna have Jaime and Adam a little bit
later but for this one super special
special guest of course the floor is
yours
I see bated a lot what topic I should
bring up and I don't think that you can
get around the mate X the huawei mate X
as the big kind of topic of the show it
was released here unlike Samsung Galaxy
fold which was a few days before yeah I
still buy and go ahead so actually that
that's one of the things that I've been
asking people do you think that we as
media love the phone more because we've
been able to touch it and have access to
it I think so but I don't want to put it
past wall way the the level of
engineering that they've managed to put
into that to prove to consumers and to
for now us that that kind of form factor
is absolutely possible and can actually
be great and I mean I'm of two minds
right I do believe that the mate X might
be technically superior to the fold like
just like the way that it's one display
makes it a little more elegant the way
that there's the cameras down the side
the way that just it just it's quite
future when you fold it out oh yeah but
I think that technically the the fold
might be a better device because it
shields the display because the displays
on the inside right because it's outside
versus inside yeah right and yeah
Samsung's construction isn't as elegant
right with three displays at three
displays two displays two displays right
the one on the inside of the one on the
outside though 8.8 right so we have like
it's not as elegant I'll give you that
but like I think that it might be the
more durable construction considering
that we have plastic display now it's
gonna be scratch a bull yeah it's not
gonna shatter but I remember the last
plastic display phone I reviewed and I
actually used it for I think like eight
six eight six eight months sure and
there's like pixel bleeding there's dead
pixels like the display just doesn't
stack up
did you see the there there can be a
crease of sort in the middle I'm sure
that's just gonna be par for the course
but is that going to be a deal-breaker
considering this as the form factor
they've gone with I think that that
crease in the middle is exactly where
we're gonna see those dead pixels in the
pixel
and all of yours right so I I think that
the physical construction right now like
we're gonna see problems would you would
you believe not believe rather let me
rephrase that if you were to have this
phone as a daily driver do you think
that it would make you coddle it do you
think that it would make you change how
let's say rough you might be with your
tech because I know a lot of us in this
industry we just tossed everything
around so much this is not one of those
phones I feels like it should be so when
Xiaomi came out with that for ceramic
phone yes I didn't bring it out of the
studio I was like oh this it was sliding
all over the place and I knew I was like
I'm gonna break it I'm gonna break it so
I didn't bring it out right like it
would definitely make me change my
habits like mostly because I remember
there was one point in my career was I
was like so I shouldn't carry a metal
nail file in my purse that's that's
pretty hard on the tech right so like
I'm less careful than most people yeah
with their technology so I would be
terrified I just can't imagine we all
know those people who do that they just
throw their phones in their bag and then
of course with I don't remember who
actually did that test but they put a
phone into a backpack and just went like
that a bunch and yeah of course
like if the phone comes out looking okay
then cool but this is literally all
scream scream it's Oscar and I like I'm
just very afraid of the like they gave
it a case because they know about this
issue right but at the same time like
though it's a first-generation right and
it's a little bit between Samsung and
hallway the foldable phone proves which
company is more innovative right like
kind of this moment of like eye catching
the consumer to be like look at the
innovation in this company right and
right now I think hallway definitely won
that race right by having the phone that
just technically seems like thinner and
doesn't have a space in between and
though I think both phones have a crease
right I'm sure I heard that the the
galaxy fold did have a noticeable crease
when it was folded over even though
there was a gap because I kind of have
seen the gap might I can I keep that
crease from happening but I guess it's
not big enough I mean I'm a surface book
user I don't mind the gap
it won't it definitely won't be the kind
of gap that we saw on the axon em
definitely
but that was literally a dual-screen
device it's a kind of a different thing
so the term practicality that is
practical a word to use for this find X
or find X let me the made X I mean I
think that for a first generation device
it's one of those just like let's catch
the future let's like figure out this
form factor let's just come I mean it
doesn't matter so much how practical it
is Gen 1 right is is about working out
those bugs it's for early tech adopters
and Beyonce like those like you know big
influencers that are gonna be they look
at me in my fancy phone who would be
besides gal gadot because she's very
signed by Huawei who would be the
celebrity that that they tap in order to
do this kind of phone I think that'd be
pretty interesting but not even that not
even just that you know just of the
impracticality of a phone like this I
could if you get one scratch any OCD
it's cute you're gonna die you're gonna
die looking at this thing that's why I'm
tending to be like well you know Samsung
though everyone's kind of knocking on
them for being less innovative they're
not coming to the table of life right
the thing is though they're less
exciting their execution is stronger
right like I've been always been drawn a
little bit more towards the galaxy line
over the mate line even though the
camera might be a little bit better so
right I was such a fangirl of Huawei
something changed right just like um I
find of like maybe it was like the
attitude the the advertising of the
company that's kind of started curdling
against me this influencer thing how
they were working with influencers that
were just like there's four four cameras
on the back right and I'm just like you
keep that person a phone for like three
days and they never noticed there was
only three cameras on the back like so
like it just like like maybe from a tech
perspective tech journalists perspective
sure I started to disrespect them of the
word respect them just a little bit less
um but like you're a little bit
incredulous yeah yeah you're the best
it doesn't think like wow he has
we remember Huawei like from the p9 yeah
and I loved I loved so hard on this
phone but just somehow it feels like
Samsung has come out with a more
business-focused device and I'm more
business right like I run my business
from my phone I travel a lot I do like
and I love taking great photos but like
even though I'm a tech reviewer and want
the best the 5% difference on the camera
is like not enough to have me like make
up make other decisions so like III have
gone a little bit more mainstream with
my tech selection that I am willing to
make sacrifices like I'm using a a one
plus client like 16 McClaren right this
definitely does not have the best
low-light camera out there it's not not
great but that's the reason why I keep
coming back to that term because you
bring up the oneplus 60 my battery's
about to die over there there's okay
I'll change it if I need to
you mentioned the oneplus 60 as far as
practicality goes I think that that
software is probably the best
representation of that turn so we even
then you know emu I remember you were
singing its praises who knows how it's
going to react to this kind of form
factor the way that's going to change
things up I'm sure while we have done
their homework yeah by the continuity of
the galaxy fold yeah actually enjoyed
that a lot me too me too and the fact
that Samsung had like I think that their
execution on the foldable form factor
might be a little bit stronger than
hallways like I think that like from
like a technical perspective on things
really just working like Samsung I think
is above hallway and that kind of that
kind of realm like there's definitely
nothing wrong with the mate xx it's it's
one of the best maybe arguably the best
phone on the market right like the
camera is great the UI is fine the
battery life is baller like there's like
so many things to really like about it
but I think that you know for my use
case scenario Samsung has like from
their feature creep in the past they've
figured out how to make things a little
more useful within their operating
system indeed
I called the maid the maid acts the
wallpaper TV of phones because it is
literally all display all of the
processing happens in that big bar on
the side how did you feel about that
that form factor on their because they
made a big didn't make a big deal about
it you can hold like a grip there's I
think it's totally fine like this like
grip thing Michael hold it out you it
knocked on the subway I mean I would be
terrified to take that thing on the
subway someone would rob me
I was watched say yeah I still am so
weary of having any of these new devices
like anywhere right now because it's it
immediately paint you as a target in
Barcelona which is a haunt of lots of
robbery yeah I was using the S 10 and
someone was just like did you buy that I
was like no where'd you get it I was
like from Samsung and they're like how
do you like it show me the fingerprint I
mean uh and I was like okay step away
step away from the phone the camera is
going to die during this next question
but if it does let's just keep talking
and while I swapped the battery I'm like
waiting for it like the indicator is
going one more time going back to the
practicality term price everyone
everyone had it's not matter really
doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean I
was initially really shocked not
affordable not for you know what they
could make it $5,000 they was so so out
is that a luxury afforded to the Galaxy
fold do you think at 1980 is it 1980
1970 300 I mean I think Huawei will drop
the price right now it's like it's like
2300 like let's like we're gonna set
ourselves as a luxury brand room or
expense at the Samsung we have more tech
it's right so like they will drop the
price I think just initially that are
like painting a picture of their you
know dominance and their luxury blah
blah blah yeah right I think the price
will come down to compete with the fold
right and then I think that we're going
to see they could just knock they could
not lower the price and I think they're
they're still gonna sell out technology
enthusiasts will buy it right we will
buy it and early adopters will buy it
and rendition does Google people to be
early testers
and I think like how many average people
have said to me I'm gonna get that phone
anyways I'll sell it after I really like
it's true like even just to have it a
lot of people will do it I mean I think
that the price like if you think about
there's a few luxury car makers that are
out there right and you talk to them
about them selling cars and they sell
their cars for eighty thousand dollars
and actually one of them told me I could
have put my car out for a hundred and
ten thousand dollars and that first
initial wave of people who would buy it
they they would pay fifty thousand
dollars more actually that first set of
people the price could be almost
anything and they're gonna do it anyways
so while we just sort of hit that upper
echelon you feel I think and I honestly
think that it doesn't matter I'm just
talking to affect sales like everyone's
like I'm wind jam not gonna bite it's
too expensive for me sure yeah but the
people who will chunk down who will pay
for it we'll do it at 2,000 or 3,000
right yeah I do think that you're right
it makes me a tiny bit sad but I do
think you're right no there goes the
camera I'm going to change that up while
I pivot a little bit I should want to
pivot this topical oh it's still related
I made a comment a little while back - I
want to say it was - Issa mm-hmm that
phones are starting to get really
exciting but she and I had a
conversation over
LG's air motion and their new biometric
features when the time of flight camera
on the front she asked me why and I
swear this is we're still related to
foldables um she asked me why people are
so mad at LG quote-unquote for having
these features that they that seems so
impractical or they that seem so
off-base mm-hm
and why why people are making such a big
deal about it and what I told her was
consumers generally want to have more
that's what they're used to more power
more audio more spec and in this case
what people are excited about is
basically just more screen right and
that's really all these foldables are I
guess I guess what I'm saying here is
like what are your general thoughts
about foldables as a category is it
am i off base by by thinking that way no
I mean so for me
I've actually sweet a lot on the last
few days I'm not like first I was like
no this is probably gonna be another
Google glass and then I was like oh
actually you know what I think in the
next 10 years everyone we know will have
have one either will have one or someone
that we know will have one I think 10 is
a safe number yes yeah I think tons of
it like a very conservative safe number
yeah right like I think over the next
two years we're gonna try to figure out
how this foldable form factor works best
right and in that iterative time right
we're gonna see a lot of mistakes we're
gonna see a lot of stuff and I think the
price is gonna need to come down right
for someone other than that crazy
segment to buy them but I do I do think
that it is practical right ok I think I
think it's practical if you want to try
to envision the future of 5g in the way
that 5g can really be exciting right
like if we take if we remove a lot of
the processing power from the device and
5g just enables this really big base of
like data and interaction and like we're
able to use that screen real estate to
interact with an actual powerful
back-end right you know real computers
link like link to this dumb device which
is where we're altima we headed yeah wit
with 5g so having this you know folding
out display that suddenly we have a lot
more productivity space I think
absolutely that but in the meantime I'm
telling me that I can stream Netflix
better
or like you know like just a lot of
their use cases I think are too early
and not useful enough for the consumer
but we are in Gen one right so it's it's
it's exciting it's really exciting it's
interesting yeah I agree with you there
the the fact that we're in generation 1
and they're already this it's good
they're good good they're it's kind of
surprising how well they were able to
execute so far yeah think of like Gen 1
of smartphones as we remember them it
was such a different world that's a
different world I mean like the first
iPhone didn't even have 3G yeah that's
right like you think if you just think
about it like and then what when when we
had the first like convertibles right we
didn't know which hint was gonna be the
most successful foreign factor for the
hinges for us to go into tablet form and
then the dominant hinge and it'll be
coming up the the yoga hinge basically
right like surface does have a like a
mechanical mechanism but they're in the
minority right and I think that now with
the foldable form factor we're gonna
start to explore that is the display on
the inside it's a display on the outside
like how or how will this physical
device be set up in order for us to get
the most out of it right and I think
Samsung does present the most
interesting case between the two
manufacturers with their triple app
capability right and like the app
continuity right like and this is why I
think that people can't discount the
fold because I think Samsung has really
thought through this kind of like let's
make this them as like productivity
based is useful like let's not just
focus in on like being able to stream
more video right or take better selfies
like ours play more games which is kind
of where I came out came with that like
I have I have a thought with the fold
and honestly what the made X that you
know open up open up the game and then
unfold and all of a sudden you have like
yeah as long as mobile gaming finally
gets to like console level yeah I think
it could be fantastic and like 5g will
enable that Yeah right like 5g will
enable you to have like true console
gaming on a dumb device mm-hmm right so
I mean like we're definitely getting
there it's just right now I think like
hmm we have to forgive it a little bit
it's gen1 like like think about the
first Google glass right or like we
could actually be in a Google the last
scenario right that this foldable form
factor actually is it just doesn't take
off yeah if the buzz is anything to be
if before you believe the buzz people
are really buzzing about it yeah Google
glass was a very like insulated like
reaction I didn't feel like the general
person was really like but when it comes
to the foldable and you see the made X
that's always gonna be a crowd-pleasing
demo you know it was so funny right
after the samsung launched I went for
lunch with a friend and so I have to ask
you about that phone and I thought I
thought Stan because like this is the
one that you know is for sale and people
can buy and then like forwards later I
was like oh right right the phone that
no one's gonna buy yeah right and the
but but the phone that everyone's
talking about right and and it took me a
minute to readjust to the fact that it's
not just tech enthusiasts and early
adopters that are going to be jazzed
about this phone yeah on the way to the
event and the guy that was driving was
like all Samsung mmm-hmm
because he saw that yeah the signs
robbed Samsung what are they announcing
now and I'm like well I mean they're
there next s phone but they might have a
phone that folds and he like turned
around and he was like in full that was
hilarious
and imagine what that cab driver would
have said if you saw the mate X but
obviously it's a word I know you were
saying before the cast is probably a
cliche answer but you know it's it's
still a worthy answer I think I think
that it is going to be on the minds of
people for a while a post MWC sure and
that thing's gonna be what April ya know
see a pronoun fairly soon so hopefully
we're gonna be able to take a look at it
and use it in a real-world scenarios and
whatnot okay so we're gonna move to our
next segment where we're gonna have a
couple more people on thank you so much
for being on thank you so much for
having me I'm gonna give you the
all-important all what's the term I'm
looking for I'm gonna give you the
really advantageous section the middle
of the podcast for your loan and add
your own mid-roll oh so whatever you got
going on to go and tell them oh yeah so
I have mobile geeks calm I talk about
the future of mobility so also
like future form factors of smartphones
but also ride-sharing smart city like
I'm really looking at like future of
work and like the holistic way that how
we exist as people is fundamentally
changing five g's one of those
components new form factors like this is
one of those so if you follow me at
Nicole underscore scooter you can check
that out
get into the show notes in the
description maybe Jules will put it like
right Oh Jules Jules will do that right
cool I love anybody watching the video
version yes this is my keyboard yeah
which part all right mics up mics up
hello
and we're back okay so we have some of
our representatives of the company here
we have of course I may hear from
PocketNow been doing the daily very
vigilantly here during MWC it's been
crazy
I love I still love no one's commented
on me at the beginning of that one where
I said I'm high I believe it I we're
currently here at the Qualcomm booth
there is a toast to 5g it's far get out
daily its 5g baby hey I got into it
earlier they're only like 10,000 views
on it but I was kind of disappointed
nobody commented on me saying 5g baby
it's just what they've come to expect
from you yeah exactly like when at when
I'm in my video I'm very like it's me
you know very very zen actually we'll
talk about it in a second but I I'm very
zen however when I'm one of the three
plus five
however when I'm on somebody else's
video I'm crazy and then we have you can
introduce yourself by the way from
xda-developers
but I yeah Josh here seems to think my
name is Andy so I blanked one time I
know you think I'm Andy forever yeah
also remember to float that mic near you
oh yeah man forever huh
all right so I had a really great talk
with Nicole Scott mobile geeks
thank you again Nicole but I wasn't
there well you were kind of busy
I love conversation but you also love
beautiful helicopter rides don't you are
you jealous
you know I'm here's the thing
I'm only harping on it because you did
too because you wanted me on it too yeah
and I wasn't able to make it and I
appreciate you trying so I so in the
spirit of solidarity I am also but it's
fine it looked like a really great time
but I had a lot of really good stuff
today not not the least of which was
talking to Nicole for the podcast so you
know it's been a productive day for me
and I was able to talk to functionality
and this is not part of our topic I am
taking a couple of minutes to just sort
of check in a little bit but I had a
little bit of time with functionality
and I love that name by the way yeah and
I love the fact that they used the FX I
was like devotion that isolate the
moment that I saw I'm like function what
yeah yeah why are we factoring equations
or what welcome to yeah well go to our
company long division I just blanked out
on the point that I wanted to make
something that we were saying earlier
shoot I'm trying to remember oh they
have actually seen a lot of my videos
not just on pocket now or previous pre
previous videos from Android thority but
also my videos on JV and they were like
you're so sad dude on that one because
we had champagne flutes
it was very nice yeah and also yeah I
wish people could see just the kind of
work you put into the daily because it's
like it's clockwork you have such a
great flow on that you have to the
problem is because I have to send the
files to Sam at the VA go you like the
longer the file the longer the more
mistakes I make the longer the file the
more time it will take for the file to
get to them yeah and I'm also it's also
really fun to see how you talk to diego
through the camera
I have a long monologue conversation
alright so um one thing I wanted to do
for like at least a minute is have you
check in a little bit we're gonna get
into our focus topic which is our one
favorite thing from MWC and I mean thing
I don't want to go too far into too many
things but just a general usage this is
your first MWC yeah first conference of
any of this scale yeah exactly
overwhelming but in a good way
every every any general thoughts of MWC
you want to share um it's like kind of
organized chaos it's you can kind like
oh wait a sec yes that's very true
that's this organized chaos it's also
because I mean it's Vegas ya know it's
it's I'm really enjoying it there's lots
of cool technology it's like you go
around the stuff that you didn't even
think of what exists like the ZTE robots
to play music that thing is really cool
have you seen that okay so I walked by
all of us happening and I just remember
thinking to myself it's not even that
good like it's a very very simple
melodic oh yeah and there's that just
that one I'm trying to member of which
one it was it's just that one robot that
hits the one drum it doesn't even do
anything special just just like that
dude I haven't really had time to like
walk around walk around but there's
still that you feel better um when we
walked around
we've only been in hall 3 yeah yeah bit
of hall one and then mostly halter but
how one is where everything is like the
hottest stuff is there anyway of course
yes but there I need to okay for the
future I do want to make sure I make it
out to the things where like the the the
the Taiwan delegation are we're all of
the ancillary products that are coming
out of that part of the world are and
you know cuz sometimes there's some
exciting stuff there and if you sleep on
it it's going to appear in another
fashion sometime later maybe on
Kickstarter and then you you don't
realize that you saw before
one yeah I think this one's I call seven
I think all seven they have a lot of
those in any case okay Nicole gave us a
really great talk about the mate ex that
was her absolute favorite thing here at
MWC she did she did pepper in a little
bit of talk about 5g because I think
she's genuinely excited about it if not
because 5g itself is actually exciting
but also because she I have a feeling
she feels a little um she feels that
journalistic vibe going right now
because a lot of people in her eyes are
talking about 5g in the wrong terms yeah
yeah and she's happy to educate yeah
so kudos gonna call for that but with
that in mind
Jaime we'll start with you tell me your
favorite thing two things okay I'll give
you two two things you run this channel
alright two things the first one I have
to give it to the main X sure I okay
the video sadly not live yet I'm working
on it but I did not recommend that I
marked it when they provided the price
you can watch my episode of the daily
two days ago three days ago I was like
what $2,300
they're crazy yada yada yada and then I
walk into the Huawei party and they
allow me to use it mmm and I was one of
the few people that was allowed to use
it because I have a really good it so I
get along really well with certain of
the people there they're like just hold
it do it and I'm like can I film myself
doing it they're like yes you can mmm oh
my god okay so the reason why I like the
made X is not because I believe in
foldables it's not that I don't believe
it it's just if they are going to deter
the current experience of a smartphone
then we have a problem because I'm not
willing to carry them in my pocket
yeah the thing about the made X is if
you have ever held the Galaxy Note 9
you've held the main X oh elaborate you
know this magining it is literally that
footprint a little thicker and and
obviously a lot er know what it is
literally that well but what you mean is
when it's folded yeah we're not going to
fold it okay okay and then when you
extend
that it's like a kid below aces dude hmm
which I've not used by notes fan well I
mean Amazon charges a lot of money for
it over the you know over the argument
that it's so thin and light and whatever
yeah you know and so for me it's like I
have not held nobody's held a galaxy the
galaxy fold they haven't allowed anybody
to touch it
true and so I can't I wish I could say
it's the galaxy book but you know the
sorry the galaxy fold but they are not
allowing anybody to touch it so I can't
and it would have not been the made X if
I did not have time with it and I
there's a video there's a video by the
time the podcasts go podcast goes live
the video will already be live ok that's
good so I'm sure that there will be
links to it and it's just I'm like okay
fine that for me was problem solve right
there if the foldable can feel like a
smartphone great that and it feels like
a tablet remember that last point he
just made yeah
for our cuz we Adam and I have already
kind of planned out while we're gonna
talk about a little bit later anyway
your second thing number two I have
kudos to Samsung okay I was a little
upset over our pre-brief of the galaxy s
10 and them having a 5g phone that we
couldn't touch and I'm like MWC is gonna
be the show of everybody bringing
prototypes that nobody can touch behind
glass and you get to see 5g Samsung was
the only company that showed not a
prototype because if you see one plus
you see all the all the other companies
they brought their 5g so yeah yeah even
LG LG brought their LG be 50 but I
wasn't I wasn't part of the that was it
a working device at the event as far as
5g goes no no no did it work
it worked yeah I've been I've been ad
the LG booth many times over last okay
then I'm gonna have to give kudos to
both Samsung and LG okay okay Samsung
and LG because they were able to bring
usable 5g phones yeah I spent some time
with the Galaxy S 10 5g it works like it
works there is a 5g tower in Hall too we
ran some real-life tests go do the go do
the check and you can go see the you can
go see
it's our and halt to its there okay yes
we could any and I thought that it was
like a mock-up or anything I actually I
literally put the phone on airplane mode
I swapped it out I I saw what it was
connected to it is a 5g connection
that's cool I wish we could take these
phones from each of the booths in Hall
three and take it to that Tower
yeah dude but here's the thing think
about it it's not even close to halt to
all twos in the other yeah it's in the
other end yeah so honestly I have to say
it man I have to give kudos to them for
bringing products that work that like
you know it's we've been hearing about
5g for so long but to actually see
products that that use it obviously
right now you can't tell the difference
between 5g at Elte there's so much more
to go you know yeah there is so much
more to go but they were showing me this
working demo in the case of samsung
let's say you're watching an MLB game
because there is so much data being
streamed through 5g the demo is that if
you're watching an MLB game on your
phone you literally have access to all
the cameras stream than the real times
it's not just watching so it's not just
you watching the the whatever stream
with the producer deciding what you're
watching if you want to watch the whole
game from the pitchers perspective you
can and you can't just and wait a sec
wait for it it's then it's not a lot
just that you can see what the pitcher
is doing you can rotate the camera
around him and choose the angle hmm that
is pretty awesome I was like how crazy
is that but you know it's it's funny you
mentioned baseball that's a really great
that's a really great example obviously
because of where we are it's gonna be on
the soccer pitch it's gonna be a
football game that's gonna be the first
major one imagin World Cup in 5g no dude
okay so again you we've been hearing the
topic of 5g for the longest time yeah
here if you have not gone to the Samsung
booth do so spend some time with it
it is crazy cool crazy cool we shouldn't
we shouldn't keep certain players out of
the discussion I mean like earlier when
I was talking to Nicole we never touched
upon TCL dragon hinge I just want to be
sure that I say that
loud just those words but also as far as
5g is concerned xiaomi even has their me
mix three and five oh yeah yeah they so
kudos to them as well because that's at
the booth does it work I like yeah okay
kudos to show me - so here's the thing
the the reason why I've got that press
conference of Xiaomi was insane dude you
could not walk yeah you like I know that
they had the phone and everything I just
I couldn't see it hmm I couldn't see it
and then you were at the LG event I
wasn't able to be there on time
yeah the LG event where yeah the v50
there are units floating around at the
booth I've been actually using one a
video will be coming hopefully by the
time this podcast comes out but yeah the
V 50 I mean it's triple camera on the
front
5050 no tof on the front so no hat no
air motion no hand ID oh I'm sorry I'm
sorry
LG guys you know I've been a fan of your
work for years but not this all right
cool thing as you can switch it off I
mean it's it's optional sure it's option
still is good for portrait mode photos
still is good for face on lock yeah it's
just not you could turn off the hand ID
if you want you can turn off the you
will turn off the handbag you will not
be caught in the subway in New York City
doing this to your phone what are you
talking about you realize New Yorkers
are gonna be like oh my they're gonna
throw like a dollar at you oh yeah how'd
you do that well okay that that as a
interrupts you okay I'm really curious
about that adaptable display for the V
50 yes which is which is part of why
Adam and I actually we agreed that our
favorite thing because we know the mate
X takes takes the cake it takes everyone
even Nicole was saying do I really want
to talk about yet another podcast he was
icon for so she she gracefully came on
to this podcast after she
Miriam's already and she was like do I
wanna talk about the main X again
because it's it's it's kind of a cliche
at this point and I'm like the thing is
cliches are cliches for a reason like
there's a reason why the made X takes up
so much of the consciousness it deserves
to there's no denying that however with
that in mind when we talked a little bit
we were like you know I really love what
I see over at LG I just do like you say
what you will about the hand idea in the
air in the air motion like at least
they're trying with something that is
not just more screen something that's
not just more performance more gaming
more and more more more something that's
literally different there's one thing I
really appreciate with the tof sensor is
they haven't gone and given it like a
gimmicky name or anything they've just
call it the Z camera I like that because
it's for the z axis like yes yeah yeah
that was a good name and I get it like
no one's actually going to use it but
then when I when I when I thought about
it harder I was like this is a proof of
concept for LG where does LG's main
revenue come from it's not phones it's
everything else so this is the proof of
concept of the tof camera being on the
front of a display because I bet you
you're not gonna if the scenario that I
would create for myself to make sure I
actually use a tof camera is to put it
on a stand next to my next to my
keyboard and then when I want to like do
something I'll just put my hand up and
just do stuff that's actually not a bad
idea
yeah let's put it up on a phone yeah
well our biggest complaint with wireless
chargers is you can't use your phone
yeah unless you can I mean yeah I mean
unless you have a unless you have a GA
exactly think about it is I okay so my
problem is not the air gestures it's the
gesture to do this it's like what am i
predator like seriously well as I was
saying it is like looking through my
eyes dance puppet dance pop guys I'm
like come on and I get it that there are
probably limitations and it requires
that to be able to be captured fine I
could I could understand all these
things but you have to understand that
the less natural gesture is the more it
becomes a gimmick
yeah and again agree totally get it for
the phone I'm just sort of thinking more
long-term because it's clearly not
something that LG ever expects everybody
in the future of the G line to actually
use I'll start diluted oh yeah exactly
what this gesture is is a proof of
concept for their TVs there's gonna be a
camera at the top of a TV one day and
Ren you're sitting on your couch and you
want it you need a control you put your
hand up and you actually change things
as long as the two of camera is far
reaching I was about to say well with
the limit a well obviously everything
gets better over time so so fine that's
actually not a bad idea it's just again
Connect has existed forever there have
been so many services that have motion
recognition how many X boxes OHS I'm
sorry I know you don't play with that
but but neither I'm Playstation as well
Vega but let me ask you this how many
Xbox are being shipped right now with
Kinect none exactly yeah why well you
were okay this here's the thing and I
know where you're going with this you
already have a controller you already
have all of the means that you need you
don't need an extra thing in order to
actually enjoy your Xbox well and it's
not just that these are motion motion
gestures or things that are not like you
see mine re-report it looks cool you
have to understand how many takes Tom
Cruise must have done to stand in front
of that panel and start moving things
around and then it's like me vlogging
with this camera and just lifting it up
and it's heavy
yeah and then over time you get tired
and you want to put it down and so how
often do you think that humans really
want to be doing this in the air nobody
does
nobody does you know I have to people
may argue with Apple as much as they
want when it comes to touchscreen
functionality on laptops but tell me how
many times you touch the screen on your
laptop I don't you know but we know
people who do
yes that's one fraction of how much in a
potential consumer market well then I
will be the one fraction let's go back
to the fact that I still consider it to
be a step in it's nice it's fine yeah I
just I just I just look at it I think
we've been we
been in the last few years of trying to
make things thinner and thinner and
thinner and smaller and sleeker and look
what we could fit and blah blah blah but
this show has been finally of 180 on
that we are literally not caring anymore
and it's nice to see that instead of
more more more more MORE which is what
we're getting more screen a bigger phone
a bigger battery that freakin energizer
phone for God's sake you see it the
brick oh and we're planning on going
yeah I think we figured out where it is
yeah it's hard to find apparently at
least we have something that is
literally like off of that pathway I
don't want to take up too much of the
the LG talk Adam you wanted to say why
you are into it yeah not it but yeah so
the main thing I really like about LG at
the moment is the dual screen I guess
edition module thing whatever it you'd
call it he's actually pretty innovative
it works it works well I got time to
actually play with it and the biggest
thing the biggest thing I liked about it
actually was it wasn't just the fact
that it was a second screen that you
could use to play games or whatever it
was that have had fun good huh yeah it
had function and I had good haptic
feedback it felt good like that's
obviously on the v50 itself rather than
the dual screen but it ties in so well
with the second screen I'm sure people
have had a Nintendo DS at some point it
is the perfect
I guess module if you want to do
emulation if you want to play games in
your phone I'm not a mobile gamer at all
I hate it but I look why am I always the
only one that's actually a good idea I
would never do it on a display but if
you gave me a controller that will
connect those to those pins yeah yeah
it'd look like a clamshell but you have
to but also like you were saying the
haptic engine on the LG phones is
actually really really well it feels
nearly directional it's like you press
the a key on the gamepad it feels like
it's vibrating there but it's a really
sharp vibrate so it nearly feels like
you're actually pressing a book oh so
it's like the V 30 so ever since that B
30 I don't have you ever used an LG
phone no so I don't know of there taptic
of apples taptic engine is made by LG we
don't know who the supplier is but ever
since the V 30 it's like if you have a
taptic engine just literally go into the
manual controls of any LG phone and just
move the dial on whatever the function
of the camera and yeah that dude it
feels like if something is actually
moving yeah yeah no and that's what I
liked about it because they had a the
analog thing is my phone so but here's
the thing
I have to hand it to LG and one thing
about that see I don't want a foldable
all the time yeah that was what I was
getting at I honestly why would I want
to pay $2,300 for a product that I will
only turn into a tablet ever so often
yeah if I'm a busy guy and I'm always
you know in the city and doing this and
doing that you know it's I'm not going
to be oh and I'm not yeah it's just not
gonna happen so if they gave me a module
that's $200 well come on all right 250
yeah if they give you a module it's 350
where I can extend my screen by just
snapping one thing whenever I want to it
could be something that's in my backpack
and whenever I've got a long commute I
just pull it out of my backpack snap it
on and boom watch a movie you know yeah
so here here here's where here's where
my perspective comes in having used this
product for quite a while by now and
yeah I have quite a bit of footage that
that hands-on is gonna be pretty awesome
um there are a lot of use case sonars
for this at LG have actually baked in
for example okay first of all you put it
into the case you close it your phone's
protected it is a case yeah
first and foremost it's actually you
have like rubber corners and everything
exactly when you open it up and if you
still want to have the case on it but
you don't want to take it out of the you
but you don't want to take it out of it
just to use your phone singularly it'll
fold onto itself and so you can still
use your phone just your phone the
screen will not turn on until you tell
it to so when you open the case it knows
that it's in the case but it won't turn
on the other screen until you hit a
little button so that way you have full
control over it
now you can set up the dual screen to
automatically open an application when
you trigger for it to turn on here's the
use case scenario
being the guy who always does stuff as
who is this for productivity first of
all you take it out imagine my here's my
notebook and wallet so when I take it
out I know that I'm looking at something
I'm gonna start writing on the other
side that kind of thing yeah
turn on put put the put the v50 thank
you inside of the case when you take it
out and you open it and you hit that
button to turn on the second screen
automatically Gmail now question does it
have a way to snap itself to remain in
one position well yes there are there's
there's there's this like hand held
words in a V pattern and then fly can
you imagine a Galaxy Note 10 with that
functionality it would be great like
stylus support and that that would be
great yeah exactly
cuz I wouldn't meet because that was my
first immediate thought was when I
opened it up and Gmail just appears
immediately on the side that is perfect
I'm going through my emails and then if
I need to do research on the other side
open up a full browser a full secondary
app that's the thing it's too full apps
it's not the software trying to cut a
screen and trying to multitask in them
oh really it's too full apps it's
actually rendering twice the other thing
is the other function and don't think
that anybody has actually tried it
because there's no way of doing it
there's no apps for this if you take a
screen shot on one you can copy it
immediately to the other okay so if
you're talking if I'm on whatsapp with
you and you're like where do we go I
open up Maps I take a screenshot of the
map it automatically goes to you
interesting because it understands that
I'm messaging that's smart right smart
so there's a practicality to this this
is actually a pip it's useful yeah so
see see but that's the thing I love the
idea but and how much is that thing
gonna cost as a question now we don't
know how much it'll cost but what we do
know is it's not coming to the u.s. to
the US so just order it exactly which is
why I said in my video what I'm doing a
video for it also on JV everyone get
into the comment sections we need this
like we need this in the sea
of we need you we need more stuff like
this and I feel like LG's really one of
the only companies that is actually
trying to inject true practicality into
its products yeah but we go back to you
know how much how even LG seems like if
they don't believe in their own products
yeah you know well you are the biggest
proponent of the old V or of classes
that they had so is a practice okay so
here's the thing I really the people
make may make fun of the LG g5 all they
want I don't blame them but for me the
LG g5 was probably one of my favorite
phones that you know that mod approach
that modularity sure you had to remove
the battery and everything but it it
just it offered so much potential it
just needed more time I feel at that
phone in particular needed more time but
it was you know like for me that what
what would solve the all right now like
it's what I told you I hate the concept
I have an op I have an oculus go I tried
it once will never put it on again why
because I didn't pay for it one yes okay
and so here's the problem it's the
process of putting it on the process of
setting it up the process of adjusting
yourself and then worst of all that
after you've done all that your face is
already tired because that thing is
heavy
yeah it's no process it's too many
processes like the HTC vive I love that
but the process was so daunting just to
set it up you know every time you had to
turn on the computer then the vibe then
steam then the app then it's like damn
it yeah you know I just want to put
something on and have it work and so LG
has been the only company that showed us
something like that with the g5 they had
this mod that never came to the market
where was literally a pair of sunglasses
well pretty much just like a little
cover on the side of them to create that
VR experience and it had a USBC cable
that you would put you could leave the
phone in your pocket with the USBC cable
yeah and the phone would power the
goggles yeah and so I was in nigga hot
as hell but yeah okay but it was a
prototype away sorry I never came to
them
but think about it when you not use that
that's annoying
that's cool like it and people were like
yeah but it's all I think it was only
720p I'm like it survived is as well
it's again prototype they could end up
opening it but when it comes to market
like that's so much potential can
somebody come up with that product yeah
like if LG abandoned that can somebody
do this because I feel that that is the
secret to get VR off the ground you
literally snap snap and you start ease
of use ease of use and I don't care if
it's not listen come on VR companies
none of your products are immersive none
of them are because the experience of
using them it's something cool and
you'll invite a couple of friends and
they'll play with it once but then
you'll forget that it exists but
actually see reached out about the vibe
and they were like we're running out of
units any chance you can let me borrow
you don't like to take it just leave the
computer but take it okay yeah did the
fact that not enough gaming youtubers
and twitch streamers even touch V art
anymore really unless it's like beat
Sabre but that's it but that's the thing
the reason why is ease of use yeah and
that's what I'm just trying to do in
this dual screen case that's like an
example of ease of use yeah you just
snap it in it works yeah and not to
mention like there are the decor DNA of
what LG is good at with these phones is
still remains it still remains I've
recorded some video using the g8 and the
V 50 4k uhd at 52 megabits per second in
terms of how much how much it's a bit
rate is yeah that's good that's half of
the camera I'm using right now to record
this podcast because you could do 4k at
100 megabits that's a low setting but
still nothing comes close to that so the
Megas professional camera exactly the
bitrate of the camera is actually really
good so as much as I do believe that the
s10 plus is going to be the easiest of
vloggers camera out of a smartphone
coming up the thief the V 50 or the g8
are still going to be tough they're
still gonna be up there they're still
going to be a great vlogging camera you
know I would you just need to work out
some of the kinks and like you said it's
a confidence thing yeah LG knees were
confidence they need to say need to just
they need to go
they need to go all in on it so even an
MP for the js5 is 100 megabits at 30 P
is that matter if it's a before or M
before LPC whatever yeah it's always a
hundred megabits that's that is that is
the bare minimum for a camera meant to
make great video yeah right there and LG
manages to hit halfway there dude but
I'll tell you this much I think okay
I've been praising the iPhone for us for
a bit mainly because I mean this the
iPhone 10 oh sorry this is clear that I
only slept four hours four hours the
number that's on my mind I'm really
tired and I apologize the fights a
beaner it shows that I'm tired I'm not
drunk yet but oh he's looking at me when
he said that the king of videos is the
iPhone 4 there has been no room for
comparison I don't care who you've
watched on YouTube I don't care who
claims to be an expert at this topic how
fine okay I'm sorry but it's it's just
one of those things where you know honor
where honors do mm-hmm
that's just it but today I use the
galaxy s 10 plus it's up there it's yeah
it's right no it's not just up there
it's there yeah it's the improvement is
there V so I had a long conversation
with Qualcomm about the 855 and I was
like dude whatever codec you guys use
it's literally it's like either over
sharpen the know EMS can't really do
much yeah and and they explained to me
know wait for the age 55 man we are
really going to hit that hard yeah I was
able to test it today dude we were in a
chopper it's dark inside extremely
bright out bright outside and it was
crazy how the phone would adapt which is
one of the things that I love about the
iPhone I you know I had the G H 5 with
my 12 millimeter f1 point 4 I did a lot
of play with it and I could not achieve
the dynamic range that I did with the
galaxy s 10 plus and which is one thing
that I love about smartphones they're
smart about it right yeah regular
cameras are now you have to tweak them
to be able to achieve it and so and this
is without HDR video enabled
this is without HDR 10 video enabled I
can't imagine if I filmed in HDR yeah
HDR 10 on the V 50 is aggressive is it
it is a caress oh it's like on Sony's
dude like I like I kids funny when I did
my Xperia z3 review and they're like
where's your HDR 10 video sample and I'm
like I couldn't get final cut to render
it yeah that's that's the only problem
with it is that you can do HDR 10 you
can do high fire do recording a few
people out there my question why I
didn't use it in my upcoming LG videos
for both you and myself yeah it's mainly
because it makes the editing process an
absolute chore I remember trying to use
HEV see yeah and it was horrible I hate
Apple for doing it yeah HEV C yeah
exactly
it's like ooh yeah it's true and you
know I'll make bones about it but at the
same time I understand why it's the case
but yeah before we get too far you know
off the beaten path like is there any
other parts about the LG talk that you
wanted to give before we know it you
just really love that dual screen I
really love that dudes gonna go see that
thing tomorrow see that's that's the one
thing I like I was saying I'm not a
mobile gamer but if this is executed
right and developer is kind of figure
out how to integrate with it cuz I
assume it'll be open to apps to use and
access yeah if they're like dolphin
emulator PSP emulator SDS emulators if
any of them can access it and allow you
to rebind keys to use it Darden itself
is a game changer for emulation on
Android my opinion yeah yeah it's got a
lot of potential and then as well if
this works are the three people at this
table are gonna be some of the only
people who can own it but this we're
gonna make some phone calls the pins as
well on the back I think they could be
like a motorized pogo pen the bottom
third because I was so upset when we did
the briefing with the v50 yeah and they
did not as well yeah they had a little
deal I said they allowed us to touch it
but they were like no photo no video so
I'm like what am I gonna waste my time
on this thing if I can't do anything
with it yeah and then I get a call from
LG PR no an email from LG PR
they were like so apologetic we're sorry
we just learned that in the briefing in
the UK they did allowed to film and
think yeah and I'm like oh no I'm not
gonna redo this video like it's gonna go
the way it's gonna go here yeah so I
mean basically our v50 coverage
respectively it's just coming out a
little bit later but you're gonna want
to check it out and you're going to want
to tell LG that this product should come
out in the u.s. why is it no it's the
way Korea is like they yeah now tell me
so it's also a carrier thing now tell me
something how do you feel about the fact
that the V 50 is a B 40 there's stuff
new about it internally but like the V
50 is literally but you know what for as
much as we could say anything I mean
apples 10s is a 10 a 10 yeah is that but
how do you feel about this because this
is not comic this is not calming and
Android not in Android phones III would
say that this is the first this is one
of the first to do that but I honestly
don't mind so much because what they've
improved in it is significant things
also what they focused on more than read
then going back to the drawing board on
design yeah yeah that's why I think it
in my case it's not I'm not against it I
praised it actually because you know how
many RF antennas you have to add 4
millimeter wave on 5g yeah how are they
able to do it in the same footprint
because if you grab the Galaxy S 10 5g
it's larger
yeah yeah that's true it is larger yeah
all right well I think we did it guys I
think it's very easy for us to talk
about our favorite thing at MWC a once
again a big thanks to nicole scott for
being on in our earlier segment I forgot
I forgot one thing
Oh what's up no Kim nein Oh Nokia 9
that's true no kid 9 peer review the
thing is I haven't even seen it here in
New York briefed in New York it so it
hasn't been like in my radar because I
had already seen it we had a talk with
them and the Nokia ions are internal
people's units so there's no there are
no units there are yeah that's why yeah
guy let me use it like five minutes
like a favor because he's like oh you're
from XDA here I like you guys
yeah listen listen but it's okay can I
just say this too like my final opinion
I have never been in an MVC that's been
so exciting
agreed all things considered it's been a
pretty great show it's been a pretty
great show I've really really really
liked that I've miss an mwc like this
yeah I miss going to a trade show and
being like wow yeah Wow
that I have a lot of enthusiasm the
other day we were chatting with Brandon
and Brandon was like oh my god dude this
year is gonna be awesome and he's right
mm-hmm he is right there is a lot of
experimentation back and I love it and
the other like it's it's just it's
really hard when you ask me what's my
favorite thing it's a lot of things it's
honest and it's like that it's the Nokia
and it's the made X is 5g it's also the
fact that the galaxy s10 cost less than
an iPhone 10 yeah that's absolutely
right I think a lot of people who let
that fly over their heads because they
just see that $9.99 price point and they
don't realize what that really means
it's the price of this mean nine I was
like what yeah yeah it's insane it's
like yes it's here oh my god dude the
price of this thing mm-hmm
yeah I know oh my god please don't ever
send me a black review unit again moving
on we're gonna go ahead and call it on
this one we can talk about I've
hopefully those Nokia's are going to
come in sooner rather than later I'm not
going to say anything that you know man
I think we release information finally
came out like a day or two ago yeah or
even today probably but I'm not going to
talk about it on here oh release they
it's just at the time of this recording
I got I already have the email there we
go
so yeah so weird that is trickling in
we're excited to get those Nokia's in
we're excited to get the made X we're
excited to get all the LG stuff as well
even if literally if I'm the only person
in America who has a dual screen I'm
gonna be happy with that all right so
we're gonna go ahead and call them this
