2013 LG discusses the nexus for
shortages and the galaxy s4 takes over
rumor mill again I'm hi meri behna
wandering of the t-mobile girl is going
to switch to the iphone and this is
fucking out daily that's right the
galaxy s4 has taken over rumor mill
again and apparently this time we're
getting more than just the phone in 2013
it's called Project J and it seems that
Sammy is working on bringing as a nun
destructible screen which I won't
believe until we give it our official
pocketnow test that includes my
three-year-old smashing it somewhere but
we'll see if that's really true
apparently the launch they will be in
april 2013 so stay tuned now when it
comes to the nexus 4 we don't know
what's worse if Google ditching Samsung
over LG for manufacturing or the fact
that LG can't even keep up with the
manufacturing process there is too much
demand according to LG UK's Andy
Coughlin and they're doing their best to
try to keep up because not even Google
was preparing for the amount of phones
that they're trying to sell now we do
have reports of people getting a four to
six week notice for the LG Nexus 4 when
they order but then they end up getting
the phone like a week later so it would
be good for you to give it a try but we
can't promise you anything that's right
our full review of the nokia lumia 822
is now live this may not be the hottest
phone of the year but according to
michael fisher it's not actually the
worst phone of the year it's actually
really good and hey if you're on Verizon
and you want to Windows Phone 8 it's not
like if you have many choices so watch
the video and tell us what you think now
I have a confession to make the swiftkey
keyboard is solely responsible for
making me love android years ago before
that in the times of gingerbread any
keyboard on any android device was
terrible and now swiftkey has a new beta
called swiftkey flow which is a new
keyboard that brings the same swiftkey
functionality with the added bonus of
swype functionality but this time in
real-time text prediction like you get
an android 4.2 in the new flavor of
jelly bean now this beta is free
currently it's currently great and if
you haven't bought swiftkey already this
is an app that i do recommend you don't
pass on just download it by it no
questions asked links in the description
for you to be able to download the beta
so far we've been testing it and it is
quite good and finally for the believe
it or not news of the day t-mobile and
Apple have just confirmed that the
t-mobile grill will be selling our
iphones next year not criticizing them
according to the report they'll be
selling apple products next year they
weren't specific on which but we know
that that includes the ipad and it's 4g
very then also the iphone now we don't
have specific dates but that leads you
to the question today have you been
waiting for an iphone officially to come
to t-mobile in my case I'm not really a
fan of the carrier I know Adam loves
these guys but leave us a comment down
below and if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet well make sure you
follow us on pocketnow.com please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I'm hi Mary better thanks for
watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
