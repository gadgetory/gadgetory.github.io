the headphone jack and next year's
Galaxy Note 10 the Google pixel 3 Excel
display has been crowned as the best
display by display mate and we get even
more likes of the huawei mate 20 Pro
this time from the most trusted of
sources I'm Jaime metal yet I'm
reporting from sunny LA because yeah
yesterday we were at the pixel event
then we all have to fly here now for the
Razer event but it should be really cool
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with the Microsoft
Surface headphones that took us by
surprise the design is great but for
those of you wondering exactly when can
you get it
pre-order information has emerged it
starts November 15th you can get them by
the 19th and the retail price is yes 349
bucks I don't find them over price for
what headphones in that range cost but
then again we'll see now let's talk
about the LGV 40 I know a lot of you
actually want to get your hands on this
phone for those of you that want to
October 3rd was pretty much the launch
it should be reaching people's doorsteps
on the 18th and well there are software
updates already in our units there are
camera issues that the canada√≠s
company's working on and I actually kind
of reported string of these and the
review so you can learn more in the
review but in addition it's still a
great phone again there was just some
software things they needed to iron out
now for those of you that want to know
more about the huawei mate 20 pro as of
we don't know enough about it famous
tips for evan blast is just showed us
exactly what to expect from the design
once evan gets this I'm pretty much sure
that this the way it's gonna be
it looks gorgeous we see things like the
on display fingerprint scanner we look
at cases like the color options I just
can't wait to get my hands on one and
see if it really looks as good as it
does in the renders now let's talk about
the Google pixel 3 XL as well the phone
just won the best rating for a display
from display mate and that's interesting
because the iPhone 10's max beat the
Galaxy Note 9 which for us is the best
display but then the tennis max was good
now in the case of the pixel 3 XL we do
have our you
we've begun our review process and we
will let you know if it's actually a
better display but yeah it's got that
rating
we'll see how it lives up to that
particularly with that much and finally
the hot news today should I call them
hot I think I should we've got sources
from Korea that are claiming that
Samsung is going to be the next company
to kill the headphone jack they've made
fun of Apple many times but it turns out
that the company is working on this not
for the Galaxy S 10 but apparently for
the Galaxy Note tended to do a wave for
it there's no justification we're
obviously very early we're nearly a year
away from the Galaxy Note 1000 MERS are
that it could launch at the same time as
the s10 so whatever the case may be let
us know in the comments I mean how do
you feel I mean Samsung and LG are the
two companies that still defended this
now it hopefully is just well it's
probably just gonna be LG and I'm saying
hopefully but not meaning that I don't
hope that Samsung makes the switch leave
us a comment down below as in my case I
hope they keep the headphone jack

news earlier follow us on fucking our
coms destructor both our channels
