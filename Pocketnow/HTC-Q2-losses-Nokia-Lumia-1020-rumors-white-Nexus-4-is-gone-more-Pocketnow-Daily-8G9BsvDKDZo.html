disappoint in profits the Nokia Lumia
1020 gets Reuben along with a possible
launch date and the white Nexus 4 is
gone and for good I'm hi never iveta and
the weekend has begun guys so I'm
pressing pause and calling it a day this
is poking out daily let's start day off
with the usual batch of moto x rumors
because i know this phone is going to be
a victim of its own hype so far canadian
carriers are assuring that the phone
will be available to launch an Argus
with a possible announcement to have it
on july eleventh now given the fact that
july eleventh is pretty much a couple of
days from now i don't really see an
announcement happening so soon but you
never know stay tuned for more rumors
and for all of you that we're interested
in that HP slate7 stop fighting guys
raise your hands well HP is now
discounting the tablet by 30 bucks so
it's now going to be below the two
hundred dollar price range in its
highest end 16 gig model and still I
mean we could always just wait for HP to
keep dropping that price until we have a
new HP TouchPad here anyways for those
of you that were interested in the white
Nexus forum sorry to report the phone is
no longer being sold in the Google Play
Store not just because it sold out but
because the company is not bringing it
back Google does take that limited
edition phrase seriously you can still
get the phone on t-mobile obviously not
as cheap as it was in the Google Play
Store and oh well it was sad while it
lasted and you know we're still debating
of Nokia's new flagship is going to be
called the Lumia 909 or the Lumia 1020
we have solid leaks thats a 909 and then
we've got new reports in paper that
staked the price tag 602 bucks which is
odd and then the fact that it's going to
be called the Lumia 1020 and that it's
going to be available on sale on july
twenty second which would be the first
time in history that you don't get a
windows phone being announced today and
being launched six months from now you
know that the announcement is going to
happen on July 11 so stay tuned let's
see what it's going to be called and
finally for the very sad news of the day
HTC's quarter results are out and they
are not good at all the company is down
eighty-three percent in profits and
don't even let me get started with
the revenue the company was unable to
maintain the momentum of sales of the
HTC One during the month of May and you
know if a hot phone can't pull you out
of the water I don't know what can so
you know that leads you to the question
of the day if you were an advisor to HTC
right now what would you tell Peter Chou
to do to get the company out of all
these problems in my particular case
well I haven't seen any more marketing
after the Champions League let me know
if you've seen any more and in the
mother case honestly why did they erase
the price of the HTC One in May I mean
that was something that was bound to
happen they should have been maintained
the price keep the phone attractive get
rid of all that inventory so you can be
able to build more phones keep that cash
flow flowing leave us a comment down
below what would you do of course it's
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and topical but she follow us
