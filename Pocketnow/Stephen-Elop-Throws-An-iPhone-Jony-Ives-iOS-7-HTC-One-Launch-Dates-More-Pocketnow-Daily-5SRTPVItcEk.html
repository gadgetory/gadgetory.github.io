iOS 7 Stephen Elop talks nokia design
but throws an iphone in the process an
HTC talks about their launch states for
the HTC One I'm hi Marietta and at the
time of this recording the game had not
started yet this is Parnell daily how
about if we start today with the odd
news and for those of you that remember
the bad news that Android five-pointed
for the samsung galaxy s3 mini because
it's an underpowered phone we've got
recently images of a samsung galaxy s4
mini which will most probably be just as
underpowered and we will most likely not
recommend that you buy it specifically
for software updates so anyways and for
those of you that can't find your way
around the annoying sounds made by the
Google Talk application and listen to
our parking our weekly podcast for more
details on that we've got leaked images
of a new google messaging service that
come to probably replace google talk as
it never really took off or it hasn't
really been popular and i still can't
find a way to send the photo anybody but
anyways the problem is that we still
don't know any details on when this will
happen it looks kind of intuitive but it
also looks kind of convoluted as well so
stay tuned for whatever happens and for
how it's called hopefully not Google
keep message now let's talk about the
HTC One obviously March 14th when buying
the phone did not start selling for
obvious issues that we already know
about the delays with suppliers and just
about everything but apparently well HTC
just came clear we have the phone being
sold in the UK and Germany late this
month and then we will have it being
sold in the united states as of late
april you know those same dates that the
galaxy s4 is going to be sold as well so
let's hope that history does not repeat
themselves and i do recommend that if
you really want that phone you make a
line because it will most probably be
short very short because of the high
demand and for those of you wondering
how iOS 7 will look by the hands of
Jonathan Ive well apparently some inside
rumors from The Wall Street Journal
we're already talking about a lot of
collaboration happening with an apple
because Johnny I've is a nice guy
apparently there were a lot of issues
with Scott Forstall and apparently a lot
of things are already working
those of you that didn't know the
podcast application for iOS was recently
updated and we do know that Jonathan
Ives is not about skeuomorph he doesn't
like stitch leather and stuff like that
and we did notice that this podcast
application is kind of flat everywhere
kind of just you know no gimmicky design
or anything so it does seem as if Johnny
I was already working stay tuned and
finally for the good and bad news of the
day Stephen Elop was recently in an
interview with finished television and
well he was asked a lot of things first
of all what can we expect on camera
quality and built quality he obviously
showed everything that's going on we do
know that the Lumia has brought a lot of
innovation in this camp and the name was
asked about the Nokia Lumia 928 which he
dismissed he didn't comment anything
about but then the finish presenter came
to him showed him his iphone and said I
really want to change this phone for a
Lumia and then ylab was nice enough to
just grab the phone from his hand and
throw it to the floor and probably smash
it you know how the iphone is but you
know even though we know that a lob was
probably joking he was very nice this
was not done in a bad manner at all you
can see the video um you know it's kind
of weird that he actually just threw the
phone to the floor he almost probably
replace it with lumia but that leads you
to the question of the day how do you
find eal ops actions that you consider
them nice not nice good or bad I mean I
don't really see Tim Cook holding a
Lumia onstage and throwing it on the
floor or Larry Page doing the same from
google I don't see them doing that I
don't consider what he lobs did is
ethical but obviously he did it a nice
manner so leave us a common what's your
opinion that you like what he do or
didn't you as always for an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow us on Fargo now calm and
subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I am high memory
that I and as always thank you very much
for watching see you Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
