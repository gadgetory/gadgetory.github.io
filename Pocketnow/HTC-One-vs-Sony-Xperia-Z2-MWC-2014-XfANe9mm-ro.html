Xperia z2 and we wish we could say the
same thing about the one as we said with
the s4 that there will be a follow-up in
a couple of hours but hopefully we will
see one in march or april until then
we're going to compare these two and see
how they fare the 4.7 inch screen on the
one makes this an instantly smaller
phone compared to the 5.2 inch xperia z2
and you can of course tell the
difference in height now when it comes
to thickness it is a bit tricky because
the one has a slight curvature on the
back which makes it feel good in the
hand but i'd say they're approximately
at the same thickness on the back
there's a huge difference between the
four megapixel ultrapixel camera and the
20.7 megapixel brand new sony camera
with a larger sensor and of course the
other built difference is that the HTC
One is built out completely of an
aluminum body and the Sony Xperia z2 has
a sandwich built of glass between two
pieces of glass between which there's a
layer of aluminum and plastic
combination another huge difference
between the two is that this is
submersible and waterproof and dustproof
at the same time while the one would not
probably survive a submersion
however on the HTC one you got the
signature boom sound which is a standard
and audio quality ever since the one got
policed but we're being told that the
speaker system on the Xperia z2 is a
brand new system which now delivers
clear quality audio and stereo at the
same time just a quick rundown of the
specs we have a Snapdragon 801 plucking
a two point three gir hurts on the z2 we
have a Snapdragon 600 on the almost one
year old one we have three gigs of RAM
on the Z 2 tunics of RAM on the one this
particular unit is a 32 gig version the
z2 has 16 gigs of internal storage but
you cannot add more via a microSD on the
one well there's an expansion slot on
the z2 here you can add up to 64 gigs in
addition and well we'll hear there's a
dedicated shutter release button for
underwater operation which you will not
find on the one since you cannot
submerge it this has been just a quick
look at least you and how they compare
and the differences between them will
get the sea to hopefully soon in our
labs until then have a behind a camera I
bonanza and you've been watching pocket
now thank you very much for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
