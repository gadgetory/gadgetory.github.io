housing the HTC One m8 seems to be off
to a positive start in sales and Sampson
may look to google it its trial against
Apple I'm hi metadata and hey if the
price is right I don't mind I would
definitely serve as a witness right this
is parking out daily especially off with
some official news that are quite good
actually we were expecting for the HTC
One m8 to make some significant growth
in its initial sales and so far the news
have been positive Taiwan is reporting
the phone has a substantial demand but
so that we don't get specific numbers
just share we're gonna have to wait for
the poor results hopefully this will
mean a better wind for HTC after so many
disappointments in sales last year but
aside from that for those of you that
were concerned about the HTC One m8 you
know massaging benchmarks well as it
turns out the phone does include a
setting for you to turn that off which
they included and made available to
those people that want power hungry
games so interestingly see description
for full details on that now let's talk
about Apple is the company has just sent
out an email to all developers making it
clear that as of tomorrow we will be
seeing some price differences and
international app stores and the reason
why is because obviously there is an
exchange rate it's quite fluctuating in
certain countries and we have a full
list of the countries that are being
affected intellectual description but so
far it makes you wonder exactly how
Apple is going to make that you know
keep that happening as exchange rates
continue fluctuating it's going to
continue happening so stay tuned for
that now let's talk about the apple vs
samsung trial there are some very
interesting news as it turns out that
samsung is planning to ask google to be
part of the trial as a witness
apparently samsung is going to ask Andy
Rubin himself one of the creators of
Android to come over and tell the story
of Android how it was born how it does
not copy Apple's iOS even though iOS was
first or looked the way it does first
and then Android swapped everything and
look more like it but anyways you be the
judge of that in the comments down below
this is going to be very interesting as
once there's a court order Google is
going to have to attend let's see
microsoft and its Windows Phone 8.1 is
we've got two very interesting rumors
first of all it seems that the company
is considering adding an extra row of
live tiles to their windows phone 8.1
operating system which is great you know
for any device that has a display about
4.5 inches great but even more
interesting is that apparently the
company is also considering allowing you
to run applications from your microSD
card which you could do so many years
ago and windows mobile but you will need
a microSD card that's above class 6 so
let's see how that goes and finally for
the very very interesting news of the
day we get the first leaked photo of the
iphone 6 we don't know if this is going
to be the 4.7 inch variant or not but it
sure looks like it it looks like a
bigger iphone in every way but it looks
a lot like an iPhone it's just really
interesting to see that there is really
not much change in design here except
for the fact that it's a bigger phone
but even though I could say that this
could be a 3d print out this photo did
come from Foxconn and since apples
become terrible at keeping secrets we
could just say that this is the real
deal but aside from that you know this
designer made a mock-up of the recent
schematics that were leaked for the
iphone 6 and it's phablet variant and
this is very interesting as the phone
looks really really hot and we have a
glass back so could we expect that
sapphire will make that glass back that
leads me to the question of the day what
do you think about the leaked photos and
the renders that we just have of the
iphone 6 in both models leave us a
comment down below in my case if that
pellet were real it is really hot and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is filming tree follow us on
pocketnow.com it's a scripture youtube
channel as well he also follow me on
twitter Highlanders quarter iveta please

what you saw I am hi Natalie that I
thank you very much for watching we'll
