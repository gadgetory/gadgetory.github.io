tony behind the camera we're here at the
nokia booth checking out the just
announced Nokia Lumia 720 let's take a
look so this is the Lumia 720 and just
take you around the hardware a little
bit believe this is a 4.3 inch display
with with curved glass here and it does
have the clear black technology on board
you'll notice the traditional Windows
Phone 8 camera button power standby here
visit carl zeiss lens with an f 1.9 lens
which nokia is telling us let's in a lot
more light than is typical which have
some very impressive sample shots which
hopefully we'll get some more of that a
little bit later on this is a wireless
charging enabled device and the
resolution of the camera is this is 6.7
megapixels that's very interesting with
it with AF 1.9 aperture and this also is
the first nokia device or one of the
first Nokia devices to feature microSD
expansion without a removable battery
cover so this is not removable we do
have wireless charging and you have
microSD expansion onboard here so this
is a mid-range device but not one that
is unremarkable
the rear facing camera isn't the most
remarkable one on the device there's
also a wide-angle front facing camera
which allows up to four people in the
same shot at very unflattering angles as
you can see but you know this is
something similar to what HTC was doing
this is still a 1 megapixel unit or
something like that but is 1.3 is it
it's still a 1.3 megapixel front facing
shooter but it is it has the wide-angle
capability so just a quick look at the
Nokia Lumia 720 we're going to have a
lot more on this device as we learn more
but for now Michael pocket now Tony
behind the camera stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
