flagship the one m8 the global Edition
in great detail but the Verizon version
arrived on our doorstep last week and we
decided that since it has some
differences both big and small it
deserves a look of its own I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is our
video review of the one m8 for Verizon
the Verizon model at least on the
outside is no different from any other
variant of the One m8 save for the
Verizon emblem and the 4G LTE tramp
stamps around back what you're dealing
with is a newer more mature or tame
incarnation of last year's one m7
visually they're very similar with matte
spaces around back the dual boom sound
speakers on the front and the tapered
profile like before we have the brushed
gunmetal gray model on hand but it also
comes in glacial silver it feels rather
hefty in the hand at 160 grams and it's
dimensions are relatively large for a
phone with a 5-inch display 146 point
four millimeters tall 70 point six
millimeters wide and nine point four
millimeters at its thickest part but you
won't find an Android phone that feels
better or more premium and it's quite
the looker there aren't many phones
around that can compete with the m8 on
an aesthetics level it's simply a
beautiful sturdy impressive piece of kit
and that holds true under the hood as
well on the Verizon model you're looking
at a 32 gigabyte model only with 128
gigabyte microSD card support two
gigabytes of RAM a Snapdragon 801 with a
quad-core Krait 400 CPU clocked at 2.3
gigahertz and an Adreno 330 GPU a 2600
milliamp hour battery rated at 271 hours
of standby time and a 4.1 megapixel
camera and 2 megapixel episodes are
around back and a wide-angle front
camera rated at 5 megapixels the core
difference between this model and the
global Edition is support for Verizon's
LTE network and the SLC d3 display is as
gorgeous as they come it's 5 diagonal
inches with a 1080p resolution colors
are vibrant viewing angles are great and
it's super sharp blacks could be better
especially when compared to OLED style
displays but it's something most will
never notice or care about just like
last year it's beautiful however much of
the increased display sizes lost to
on-screen
buttons though they often hide away when
developers make use of KitKat's
immersion mode the One m8 visually and
from a hardware stance is one of the
most impressive smartphones on the
market no question above all it feels
worthy of its $599 no contract price tag
on Verizon the software version on this
phone is also lagging behind the
unlocked m8 Michel reviewed a few weeks
ago thanks to Verizon's approval process
for firmware updates it's still running
KitKat 4.4.2 of course and it's packed
with the latest iteration of since
version 6.0 but this firmware version is
missing the extreme power saving mode
which basically trades all smartphone
functions and the camera for up to two
weeks of standby from a full charge
we're pleased to see the visual
enhancements made in this version of
software since five was an improvement
on the over encumbered cluttered and
visually conflicted since four but it
wasn't quite where it needed to be HTC
has since lightened the since experience
cut down even further on animations and
flattened practically all UI elements it
trimmed all the unnecessary fat away yet
it still bears enough resemblance to
previous versions to let you know since
is certainly still alive and well but
it's not packed with frivolous features
only the stuff that will truly improve
the user experience such as boomsound
motion launch gestures for waking the
device and a configurable quick settings
page of course you can't forget blink
feed which is also improved for a more
in-depth look into the software features
of the 1m a check out Michaels full
review
linked in the description below as for
the Verizon edition it comes with its
fair share of Verizon bloat accessories
caller name ID Verizon cloud emergency
alerts message Plus mobile hotspot Isis
wallet plus six other verizon apps it
also comes with some Amazon apps
pre-installed Kindle Amazon mp3 app
store and audible as well as slacker
radio none of which can be uninstalled
only reverted to the original version
that shipped with the phone it can
however hide and disable any apps you
never want to use or update but that's
an unfortunate half measure overall the
software aspect of this phone is
incredibly solid we actually found
ourselves using blinkfeed this time
around and were compelled to explore and
use the software not get caught up on
the shortcomings or unrefined elements
because there truly aren't very many
there is still some quirks with the
sense copy-and-paste phone
but we're truly pleased with since 6:00
on the One m8 performance is one of the
highest points on the One m8 we have yet
to slow the phone down through all the
gaming and intense multitasking we can
throw at it
we won't dwell too much on benchmarks
scored since HTC admitted to switching
the phone into overdrive for certain
benchmarking apps but just know it's
performance is comparable to the best
phones on the market heat dispersion
continues to be a problem though in
short spurts of heavy use the One m8 has
the tendency to heat up pretty quickly
when it does you might notice some
battery drop off speaking of battery our
experience with the One m8 from Verizon
hasn't been quite as impressive as with
the global variant we've managed to last
an entire day on lighter usage but on
most stage you can expect to end the day
with very little or no juice left some
instances of quick inexplicable drain
occurred dropping as quickly as 20% in
just two hours of standby and some days
we needed to plug in mid day just to
last into the night you'll likely manage
to squeeze a full day of use from the
One m8 but don't expect to go one day
plus at least not until the extreme
power saver update hits the multimedia
experience on the One m8 is incredible
thanks to the much-loved
dual front-facing boom sound speakers
they've been markedly improved over last
year they're loud crisp virtually
impossible to cover or muffle on
accident of course they don't provide
great low-end response but they are the
best speakers you will find on a smart
phone today if you're a gamer or like to
watch videos and movies on your phone
this is the phone you should be looking
at that great audio carries over into
call quality as well simply impressive
as our Verizon's data speeds in the
Charlotte metro and winston-salem areas
of North Carolina we've peaked at 31
point 5 megabits per second down at
about 5 megabits per second up those
speeds aren't far from our average
either
the camera is of great debate however is
for megapixels enough is the duo camera
worth sacrificing optical image
stabilization Michael and I posted some
of our favorite pictures with one m8 so
far last week and some of them are truly
impressive will it take great pictures
in all conditions
no no smartphone will is it an
improvement over the m7 s camera
marginally can most live with it yes the
color reproduction is superb in most
scenarios the contrast is great but
detail suffers due to the comparatively
low resolution and noise and artefacts
sneaked into even many bright photos
with a vengeance it isn't the best
smartphone camera to date and the
highlight you focus feature only works a
fraction at the time which makes it
difficult to justify the duo camera over
something like oh is but it will
certainly do
in all the One m8 on Verizon is a
spectacle
it looks and performs incredibly well
it's currently the phone to beat but
we'll have to wait and see how it holds
up against other heavy hitters such as
the Xperia z2 or the galaxy s5 but we do
have a feeling the One m8 while not
quite as bold as its predecessor will
bring home its own share of awards for
HTC we can't say whether it will be the
savior for the struggling handset maker
but it's certainly an impressive start
to 2014 and one of the most well rounded
balance smartphones on the market if
you're looking for the best Verizon
currently has to offer this is it
for our full thoughts and final score
