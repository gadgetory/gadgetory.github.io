of the video review for the HPI pack 900
series in this edition we'll look into
the software that's integrated into the
device I'm going to zoom in a bit to get
a better grip okay so if you've been in
a long time I pack a user like I am
you'll notice that HP doesn't really
customize your device as much as long as
for UI enhancements for anything you
won't find much it's actually Windows
Mobile as Ross it could be what do I
think about the 2.4 inch screen honestly
I like it I don't feel it cluttered or
too heavy I like it it I see everything
I want to see I really do enjoy it
pretty much what you'll get is well
office mobile 6.1 which is standard in
windows mobile 6.1 you get this new HP
photosmart mobile which was included in
the 110 and 200 series it's a standard
application for printing emailing
recording and stuff for images not bad
at all you get this help and support
option which is good for beginners it'll
give you a tutorial on what you can
expect from the iPad and things to work
on it
not bad at all you get also this Google
search link which will actually only
take you to P ie and help you navigate
through Google it's really nothing out
of the ordinary you get Google Maps
integrated there is no GPS application
with mapping all you get is Google Maps
how is GPS acquisition on this device
well guys it's not bad I mean compared
to other devices like the X 650 or the Q
9 which I've reviewed it's just a slow
not really something like the 3o 800
that you saw on atom lines review but
you could deal with that then after that
it's pretty much standard you get this
camera application which gives you VGA
resolution video and also the 3
megapixels from the camera not bad at
all really snappy clear view PDF which
is nothing out of the ordinary you get
this HP iPad GPS quick positioning
supposedly if you download this database
it'll help you and enhance the GPS
performance whatever I found well I
downloaded and I see it just as slow but
you know it's there it's free so it's
nothing that I'll complain about HP
print smart mobile is a very old
application which enables you to print
things from your device to a printer
bluetooth printer preferably and you
know it's nice for it to be included but
it's also free so you can get it
internet sharing is included with the
Bluetooth PA n which is good some of the
devices don't have it if you saw Adam
Lyons touch diamond review you notice
there was a remote desktop mobile
application which enabled you to map
your device to the computer and also
listen to the sounds of the computer if
you wanted this is also included in the
iPad really nice feature great for it to
be included you get the Sun Java midlet
manager honestly the best midlet manager
I've used yet it's really practical
really snappy you have Opera Mobile here
loaded with pocket downs website and it
loads really good I don't have no
complaints about it I actually consider
it to be superior far superior to the
ones I've used you get cyber Iran's
voice commander compared to Microsoft
voice command where I considered better
or worst I consider it the same it's it
has the same recognitions and options in
Latin America where you have more digits
for dialing this actually does recognize
more digits as opposed to voice command
which will only take the typical seven
digits for cell phone number so this
really helps around one thing I do like
about voice commander is for example if
you go to mail and I have this mail open
right here you get this option for HP
voice reply which will actually enable
you to record a small sound recording
and answer to your email this is really
nice it actually enables the option for
you to be on the run not being able to
actually type anything and practically
record what you want people to hear I
don't like the fact that it doesn't have
soft key options and I'll show you in a
bit but if for example you want to
control the file size because it does
tend to be a bit large you can control
it from the same s IP settings so this
is really nice enhancement so if you go
to HP voice reply and you say reply to
sender it'll give you the bar for
recording not really an option for soft
keys really uncomfortable but you have
to take your stylus out for this to work
but it's a nice enhancement not bad at
all
then if we go back to programs
everything is pretty much standard after
that if we go to settings it's the same
deal everything is standard you don't
get actually additional button mapping
as you did another eye packs all you do
is have one option for the hardware
buttons that are included so not bad not
good I would have enjoyed something
additional after that everything is
standard then if we go to the other side
we have the typical controls we have an
audio control which I believe there's a
little bit of a bug here because every
time I would send bass boost up or
treble every time I soft reset the
device this goes back so hope HP's
riding this down another option that is
different is this keyboard function
which allow you to turn the keyboard on
and off and also control the backlight
really nice feature included after this
it's pretty much if we want to go and
look at memory I'll I've already loaded
my email in my Outlook so pretty much
you get a one twenty five point seventy
four megabytes of storage out of which
you could say you get a fair one hundred
and ten megabytes available and then we
get program memory 112 out of which
fifty eight is available one thing neat
about the eye pack is you have I pack
file store which is back from the old
eye packs really neat so what's good
about eye pack file store you get twenty
megabytes of ROM that are actually
separated from storage roms so if you
get to hard reset you don't actually
have to be depending on a storage card
you can actually use the same device
memory to backup files and then restore
them really nice I like this after this
you pretty much get this ringtone
feature which doesn't do much but look
for ringtones in your device and let you
play them that's pretty much it as I
mentioned you don't get a screen
rotation option here it's pretty much
just the line screen clear type and text
size not really something out of the
ordinary then we go to the other tab and
pretty much here all I could consider
different is the fact that for example
if you saw the 100 and 200 series
reviews you notice they use the wind
econ Bluetooth stack which wasn't good
because it didn't real
work when you send the device to standby
so it's really nice that HP chose to
include the Microsoft Bluetooth stack in
this device which allows for it to
remain available when you send the
device to standby which helps with
Bluetooth headsets and other options
Wi-Fi acquisition is really good on this
device really decent it's pretty much
standard you get this HP I practically
quit actually allows you to select the
country you're at and then help you get
all the settings and connectivity
settings from that country's mobile
provider my country's not here so I'm
not really gonna look at that you have
this domain enroll which will actually
allow for you to enroll two domains on
corporate networks I haven't really had
the tents attempt to test this but it's
a nice addition I hadn't seen before
this is pretty much what's included in
software and the Ipek really as I
mentioned nothing out of the ordinary
probably I would have enjoyed the fact
that I could control these soft keys
also but not this is not included either
this is pretty much it for the part 2 of
the video review if you have any
questions or something you'd like for us
to see in part 3 as per performance keep
us posted on the forum thank you very
much for pocketnow.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
