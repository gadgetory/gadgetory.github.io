fourth generation ipad is now sold out
in google voice search now treats iOS
better than Android I'm hi Mary vetta
kind of hating android 4.0 ice cream
sandwich right now and this is poking
out daily that's right google has barely
taken the wraps off their new Nexus line
of being the for the seven and the 10
we've already got photography data the
new Nexus three though all we have is a
couple of photographs no real details on
the phone or any specifics on the camera
but it is really cool to think about a
cheaper Nexus phone if that could get
actually any cheaper than the nexus 4
now we were interested in a
fourth-generation iPad things just got a
little bit complicated because the first
stock of devices just sold out now we
have to wait a week for shipping war
make a line on the second of November to
get your device the iPad minis also pull
two weeks in a delay and it just makes
you wonder why the third-generation iPad
earlier this year sold out in less time
than this current new iPad see why
Microsoft has just launched their
windows phone 8 SDK to developers for
them to enhance current applications to
Windows Phone 8 or make new ones though
as with everything from Microsoft
there's always a catch there's currently
an eight-day sale where you only pay
eight bucks to register in the Windows
Phone store but the problem is that you
have to pay the 99 bucks to register and
then you get a refund three weeks later
the other catch is that you require a
windows 8 64 bit pc for you to be able
to use this SDK or not so if you weren't
an early adopter and you're planning on
developing apps for Windows Phone 8
start moving LG has just launched the
spectrum to on verizon for just a
hundred bucks and even though this is no
optimus g if you look at the spec sheet
this device is actually really good at
that price point now the problem is that
the spectrum one not review earlier this
year was terrible so buyers beware just
give the device a try before you buy 99
bucks is actually great and finally for
the disappointing news of the day google
has just upgraded their search
application for iOS and isn't that nice
iphone customers and ipad customers from
now on will get the same voice search
and even the same card view that ghoul
now provides to android 4.1
in customers which is kind of ironic
since android 4.0 ice cream sandwich and
gingerbread and honeycomb customers
don't get any of this that leads me to
the question of the day do you think
it's fair for google to upgrade these
services on other platforms before
android i know that you have to get a
new west but this whole deal is simply
disappointing leave us a comment down
below and if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure

what you saw I'm hi never be better
thanks for watching
