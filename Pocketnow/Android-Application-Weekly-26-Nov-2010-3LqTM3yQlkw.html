Paco calm and this is another episode of
the android application weekly in which
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get started this
application is called hot deals and
there is a free application available in
the android market this is a very useful
application if you're looking for great
deals in the largest shopping season of
the year so what's the day I wanted to
search for something in electronics I'll
do is click here it's really fast to
load now let's try cell phones so let's
say I wanted to buy this otterbox for my
iphone or just click here if I want to
get more information I click there you
can share with my friends it can also
purchase this directly from the device
group pic is a free application
available in the android market that
allows you to answer other people's
questions and also post questions of
your own let's say that you're having
trouble deciding between something you
can just ask a question and post it
directly on here you can either sign up
for a group pic username and password or
you can register using your facebook
account so this person asks does the
internet keep you up at night sometimes
yeah so we can rate this question I'm
going to give it five stars and we can
move on to the next question and create
our own question I'll wait to do is go
down some men you ask a question and
input all of our answers and choices the
dealer map is a free application
available on the android market always
help you see great deals in your area so
let's say if i want to see the black
friday deals all i have to do is click
on here and it will show me a list of
all the black friday sales going on in
my area i'll just click on one of these
icons and it will give me a display
showing all the deals that are going on
it counsel to deal detail and it
canceled if I'd like I can also see
daily deals on this application and I
can view most of the daily deals and
they seem to be up north in Seattle I
can also get deals with restaurants and
bars upstream is a paper application
available in the android market because
ninety nine cents what it allows you to
do is to upload practically any photo on
your device directly to your flickr
account so i have a photo here all i do
is add the title sailaja see these were
rabbits i can change the description add
tags if I like I can also go to more I
can select this down here and more get
license information
caching and all that other great stuff
that I would like to do so logit is
upload this photo and it will begin
uploading to the flickr website and a
matter of seconds nesoid is a Nintendo
Entertainment System emulator available
on the android market there are two
versions available a paid version which
is three dollars and ninety-nine cents
which gives you cheats that you can use
the game genie on save certain other
things and the free version which allows
you to just play the emulation nes file
so we can start the game if I want here
I can just play start I'll select one
player and it's very easy to use so the
controls are pretty easy to use on its
kind of difficult sitting down like this
and to download though most of these
robbers you can go to the old computer

the android application weekly and if
