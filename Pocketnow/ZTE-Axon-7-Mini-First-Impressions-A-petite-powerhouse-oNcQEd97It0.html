mid-range er this year with the axon
seven this company is on a mission to
drive high quality phones to even lower
price points and the follow up gadget
we're playing with today is the little
brother axon 7 mini getting it out of
the box this is still a very nicely
accessorized device for such a low price
point we of course get the folder of
papers we won't ever read a set of ear
pods style buds and of course a charger
and a cable we're always happy to see a
phone which is fully ready to use out of
the box in the hand this phone doesn't
much feel like the many options of old
this device represents a modest size
reduction from the main axon 7 a 5.3
inch screen and nearly identical
thickness to the full sized axon which
is only about 4 millimeters taller and
wider than this mini this is tricky
territory where many manufacturers have
struggled in the past when a company
delivers such a beast of a phone at a
low price point reaching lower price
points often means making compromises
which some people might feel are too
aggressive we're all emotionally holding
our phones to higher and higher
standards every year in terms of style
even though you're spending $100 less
it's exciting to see almost no
difference in terms of build quality and
design a metal phone body the soft HTC
style graceful tapers the chamfered
front edge to catch some light at an
angle it still looks a bit like a
surprised minion but overall this
phone's looks punch way above the price
tag and even for having forehead and
chin speakers the screen occupies more
than 70% of the front face as mentioned
we still retain the front stereo
speakers in addition to the rear mounted
fingerprint sensor and the card tray
which supports either two Sims or a sim
and a microSD this chipset is definitely
not a powerhouse and this lack of
horsepower resulted in one of the
longest first boots we've seen in
testing the initial setup runs quick
though and were dropped right into ZTE
skin the software here recall some of
the organization which we haven't always
enjoyed on HTC in LG skins
it's just similar enough to stock
Android that there shouldn't be too many
missteps getting around the phone but
just different enough in design and it
takes a little time to get used to where
things are
after loading up some apps happily our
initial use has been relatively snappy
of course we have some concerns just how
much of a mini is this many many
generations of smaller sibling phones in
the past represented severe compromises
with the main axon representing such a
great bargain
what exactly did ZTE trim here to get to
that lower price point looking ahead to
our future review and some possible
comparisons will definitely be examining
the audio situation where the axon 7 was
a monster were skeptical that the mini
fully inherited that audio prowess while
there were some flaws to deal with the
bigger axon camera also represented some
ambitious moves delivering h.265
compression support which we know this
phone's chipset can't handle and
speaking of that chipset just how much
of a performance downgrade might we find
here especially as the newer Qualcomm
Snapdragon 625 has shown some nice
improvements over this older generation
of mid-pack processors this is a company
on the rise building a fanbase of folks
who like inexpensive power user gadgets
so we have a lot to look at here will
ZTE continue building that reputation or
will this phone prove to be an overly
compromised companion you'll just have
to stay tuned for our future review as
