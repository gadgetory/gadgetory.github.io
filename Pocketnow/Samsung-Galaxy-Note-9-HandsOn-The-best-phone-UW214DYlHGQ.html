successor to what we highly regard as
the king of phablets that phone that
does more than your standard phone
samsung is boldly confident that this is
the best device in the market but
there's really only one way to find out
before tea from New York City I'm Jaime
meddling that with pocket now when let's
go hands-on at a glance the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 looks like everything the
Galaxy Note 8 should have always been
meaning this is more an iteration with
significance and logical improvements we
have the same glass on glass design with
an aluminium trim that now includes a
minor chamfer in the border providing a
shiny new aesthetic even if subtle to
new colors were shown to us lavender
purple and ocean blue with the latter
being my favorite it's got this new dark
branding in the back along with a yellow
s-pen to spice things up from the back
we notice a fingerprint scanner now
placed in a reachable spot addressing
one of our biggest complaints of its
predecessor from the front we actually
have a new taller six point four inch
infinity display over the same footprint
of the note 8 which seems to have been
achieved by making the bezels
asymmetrical on the note 9 if you look
closely this means we now have an 83%
screen to body ratio and the Super
AMOLED panel that quad HD plus
resolution continues to be the gold
standard we compare every other phone to
stereo speakers stood by AKG also make
it to the note line to assist with
content consumption in addition to the
beloved headphone jack now the company
mentions three pillars that define the
philosophy behind the note 9 all-day
performance a mightier s-pen and an
intelligent camera
yes this is the most powerful Samsung
Galaxy to date so no it's not just the
galaxy s 9 plus with an S Pen it's the
first to support options that range
between 6 bytes of RAM and 128 gigs of
storage or a whopping 8 gigs of RAM and
512 gigs of storage a larger 4000
milliamp hour battery the typical fast
and wireless charging in ip68 water and
dust resistance it's powered by the new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 which not only
means speedy performance and power
efficiency but also the cat 18 LT modem
and 4x4 my mo that okhla has been
praising and speed tests lately to
address what throttling Sampson claims
the use of a new water carbon cooling
system for enhanced game performance and
yes this is one of the Galaxy phones
included in the fortnight for Android
initial release will definitely do our
homework as to how this cooling system
works as Samsung only mentions that it
spreads heat three times better probably
one of the places where this is most
evident is that it proved to be powerful
enough to power decks without the need
of a cradle all you need now is a
special USB C 2 HDMI adapter which I
assume will be sold separately by
Samsung the UI has now been enhanced so
much that you don't really need to buy a
keyboard and a mouse either simply use
the Galaxy Note 9 as a trackpad and
whenever you select text or a text field
on the screen your keyboard will pop up
on the phone for you to type powering
the show is Android 8.1 Oreo on top of
Samsung's experience 9.5 which
technically looks the same but we'll
have a closer look during our review
coverage to report back on details as
our time with the phone was rather
limited
as for the mightier s-pen there are some
changes to the hardware there's now
Bluetooth le for communication up to 30
feet away and to charge it there's a new
super capacitor built-in to power within
the silo with 30 minutes being juiced up
in just 40 seconds
this means the s-pen now has new
functionality like being able to control
music your camera presentations or
whatever settings you decide and Samsung
is now launching a new SDK for
developers to take it even further
and yes it also provides the legacy
features like serving for navigation
translation drawing you name it and now
new tricks include the fact that the
color of the ink on screen/off memo
depends on the color of your s-pen which
I find to be cool
and finally as for intelligent cameras
we have a dual camera module at the back
with both lenses being optically
stabilized the primary 12 megapixel
shooter is now being dubbed the
SuperSpeed dual pixel camera with
autofocus oh is and variable aperture
that ranges between F 1.5 and F 2.4 the
telephoto is also of 12 megapixels with
autofocus providing 2 X optical zoom in
10x digital zoom though we have fixed
aperture at F 2.4 and finally the selfie
cameras of 8 megapixels with autofocus
and that's 1.7 aperture Samsung now
includes AI features that can detect up
to 20 scenes to enhance the auto mode
and that works locally on the phone
there's even a new flaw detection
feature to detect eye blinks image blur
lens smudges backlighting and other
things that require another photo well
these are things that we will have to
check in our full review so yes this is
the new Samsung Galaxy Note 9 pre-orders
begin at 12:01 Eastern on August 10th
and availability in all major US
carriers on August 24th pricing starts
at $1,000 pretty much for the six and a
hundred and twenty eight gigabyte model
and then only select carriers will have
the eight and 512 gigabyte model those
who pre-order will either get a choice
for a free pair of AKG noise cancelling
headphones valued at 300 bucks or a
fortnight galaxy skin that's 150 dollars
in retail value or yes you can get both
but you'll have to pony up $99 when you
buy Samsung calls this the phone for
