megapixels are all that separate the
seasons most prominent Android flagships
you're in for a big surprise the Samsung
Galaxy s5 and HTC One m8 might look
vaguely similar at first glance but pick
them up plug your life into them and
carry them around town for a day
side-by-side it doesn't take long to
realize that this isn't just about metal
versus plastic this is a clash of
priorities features and just like last
year even philosophy
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
if you're shopping for a high-end
Android smartphone this season there's
no more important comparison than this
Samsung Galaxy s5 vs. HTC One m8 the
first difference you notice is also one
of the biggest feel in hand the 90
percent aluminum wraparound body of the
HTC One m8 is almost silky in the palm
it's hundred and sixty gram mass giving
it a heft that makes it one of the most
distinctive smartphones on the market
distinctive is not the word that comes
to mind when you pull the galaxy s5 from
a pocket like the s4 before it the s5 is
shoes metal for plastic aesthetics for
raw capability at 145 grams the s5 isn't
far off from the HTC phones mass but it
feels substantially lighter due to its
less ambitious chassis materials but the
s5s conservative design obscures a few
advantages it has over the m8 while the
HTC phone has been shown to survive
immersion in water it's not specifically
designed for that kind of abuse by
contrast the Galaxy s5 is rated to ip67
for dust and fresh water immersion up to
a metre deep and Samsung didn't have to
make a tank of a phone to accomplish
that it's actually more than a
millimeter thinner than the HTC One and
the larger Samsung battery is still
removable while the HTC phones is sealed
in yes the galaxy is charging and data
port needs a door to keep it watertight
but its USB 3.0 to the HTC phones 2.0
while we're tossing numbers around let's
talk about specs where there's more
similarity than you'd expect at first
we're focusing on the American versions
here so each of these is powered by
top-shelf hardware a Snapdragon 801
backed up by two gigs of ram and either
16 or 32 gigs of storage
each supports microSD expansion up to a
head exploding 128 gigs and each offers
an IR port Bluetooth NFC Wi-Fi AC etc
but it doesn't take much drilling to get
back to the differences each device has
an unconventional look to its lens area
but HTC's additional eyeball is there to
help out the camera while Samsung's port
hides a heart rate sensor also hidden on
the galaxy s5 a fingerprint reader
lurking beneath the home button my most
support in the Wi-Fi suite a thermometer
in its sensor package but no FM radio if
you want to stream the oldies through
your headphone wire only the HTC device
can do it and speaking of all days the
galaxy s5 uses the older micro sim
standard well HTC is following the rest
of the industry forward into nano Sims
with the m8 finally how about those
displays they're approximately the same
size with the same resolution and very
similar pixel density where they differ
is in color reproduction and brightness
the galaxy's AMOLED screen features
blacks that are truly pitch black and it
can give you crazy color saturation if
you wanted while HTC's SLC d3 is a bit
more conservative also the galaxy s5 can
ratchet the brightness down to two nits
much dimmer than the One m8 16 nits
minimum and handy for bedtime reading in
the opposite condition direct sunlight
the One m8 is the easier phone to read
to wake up those displays you'll press a
button on the samsung device either the
conveniently located side key or the
home button down below while HTC's
unlock key is inconveniently located way
up top that doesn't matter as much
because the One m8 also allows you to
unlock it with gestures don't let our
similar home screen setups fool you
while both of these devices are running
Android 4.4.2 Samsung and HTC have
always been night
day with their manufacturer UIs and
despite some recent changes that holds
true here as well what's important for
this comparison is what you value more
feature load or day-to-day
responsiveness because while these
interfaces have actually grown more
similar over time there's still a
profound disconnect between them if
you're the type who worships at the
altar of raw capability the galaxy s5 is
hands-down the better choice this is
especially true given the s-health suite
which combined with the heartbeat
monitor onboard sensor package the
phone's rugged nature and optional
accessories like the gear fit is a very
powerful offering for fitness buffs and
even if you're not an exercise maven
there's just a truckload of stuff here
multi window for side-by-side
multitasking an app toolbox that can
hang out over your screen like a chat
head air view which lets you hover a
finger over the screen to preview
content private easy and blocking mode
so you can control who has access to
what and so much more just exploring all
the s5s add-ons takes hours the one I
made is no slouch when it comes to
features but the focus of HTC Sense is
still more on delivering a tight unified
responsive experience the extra speed of
the m8 on things like jumping into
blinkfeed
versus jumping into Samsung's my
magazine these delays on the Samsung
phone are cumulative as they add up they
make you feel like you're too often
waiting for the phone to catch up and
screw-ups like these widgets not working
and half-baked features like that
useless geo news they're just
frustrating meanwhile the One m8 while
it does less more often than not does
what it's told and does it well the
short story and software is this if the
galaxy s5 is a phone for the feature
obsessed the One m8 is for those who
respect attention to detail
those same people will be frustrated by
the resolution gulf between these
heavyweights though Samsung's 16
megapixel camera is four times the
resolution of HTC's 4 megapixel ultra
pixel camera and HTC's at a depth sensor
just doesn't do enough to justify its
inclusion because it's faux bouquet
effects really aren't all that good
especially compared to what Samsung is
able to do with its single ISO cell
sensor that Samsung sensor is supposed
to provide better low-light performance
but as you can see from the low-light
comparisons it has its limits though
HTC's ultra pixel camera does overexpose
and washout in some conditions sometimes
that's preferable to Samsung's results
which have this weird milky blue hue
creeping into the frame in very dark
conditions even when the cameras
software stabilization is turned on even
in night mode if you're shooting in
low-light all the time well neither of
these should be your first choice you
should go for a Nokia Lumia device but
it's interesting to see the HTC camera
often delivering much better results in
the dark ultra pixels at work in
brighter conditions the results hew
closer to what you'd expect the s5
consistently offers more saturation and
better contrast and of course the photos
it produces are much more zoomable if
you're looking for fine detail the s5
also barely edges out the one I made in
terms of features though how many you
actually use will depend on you and it's
tough to overstate the coolness of HTC
Zoe those results repeat themselves in
video with the s5 delivering more
saturation and richer audio at the
expense of slightly more visual noise in
the shot
of course the s5 can also shoot in 4k
whereas the One m8 is limited to 1080p
we've only been using these devices side
by side for three days so we can't yet
speak to things like battery life that
said using them on AT&amp;amp;T and Greater
Boston for that short period has shown
us that cellular reception is about the
same they lose and regain service about
the same time when going underground and
re-emerging
we weren't able to detect a noticeable
difference in Wi-Fi speeds but that's
likely due to our older router gaming
performance on each is absolutely
excellent as you'd expect and through
earphones audio is about the same unplug
those earphones though and well
Samsung's Beats Audio app can't make up
for its unimpressive mono speaker around
back meanwhile HTC's boomsound speakers
are even louder and bass here on the m8
than last year's one the result is a
contest that's well not even a contest
boom sound beats everyone and it's
slaughter Samsung
and HTC doesn't stop there even in
regular old plain-jane voice calls
remember those quality on the One m8 is
far superior according to the callers we
talked to so what does it all come down
to well if you're asking for a clearly
defined winner in this contest you're
asking the wrong question
these smartphones are each exemplary in
their own way even when they stumble
there's no Universal deal-breaker
they're essentially the same price on
most carriers in the States - so which
one you buy depends on what features you
value most
that said HTC deserves a nod here for
the completeness of the one I made sure
it's camera is sometimes disappointing
and it's body won't hold up to the abuse
the galaxy s5 can handle but from
hardware to software it feels like a
more finished product while the Samsung
device feels like a step on the road to
something greater but greatness exists
in both of these smartphones so decide
where your priorities lie check out our
full review of the HTC One m8 from March
and our galaxy s5 review coming the week
of April 20th buy one of them if you're
