you a phone that has almost everything
you need meaning if you were to quantify
the basics of what most consumers ask
for a phone some devices do a good job
at nailing the basics thing is even if
they do that usually comes at the
expense of looks and the guarantee that
you're buying into future proof hardware
and software now don't think that I
ended that video with a question just
for the fun of it I know that if you're
looking for a budget phone that's
because you actually want to find
something affordable but what if I told
you that there's something in between a
product that's either as or more
powerful than the flagship phones out
there and priced in a way that'll make
you debate if you really want to buy a
mid-range err a device that jumps from
just fulfilling needs to being a product
that you actually want I think this is
it this is the 1 + 7 Pro what the
company dubs as its way to go beyond
speed and what we know as a flagship
killer but the question is if it's
really worth the extra $270 when
compared to the disruptive pixel 3 a I'm
he might've a double pocket now and this
is our full review
I have yet to meet a person that's
willing to the client the opportunity to
pay less for more it's quite common
sense but the thing about it is in
society when it comes to product
consumption the effect is rather
interesting where people assume that
something that's affordable is cheap and
that's not always the case I know a lot
of company spends much money on
marketing and distribution where oneplus
has a different approach where they
actually don't spend that much on this
and actually use that money for
something that you'll actually consume
let me begin this video by telling you
what I like about the oneplus 7 pro and
it starts with the hardware the oneplus
7 pro is not a cheap phone you can tell
the moment you hold it for the first
time and as of this generation it's
actually also a visual thing but the
sign of previous generations was not bad
but I'm more of a fan of the color
options and the curves of this
generation side-by-side it's even hard
to tell that the 60 and the 7 probe came
from the same company now there are some
clear design inspirations from other
companies I mean the bottom looks a lot
like the made 20 pro and the curves are
all Samsung Galaxy and we kind of get a
hint of where this almond color option
was inspired from still I don't care
this is my favorite color and match with
the minimalistic sandstone case I'm good
this is all I want the second thing I
like is how much the company has
invested in the wow factor that
consumers actually care about this is
seriously one of the best displays on a
smartphone at 6 point 6 7 inches it is
one of the largest you'll finance
category this quad HD plus AMOLED panel
is not just vibrant and gorgeous but
also hearts of fine and competing
devices
see it's one of only two devices that
supports 90 Hertz refresh rates so
navigation and interaction feels more
fluid though yeah that's the reason for
some of the flicker you'll see from the
camera one of the coolest things is the
display is nearly border-to-border at
almost 90 percent screen to body ratio
and there are no notches no punch holes
just all screen to get rid of the
interruptions there's a wow factor
number two because there is a selfie
camera but it's tucked in and it's only
available whenever you need it which is
really convenient for privacy I've seen
people using selfie camera covers we
will come back in a bit to how the
camera performs but right now what's
important is just how fond I have the
come to consuming content without
interruptions see 18 by 9 video is a
true pain when not just come in the way
and now that oneplus has finally taken
the plunge to duel firing speakers it's
gonna be really hard for me to go back
to using any other phone the on display
fingerprint scanner that was gone on the
60 has now gone to great with a larger
surface area and faster response times
and then there's wow factor number three
and what you get for what you pay for
prices range between 669 and 750 dollars
and for this you get the latest Qualcomm
Snapdragon 855 options between 6 8 or 12
gigs of ram 128 or 256 gigs of UF s3
storage which is the fastest in the
market and you have dual sim options if
you go for the unlock variant there's
also a four thousand only amp hour
battery and in the box you get a warp
charge 30 adapter that'll take your
phone from zero to 50% in around less
than 20 minutes now having a really good
sports car is not just about its engine
it's also about all the efficiencies in
the materials and in the case of smart
phones it's all about the software and
oxygen OS continues to be my favorite
option I've been reviewing oneplus
devices since the 3t and if you're
looking for a phone that's fast
minimalistic at age as well this is it I
can glide through menus all day and show
you how fluid it is but really what I
like the most is its flexibility if you
like the software buttons or the pixel
pill or gestures for navigation it's all
an option you want light or dark mode
without having to wait for Android cube
it's here heck if you want to try
Android cube beta this phone supports it
and it's ready for it if you want to
lock applications with your fingerprints
or hide applications in a separate
drawer you can also do that my personal
favorite is reading mode to turn the
screen black and white for when I'm on
the go reading a book but there are
options like gaming mode that's
self-explanatory and then Zen mode in
case you want to force yourself to not
be bothered you can even stack your
widgets on the left shelf if you want a
cleaner home screen though I would have
preferred the Google feed which is what
you'd get in the case of the t-mobile
variant now software also plays a major
role in
life and even with this phone having
features like RAM boost which will keep
certain applications in RAM and help you
launch them quicker I've noticed that
this is one of the few devices that I
can trust to get through the day without
a problem and I still have enough
battery life to reach the next day and
for those of you concerned about data
speeds since I did notice some
differences in one plus predecessors
watch our recent 5g video where the
unlock variant is being tested when
compared to the galaxy s 10 plus and the
galaxy s 10 5g and data speeds for
stellar on all devices right about now
you'd think that this is the perfect
phone I mean it is a great flagship but
this is not a sequel to the notebook
it's a review let me tell you where I'm
mixed about this device the first is
really ergonomic the oneplus Evan Pro is
a large phone which I'm sure it's fine
for some of you heck I always drift the
galaxy notes so I should be technically
okay but the problem is really the
combination of factors I mean the phone
looks awesome with its curved screen but
there is ZERO palm rejection which
galaxy notes actually get right and as
cool as the navigation gestures are
given the size of the phone achieving
that back gesture at the bottom left is
a nightmare I seriously can't wait for
oneplus to adopt the back gestures that
you can find on Android q and the second
thing is well you have a large phone
what is the excuse for there not to be a
headphone jack if we're gonna use the
slogan of never settle and then last but
not least let's talk about the camera
but not for the reasons you think I know
that we're in the mix section but it's
not to tell you that this camera is bad
this camera is actually really good see
on the positive front we have all the
versatility that you demand from a flash
of smartphone camera we have a telephoto
a wide-angle and a standard sensor with
all the specifications to not make you
want more and then there's the software
where oneplus has invested a lot in
improving their proprietary HDR and in
addition to the basic minimalism of the
camera software resulting photos are
good I mean very good color saturation
and dynamic range and I really like that
the color reproduction is not overdone
on the contrary it's very subtle and
accurate and the same can be said for
low-light performance were features like
nightscape let you capture a lot of
detail in tough conditions
if you moved to portrait photos and
selfie portraits I like how natural the
results are from this set of cameras
which makes it easy to edit later in
whichever software you like without
worrying about clipping detail now
obviously there's a reason why this is
in the mixed section and it's because I
feel that the software needs a little
more maturity in the flexibility of
being able to edit these portrait photos
after the fact or being able to take
them and use the wide-angle cameras the
depth map sensor and not force you to
step back from your subject to get the
shot and then there's the topic of video
recording where 4k video is great at 60
frames per second and we have some
really good stabilization but I find it
to be such a missed opportunity that you
can't switch between sensors as you
record video and then there's the topic
of switching to selfie video where
colors and civilization are good as well
but the problem is that your capped at
1080p video and we're close competitors
are currently already at 4k with a
sensor that has a lot less megapixels to
conclude notice that there is no things
that I don't like about this phone in
our review I mean surely the 1 plus 7
Pro is not a perfect device but if you
think about it most of the things that I
find myself mixed about are things that
our personal taste you have a great
looking design awesome color options
great software and all the most powerful
specifications money can buy and a
camera that gives its competitors have
run for its money
after a month of using this as my daily
driver and at a time when getting the
latest and greatest cost you more than
$1,000 it's really hard for me to sit
here and tell you that any of those more
expensive phones is better they're not
they've got their perks but the 1 plus 7
Pro is actually the best value flagship
money can buy in my opinion I'm not even
gonna call this a flagship killer
anymore I'm actually gonna call this a
flagship a device that I feel that other
competitors should look up to and how
they are able to achieve all this and
not make you break the bank but what
about you let us know what you think
about the 1 plus 7 Pro in the comments
