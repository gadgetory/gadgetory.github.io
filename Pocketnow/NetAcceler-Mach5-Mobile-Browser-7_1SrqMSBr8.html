parking calm and today I'm going to show
you a sweet new web browser windows
mobile 6.1 6.1 devices and the program
is called Mach 5 and it's created by
genetic seller a company based out of
Hong Kong now this browser is available
to try but at the moment it all and i
can say that i hope the developers
expand to the west because this browser
is probably one of the best browsers
that i've seen so far its a mix between
opera mobile 9.5 with the flash enriched
server rendering as the web pages are
quick to load but unfortunately they
default to the hong kong-based version
and there is no setting that allows for
this to be turned up okay so we'll just
go to Google I'll show you how it
renders to the hong kong version of the
website so if i go to google com it'll
actually go to google.com / HK so right
here ask for user ID and password so
this program only work to the middle of
May like I said so we'll just at trial
hopefully in the future the developers
don't start charging because I don't
think people would actually pay for
something when they could get it for
free like opera mobile 9.71 is released
so as you can see it renders to the hong
kong version of the website so we
luckily this website also allows for
english translation so click on that
wait for to load okay there goes and the
cool thing about this is you have it
will give you the full screen default to
the full screen but you can also change
it so your address barton settings and
your tools on the bottom so that's nice
so go into the zoom as you saw when i
zoomed in it zoomed in kind of like
opera mobile 9.5 which is really useful
but you can also pick difference in
levels so i can zoom out if I'd like to
170 550 hi 925 all the way one hundred
percent which is the normal web page it
can also change between landscape and
portrait so we can do that and it will
also work with a slider device I'm not
too sure about an accelerometer device
but it should work as well so on go back
just put it back to the regular page
there we go okay the house will go to
our favorites so I have talking out a
common here so I'll just click on that
and because the u.s. website should load
pretty fast so you have some of the
videos work on this
just wait for it to load it's actually
pretty fast to load the entire page so
go down as you can see some of the flash
enriched advertisers up here and go down
to one of these videos so here's one
that Brandon did today so click on this
it actually launched youtube so it says
video file detected play it now and I'll
click yes and it will launch its
proprietary video player so that's
pretty nice so can also click full
screen go back so as you can see it
works very well it's actually really
fast so it's pretty high quality so
click out of that and we'll just go and
as you can see it opened up a new
webpage you can have up to three web
pages so it opened up YouTube a separate
web page we can't go back to the pocket
our website right here and click on this
and it will bring us back to our web
page that we run before so that's nice
and asked if it also says if you there's
other videos on the web page it'll it'll
select video file detectable sticking
out for now now to understand the
settings so you can see the screen
rotation you can rotate the screen you
can select text you can select image
text view which will take you directly
to the text you can also use different
settings on the now so you can and block
pop-ups you can select text box or image
box so what on the mouse you can select
those settings you can go to homepage
browser mode so you can go mobile mode
or piecing those will just cancel this
is the double click zoom ratio so if you
click kind of like on the Opera Mobile
9.5 which is very nice and initial
settings will reset everything and web
page width is you can select how the web
page you want to be viewed so as close
as and this is the about the programs
free at the moment and we're unsure as
to what and how the developers will
watch this browser and the website
states to the browser will run on any
windows mobile 6.1 six-foot-one device
with either a queue vga or vga screen
but as you can see on this
this is a wvga resolution screen and so
it might work on many other devices as
well and I'll post my compaq another com
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
