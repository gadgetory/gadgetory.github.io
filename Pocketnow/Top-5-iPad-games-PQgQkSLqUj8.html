best multimedia devices on the market
I'd tailor Martin this is PocketNow and
these are the top five games for your
iPad the iPad is known for its superior
multimedia experience video content
digital magazines hundreds of thousands
of high quality apps and of course an
obscene amount of dangerously addictive
games in recent years game developers
have given iOS a serious look which has
resulted in Apple's popular mobile s
becoming a solid gaming platform for
various types of games so we've created
a list of the top five iPad games the
first model net list belongs to none
other than one of the iOS exclusive
titles Infinity Blade released just last
week was the third and final episode of
the trilogy Infinity Blade 3 if you
followed along with a storyline you will
note that this episode picks up where
Infinity Blade 2 left off with Syrus
pressing forward to defeat the worker of
Secrets if you haven't and you're just
starting up with Infinity Blade 3 it's
just as easy to pick up so you may not
understand the whole story until after a
few attempts basically you're in a
post-apocalyptic world battling an army
of deathless titans and a journey to
destroy the worker as you progress the
Titans become more difficult and like
other infinity blades in the series the
game is utterly repetitive in a good way
once you die you respond once again and
start from the beginning Cyrus is
hideout built on the Unreal Engine the
graphics and gameplay as expected are
stunning
controls are built for ease of use on
tablets making Infinity Blade one of the
best ever mobile game titles for $6.99
some might find this game a little steep
but it's well worth the $7 for the epic
battles that will ensue Call of Duty is
a game most gamers can immediately
associate with not everyone likes this
Call of Duty titles as they're more
often an arcade style FPS as opposed to
similar games like Battlefield but for
this list we've included call of duty
strike team frankly we would have
included modern combat 4 in the place of
Call of Duty strike team as the actual
gameplay in combat is a little more
polished
however strike team has one unique
gameplay style that keeps us coming back
a third-person top-down strategy mode
where you control your team from above
while first-person shooters are
generally very fun the on-screen
controls aren't always up to snuff so
the ability to an
the same type of gameplay with more
finger-friendly controls is a nice
change and for any Call of Duty fans out
there there are quite a few similarities
between the mobile optimised game and
the console counterparts such as the
sounds this game is also $6.99 and well
worth it if you like third-person
strategy style games the asphalt series
is one we here at pocket now are very
familiar with as fall 7 was one of the
best racing games for any mobile
platform until this year and when game
law announced antes asphalt 8 we could
hardly wait to be completely honest
asphalt 8 wasn't all it was hyped to be
but it doesn't disappoint either the
graphics are great the controls are
nimble and fun and it's still one of the
most engaging and fun mobile racers out
there best of all it's only $0.99 but
there are a ton of in-app purchases to
speed you along through various seasons
more quickly if you're looking for
something a little more realistic and
less arcade style you may want to check
out the freemium of Real Racing 3 not
every game has to be a 3d action-packed
adventure to be fun sometimes the most
addictive games are very simple yet
challenging puzzles that's exactly what
beat sneak bandit is Duke clockface has
stolen all the clocks and you beat sneak
bandit our own emissions who steal them
back for the greater good of your people
to get past security and remain
undetected you must sneak to the beat of
the music playing in each level from
level 1 the game is fairly challenging
especially if you have trouble keeping
time but the levels progress in
difficulty the further you get into the
game it's wildly addictive and
moderately challenging at $2.99 this
game is a masterpiece and a must by
finally nightmare tower this game like
Infinity Blade thrives on repetition but
in a totally different way you're a
knight flying through a tower fighting
off monsters a boss and dodging hot lava
to rescue 10 different princesses
upgrade your character to better your
odds the controls are very simple tilt
to move and tap to attack it's like a
medieval twist on Galaga but infinitely
more addictive nightmare Tower is also
$2.99 and well worth the price of a cup
of coffee that's gonna wrap this video
up if you enjoyed it be sure to let us
know by clicking the thumbs up button
below and subscribing but before we go
we'd like to leave you with a question
there are many many more games out
for the iPad so if you had to choose one
which would it be if I had to choose one
it would be asphalt 8 be sure to leave
your answer to the question in the
