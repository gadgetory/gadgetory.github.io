magazine's techland blog made the case
for the retirement of the Nexus brand
name the piece was based on a rumor from
noted leaker elder murders in and it
ended by saying that the Nexus brand
name itself is due for retirement
because it communicates nothing about
the product to those who don't already
know its meaning well whether you agree
with that assessment or not it is true
that the Nexus line has been through
quite a few changes over the years and
since we at pocket now have every
incarnation of Nexus smartphone in our
inventory we thought we'd take advantage
of this month anniversary to take a look
back at where the Nexus line has been
and just how that meaning has changed
over time i'm michael fisher with pocket
now this is every Nexus smartphone from
the last four years so let's see what's
changed since 2010 most product lines
that grew to greatness had humble
beginnings and that's very true of the
Nexus family the HTC built nexus one
launched in January 2010 almost didn't
see the light of day from Apple lawsuits
to US Patent Office refusal to a
challenge from the estate of author
philip k dick the nexus one was plagued
with hassles before during and after its
release leading some to question the
worth of the entire endeavor but the
ones specs including one of the first
snapdragon processors and then hefty 512
megs of ram were meant to showcase
android at its best the device launched
with android version 2.1 eclair and
would eventually top out at gingerbread
officially anyway but the nexus one with
its unlockable bootloader was built with
developers in mind some of whom used its
powerful hardware to good effect when
crafting custom roms the nexus one
certainly bears the hallmarks of 2010
era design witnessed the trackball
rounded sweeping HTC curves and the 3.7
inch AMOLED display or LCD depending on
when you bought it and despite Google's
efforts to reinvent the mobile space on
its back the one was destined to remain
an artifact of 2010 there just wasn't
enough here for most Americans to
justify choosing this 500 $29
unsubsidized phone
over subsidized equally capable
competitors like the motorola droid on
verizon or the evo 4g from sprint and
google shuttered the nexus one web store
just five months after it debuted at the
time a lot of us thought the Nexus story
would end there so it was a big surprise
to many when Google less than a year
after kicking off its first pure Android
experiment followed HTC's device with
Samsung's Nexus S as the name implies
the new phone shared a lot in common
with Samsung's then new Galaxy S line on
both the spec sheet and the casing
design a slick black plastic chassis
with a bulbous inverted chin and a very
slight curve to the glass covering the
display which was once again either
AMOLED or LCD depending on market and
though it's only the second generation
of nexus smartphones we already see the
effects of the competition's rapidly
inflating display size the Nexus S
screen was 4 inches on the diagonal to
its predecessors 3.7 but one-handed
usability was just as easy due to the
small size of the hardware on the
software side android 2.3 didn't behave
a whole lot differently from prior
versions but a slightly darkened and
more reserved interface was the first
indication of google's new focus on the
UI it wasn't until the next generation
that we would see the company take a
truly meaningful step toward aesthetic
improvements the positive aspects of the
Galaxy Nexus were almost all rooted in
ice cream sandwich android for dodo was
the most major overhaul of androids
interface ever and almost all of its
changes from the new color palette to
the Roboto font family to the updated
multitasking view to the added
responsiveness were long overdue and
quickly embraced by those tired of
androids ugly duckling reputation it's
thanks to ice cream sandwich that I
consider this generation launched in
late 2011 to be the first truly modern
Nexus smartphone unfortunately the
Galaxy Nexus wasn't such a grand slam on
the hardware side while its build shed
the sly meanness of the Nexus S and up
to the screen size once again to four
point six five inches the pentile screen
delivered washed out colors and milky
white also the sack
fices made by google to accommodate a
verizon branded LTE variant meant that
that version did not receive timely
Android updates long a promise of the
Nexus brand in addition the phone's
battery life was subpar and it's Texas
Instruments chipset would later come
back to haunt Galaxy Nexus owners who
were prevented from updating to Android
KitKat officially anyway before KitKat
though there was jelly bean and the
device built to launch it in November
2012 was the nexus for the all-glass
smart phone from LG borrowed heavily
from the design of the earlier Optimus G
with an IPS display under curved glass
only slightly larger but of a much
better quality than that of the Galaxy
Nexus its specs were typical of
top-of-the-line smartphones from a year
ago with a Snapdragon s4 pro under the
hood and two gigs of RAM pushing along
the project butter enabled Android for
two at a good clip as long as you are on
Wi-Fi or a capable 3g network because
while the next has 41 points for
including wireless charging it also lost
a ton by not offering LTE but there's a
good reason for that this smartphone was
built not just to continue the pure
Android legacy of the Nexus line but to
help change what that line stood for
continuing in the vein of the Affordable
Nexus 7 tablet the Nexus 4 was built to
be an affordable high-end smartphone it
launched starting at 299 off-contract a
hundred dollars cheaper than its
predecessors initial price and more than
two hundred dollars cheaper than the
nexus ones this aggressive pricing
completely changed the messaging of the
Nexus brand no longer was it a phone
just for Android diehards and developers
now Nexus meant lower than average
pricing for a better than average phone
even if this one did crack pretty easily
the current model predictably named the
Nexus 5 fixes the fragility problem with
a polycarbonate back and continues
Google's low-cost strategy it launched
last October starting at three hundred
forty nine dollars the added cost is
well worth it if you live in a 4G area
the Nexus 5 offers extensive LTE
compatibility it also does its best to
correct a persistent problem with the
Nexus line poor photo performance the 8
megapixel camera in the Nexus 5 is
optically stabilized and does a better
job than its predecessors at capturing a
solid picture which it displays on an
IPS screen that's followed the rest of
the industry into the 5-inch territory
that's par for the course these days but
putting it up next to the first
generation Nexus makes it easy to see
just how much has changed that change is
even more meaningful in the new phones
software for the first time ever the
Nexus 5 incorporates an exclusive
launcher in its version of Android
KitKat with features you can only find
officially on the Nexus 5 and that
launcher leads to an experience that's
not quite as much pure Android as pure
Google that's an important distinction
because today's Nexus is a portal to a
glut of services and features most of
which weren't even around when the first
Nexus phones rolled off the line okay
but so what right ecosystems mature new
features come along over time that's not
unique to the Nexus line well that's
absolutely right and that universal
truth taken together with Google's
strategy changes over the past four
years say to me that the Nexus brand is
just like any other one it used to be
aligned for developers then it was for
the pure Android experience and then it
morphed into an option for the price
conscious and the contract averse and
today it's kind of a funky amalgam of
all three like Google itself the Nexus
line is dynamic it changes but the
important thing is it's always
aspirational whether its purity
affordability or utility it's always
showcasing the very best of what Android
can
and that's why I hope it sticks around

thank you for watching and we'll see on
the next one we thought we'd take
advantage of this month anniversary to
take a look back at where the Nexus line
has gone and just how that teleprompter
can move faster we thought we'd take a
look back and use the advantage of this
horrible sentence to trap ourselves in a
never-ending intro that never gets
filmed right this is every Nexus phone
ever made and let's see what's changed
