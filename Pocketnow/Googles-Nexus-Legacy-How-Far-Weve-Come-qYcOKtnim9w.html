Magazine's Techland blog made the case
for the retirement of the Nexus brand
name
the piece was based on a rumor from
noted leaker elder Merton and it ended
by saying that the Nexus brand name
itself is due for retirement because it
communicates nothing about the product
to those who don't already know its
meaning well whether you agree with that
assessment or not it is true that the
Nexus line has been through quite a few
changes over the years and since we at
pocket now have every incarnation of
Nexus smartphone in our inventory we
thought we'd take advantage of this
month's anniversary to take a look back
at where the Nexus line has been and
just how that meaning has changed over
time I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow
this is every Nexus smartphone from the
last four years so let's see what's
changed since 2010 most product lines
that grew to greatness had humble
beginnings and that's very true of the
Nexus family the HTC built Nexus One
launched in January 2010 almost didn't
see the light of day from Apple lawsuits
to US Patent Office refusal to a
challenge from the estate of author
philip k dick the Nexus One was plagued
with hassles before during and after its
release leaving some to question the
worth of the entire endeavor but the
ones specs including one of the first
Snapdragon processors and then hefty 512
Meg's of RAM were meant to showcase
Android at its best the device launched
with android version 2.1 Eclair and
would eventually top out at gingerbread
officially anyway but the Nexus One with
its unlockable bootloader was built with
developers in mind some of whom used its
powerful hardware to good effect when
crafting custom roms the Nexus 1
certainly bears the hallmarks of 2010
era design witness the trackball rounded
sweeping HTC curves and the 3.7 inch
AMOLED display or LCD depending on when
you bought it
and despite Google's efforts to reinvent
the mobile space on its back the one was
destined to remain an artifact of 2010
there just wasn't enough here for most
Americans to justify choosing this $529
unsubsidized phone
over subsidized equally capable
competitors like the Motorola Droid and
Verizon or the Evo 4G from Sprint and
Google shuttered the Nexus One webstore
just five months after it debuted at the
time a lot of us thought the Nexus story
would end there so it was a big surprise
to many when Google less than a year
after kicking off its first pure Android
experiment followed HTC's device with
Samsung's Nexus S as the name implies
the new phone shared a lot in common
with Samsung's then new Galaxy S line on
both the spec sheet and the casing
design a slick black plastic chassis
with a bulbous inverted chin and a very
slight curve to the glass covering the
display which was once again either
AMOLED or LCD depending on market and
though it's only the second generation
of Nexus smartphones we already see the
effects of the competition's rapidly
inflating display size the Nexus S
screen was four inches on the diagonal
to its predecessors 3.7 but one-handed
usability was just as easy due to the
small size of the hardware on the
software side Android 2.3 didn't behave
a whole lot differently from prior
versions but a slightly darkened and
more reserved interface was the first
indication of Google's new focus on the
UI it wasn't until the next generation
that we would see the company take a
truly meaningful step toward aesthetic
improvements the positive aspects of the
Galaxy Nexus were almost all rooted in
Ice Cream Sandwich Android 4.1 / Hall of
androids interface ever and almost all
of its changes from the new color
palette to the Roboto font family to the
updated multitasking view to the added
responsiveness were long overdue and
quickly embraced by those tired of
androids ugly duckling reputation it's
thanks to Ice Cream Sandwich that I
consider this generation launched in
late 2011 to be the first truly modern
Nexus smartphone
unfortunately the Galaxy Nexus wasn't
such a grand slam on the hardware side
while its build shed the sly meanness of
the Nexus S and up to the screen size
once again to four point six five inches
the pentile screen delivered washed out
colors milky whites also the sack
professors made by Google to accommodate
a verizon branded LTE variant meant that
that version did not receive timely
Android updates long a promise of the
Nexus brand in addition the phone's
battery life was subpar
and it's Texas Instruments chipset would
later come back to haunt Galaxy Nexus
owners who were prevented from updating
to Android KitKat officially anyway
before KitKat though there was jellybean
and the device built to launch it in
November 2012 was the Nexus 4 the
all-glass smart phone from LG borrowed
heavily from the design of the earlier
Optimus G with an IPS display under
curved glass only slightly larger but of
a much better quality than that of the
Galaxy Nexus its specs were typical of
top-of-the-line smartphones from a year
ago with a Snapdragon s4 pro under the
hood and two gigs of ram pushing along
the project butter enabled Android 4.2
at a good clip as long as you were on
Wi-Fi or a capable 3G network because
while the Nexus 4 1 points for including
wireless charging it also lost a ton by
not offering LTE but there's a good
reason for that this smartphone was
built not just to continue the pure
Android legacy of the Nexus line but to
help change what that line stood for
continuing in the vein of the affordable
Nexus 7 tablet the Nexus 4 was built to
be an affordable high-end smartphone it
launched starting at $2.99 off contract
$100 cheaper than its predecessors
initial price and more than $200 cheaper
than the Nexus ones this aggressive
pricing completely changed the messaging
of the Nexus brand no longer was it a
phone just for Android diehards and
developers now Nexus meant lower than
average pricing for a
better-than-average phone even if this
one did crack pretty easily
the current model predictably named the
Nexus 5 fixes the fragility problem with
a polycarbonate back and continues
Google's low-cost strategy it launched
last October starting at $349 the added
cost is well worth it if you live in a
4G area the Nexus 5 offers extensive LTE
compatibility it also does its best to
correct a persistent problem with the
Nexus line poor photo performance the 8
megapixel camera in the Nexus 5 is
optically stabilized and does a better
job than its predecessors at capturing a
solid picture which it displays on an
IPS screen that's followed the rest of
the industry into the 5 inch territory
that's par for the course these days but
putting it up next to the first
generation Nexus makes it easy to see
just how much has changed that change is
even more meaningful in the new phone's
software for the first time ever the
Nexus 5 incorporates an exclusive
launcher in its version of Android
KitKat with features you can only find
officially on the Nexus 5 and that
launcher leads to an experience that's
not quite as much pure Android as pure
Google that's an important distinction
because today's Nexus is a portal to a
glut of services and features most of
which weren't even around when the first
Nexus phones rolled off the line ok but
so what right ecosystems mature new
features come along over time it's not
unique to the Nexus line well that's
absolutely right and that universal
truth taken together with Google's
strategy changes over the past 4 years
say to me that the Nexus brand is just
like any other one
it used to be aligned for developers
then it was for the pure Android
experience and then it morphed into an
option for the price conscious and the
contract averse and today it's kind of a
funky amalgam of all three like Google
itself the Nexus line is dynamic it
changes but the important thing is it's
always aspirational whether its purity
affordability or utility it's always
showcasing the very best of what Android
can do
and that's why I hope it sticks around

thank you for watching and we'll see on
the next one
we thought we'd take advantage of this
month's anniversary to take a look back
at where the Nexus line has gone and
just how that teleprompter can move
faster we thought we'd take a look back
and use the advantage of this horrible
sentence to trap ourselves in a never
ending intro that never gets filmed
right this is every Nexus phone ever
made and let's see what's changed in the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
