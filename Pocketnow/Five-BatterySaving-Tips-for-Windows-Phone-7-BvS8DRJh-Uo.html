now calm and in this video we're going
to talk about battery saving tips for
windows phone 7 let's get to it now a
lot of these tips are applicable to all
smartphone devices but some of them are
clickable to just windows phone 7 like
this first one if you are using an
AMOLED display you want to be sure that
you are using the dark theme and not the
light theme i'm about to show you can
get there by going into settings going
into theme and choosing light so now
everything is white in a Super AMOLED
display the only pixels that are
requiring power to light up on the
screen are ones that are not black so
more of the stories you want to have as
much black on the screen as possible and
choosing the dark color scheme is
absolutely the way to go now in an LCD
screen like you'll find on the HTC hd2
or the HTC mozart it doesn't matter if
you have the white or black theme
because there's always a backlight
running on your display when the
displays on so either one will be just
fine and there's really no difference in
terms of battery life but super amoled
or AMOLED definitely go with the dark
theme number two we can talk about some
changes to Wi-Fi to get better battery
life and some people say that it's good
to have Wi-Fi on all the time because
it's a more efficient way to get data
some people say it's better to use the
3g connection in my opinion Wi-Fi is the
more efficient radio and you should use
it whenever possible so over here in
Wi-Fi obviously if you have an own
network when your phone comes in range
of that network it will latch on but you
want to uncheck this box here notify me
when new networks are found because your
phone is going to be constantly scanning
for new networks and it's going to
present you with a pop-up but instead if
you are within a place that has Wi-Fi
you can join it manually into the next
time your phone is in that area it will
join automatically to that Network
number three email accounts I've got two
email accounts on this device another
friend of mine has the same phone with
three email accounts we have a similar
configuration and yet his battery life
is worse more all the stories that you
want to limit the amount of email
accounts you're running on your Windows
Phone 7 device and of course you can
change the sync settings so that it's
not pulling email on a regular basis or
not doing push email certainly the
higher interval that you choose to check
no as has always been the case with
smartphones will make it a little bit
easier on your battery number three
another way that to save a little bit of
battery life if we go into settings is
to change the location feature here to
off so it's not going to be using the
really precise GPS to find your location
it's going to be using triangulation
which will still give you a location but
not as as precisely I actually leave it
on because the battery life on the
samsung focus seems to be quite good so
I can benefit from that location and
finally another thing that you may want
to change and this is arguable if you go
to the bottom here to system and you go
to feedback this allows Microsoft to
receive error reports when something
goes wrong on your phone it's good for a
Microsoft but it runs another process on
your phone which is using a little bits
of battery life and also CPU cycles so
if you want to have a device that's as
fast as possible with as much battery
left as possible good thing to leave
this off Microsoft probably doesn't want
you to but hey it's your phone do what
you want and finally just a note on the
battery indicator you may already know
this you probably discover this already
fifa Windows Phone 7 device but Windows
Phone 7 does not show you how much
battery there is unless you tap on the
top bar here in fact everything is
hidden including the 3g signal strength
the Wi-Fi indicator and the vibrate ring
indicator so you always have to tap up
at the top there's no way to keep this
on hopefully in a future version of
Windows Phone 7 they give you a way to
keep the battery meter up all the time
so you can glance up and see how much
battery you have left for more
