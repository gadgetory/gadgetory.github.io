company but it's not until it decided to
approach mobile technology that it's
fallen more on our radar parks like the
porsche design huawei mate 9 or an
example of all the innovation this
company can provide and we recently got
a glimpse of something else something
actually very cool with some late
coverage for me but GPC in Lisbon I'm
editing out of a pocket now and this is
the Porsche design book one
so if you're a Porsche fan and even if
you're not there is a lot to consider
about the book one for starters it
adopts a lot of the features that we
loved about the Microsoft Surface book
this is a full-blown and very powerful
computer that can also become a tablet
if you need it to the company made it a
big deal about this special hinge that
it has at the back that enables its
design and we've got to say that it's
quite awesome at a glance even more
awesome is that this computer seems like
if it has sharp corners but actually it
doesn't it's quite easy to handle it's
no slouch when it comes to
specifications thanks to with 7th
generation Intel Core i7 16 gigs of ram
and 512 gigabytes on the solid-state
drive the 13.3 inch display is
multi-touch supporting up to 10 fingers
at a time with a resolution of 3200 by
1800 and it also supports more than 4000
pressure points for its book one pen in
case you want to use a stylus for input
and speaking of input porsche design
went as far as to making the keyboard
experience more pleasant there are also
some very loud stereo speakers in the
package and if you're looking for
Windows hello yes there is an iris
scanner here battery life is also
claimed to be up to 14 hours with only
two hours needed to top it off after
that it supports other important
peripherals like USB C and thunders book
3.1 connectivity and don't worry those
extra dongles you need for HDMI are
actually included in the box overall
you'll probably think that the price tag
on the book one must be insane but it's
actually cheaper than a MacBook Pro spec
touted just 2800 euros is it really
worth all this
well Windows 10 has proven to be great
and match with beautiful design and
powerful internals it can only get
better but time will tell once we get
one for our full review
