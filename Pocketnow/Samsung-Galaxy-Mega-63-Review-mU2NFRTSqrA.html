longer a phone but rather a small tablet
as a boundary that Samsung has been
pushing for the better part of two years
and it's showing no signs of slowing
down or abandoning the so-called phablet
market I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and this is our full review of the
galaxy mega 6.3 as if the name wasn't a
dead giveaway the Galaxy mega is a huge
phone it's the first thing you'll notice
once you see the phone in person the
second thing you will notice is that it
looks almost exactly like a much larger
galaxy s4 it features the same plastic
trim around the edges the same dock
pattern on the hyper clays plastic on
the back and beneath the glass on the
front and the same camera hump around
back with the LED flash beneath the
difference here obviously is size it
measures one hundred and sixty seven
point six millimeters tall 88
millimeters wide and eight millimeters
thick for reference the galaxy note 2 is
only 150 1.1 millimeters tall 80.5
millimeters wide and nine point four
millimeters thick
although the mega 6.3 weighs in at a
hefty 199 grams it feels relatively
lightweight especially for its size much
of that weight is the giant 3200
milliamp hour battery if you've been
turned off by Samsung's penchant for
lightweight plastics the galaxy mega
will be no different it strictly adheres
to Samsung's current design language and
does not deviate even the slightest bit
from the design shown in the Galaxy Note
8 or the galaxy s4 while this pocket
stretching foam pushes the boundary of
what is sensible to carry and
specifications won't blow anyone away
Samsung did not build this phone to
cannibalize its Galaxy S and Galaxy Note
brands instead it's been given a brand
of its own and thus does not feature the
most impressive specifications it bears
a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon 400
chip 1.5 gigabytes of RAM 8 or 16
gigabytes of built-in storage paired
with a micro SD card slot and 8
megapixel primary camera and the now
standard subset of connectivity Wi-Fi
b/g/n
AC NFC LTE and/or HSPA+ and infrared
lastly the 6.3 inch display is hardly
the best display on the market unlike
most Samsung smartphones the mega does
not feature a Super AMOLED display
instead it's a TFT LCD panel with a
resolution of 1280 by
120 pixels for a total pixel density of
233 PPI as you would expect beside a
smaller more dense display like the 4.7
inch 1080p s LCD 3 display on the HTC
one videos and images are not nearly as
crisp in fact the edges of the icons on
the home screen looked fuzzy that said
large text looks fairly sharp the
display offers wide viewing angles but
the colors are not nearly as saturated
as what you will find on other Samsung
devices using OLED displays it's not
even as vibrant as many other LCD panels
we've seen but it's bright and the added
size is what truly matters with this
phone the Galaxy mega 6.3 runs the
latest version of Android version 4.2.2
beneath the latest TouchWiz iteration if
you've used the Samsung smartphone for
any length of time in the past two years
you will feel right at home on the mega
6.3 the notification shade looks
virtually the same as the galaxy s3s
or the note 2's the icons home screens
widgets and application drawer all look
the same but since it's running on jelly
bean 4.2 there are some added features
such as lock screen widgets daydream
mode and a quick settings page
accessible by a two finger swipe down
from the top of the display and many of
samsung's features we have come to
expect or prison such as multi window s
voice motion controls S Memo a custom
photo gallery and much more however it's
important to note that this version of
TouchWiz is not the full-blown TouchWiz
you will find on the galaxy s4 you will
find air view the ability to preview
select content by hovering your finger
over various things and like on the s4
the light will follow your hovering
finger around the lockscreen you will
also see the new tab layout if you take
a quick trip to the settings application
there you may also notice there are
several things missing such as air
gesture smart polls smart rotation or
smart scroll it's also missing dual
camera and drama shot in the camera app
and many more features there are also
several built-in apps missing like s
health more or less the galaxy mega 6.3
offers the same TouchWiz we're all used
to by now atop the latest version of
jelly bean instead of new smart features
Samsung has kept this version of
TouchWiz fairly streamlined with
previous versions which shows us exactly
how the company is prioritizing and
showing favoritism towards its hero
device the gallic
s4 the chipset in the Galaxy mega 6.3
isn't the fastest chip around
it's a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core Krait CPU
paired with an Adreno 305 GPU to make
the Snapdragon 400 chipset and in normal
day-to-day usage it holds up pretty well
as per usual with a TouchWiz device
there is some intermittent lag and
stuttering and thanks to s voice there
is a short pause that occurs when you
press the home button disable the double
press shortcut in s voice settings and
you will immediately notice a serious
improvement when exiting apps naturally
it scores them synthetic benchmark tests
weren't the greatest we've seen much
higher scores and much lower scores the
Galaxy mega 6.3 will eventually come
with LTE capabilities but our model is
limited to HS p+ connectivity and we've
been running in on AT&amp;amp;T here in the
Charlotte metro area for several days
and all the speed tests so far have been
in the same ballpark around 6.5 megabits
per second down and one point five
megabits per second up car quality has
been above average callers for crisp
clear and exceptionally loud there are
even software toggles that can improve
the sound quality based on individual
use cases we also held enough signal to
perform and hold calls in spotty areas
some places we've even been disconnected
with other phones on AT&amp;amp;T with a 32
hundred million power battery tucked
inside we figured the Galaxy mega 6.3
would offer similar battery life to the
galaxy note 2 but we hadn't taken into
account the additional battery munching
display and it makes a noticeable impact
on the battery life overall we'd say the
stamina on this device is average which
is disappointing considering the
additional battery capacity as you would
imagine when the display is on
especially at full brightness you can
watch the battery percentage slip away
by the minute the camera around back is
an 8 megapixel camera and considering
the galaxy s3 and note 2 offered some of
the best eight megapixel cameras on the
Android platform we set our expectations
pretty high for the mega 6.3 s image
sensing in a nutshell the performance of
the mega 6.3 s camera isn't terribly
impressive but we're not convinced it
isn't a lack of software optimization
images turn out great in terms of
clarity color reproduction and contrast
low-light performance isn't particularly
noteworthy but the real problem is auto
exposure the camera is very quick to
blow out whites and it also has some
trouble
clean autofocusing to sum things up we'd
be hard-pressed to say the galaxy mega
6.3 is destined to be a popular
smartphone it definitely turned some
heads and it makes a great conversation
piece we've even had many passers-by
extremely interested in such a large
foam but its size makes it a tight fit
in pockets even in loose jeans and
shorts and it forces users to use the
phone two-handed in most scenarios it's
a great thing if you're after additional
display space that still fits in your
pocket a smartphone that can play the
part of a small tablet and a smartphone
and for that we love it but this
smartphone is clearly not for everyone
we give the Galaxy mega 6.3 and 8 out of
10 that's gonna wrap up this review if

before we go we'd like to give a final
thanks to our friends at Negri
electronics for lending us a Galaxy mega
6.3 for this review as always I'm Taylor
