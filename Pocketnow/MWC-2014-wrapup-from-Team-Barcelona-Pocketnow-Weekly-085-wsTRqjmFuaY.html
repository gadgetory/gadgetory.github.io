new wearable gadgets an Android nokia
phone mwc 2014 was a veritable avalanche
of adventure and surprise and we've got
the dudes who saw it all in person here
to fill us in on just what it was like
on episode 08 five of the pocket now
weekly the once a week audio podcast
where we discuss smartphones tablets and
wearables from the United States I'm
your host Michael Fisher editorial
director at pocket now along with my
trusty auto aficionado Taylor Martin
hi-ho neighbor hello and joining us from
Europe fresh from their Barcelona
adventure everyone's favorite Romanian
Honduran duo editor-in-chief aunt on
dinadh and multimedia manager Jaime
Rivera good morning guys and good
morning to you it is gonna be good
morning for an entire week man now I
this is this is fun because we've had
people we've had two people on one mic
before but never I don't think have we
had our chief hunter and staying with
our lead Romanian how long is that
happening for for at least a week or
until I kick him out I think the second
will happen earlier yeah we were talking
a little bit off the off the air about
whether you were having any Romanian
coffee or not and not neither nor are
you having palinka you're completely dry
at the moment well you wanted a sober
for the show right I'm not really no I'm
haven't you told that I was a little
discipline hey let's hang up and look
back yeah let's try this again and
Michael heza has a package arrived from
me yet no because you didn't send it on
time well it will arrive today and when
it does I think you'll be happy good
good did you leave me at us and whether
you sent in the extra bottle of bullying
so that we can all get belinka oh that
would be great if we were all like if we
all synchronized our palinka drinking on
the way that's what's in the package I
have to ruin the surprise oh yeah I'm
gonna love a couple of dupes from those
synchronizing so time it have you
actually have you did you sample
pálinka at on the mwc trip oh well I
sampled polenka my first time the BC
trip two years ago
that's right so you were familiar
already oh yeah yeah yeah he was the
first one to get the new vaccine I
understand okay I've become I haven't
had a cold ever since it's a wonderful
into full of antibodies that palinka
some announcements before we get started
while we have high me on the air as well
they pocket now daily is i believe and
stop me if I'm wrong on this time it is
on hold for this week for this entire
week correct well yeah it's pretty much
over we're gonna start our remaining
edition of the pocket now daily as a fun
day what do you mean our remaining
addition to it is the daily he's letting
on shooting the daily here outdoors and
I'm gonna see what that goes how that
goes everything yeah that would be fun
but when you say it's pretty much over
you do not mean like as in whole right
no the week is pretty much okay right
obviously there's no no option for daily
now but now that's actually the reason
why we planned this trip the way it is
so obviously this week was all mwc and
it's done now and now as of next week
obviously we have a regular schedule
back only that I'm not in Nando de so
we're gonna take advantage of the new
scenery for another you don't worry free
then there's no green screen yeah that's
right that's right well I'm very very
glad that you'll be trying to shoot an a
daily from outdoors I think that'll be a
lot of fun there's some wonderful
scenery as I recall from Anton Anton
review photos it's gorgeous dude you
have to be here this is this i'm looking
forward to seeing the photos and hearing
the stories I'm actually talking more
about the walking scenery then ah you're
talking about I give the human scenery
alright that static scenery people are
not very nice very very nice you're
driving with a Romanian on a Porsche you
can imagine oh I forget that you guys
are rolling in the Porsche yes yes yes
well I hope that the rest of the trip
exposes you to a lot of beauty in all
its forms this human being has turned
into a rockstar already you should see
that you know it's your matching leather
jackets that's really gonna just to earn
you a lot of fans it's just like our
shirts back from evike you remember
yeah I did remember so see the listeners
see the pocket now round up if you want
to get a semblance of the daily and
we'll do our best to hold it together
until high I can find some some suitable
static scenery yeah the mwc 2014 recap
of hopefully a couple of hours after
recording this podcast and what about
the bloopers the blue book will work on
those over the weekend so we're hoping
to get them up but early next week as as
well as the insider there's just a lot
of censoring that has to go through and
understand I know what it's like to buy
be a lot of stories to tell that before
we do I just wanted to mention is I
talked to him in like five minutes
before a podcast and I was saying like
this quote we just got back from mwc and
we can't remember crap about it that's
where we were in the middle of where the
news happen and we're completely not
knowing anything about news and it has
nothing to do with pálinka yeah no I
know and on it because you're in you're
in trade show world and it's that like
weird little bubble where it's it's just
an impenetrable yeah domain but that's
okay because we're gonna put it through
some filters for you and well I'm sure
we'll have a lively disagreement about
something and it'll be fun let's just
tell everybody that it is very possible
that next week we will fulfill our
promise to have Evan blast on the on the
weekly of leaks we couldn't do it this
because we wanted it to and mwc thing
but I think we're going to finally make
that happen next week as things settle
back down to normal so stay tuned for
that and a review announcement I think
this is what Taylor was referring to
before when his tongue would ship me
things the Nokia Lumia icon review is
apparently declaring the icon the best
Windows Phone fr and that review is up
I'm surprised actually Taylor Taylor
tells getting T talking about the worst
timing ever well when Taylor comes back
maybe he will grace us with a word or
two on the icon but it'll already be too
late gentlemen what say we dive into
some of the news from mwc we're not
using our usual categories this time
around we're going to go by manufacturer
and tell me if you disagree but I think
the biggest OEM from the show was
Samsung sure I agree with you only that
I would share that first spot in terms
of the excitement and I was me
everything with Sony's Xperia z2 no Jack
I want to talk I'd really want to talk
specifically about that but um let's
let's dive into Samson first when we get
to Sonia what we'll compare and contrast
we had a unique situation this year
where you guys were in Barcelona debt
the Samsung unpacked event watching all
of it happened live including the
orchestra which was like doing that
Samsung theme do we know what that is by
the way is that a musical piece that
they had written for them Rosaiah name
is one-eye no idea i think that that's
their proprietary thing which they
always play back either recorded or live
whether the event is in Barcelona London
or New York that's their theme ringtone
yeah yeah yeah well you guys were all
seeing it live and at the same time I
was in New York with Adam Lane and we
were watching it at the galaxy studio
for the US launch event which was
live-streamed so it was morning for you
no excuse me it was late evening for you
or early evening for you and it was
early afternoon for us and we staked out
the corner of the studio we knew where a
demo unit was going to pop up and then
we got our hands on it oh there we go
we've got a story about that so tell it
yeah what's it what's the story like
Samson let me start and then you'll
finish the thing is you've got more
emotion to declare would happen there
yeah I've been to a lot of Samsung
events and I'm telling him you listen
handle isn't it let's not just rush into
the entire venue let's just try to find
a spot because I really know where the
demo units will be like behind the the
stage there will be two doors on the
sides and then those will open yeah so
let's find a place okay so like a couple
of minutes before the event is done we
just stand out from the crowd gets to
that specific door which I know that
will open to be among the first ones to
get a hands-on and we are the first ones
there and then the security guy comes
and he says no no review units here no
nothing the exit is the other way yes no
no wait a second just imagine this this
place had how many people that doesn't
at least yeah ok so imagine this they
opened the doors those 5,000 people
begin rushing out assuming that the
review devices because obviously since
we were the ones that were the Thor we
were the only ones that hurt that yeah
so they open the doors and those 5,000
people sworn to the lobby looking for
units of course no units and then some I
don't know some Samsung people imagine a
lot of ants and once you start stepping
on them the edges run around like crazy
okay people going upstairs downstairs
just running around the venue looking
for the hands on the lover a lot of the
stands which were empty yeah oh go ahead
so that it was like it was a bait and
switch yeah and at one point I'm asking
the news where were the reviews
everybody's like yeah behind the stage
where they usually are Oh No so when you
least expected after five minutes of
people swarming around the place they
make an announcement please make way to
the device experience lounge behind the
stage five minutes after people are
running around the lobby I'm I hopefully
tried to beat each other to the device
thousand nine hundred and eighty fifth
exactly exactly no you know I was really
really really upset I really it said
security guy once again just you know no
honestly I don't think it was a security
guys problem you know Samsung you lay
something very very irrespective oh you
know they may have you know I think they
probably just weren't ready it sounds
like that experience lounge had a
problem that they had to fix all of a
sudden and they just decided they
weren't gonna make my that the the
insane amount of waiting for like a one
and a half two hours standing either
outside or in the lobby before they
opened up the doors for today for the
actual venue that's that's what Samsung
so they're usually playing there's
nothing is bad thing I mean just think
and you can do things in a more
elaborate man it's funny like I saw that
I saw part of that crush because I think
Sam Sam pullin was tweeting pictures
from it and I just saw the usual throng
of thousands of people between him and
the demo devices and I was like wow our
experience here at the galaxy studio
could not be any different like it's you
know it's small it was like I felt like
I was in someone's apartment how many
people there near probably a 152 other
but it's if that yeah and then so we
walk in in the minute we get in there
I'm just like there's a security guy
hanging out by a covered table and I'm
like Adam where the where the devices
icon some of the cover over there I'm
like oh really so I go over to the
security guy I'm like hey man sir galaxy
s5 under he's like yeah
okay so is there one like right at this
corner I'm like like we're pointing at a
specific area on the table like we're
getting at box down to like the
millimeter he's like yeah it's it's
right there so it's like okay how long
until the event starts he's like about
90 minutes all right Adam I'm gonna
stand here for the next 90 minutes and
that's what we did we've kind of hung
out and got our shots ready and we shot
a couple pre-rolls and the covers came
off and we immediately had device
hands-on time so we were lucky because I
spotted my own Romanian language being
spoken just a couple of meters from us
like 75 people away but a couple of
meters from us and I just rushed over to
my commands and said guys whenever you
finished with that just don't put it
down hand it over to me and that's how
we managed to go uh good call nice well
so okay so finally we all got our hands
on the devices except for Taylor who is
who is backing us up from from the
Carolinas and yeah and we we spent some
time to that because what was your first
impression when you got your hands on
the galaxy s5 you had seen the
presentation you knew what was coming we
had two impressions the first impression
we had when we were inside the venue and
the presentation was going and we first
seen the phone on veal and projected on
the big screen I think we both were at
the same time like man yes we saw those
leaks we remember those gold leaks that
would the band-aid look on the back yeah
but we had all brushed those leaks off
because the company CEO had said that
they were gonna launch something
completely different for the show well
yeah yeah in the sense that they changed
their focus on what they're doing with
the product per se but it's pretty much
the same phone and the second impression
came after after that initial the
impulse cooled off and then we started
looking at things the way we should look
at things like taking a step back and
looking at the bigger picture sharrap
while looking at the bigger picture this
is a great phone okay so that's so I
think we are all in yeah and I think we
are all of different stripes now Tony
this this is a rare thing I think I
think you and I agree on that because
listeners if you haven't seen the the
editorial line up on this I wrote a
piece called the galaxy s5 doesn't suck
as much as your nerd friends say it does
because I think it actually does offer a
lot that's quite compelling Taylor
Martin responded with a piece called the
galaxy have five more of the same which
is
exactly exactly the opposite opinion and
it seems like we are 22 aside here gents
so I want to be when we say Tony why
don't we ask you what is why is this a
good device what what did I bring to the
table i think i will quote exactly what
i said in my house or video that we need
to to look at things this way samsung
has an extraordinary brand recognition
so we need just forget about the leaks
which are either the fake or just a fake
and understand the fact that the galaxy
s5 is indeed not an iteration with an
evolution of the s4 which is an
evolution of yes free and while doing
that while being that it not only has
faster processor so better overall
specifications but it also has some very
useful features now did we expect the
leather or aluminum yes did we get
Robert yes but then again this is a
active like phone this is a ruggedized
phone up to a point so there's no really
way in doing that with another plastic
or aluminum so all things aside I think
that this is a film which will switch
will be the best selling galaxy ever it
will outsell all other galaxies and I
don't see the problem it's I mean Apple
does the same thing with its devices
they follow the same general guidelines
the s5 look like yes force yes but then
the HTC One max and the one mini look
like the HTC One so everybody has a
signature design and Samsung is just
doing that taking that to the next level
you know I and i will i will add to that
something that you touched on Tony I
think Samsung is yes there do remain
gimmicks on this device so I made a big
point of saying that the focus is less
on gimmicks with this iteration then of
course everyone just jumped on the most
obvious thing and said well the heart
rate sensor is a big ol gimmick yes okay
yes it is they've not entirely left that
DNA behind but the look at look at what
else they've done that that immersion
protection you know i mean the sony's
been doing it for ages and now samsung
has finally looked at a competitor said
hey we should do that let's do that and
we're not going to put confine it to an
active version the phone will just make
the flagship itself waterproof yeah you
know the software is improved in terms
of fluidity how was your demo demo
device guys was it smooth
yeah it was good yes good so was ours
and I was really really surprised and I
was the first one with hands on it so I
was like wow okay this is how it is
after a fresh boot and it's smooth and
it looks better it's not real bored
winning better but whatever I mean these
are these are nice improvements i I
really don't like the look of that
perforated back panel but I don't like a
look of the new rounded icons but in the
settings but let's see that that's where
we're we're completely separated in
opinions like oh yeah i might go i'm
torn it with this phone first of all i
love the fact that it's rugged i love
the fact that you know they I I do like
the fact that they've kept the design in
a way because I actually did like it I I
didn't mind the design I guess my
biggest problem is number one that we I
sorry another thing that I like just to
finalize is the fact that yes this is a
phone with less gimmicks we've been
asking for this we've been asking for
samsung to stop focusing on things that
we don't use and they've done it sorry
to interrupt the so-called gimmicks are
still on the phone they're still there
not in your face but ya dig into the
settings for air view and he otherwise
but then we go to the things that that I
don't like what do I don't like for
example they did this very simplistic
flat UI with the settings but then the
rest of the UI is very similar to what
we already knew so it's it's both
skeuomorphic and flat right so it's kind
of mixed and I wish they would have done
it uniformly you know they would have
flattened everything within the you I
agree I agree with that completely yeah
yeah that's one thing where i'm like
okay did they finish this product
because it seems like if they focused on
flattening some parts but they couldn't
do with the rest and then I'm actually
disappointed that they didn't bring the
tablet UI that you guys saw at CES or
something similar because I really liked
that card you I and that whole ambience
thing they brought it they brought a
fragment of it with the on the
magazine's of my magazine bit which is
done everything but it did her face on
the hill spring well then another thing
that I didn't like is ok so if you're a
parent galaxy owner like galaxy s4 or
galaxy note 3 i'll tell you this much i
have an s4 903 and if I really am
fitness buff I love to do it and I would
rather get me a gear that will give me a
heart rate monitor where I actually need
it which is in my wrist yeah and you
know I would have I would have rather
they invest on a xenon flash or
something on the back instead of that
heart rate monitor which is really
useless for me because I mean what if
that would have been like a glucometer
or something something that somebody
that sick really needs but a heart rate
monitors I'm not I don't know why would
I need that be false yeah the heart rate
monitor on this thing is like is like
the golf shot of the of the galaxy note
3 like it's that weird one time you know
the single-use feature that only a small
subset of the of the user base is going
to appreciate how I would make more
sense on the inside of the band of the
gear and it is there exactly I think
exactly where it is on an olive the gear
for example what did I like about this
event Oh different types of gears I love
well we're gonna talk about the gears in
a second it was really important but but
I guess for me it's like okay path like
we were on the on the on the train with
Tony and he's like man a hundred percent
of the people that either use a galaxy
phone or an iPhone use a case so what is
going to be the point of this heart rate
monitor if you're gonna be using it with
a case and your fingers gonna have a
hard time fitting in there well maybe
you know that's true right now but this
is not an iphone at all but it's also
not ns4 or an s3 because it's not coated
in hyper glaze that scratches when you
breathe on it wrong like this is this is
a woven like glass fiber and
polycarbonate blend of some kind and it
looks it looks and feels rather rugged
so I think if thats people will not
carry this in a case quite as often
unless you know they get the gold one
but you know I don't know I would get
the blue myself but I really i think
this one is is one of the first flagship
class devices you can carry without
without a case and be okay with it from
Sanders that as wells to solve the
European the part of bucket now's a
presence in Romania our opinions that be
about the only one or two reasons you
would need to upgrade your current s4
and no.3 is whether you need to take
underwater pictures for you you are a
clumsy guy or girl who splashes
some sort of fluid on your on your phone
or you specifically are a speck head who
really has to have the latest
specifications else I'm sure that the
roms will come out 40s 403 with the new
UI with the new settings so in my
opinion only this segment of the market
and those who are first time samsung
galaxy s purchasers or those who need to
upgrade will really upgrade to this
phone with me having an s4 will probably
not i'm going to the s5 so that's a good
question so let me get the flip side of
this taylor what's you know you've
you've heard some of this you wrote an
editorial specifically addressing this
what are your opinions well it's ugly
I'm just gonna say it right like I'm not
implying bottom line I'm gonna be around
the bush the phone is just hideous and
I've never really liked Samsung's design
or I guess design language it's not been
something i personally like and outside
the note line there's nothing that
really enticed me to purchase a galaxy s
phone I mean it's just yeah yeah so I
don't like the design that's completely
totally a subjective and I'm totally
aware that it's fine people were calling
me hypocritical in the comments because
I have an opinion the different or
differs from there so difficult is
welcome to the Internet yeah so yeah I
don't like the way it looks and that's
that's on me I understand that but the
thing the problem that i have with
samsung is that it's still ok so it's
listen to the complaints of users and it
started to fix the appearance of the UI
but it hasn't paid attention to the
bigger problem which is not the UI but
it's that the size of their software i
think it was androidcentral who just
took a stroll through the storage sub
setting menu and found that on the base
model the 16 gigabyte model you have
less than 8 gigabytes left to the user
after just after your first boot yeah
would you go micro SD card slot yeah
well when you can install apps on your
SD card out of the box again then the
net complaints valid but
it's just why and and the headline or
the I guess the caption that I used in
the article was prettier bloat is still
bloat um and and part of it is that you
are forced to keep Samsung's stuff
whether you use it or not chat on
something I've never used in my entire
life is there for good and you can't do
anything with it yeah unless you root
and that it's that argument is dead in
the water well on that note there if
there would be within a week or two from
the availability of the s5 a google
edition of the s5 would that make
anything to change your mind for my
personal use probably not a general
especially when you get the Google
Experience launcher now yeah on track
the typed I just loaded on the note 3
it's like love it but I have no qualms
saying that it's a good phone not at all
it will sell millions probably more than
anything else on the market but for me
it's just it is more the same and that's
kind of that's what I want to round this
out with taking a look at some other
manufacturers at Mobile World Congress
specifically Yoda phone and Michael can
say what he wants a value 0 phone stuff
like that is what really really really
intrigues me I would deal with a
slightly worse user experience for four
features that I'm actually going to use
like an eating display on the back but
from Samsung the reason I think I'm so
quick to hate on them is because or it
Samsung has so much money that it can
invest in R&amp;amp;D so all that money that
it's saving by using plastic instead of
metal why don't why doesn't it just
invest some of that money into R&amp;amp;D and
pushing them push the market forward
adding a heart beats and or heart rate
sensor on the back of your phone or a
fingerprint scanner on the front that if
you were actually probably ever going to
use why don't you put that time and an
effort into creating something that's
actually useful so last week last year
we learned that it's software features
really weren't all that useful air
gesture area there all day and realities
yeah yeah all those were just kind of to
sell the phone and that's
that's what Samsung cares about it
doesn't care about pushing the market
forward in it name and and truly
innovating features that are going to
help users it cares about moving units
and that just rubs me the wrong way it
makes sense in every company to a degree
is about moving units but I agree that
other companies are able to balance that
better and actually bring bring new and
very useful things to the market and are
you trying to suggest that Samsung is
the new Apple you know I actually told
Tony that's like there's like the great
opportunity for editorial it says okay
Sam's like now you're looking more like
Apple than ever yeah because this was
like come on Samsung I can't believe
they come up with a curve display they
come up with so many feet you know
things last year and we get the same
phone with just a couple of benign the
software changes you know and I'm room
I'm remembering back to the first
Samsung device I ever reviewed for
pocket now which was the galaxy s3 and I
remember I remember that thing coming
out and my expectations could not have
been lower and it blew me away there
were definitely things I didn't like
about it there's a lot that we've been
over and over and over again but when it
came out it had a whole bunch of
features as usual as some of them didn't
work right but on the s3 a lot of them
did work well you know I still remember
like the sum of the did the core of some
of these ideas like smart stay being
like wow that makes sense if I look at
the phone i want the screen to stay on
if I don't then I wanted to go off of
course it didn't work in the dark but
you know this was the first time we saw
a side of these things and it was
bundled into a device that I think as a
result of legal action they were still
there was still a very different legal
landscape back then with regard to Apple
they had to do something really
different with the hardware you know
they had a different motivation to do
that but the end result was a device
that actually looked different I see the
s3 out in public today and I'm like wow
that thing look at around it it is it's
not like it's not like much else out
there and with the SF whisk it is it's
babble esque and when they now they've
gone back to the S you know the s4 they
made it more boring and then as5 it's
just well I don't think it's boring but
it's just weird so I don't know you know
I think Samsung's had some some up and
downs here you can counterbalance those
with the water resistance but then
you've got that fingerprints kind of
thing which you mentioned briefly to and
it's like what
okay when they said they were putting a
fingerprint scanner in the home button
at first I was like oh cool Wow the home
button doesn't look any different than a
regular home button that's awesome and
then they revealed that they were using
the swype method and I'm like you guys
know then saw my video hora song idea
yeah yep did you did you try to deter
try to learn you i forgot what happened
because I didn't include that my video I
tried for a long time to learn to make
it learn my fingerprints and it just
fail them we'll just brush it up and say
that this is probably a creep reduction
software i'm i'm waiting for the device
to get nervous doesn't matter it doesn't
matter it's in the wrong place for a
swipe action fingerprint thing if you're
gonna do a swipe thing you do it on the
back you don't do it on the front and
the home button when when you press and
hold is the only thing that works down
there because it's a frickin button well
it'll work or it works pretty well yeah
but it works differently on touch ID
it's just we did a comparison with the
5s and man it didn't matter how many
times I tried I did my best and that
fingerprint scanner just did not capture
my swype i think i'm going to be
unusually a separate opinion and this
I'm gonna wrap my opinion on the s5 with
this one I once in every ten years I
agree with Michael that just happens and
now it's that time but I also slightly
disagree so I my biggest problem with
the s5 is that it only has two gigs of
ram it should have three gigs of ram
correct me if I'm wrong what has you
thread two games yeah but why should it
have three gigs now because the no.3 has
four games and TouchWiz as it is now
needs three gigs especially if you're
going to use all the applications which
come bundled or even if you use the the
gym the activity of applications which
can constantly run and monitor and do
stuff but that aside I don't really have
a problem with the s5 whether it looks
good or bad that's up to everybody so we
don't even need to discuss about the
looks and in terms of features is there
a break monitor yes will you use it now
don't lose it will you use it yes use it
same with the fingerprint scanner so and
try on trakis ease as long as they keep
the price at the same level and not bump
it because of these things which you
might or might not use then it's just
like an option if you don't like it
don't use it or disable it yes yeah and
like on a product level that makes sense
but I mean what what this says about
about Samsung's future strategy actually
make fills me with a little bit of hope
because for all of the things that we
can find to complain about with it I
really think this signifies a move
toward actually listening to people in
providing things that people want heart
rate monitor fingerprint sensor aside
and I think if the if the company had
had more time after their agreement with
Google we would have seen those software
improvements hi me that you were looking
for and that I was looking for because
this that this build of touch with
screams to me I rushed you know I if
flattening and and and slight tweaking
to get it out the door to give it good
performance and to make it look like we
did something different with it I think
if they had made that agreement with
Google months and months and months ago
we would have seen a entirely different
touch wit or nobody mm-hmm sorry nobody
rushed outside to announce the s5 we
were I'm not had a hard time believing
up until the last moment that we're
gonna see the S man februari like 10 or
11 months after vs 4 announcement and
coming back to the show so they could
have done the same announced in April
they would have had two more months two
I don't know work on the software side
making beautiful make it more beautiful
and then but no they wanted to I think
they want to be HTC to the bunch this
time because if the rumors are true the
s4 sales weren't up to Samsung's and
expectations and to do they cared do I
think they can't listen we were so
incredulous is that a word yes it's now
it is now no doubt word in Spanish it is
incredible but we were so incredulous of
a launch of the s5 at mwc that we
finished filming the intro and we start
walking towards the train and we look at
the sign right beside us in front of the
venue that says meet the next Galaxy and
I'm like dude do we go back and record
that whole segment again feels like now
let's look like that yes i watch your
intro and I was like cuz I was never I
had never had the doubts that you guys
didn't kudos to you for your skepticism
but I was like no yes we're seeing it's
called the unpacked 5 event of course
we're seeing the galaxy as much I just
cracked me i was i'm watching the intro
my go guys oh we're gonna have a nice
fun
come on did do we go back and refill
this now tell me let's go get food did
because it's interesting to me that that
you say like they wanted to beat HTC to
the punch because we have an editorial
that addresses this straight up right
again from Taylor i I don't know that
Samsung really care it cares too much
and you know how I know they care how
it's not been shown because they wanted
to be the first one so if if the
announcement would have been now and
availability within a week two or three
I would have said okay samsung doesn't
care about HTC but this is what Samsung
Samsung made the announcement now to
make the announcement before HTC's
announcement in March guess what yes
five will be available in April after
HTC's announcement right input and also
the they had the worldwide stage to do
it on with mwc and it was interesting by
the way to see a major manufacturer come
back to mwc you for a huge amount that's
that's a new that's it i think at first
no school in a while i was probably one
of the high points of mwc the fact that
Samson came back yeah if we take HTC's
launch date for the one last year and
compare it to the galaxy s5s launch date
so that's April 14th for the galaxy s5
and April nineteenth for the original
one if HTC launches the one around the
exact same time like the 12 though the
actual one year mark they're gonna be
launching within days of one another
anyway interesting yeah so if that and
it gives them like more than two weeks i
think it's 20 days or something or more
than 20 days almost 30 days no i don't
know what it is I can't do math okay but
their march five works for 25 and their
one-year date would be April nineteenth
so it'd be almost a month after they
announced it so I think yeah I think
they could announce it and then launch
it within 23 days of Samsung huh so that
that to me shows that it really doesn't
matter if Samsung wanted to beat HTC to
the punch because nobody's gonna be able
to really buy these things until around
the same time anyway the only thing only
thing that would really matter is if
Samsung has or opens pre-orders
you know around the time that is a job
and working for samsung in terms of SEO
and keywords because the new Galaxy or
ds5 are already super hot and trending
keyboards and that's going to be a huge
major win against HTC that they're going
to be higher ranked on search engines
for the specific and guys there's a lot
of food on the table right now I the
iphone 6 rumors are starting to get
strong there are there's a lot of
reports that it'll be launched in June
and that it'll be bigger and better than
ever according to the rumors so you know
but think about this the galaxy s3 was
the best galaxy ever sold these people
are about to leave their contracts this
you know the spring so this is like the
best time to launch the s5 early enough
to lure these people away from an iphone
6 sure and I feel I feel that that's
really the strategy that they're
focusing if you're going from an s3 to
an S 5 that's a massive jump yeah
exactly i recommend that absolutely
exactly so i feel that they're really
doing it to capture the s3 customers
back okay uh it lets you also regardless
of how these devices compared right up
against one another HTC one to all new
HTC One and Galaxy s5 horrible name da
hoe and hoe gigantic giganto the galaxy
s5 is going to launch accompanied by a
massive ecosystem of hardware
specifically wearables let's talk a
little bit about those we expected the
galaxy I'm gonna do this all the time we
expected the gear to and the gear 2 neo
not galaxy because they're running Tizen
which is weird but we did not expect the
gear fit I don't think I think that was
surprised to pretty much all of us right
yep yeah so I remember like when he
wouldnt Peter Chao and it's uh it's chew
and its chew by the way yes it's true
threats in Soochow when Peter to held up
the this is where the wearables when he
came out is that where we're talking
about the hold on mirchi was CEO was a
ship when Jimmy JK Shin I'm sorry she's
I'm an idiot when JK Shin was out there
it's early here
and samsung subcontracted HTC CEO
announces new product yeah the world I
apparently in have it early in the
morning sorry I'm dumb um no no but when
did woody was like hey check it out we
got three new wearables and I remember
looking up in the stu galaxy to do I
mean like wait huh what what would three
I guy I know that we're expecting the
gear to what what's this so we had the
gear to gear to and gear 2 neo which we
were expecting and then the gear fit
pops up I immediately was smitten as
they say because this thing yeah and on
one respect it's like a Fitbit ripoff
but it's so awesome what do you guys
think of it I like it that's the way the
fitness band should be it's like this is
really gonna kill the purpose for you to
ever buy either a Nike FuelBand or
Fitbit four hundred fifty dollars when
you can just you know this is really
gonna but and here's the strategy is
just so cool looking that it'll make you
be like okay this is a reason why I
would buy a galaxy because it obviously
only works with a galaxy phone and you
know it kind of makes sense and if they
figure out a way to bundle Italy it'll
be even better okay here's my opinion
guess what can you guess it I can guess
that you don't like it I don't like it
here and here's why because it's not not
like the other morons who say dude this
sucks and the full sup no I the reason
why I don't like it is that ok everybody
can make a wearable which has a heart
rate monitor has a software it
communicates with a phone aggregates
results and so on what I don't like
about it is the actual usage scenario me
ergonomy of it then I know it's a yeah
this comes down to this we have a
longitudinal display and once that is on
your wrist you either have to twist your
wrist completely can you explain this
Michael better yeah yeah yeah because
the display does not dies the display
bisect your wrist so if you raise it
like a wristwatch it's going to appear
vertical to you and you're not going to
be able to use it you're going to turn
your arm so the only way to use it
effectively is to wear the thing on the
inside of your wrist and doing that way
yep yep and that's problem yeah else
it's great for those who who work out I
personally use a different part rate
monitor which is a more professional not
a consumer-oriented thing but sure if
you are just trying to lose some weight
station or getting shade get fit that is
absolutely a great thing but
unfortunately that's not enough when it
comes to me twisting my wrist and arm in
order to see everything like I'm trying
to literally do that yes si Senora so
what if you know if you want to wear it
on the outside of your wrist you can't
do it if you want to wear like regular
wrist watch it won't work like that I
don't think but you if you wear it on
the if you're willing to wear it on the
inside of your wrist I think it could
actually work pretty well and as I said
when I was trying the thing out I'm like
I'm not even a runner like all you guys
you know you guys are exercised guys and
whatever and I don't do any of that I
don't care about the heart rate monitor
I just want a cool-lookin smartwatch and
this is the coolest looking SmartWatch
I've ever seen it's got the curved
AMOLED panel which is beautiful it's the
software is is just as pretty as it is
on this on the gear to stuff like it
really looks amazing and even wearing it
on the inside of the wrist like that
still can play into their Samsung's
strategy if they're going to persist in
this of using nostalgic advertising
because some of those future watches did
in fact go on the inside of the wrist so
it's like I think this should be the
centerpiece of their of their strategy
not these iterations on the Galaxy gear
that frankly aren't that impressive now
one question guys because I really don't
remember this does the gear fit include
the four gigs of storage just like it's
not I wait it doesn't let you do the
voice calling and I don't think it as
local storage but let me look that up
well okay because here's the deal so I
am a runner and for me using the
professional heart rate monitor on my
chest is extremely uncomfortable because
it slides down as you're running you
have to be you have to either wear it
really tight or hat big well and for the
average human being that's not a problem
in my case I swept more than the average
human so for me it's really common for
it to slip knot and then and then
wearing and I've been wearing anything
that's bigger than an iphone on my arm
is uncomfortable as well so I'm forced
to either use an iphone or something so
for me to actually just use the watch
have my music there and have the watch
track everything and not need anything
else is actually something cool but you
know I actually be willing to sacrifice
and just use the gear and not
necessarily the gear fit just for these
features I'm not sure whether it's
records on the watch and then sinks or
whether it does it does it that it does
but i'm not sure if it can on the gear
fit i know that the gear does but not be
the fifth are you able to just leave
your Galaxy S 4 or 5 ago and it will
record your your statistics and then
sync them to the phone yeah doesn't have
to be in constant connection with the
phone in which case you have to invite
es5 cuz that's waterproof because you
sweat a lot no no it does but and that's
that's really the cool thing that you
can you can just use it alone I'm just
not sure if you can also carry music
with the Cure fit that's I know you can
do with the gear just not sure about
that you're not seeing a mention of that
the spec she doesn't mention onboard
storage on the fit so I know you can't
take make and take calls on it and I
think onboard storage is the other
difference yeah so but yeah but yeah so
it you know I'm looking forward to
getting wrist on time with the with the
gear fit I'm looking forward actually
more too high man Anton if it's possible
using it because you know I'm not going
to be running around the neighborhood
like now with my stuff and we did you
wrong with a burrito in your hand
Michael Michael good Michael Fisher you
are mr. phone Santa please indulge us
with the gear fit and we'll definitely
film all the videos in and I'm in
jaime's bizarre world like I'm the
gatekeeper of all these devices that
never make it tone like I mean I don't
get these either you understand me we
smuggled them into Honduras yeah I love
the I am not terribly stoked about the
gear 2 in the gear 2 neo and I want to
hear your y'all's opinion on it because
it they've incorporated a lot of
improvements to the original Galaxy gear
they've made the band's switchable they
have added that onboard storage that you
you were talking about before I may but
yeah these these things are it whether
they're smaller they're lighter but
these things are lacking any of the
personality I think of the original
Galaxy gear they remove those the
pronounced screws the band has been
minimized
because it no longer has the speaker on
it so it's like a more the picture
remove the wart and yeah listen I'm not
gonna complain about the missing camera
ward that's that's mine you're the only
one in the team that's actually used the
gear as your daily driver so why don't
you tell us what you don't like I don't
like that they I'm in the minority here
okay so i don't like that the band is
now switchable and i understand that it
offers more more choice and I that I'm
all for that but the sacrifices they've
made to do that have resulted in a
device that just looks rather dull it's
denis oh is probably carbon if they
didn't hear too i think is still metal
but the screws are gone on the outside
of the casing not a lot of people like
the look of those i happen to like the
look of those that was one thing i did
like about it ya like it like I wish
pebble steel had some kind of industrial
thing like that like some giant screws
on the sides and and and if they look
I'm looking at the original gear now and
they look they look pretty pretty good
still I think and then they've put this
big old home button underneath the
screen which I understand if you want to
make make the experience consistent with
your smart phones okay fine but for a no
do the other thing take the stupid home
button off your smart phones because
home button true stupid and unless
that's unless that's like one of those
optical track bolts or trackpad it's not
yeah it's I mean oh babe I they did when
that would make it would make sense on a
on a watch it may be and something so
sliced it would be interesting like
they've taken it they moved it from the
side where it's actually easier to hit
and put it down below it oddly enough it
seems like it's easier to do but pushing
a button down below the screen I wrist
so how have you did you use an ipod nano
wait like the wrist the wrist one no
just like the simple player the small
square one yeah I had one and it was a
horrible so the only reason why Samsung
but the home button on that the
SmartWatch was for you to not swipe back
three times at home but to push the
button now back in the day of the ipod
now Apple had no home buttons and a long
tap would take you back to the home boom
problem fixed now home button shortcut
to the hell well you could just swipe up
from the bottom of the display now you
swipe down for the tub or I'm just
saying like there could be different
gestures to remove the
this is so there that's the thing like
still I use top-down swipe from back
gesture so if you're going to eliminate
the gesture driven interface fine then
you put a button on it then you'll
rethink the whole thing okay cool but
that's not what they did they threw a
button on there and they still didn't do
anything to change the existing
interface so you can still swipe down
from the top to go back to the home
screen and that feels better it takes
less effort than Strine estab a stupid
button you know what is a button thing
we step buttons all the time they put
the button on there just to piss my
pants yeah I drew I don't tell you
exactly this is an exclusive prediction
the gear 3 will have the same button but
it will be swipeable for your finger
event today this much I do like the gear
um and I do like it because it's more
useful than a lot of things like for
example again for me it's uncomfortable
to actually wear a heart rate monitor
for me it's uncomfortable too I don't
know like I I have a SmartWatch but then
other people have their polar watches
their their gps watches I like to just
have one product that does everything
sure well why not I'm okay with that so
I don't know I guess that this would be
like a smart for example the gear the
original gear had a lot of problems with
it the battery life is terrible it was
optically it wasn't the better that was
terrible at launch and then they fixed
it yeah notifications were terrible at
launch and then they fix them that's the
thing the gear was it not a bad product
ultimately but it launched in an
undercooked state that Samsung's fault
yes but the product now is quite good so
you're saying maybe Samsung sure to
focus on on continuing to improve the
original gear instead of launching the
neo and two and just launched the active
fit whatever its name is and keep the
original gear while keeping its updates
come on I think that if I have no
problem with new products you know me I
love the new and shiny thing and if
you're gonna launch a galaxy s5 you
might as well launch a new wearable with
it but I just don't agree with a lot of
the changes they've made because I just
not convinced they were necessary so I
guess that's what I'm interested in I me
like I'm a RN D'Antoni and Taylor
anybody do you like the look of the of
the new one I mean do you like the
look and feel of it as compared to the
original I the only reason why I like it
is because I can't see the work anymore
and that's that's enough for me that was
the biggest problem and it's that
aesthetics for me and the reason why i
like it again the sensors the addition
of the sensors the additional storage
that allows me what is your the aspect
the looks the looks of it just as the
way I don't see I don't see it any
different to the original I'm sorry and
for me it's like I see it and I just
remember the original gear that's really
it was for example if you look at the
original pebble and then look at the
pebble steel you're like wow yeah there
there's just a huge difference
absolutely now that once I agree with
Tony the warts going I'm happy yeah
what's gone is good it's a good thing I
I'm interested to give it a shot I don't
think I don't hate these things I know
I'm the debbie downer around this I just
I just was kind of hoping for more and
then what do we think about the switch
to ties and guys this is a very strange
thing in the wake of Samsung's apparent
make nice session with Google I wouldn't
have expected to see Tizen hit on a
major sure they are able to fit Android
unavailable with such low specifications
so that then they did another gear Tony
yeah but then again they added more
features which required even more
horsepower and the horsepower is maybe
just a little bit improved so i think
that there's two aspects here the first
one they didn't want to continue
delivering the Android experience
because of the specs and number two I
think they're testing the waters a
little bit in terms of thysen artisan
both with the gear and with the looks of
the settings within the s5 just to see
how people relate or react to that and
it's going to be inevitable at one point
that samsung will launch a different
line with Tizen to compete with its own
line of android phone so i think that
there's there's they're just trying to
see how people react or that to this
change it's a testing the water saying
my opinion i think it's just a double
bird to google by on its back there it
does not happen yeah all right willing
them all you know when you get companies
like Nokia which we'll talk about soon
doing
android phones you get to wonder if it's
really a stab at Google I mean it's an
open source platform you can do whatever
you want with it so they're not really
forced to move to Tyson I mean they
could fork it as much as they want and
Google cannot do anything because they
created the animal and additionally
having your own platform on your own
brother Apple has proved this for four
years now it brings you better results
probably been more difficult to tailor
androids that specific need of the gear
but then they can build all the way from
the ground up Tyson to fit that wearable
that's a good point well as we as we
move off of this i want to ask all of
you guys if you have a choice about the
three of them you're you're presented
but with a choice of all three and you
can only pick one for your personal use
which one do you pick Tony near that
what neither own either you don't want
anything somebody comes up to your three
boxes they say that you can have one of
these for free you're like no thank you
goodbye ya know maybe if you tell me
what you want I want that and it to
you all right that is a not exactly a
valid answer but that'll work all right
Jaime Nell take the full gear the the
gear too yeah okay all right and why
storage come on dude we're geeks we want
the most capable one okay all right all
right what about you Taylor which one's
the most expensive it's pricier than
sundays you still w I bet that fits
gonna be the most expensive just because
of that like that I think they can get
more money from it thanks to its it's
sooo veldt ness and it's curved screen I
think they can ask more and they'll get
it so I'll take the most expensive and
sell it on ebay because I don't have a
galaxy phone you guys are the worst the
worst people ever you know I don't have
a samsung device they're useless to you
so why would I have one I wanted to say
laying a hypothetical game I'm asking
you if you would think between the two
of those lenses do you know I wanted to
respond pebble steel but you didn't give
me the option sorry let's do that's true
all right I would take the air-fuel the
things we all know why I would take the
gear fit or we've talked about the steel
billion times okay yeah that's a
wonderful time great times enjoyable
thing links in the Samsung
let's move on we'll talk more about that
in the weeks ahead as we get our hands
on demo units and so on now you were
saying hi made that the other big big
big thing that that brought you that
impressed you from the show was the
massive sony launched which you guys
seem to think with me oh that was me i'm
sorry there's Tony so I you guys seem to
think that that was somehow on par with
the samsung launched but I don't I don't
I don't get it what was I'm not talking
about the entire event and I'm not
talking about the entire portfolio okay
in terms of portfolio i think that
samsung took at hell yeah in terms of
specific phones in terms of specific
2014 flagships and this is my personal
opinion I really think that the z2 is
the better phone between the z2 and the
s5 and not necessarily because the z2 on
paper has better specifications but
because the z2 Taylor's better to my own
needs it is the beauty to look at but
again that's a subjective thing it has
the glass sandwich aluminum thing which
I really liked about the z1 so as I said
with the occasion of my g1 reviewed that
would have been my daily driver if the
camera would have not sucked and I I'm
gonna say this a million times until
people believe me when I got the z1 in
that initial condition of the software
the cameras mm improves on that with a
larger sensor with a better optics oh
I'm hoping if it's going to be a better
user experience now the z2 is for the
moment the android phone of the year for
me so in the display is fixed to write
these vehicles so god this under on the
compact I Mike well you have to see that
display Michael um you know actually
brought the ZL and I felt it was just
not even worth filming a comparison
because it's night and day yeah this is
I am okay so if I had if I had to buy an
nwc phone and it was from my cash and I
had to choose one the zo would take the
cake I am just I'm sorry but the z2
sorry it is a very beautiful phone the
display is just gorgeous it's very
gorgeous Lee implemented and
you know hey I've been using iPhones
ever since they launched them for me
this is the as is the iphone for Android
it's just the build quality of this
phone the feel in the hand watering the
spring water and dustproof you know that
the sound of the speakers everything and
you know the fact that the cameras
pixels are now bigger the sensors bigger
sorry the same sensor is on the compact
18.7 that same 20.7 megapixel sensor
only got the physical dimensions of the
sensor are larger are bigger so you were
sitting more like getting in you aren't
your pixels but in the same sensor and
improve optics and I also hope and
improved software algorithm that
transforms whatever the sensor sees into
good-looking JPEGs and that was already
like they had already really dealt very
nicely with their noise problem on the
c1 comments 1 as well as even s as well
yeah yeah honestly if I had to buy a
phone that would be it from WC nice what
is the Snapdragon 801 guys is that just
a very minor tweak on the 800 what's the
story there was a tornado 10 all this
matter you know what if I can recall
what was launched either at CS or before
CS and you guys should just give me a
little time here until I find that
particular article because I wasn't so
shocked about you know when I was
expecting either one it's a cynical yeah
it's a it's a slug investor Snapdragon
800 yep okay Roger Roger all right well
that's that's cool so I mean we're gonna
see the same Sony skin as we used to we
saw this all in the video so this is it
but here's my thing because we have it a
uniquely American mindset or we do me me
this one person over here in this gray
box has a uniquely American mindset
because that's where I live but I'm
gonna see a bunch of galaxy s5s on the
shelves here in the states and I'm gonna
see billboards and bus wraps and stupid
TV commercials and I'm probably not
going to like I'm not going to see a
single bit of advertising from sony and
i'm only going to see this thing
probably on one shelf and that's
t-mobile USA shelf and i'm really gonna
have to wait like six months for ad will
remember we reviewed the z1 back in the
summer in august and it landed on
tmobile only after she yes I was like
yeah right right right yeah probably be
the same thing all over my question is
do we think that Sony's gonna change
that behavior
all I mean they have a device that can
compete they have a device that can beat
other devices on the market and and and
look good doing it so why why did lack
of us focus do we know well remember
when they launched the Z and the CL the
company CEO was very specific they were
gonna stay away from the US market and
focus only on Europe and Asia and that
was going to be their target and they
kept that strategy for pretty much the
full year until they announced the
change in focus but I'm trying to
remember if it was by the end of last
year or at CSI remember when it working
mentioned that so I guess that we have
seen that lack of presence intentionally
last year and I believe that it's
something that is going to change now
obviously all is yet to be proven I yeah
I think that they if they have not
flagged for a u.s. Bush now that they
have seen the s5 they will because I've
been talking to different people at mwc
from different OEMs and I'm not going to
name any of those and believe me the
general perception was that people are
relieved after the s5 event relief
relief as in now we have a better chance
as they were expecting much more
something that they couldn't get to
something which should set a new target
to play catch up to but now seeing that
what the s5 is these different OEMs
regardless it their high end or low
around or myth here they now really
think they stand a chance so to put it
in plain English and you have to bleep
it up they think Samsung up mmm
everybody thinks samsung Cup yeah yeah
so yeah that's kind of what i said in
the the piece that i wrote about more of
the same last year Samsung kind of
pushed the ball forward with the s4 and
it did so with the s3 and it's kind of
been driving the momentum for the
android market and this year it was just
kind of like you know take a step back
and it's not really pushing forward that
hard anymore did you say they were
pushing forward with the s4 because I
think that was the most competitive
iterative and overblown and
underwhelming device I've ever seen from
them right yes but I guess in purely in
a specification standpoint yes they were
just just specifications yes okay but
not necessarily like innovation or
anything they were pushing
hard with specifications they always
have since the original galaxy s yeah
and this year it's from people this year
because they expected another round of
that from the galaxy line which is
supposed to be this hard core awesome
users line for the ultimate top shelf
and that's not what what this is ok just
a rumor circulating on the Barcelona
show floor that we might see not one but
two cents on flagships and I'm not
talking about the s and the notes but we
might see the S we've seen it from here
he'll probably have Aoife and people
believe that there might be a summer
flagship phone really celica generally
be yeah the aluminum phones and they'll
get a meal we got the premium from the
real flagship remember the galaxy f
reverse and everything if that happens
then samsung smart so i'm just so i'm
still so stuck on the sony thing and not
just because that's where we are on the
run down i know we have to move on but
let's let's just end on this note what
do we think the z2 is going to change
anything for sony yeah i do think that
the z1 already changed a lot of things
for sony they are back and in the game
not as stop players but but they are
there in the game with a solid device
and they improve them being built on
that solid device and i think that at
the moment they have the best android
phone on the market right now right
there do you think we'll see a c2
compact I think we will see not only as
e to compact that we will also see soon
American variety not only one but maybe
two in in the US we better because it
would be wonderful to to use these
America that's what I would do if I
would be a CEO of sony because they
really have a stand a chance now well I
would say that you know that'll happen
when hell freezes over but that has
already occurred with the creation of a
nokia android phone can you guys get I
me like I mean either of you guys can
you bring us through this this event can
you tell us the story here of what this
was like to be there but I just I was
shocked and first in the first place I
was shocked to see Stephen Elop on stage
and I was asking time I like I love the
guy he's one of my top CEOs awesome
presenter for me he his his keynote sir
the but I had no idea what he was doing
on the stage because she obviously is no
longer she
if Nokia he no longer works for nokia he
now works for Microsoft that he's had a
devices division and he wasn't there in
Microsoft quality so he was there I
think as we see around here he was the
circus beer that was shown off on stage
the circus fam do you have a cell around
here not Steven feel up to the stage to
give it even more more consciousness
emphasis to this event well he does work
for no pay he's the executive vice
president advice and services for now
and he could then the acquisition will
close soon and yeah yeah and I taken
there yeah but but I see what you mean
no no no but I understand because he's
no longer yeah I think he was playing a
figurehead status at this event to
launch this phone but what was it like
like he's up there he's like what does
it say like hey we got an android phone
here it is well he it was interesting
because he never really mentioned
Android per se he said that the nokia X
X plus an XL line are based on Android
Open Source Project yeah that's the
exact reason he used and then he quickly
turned to say that the this is a phone
which is focusing on Microsoft services
so with this specific phone we are
continuing to aim at users using skype
outlook.com office and all the entire
microsoft suit and they will probably do
a heavy vetting on which android
applications will get into nakia store
because the bootloader is locked
cyberlink is at the moment not possible
sir you're confined to running android
apps which are approved by nokia and the
nokia store on the phone right so Joe
leave I wrote an interesting editorial
called it calling the nokia X not a real
android phone and i really like this
debate because it's yes it runs android
but it has this kind of custom UI layer
on top you're confined to this app store
full of it's like I don't know about you
guys and maybe this is a little
short-sighted of me but whenever I'm
running a Windows Phone like the only
time i'm using like Nokia's here maps
and like nokia music is because i don't
have a better alternative because i'm
using a Windows Phone I would not
willingly use them on a device where I
could side load something that is
superior in
right celery yeah so III I failed to be
moved by this I mean everyone was so
jazzed about this the device is launched
and I think regardless of the size
correct me if I'm wrong but these are
all devices for emerging markets the
number of them are back can blow you
away good in that that's actually what I
wanted to say right now we are not we're
not their target no we're definitely not
their target they have they want to make
a big push in emerging markets
specifically in India and you know
obviously they're having trouble because
the price is no longer a setting stone
for Android we've got the Moto G I mean
it's it's there they're going they're
going head-to-head on price points and
they I guess they wanted to win in that
own turf they're having trouble moving
developers towards the platform what
they're trying to do is creating nokia
customers really i think that what
they're trying to do is push their brand
farther and i think that the phone is
capable it's not ugly it's not pretty
it's just the mid-tier phone that the UI
is really interesting it's very snappy
you can you don't do you don't the only
reason why you know it's Android is when
you go into settings Sang's looks
exactly like Android but then the rest
of it is is no gear well then and then
I'm gonna come in and say that I don't
like them the physical aspects of the
phone on the outside it's just not yet
signature and we're going to talk about
that you either love them or hate them
but not necessarily those styles those
two details because they don't resemble
anything they don't look anything like
the real towns on Windows don't but I
get it they want to have these three
phones nicely fitting into the Windows
Phone or folio which is good but then
again my biggest problem is that how on
earth can you have a low resolution
screen on a super-huge device because I
was literally on my Brandon here but I
was counting the pixels especially Excel
right but but of course and that's
that's part of that whole like mid-range
push right it's that said low end of our
line is absolutely yeah but
if I'm a typical user or any of you guys
what would be aside from the price that
single point which would push you
towards buying one of these three phones
when you have devices like the Moto G
like the s3 for instance or even the s2
which is also capable full-fledged
android phone why would you buy a nokia
X I mean it would come down to
availability because I at some point you
know and I think companies definitely
understand this yes three year old
device that is technically superior
might might suit somebody better but
people don't want to buy a three year
old device they will settle for reduced
specs if the thing is new you know and
this thing is tailored specifically for
certain types of customers with features
that are I think going to be
geographically unique to to where
they're offered so it's like you know I
I don't think I think I made a good
point before and I certainly agree that
these are not for us these are not for
people who think like us or necessarily
have the have the kind of a you know
disposable income that that people in
the flagship market really think I'm
gonna back up on this that it will
create a window stone like frustration
and let me explain this i as a windows
phone user and often frustrated because
I don't have a proper official YouTube
have a Google+ application or GL and so
on and yes my this penetration of the
wiggle sorry stration will definitely be
present on nokia X and its users because
it's like you're rocking a Porsche
without the Porsche engine I mean I'm
rocking an android phone without the
ability of installing YouTube drive and
all the others a police ship
applications from the google suit so I
think that I'm not sure I would never
buy this phone know and and and i think
that underscores the point it's not for
us that's not just this isn't the kind
of thing but so my the thing i was
saying before it and i was aware of this
i mean we've all been aware that this is
not a device for us but the the
readership seems to seems to have
expected like a nokia android phone that
was going to blow everybody away and now
there's this kind of interesting
backlash and it's like whatever you know
that's not going to happen my question
is do we think that this will continue
after them
you're soft acquisition actually closes
smoothly because there are three lineups
now it's the Lumia lineup which is the
high end it's the exes which is the
mid-tier and it's the ashes and not get
really had to fill that yet now that
they will probably in the near future no
longer a Lumia phones and even even if
they will the Asha phones are too low
and for the target which which they have
in mind so they really couldn't have a
lower end Windows Phone and they
couldn't have a higher and Asha so
they're like why don't we just fork
Android and you have a mid-tier and
everything and not only that just think
about this guy's who owns the Windows
Phone store Microsoft okay who makes
that thirty percent cut what is it
thirty percent than Microsoft okay so
who owns the Nokia Store on Android
nokia my god yep okay there-there
there-there bridging to a different type
of market there they're looking for ways
to make more money out of software and
services and yeah and in the end this is
a Microsoft company but Microsoft is
just figuring out more ways to make
money out of software and it says this
is just like the Amazon ecosystem amazon
their whole intent was to make money
from the app store sure from selling the
services and microsoft is just trying to
figure out new ways to make money out of
ecosystems and it's not Microsoft is
doing it it's nokia you know it's not
there may have been Microsoft influence
but it's still a salary of course of
course but i guess i can't i can't blame
microsoft before using the mac pro to
build the games for the xbox for example
they're just shaming shamelessly using
another source of income and there they
can nail it why not plus with the
Microsoft acquisition of nokia's devices
division nokia still has to continue to
live off of something and the Asha
phones will not provide yeah well but
that's nokia but that's that that other
division of nokia that's not going to be
doing this cuz right cuz that this
there's no get x stuff all this stuff is
gonna get absorbed when microsoft this
isn't the stuff that's staying with
nokia right yeah
I think the minute that acquisition
closes Microsoft is a pretty prideful
company and I really think that they're
sort of you know all in on Windows Phone
I would not be surprised to see this the
plug pulled on this right after the
acquisition happens well Joe Belfiore
was was really upset with the
announcement of it I don't know if
you're yet you didn't you just quote
yeah now what was his quote where were
you worried goodness from me I don't
know I read it uh Joe Belfiore nokia X
me see if I can find it really quickly
yeah yeah um oh wait a second this is
new to me so I was you know for me it
was like oh this is a smart strategy
they're opening up a new app store and
they're gonna make money out of Android
that's why not my croissants in doing is
this is not yes than doing in the Nokia
part of Nokia which is not Microsoft so
you guys feel this is gonna be the next
kin uh yeah well actually I mean and
obviously the company's culture has
changed a lot since then but it's or
maybe it hasn't i don't know but i
certainly didn't put it past them i mean
III see the little little touches of
what you're talking about here there are
things we're less excited about said
senior executive Joe Belfiore yo this is
from TechCrunch yeah they'll do some
things we're excited about this is nokia
and some things were less excited about
he said to a room of chuckling
journalists and analysts yeah yeah i
think i think the first headline i read
was a little sensationalist i think it
may have been Gawker or something but
it's that way yeah but not sensational
list yeah but it said Microsoft pissed
about nokia X that was the headline oh
yeah right so anyway we'll see what
happens we got to move on before we
moved entirely off Microsoft the they've
announced eight or eight or nine
hardware partners so the interesting
part about this to me just really
quickly is that yeah there's a bunch of
Chinese and Indian manufacturers in here
which is cool because then we're seeing
Microsoft say actively say wow we need a
low-end presence let's get a bunch of
manufacturers to build phones and not
that I'm saying all these manufacturers
are only going to build low-end phones
but I think a lot of them are and so I
that's going to be there their budget
push not this weirdo android disagree
this too will be the budget bush and now
please correct me if I'm wrong because
nothing gets into the mwc bubble but
I've heard the reports that at the same
Windows Phone 8.1 announcement the words
along the lines have been spoken that
Android will be capable of running on
future windows phone hardware no
backwards way when those phone will be
able to run on any no no no you guys
talk about something I look this up all
right I looked at it because I'm
interested to see what what that is but
the interesting part about this
announcement to me was that not just
that we're gonna see funds from carbon
and lava and long cheer and such but
that's what that well yeah but that two
of the licensees that are like
quote-unquote announced at this thing
are ZTE and LG both of whom had Windows
Phone licenses in the past so it'll be
cool to see what CT does with it just
because like ZTE is capable of doing
some interesting stuff so how's right
windows phone 8.1 will be able to be run
on existing Android devices via
on-screen buttons yeah I'm this yeah
this this is actually something which
was simply said at that event so then
why not run windows so here's the deal i
mean you own your s5 I'm just I'm just
not sure if you have to have to root
your phone or something but she you buy
windows you buy a Windows Phone license
and you've been installed on your
android phone I mean why not why why
would you though like I've never been in
a situation where I'm like gosh windows
phone hardware sucks I sure wish I had
you know windows phone running on a
samsung galaxy s4 scary around you
cannot run android on the lumia right
rights but he will be able to run
Windows Phone 8.1 on the s4 no but
that's my point why would I want to do
that the Lumia is better suited to
Windows Phone as I want has a better
game beautiful live tiles on my galaxy s
why alive tiles are not getting enough
of the sweet plastic treatment just by
the teeth if it's this ileum this is
mike remove on what we've heard about
dual booting yeah but who cares about to
like nobody
is about to a building and no consumer
has ever liked stood up and been like I
really want a dual boot so hard you know
just imagine the average user neither of
us I'm imagining the average user that's
exactly imaginings hey i'm running the
touchwiz version of the s4 and tomorrow
i can just flip doing those phone nobody
the average consumer doesn't know what
TouchWiz or Windows Phone means it's on
it okay okay we saw mwc during the show
and after the show how many Lumias that
you see on the trains when we were when
the when the show was on it doesn't come
out that we all know that Microsoft is
really struggling for that bleh digit
market share their business is not the
cell phones their businesses to still
software and what they're doing is
trying to figure out another way to sell
software that's what they're doing well
that would be compelling I would I agree
that choice choice is excellent okay so
a good example of this I would love to
see windows phone on an HTC One I think
that would be uh you're saying something
very interesting there exactly exactly I
mean why would I not so I guess they
still feel that people want to run
office on their phones as if you can't
already do a lot of things that office
can do on current services but I guess
they want that they want that push and
just like you can run windows on a
samsung acer asus notebook windows the
basic version of windows why can't you
do it on any phone that you want if you
if you're willing to pay for the
software right and i want to call out
this this particular thing dual booting
will specifically not be allowed but the
terms of this thing so it's like wow
okay you know the thing like the whole
do boo dual booting thing is very
especially with windows one that's very
I guess hypothetical and theoretical but
I think in in practice nobody would
actually ever dual boot like when if
you're running Android why would you
need to boot to windows phone you get
them saying like a lot of people aren't
ever gonna want to do that anyway it's
just if you wanted if you need it often
and there are still people who need off
it's like I get comments from from
college students especially whose
professors or you know it might be old
school and it's like you you need to
turn in your form in a dot docx file
it's like okay
but if you do that on long drive pretty
much any document editor you need to
make a powerpoint you know oh okay so we
have a couple minutes ago we got to move
on to miss quit go ahead on me with your
final Microsoft is just going back to
the roots they're trying to make money
any way possible and that's what they're
doing the question is how much is the
license going to cost you and how long
would it take to get that into
xda-developers yeah here's the thing I
don't think we're going to have concrete
details on any of this until a after the
Nokia position is complete and be after
Microsoft's new CEO is actually in
working and we have a new flow here with
with Bill Gates in his new position and
everything so this is all very early
stage stuff which is a shame because it
seems like the Windows Phone story has
been like let's wait for more news on
this for three years four years and it
was the final nail to the coffin it is
not a nail in a coffin the windows phone
is fine it'll be fine yes while
Microsoft continues to hemorrhage money
into a not growing plant they can bleed
money for next 20 years and they'll be
fine sure that that's probably not
untrue it's exist so miscellaneous to
get you guys out the door in Ojai me and
Anton have important Romanian business
to attend to yes yes yes Romanian accent
you do that pretty well it sounded more
Swedish let's talk about the new desires
gentlemen you had hands-on time with him
I did not know there was actually only
one desire okay 16 the other one was not
on the show floor and even the 816 was
there in a capacity which only allows
certain members of the media to have
hands-on because the rest of the devices
were under a slab of glass Raj Raj but
you got some time with it at one of
those yeah yeah yeah so what what's the
story of Joe leave I wrote an editorial
said the new desires finally live up to
the name is that the impression that you
young and it over to Hina cuz he's super
excited about the desire oh thank you
very much than me thank you yeah play
this game for two years sorry guys we
gotta have an Tandy the under an accent
in a little yeah I
love that he's actually already tried a
good mexican accent he he gets right but
it's all the first week we can actually
do it on the air but okay okay so here's
the deal uh there is ok so we sadly
could not use the phone we couldn't use
the UI because the phone is going to
ship with a future version of sense um
next and i'll eat so hcc is still
working on that but to be honest with
you there is nothing mid-tier about this
phone i mean it's sure it's glossy
plastic at all but it feels really good
in the hand it doesn't feel as big as it
is you get boom sound if you don't want
to deal with the four megapixel before
the four ultrapixel camera guess you'll
get one of the old 13 megapixel sensors
that we got for example well the One X
was a 8 megapixel but yeah I guess it's
in that generation yet it doesn't have
the image sensor processor HDC did
confirm that standard it's a standard
camera but dude this phone looks really
nice I mean it does look really nice
even at 720p display though I can't
really talk about anything else that we
saw it's it's really nice phone i don't
see if HTC was pretending to redefine
the mid tiered department this is
probably going to be the hottest métier
de faux nowt there it all depends on the
price it will be announced that and it
is my understanding that will soon
launch in our first launched in China
and Asian markets and then around the
world you know just getting back to the
phone I have two problems with the phone
the first one is that I really wished
for HTC to go with probably not a shiny
but a matte matte finish in the back
plastic yeah and number two and this is
this is all come this coming down to
taste and did not like the larger
perforations for boomsound bottom until
your sauce oh yeah that's only under
Enders when you hold the phone in your
hand then then you either change your
mind like I did or not ha yeah because
I'm looking at the render and the render
actually looks okay but then I look at
the hands on and I'm like wow those are
some big big speakers like I was getting
around when I saw a beater choose
presentation and we saw the render I was
dude hate those no but but I held the
phone in my hand it's felt better it
looked better when we were at the
keynote we thought that this was a
desperate measure for a GIC to show some
presents and sadly at the key no we
weren't able to actually hold the phone
because everything was under glass and
so until we actually got our exclusive
opportunity to handle the phone um dudes
I mean this phone has swept it really
cool i mean it doesn't it looks like it
looks like the higher end phone from a
lot of competing companies i mean if i
hold after holding the galaxy s5 because
we did hold the s5 before the this 8816
I it feels just this premium I mean I I
feel that the HTC is on to something and
I really don't know what specifically
because for example let's hear one if
you remember the chairwoman recently
said and this was a quote from I'm not
sure who but the credit goes out to
whomever quoted this she said that this
year HTC will focus on the mid Rangers
because that was their main problem last
year the HTC One was very well received
so very well but the company is at loss
or still them going down because of the
fact that they are missing a solid
mid-range offering and yet the way we
did get the one mini but I guess they
wanted to try something bigger for those
markets that want that in Asia now this
phone is going to be retailing to my
understanding between the 350 and 390
year off contract off contractor um but
guys again this you get the 5 megapixel
camera at the front which is cool and
it's the wide-angle camera it's not as a
larger sensor for front fascia and the
villain has four to make ended the one
has for the main camp episode it's just
it's it's funny but again I think that
you know to be honest with you once you
guys hold it if you ask me hey you want
to review the 816 I'd be willing to do
it i really like the phone that will be
yours oh god all right i want to hear is
what I hate about phone Santa we've now
he's fickle
I've now talked so much oh you guys
surprised me I didn't think we'd talked
so long about the desire I really want
to hear about the yotaphone did you get
some hands-on time with yo Titus it is
up as a one hour ago alright so what was
it like I'll let the hymen because he
handled hands on so the problem is that
the prototype that they had was a real
like real real prototype meaning not
even the buttons were actually the
buttons that will actually ship on the
phone Wow not even the speakers it was a
real plastic slab that is not going to
be the final production device tis it
did it function at all it was discrete
function a bit function on google it did
function very well it was a little buggy
but you can really tell now you know the
the e-ink display at the back is curved
it's a touchscreen you know it is really
cool i mean why it makes you ask
yourself this question instead of
dealing with a glass back that could
shatter and you can't really use for
more than just hold the phone why not
have any in display and this phone it's
got this rounded design it doesn't look
oh how could I say the previous version
looked really our case it looks like the
Nexus possess yeah yeah it says nexus s
cool in the renders it looks so gorgeous
if the white one is just um are warning
it's beautiful dudes it is beautiful I I
really hope this company nails it I I
don't hate they treated us very well I
mean their press treatment was very well
but sure the girl ran us through
everything I'm really proud to say that
this company has a really good future
with this phone and I do hope that they
succeed yeah but they're not gonna
release it until he into 2014 Ramallah
yeah yet yet and they're repeating the
same mistake they did with the original
yeah yeah shut and Barcelona nwc yeah
it'll in the end of the year I'm not
seeing the new yotaphone doesn't have
great specs it does but in nine months
from now it will be just another phone
yeah yup extra now I have a question
Taylor just shut us a link to the white
one my god that's cool looking so is
their own aura to to throw something up
on that e ink display so that when
you're not
using it you can you can there's a
gesture a two-finger swipe from the top
and whenever you do that on a front
screen whatever is on his front screen
in terms of the screenshot goes to the
back okay now one thing that you have to
keep in mind is this is not really
available for the rest of the phone it's
only available for the apps that are
enhanced for the back screen right so
for example if you want to read like if
i want to read kindle ebooks you
currently can't until amazon ports this
availability so it really depends on the
platform actually growing a little of it
go ahead and drink i thought i read that
you could use any app on the back but
not every app is optimized that's what
i've read you can't they have for
example they have if you want to read
news for example they have their own
specific proprietary reader their own
twitter at their own twitter application
i say yes i know that there was an sdk
release though so they're exactly so
that that's the deal there is an sdk but
unless you actually take advantage of it
you won't be able to use it now that
being said there's only one thing that I
didn't like about that phone it's like
okay if there is one phone that I would
have liked to be big it's this one yeah
the head but it's not well it has a
physic you mean physically large it's
not a sure I would have wanted this to
be a the note sighs it doesn't have a
5-inch screen like it's with it is a
five for the screen the back screen is
4.7 inch and it's not high pixel density
so in its gay or whatever yeah yes it's
not really the best me there is a work
in progress here I think that this is an
exceptional concept like we the two of
us Michael have agreed last year they
nice take it to the next level but ice
continue to think that the company has
not learned enough from their experience
last year then they really need a push
or maybe somebody else could take this
concept to the real level of where it
should be yeah that's the thing and you
know I don't want to see them bought or
anything like that I think that you know
that's a really good way to squander
innovation sometimes I just and I
understand as I said my editorial on
this that building a phone takes a long
time especially one that stretches the
boundaries like this one does and we
just talked about one of the reasons why
that is because you need a custom
software I get all that but uh noun
Singh like
nine months before it's available is
also a really good way to disenfranchise
your future customers because announced
yeah announce that you can closer to
launch every you know you can probably
get away with a concept like this you
can probably get away with announcing it
like four months in advance but I'm not
gonna be able to buy this in the United
States until 2015 if I'm able to buy it
at all by which point it's just gonna be
like the first your phone is now it's
kind of it's gonna be archaic and look
okay yeah announcing a phone so early
and not launching it and not running
Windows Phone is odd you know what
there's nothing role I kind of find the
explanation I think I can nail this down
to the following they're making the
announcement now as mwc even though they
won't be able to deliver until the end
of the year because whenever somebody
else comes around with this idea they
can say that we were the first ones well
I think its patented they were already
the first on the first your phone you
know yeah either way I get she's gonna
dos it would not want it yeah if I read
the prototype state with something like
this and I had a device that you guys
got hands-on time with I would be
difficult for me to say no to a show
like mwc were you also you read a big
trade show so you can like win those
Awards that some of the blogs give out
you know like they won their seen that
best of best of si si es an emotion of
CES yeah the first one did so yeah I'm
looking forward to getting my hands on
that I hope we get a review unit this
time because we didn't I that is the
hopefully somebody from the team will
get a hands-on hopefully uh and finally
I think I cuz I know we're ten minutes
over the time you guys said you we had
to go you can chime in on huawei if you
want but I'm very interested to hear
about your time spent with Lenovo
because they are the future owners of
Motorola and I'm interested in their
current state of offerings okay real
quick about the huawei i think i'm
really excited about the the hugest HTC
One the icon yachts have X point but now
i'm just messing things up the x-point
one wherever it's saying to me
greenie up at x1 that's the one with
with the phone capabilities and the
speakers which really looks like the HTC
one really has an exceptional spring
high quality specs I'd like that and now
getting back to lumia and gloomy in
Jesus I have a drink here excellent
little thing is that the lenovo is not
yet acting as the owner of motorola and
we have talked to several people at
lenovo and we said that hey we're here
we would like to introduce lenovo to
that part of our audience which does not
know the novo or only knows your lenovo
by judging them by the laptop say their
name because you guys now Oh Motorola
and they're like oh yeah well on paper
because there's regulations that yes
absolutely but now you hopefully those
regulations and the regulatory approvals
will come through you will become the
owners in rolla but until then they
still behave like Lenovo shirt damn you
see the portfolio of products and their
presence and that's why we did that
booth door and they had the great
devices including that what was the name
of the FF the the 10 fhd plus the 10 HD
Plus how do these companies expect for
us to remember these names yeah 10 yoga
at 10 HD plus it was a tablet yeah yoga
tablets in HD put yeah yeah not only got
it whoo that's the one and this is a
great product every had the entire
laptop why have the new at the planet
they had the convertibles they had the
three families of smartphones the higher
end the vibes gianna bypass the lower
and the mid-tier phone so they had they
really brought everything to a very nice
booth so i think that this as we
concluded in the video laura is in good
hands as long as Lenovo doesn't mess up
more what everything what Motorola is ok
so I am saying that you guys just
continue doing what Lenovo does and let
moral ado what more or less best and if
necessary market the next moto g as
Lenovo GM
and leave it as moto G in the US and so
win-win situation hey if you saw the
design of that Lenovo the really thin
phone that devices the vibe z I mean it
was oh god it was so thin and they and
they have this like brushed chrome and I
don't know if it's aluminum what sort of
metal they use i'm not sure if even
black looking good they're built quality
is awesome and if they could you know
focus on design and leave the software
to Motorola and bring a couple of the
elements that we saw on the Moto X they
they have a chance to succeed indeed
well I think the hard way it's very
important for 44 Motorola's hardware
group to have it you say in their future
suffocate Motorola's yeah God they
invented the cell phone and I've never
made a voice call that I've enjoyed more
than on a motorola device and
speakerphone and yeah motorola has the
fundamentals down really well and lenovo
seems to know how to make really sexy
looking hardware so maybe marriage
between the two could bring us something
really really sexy but I'm just saying
please do not touch whatever is working
with marula now because their breakfast
riding away yeah cool we I want to hear
your very quick thoughts before we duck
out of here gents this I think was one
of the the best trade shows I've ever
seen for far I mean we have a record
number of videos from the show that are
still being uploaded and welcome this is
well done and I you know it but that is
because there was so much to film and
you know we were about to not feel
anything why we were meeting up with I'm
at the airport take the first cab to the
hotel downtown we have so many stories
and yeah we have a specific edition with
Barcelona still reason I'm like I'm it
listen we have a lot of bags why don't
we pack up the trunk and I'm gonna put
my my samsonite bag which contains one
laptop one camera a lot of phones or
tablets all my gear and I wasn't paying
attention to anything was in the back
seat I'll sit in the front and we
arrived we arrived at the destination
and I'm like comment why don't you
unpack the car I'm going to bake for a
cab and then we can go upstairs and
that's what happens
he unpacks the car I pay for a cab cat
goes away we go to the sidewalk I lit a
cigarette and I'm just looking at the
luggages and my samsonite bag oh yeah
and I'm just looking at the end of the
street and the cab is just taking a
corner onto the boulevard no Highness it
just two words just run just run I did
another runner I'm a Jimmer but for a
second I really thought that was all
that and i think it was either the third
or the fourth traffic light i finally
managed to knock on the trunk because it
turned to green and he was in first year
but I'm not so part of the trunk and he
pulled it breaks and opened up the door
grabbed my samsonite I for a second I
even thought and he was gonna cry that
somebody's gonna is ripping him off for
a minute it's her buddy dude that oh wow
well good running I'm really glad you
didn't leave that in the cab can I ask a
question we why didn't Jaime run yeah
cuz I'm a dreary yeah i miss the motor
and he forgot the bag she did not
realize what was happening but i had
read dude i started running i had just
been fine for 24 hours man I was it was
not be right but it's not like he laughs
with the back in my hand by that time
you realize like he was like dude your
bails like the bag was there run so yeah
but that just wants to read a lot more
including high nylons burning down the
entire building oh my god and I'm sign
so I bring this why bring this how do
you call those a nice tender the
extender of different connections how do
you call the search / suppressor I
brought uh you know an American surge
protector too and I always do that every
time I travel I you know you remember
Michael from Vegas I had the surge
protector with everything I think my
prospective will be more interesting
buyers because I'm on developing evening
and and smoking in the balcony and like
hymens in the room with the lights on
and at one point I just grab a smoke
from a cigarette and I here I'm gonna
darkness okay i'm looking at high man
and he has a stupidest face on
a little bit smoke coming off of his
extender and he was like oh is
going on did you really love that
110-volt into a 210 220 volt outlet
buddy with the whole building lost power
man oh my god and that that's you know
in the movies by the silence just just
no cars were moving it was just
completely dead and I did whenever
somebody asks us it was not us it wasn't

jacket and throw it out oh my god you're

ho the other day see that too now loosen
some rounded corners yeah i really like
those wide radius corners that's nice

was about to say that this
there's another phone out there which
resembles a lot to this one it's made by
HTC your name is sue yeah all right well
