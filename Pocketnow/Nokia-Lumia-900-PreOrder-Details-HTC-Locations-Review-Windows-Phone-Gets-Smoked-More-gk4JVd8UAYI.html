you money acc locations brings another
offline navigation solution and I guess
Windows Phone just got smoked all the
sim more coming up right now hello we r
1 i'm jaime with pocketnow.com and
welcome to Windows Phone view the show
we wrap up all this week's good and bad
inside the world of Microsoft's Windows
Phone platform let's talk this week off
what's good April laith is the day
people write it down in your calendars
and make sure you get your wallets ready
because the AT&amp;amp;T Nokia Lumia 900 will be
available on that date for sale and get
this it'll only cost you 99 bucks and
it's kind of interesting because usually
LTE devices cost you like 300 bucks
after two year contract but this time
AT&amp;amp;T is playing it differently with this
Lumia and it's not like if they need it
to compete with price because this is a
very gorgeous phone but it doesn't stop
there if you make your pre-order in
Walmart as of March 30th you only have
to pay 50 bucks for the phone kind of
interesting but not finish there if you
also pre-order the device on AT&amp;amp;T and
you're lucky enough to be one of their
first most probably not that case
anymore but if you're lucky enough to be
there hey you could even get the phone
for free interesting to see all these
dramatic changes in pricing Nokia seems
to be doing their job and being
aggressive that's great now if Nokia is
not your thing april eighth is also the
day where AT&amp;amp;T plans to launch their LTE
version of the HTC Titan to that we
recently had some one-on-one time at CES
aside from the great speeds the
processor and the design what makes the
acc tiny to special is the fact that you
get a 16 megapixel camera on a Windows
Phone obviously it's still going to be
stuck at 720p video recording that has
to do with the operating system not
necessarily the camera but the only
problem here is that it will cost you 1
99 after two-year contracts in case of
the Lumia so it's going to be kind of an
interesting competition there HTC lovers
will have their phone but it's going to
be kind of a no-brainer which device to
choose because even though you get the
16 megapixel camera on the HTC time to
you get call size optics on the Lumia
900 kind of a no-brainer now i'm going
back to nokia interesting notice that
they seem to be working on a new nokia
TV application and service sort of like
what you get with acc watch only that
this obviously will bring their sort of
proprietary services and features
apparently the leak show that this
proves to work over Wi-Fi and 3G or LTE
data and though we're still not sure how
they plan to compete though obviously
it's not like if you get the HTC watch
service on nokia devices anyway so time
will tell see what they bring to the
table probably some on the man TV movies
and hopefully like TV you never know out
of this week's coverage make sure you
catch adam lanes recent video where he
compares the HTC location service with
Nokia Maps for those of you that haven't
heard ACC locations brings offline maps
the HTC devices pretty much for free so
it's kind of an interesting service out
there it's really cool that Adam got the
time to compare it watch the video for
details also catches recent xbox live
preview of I Sun two of your interested
in getting rid of your snowboarding
habits off your back and also make sure
you catch Morgan's recent editorial on
his five months using Windows 8 and the
reasons why this version will definitely
matter
okay so add this is for the good let's
continue on with what's bad and let's
start talking about Microsoft's campaign
smoked by Windows Phone kind of a
gangster named but still there's a guy
named saw Scott's I and I most probably
destroy the guy's name right now I'm
really sorry but he won the battle with
a Samsung Galaxy Nexus he showed
Microsoft that he could prove and load
weather and two different places at the
same time with two different widgets
very smart but then microsoft store
employees told him that he had to show
that he could do it in two different
states not the same state which is kind
of stupid because no smartphone
operating system differentiates whether
you're looking for whether in russia and
New York and it'll take longer than what
it usually takes it takes the same
amount of time so Microsoft's been
Rudolf came on record and try to make
things right though the winner ended up
giving everything to charity because he
definitely didn't consider things to be
right so it kind of makes you wonder if
this sort of campaign is good or not
anyways and hey if you have a windows
phone on AT&amp;amp;T and you're interested in
the 8107 update that brings a lot of bug
fixes including email bug fixes well
you're in bad luck because AT&amp;amp;T just
came on record to say that they were not
going to be offering every single
updating Microsoft was launching because
eventually they just had these
cumulative updates come in the future so
apparently to them that you're still
going to get the update in the future so
if you have problems with email ATT says
don't worry you can live with that you
can just continue on and you can wait
for the next update extremely laying the
updates out there and sadly AT&amp;amp;T
customers are not getting it too bad to
see that Microsoft can't do their thing
right here and try to make things right
for customers that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching on hind
metal you better remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
