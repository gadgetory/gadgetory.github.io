we're here with a Sampson representative
and the 18-team samsung galaxy s2
what's new with this device so the AT&amp;amp;T
version of the galaxy s2 is actually a
4.3 inch first the sprint and tmobile
one's actually 4.5 inches we're done
with we have here when I should be the
media hub as you can see it's going to
really i'm just really show off the
Super AMOLED screen
let's give it a second so this is a
famous for normal media of except we get
1080p resolution from watching video as
well as these actually push out to your
TV and then decoration my pork
you can see is crisp clear no ghosting
the shadowy whatsoever really shows off
the tower hamlets dream
yeah it's good
and we can show off in here would be
woody of the phone itself you can see is
little to no lag anything
points here
I knew I could pay for the widgets and
especially the latest version of
TouchWiz so if you've ever messed around
with the tablet version most likely
ok
and you can touch that scroll there are
three know so you can go really fast or
patient like
microwaves doesn't have the new motion
so i can do like that switching screens
okay
and your garage open air just moving at
one right let's write so
as you're holding any of the icons
screen right at work in the browser or
FSU at home in the browsers yes you can
gauge
let's try this there's too many internet
connections here
let's try and go to regular yeah
what's
 now calm
everything here bring you some same
library yeah
yeah so you can do is you can she
pinched for
Virginia zoom I guess not doing this one
because it's a mobile website picture
then the pictures it will do the regular
Princeton soon so it's mostly on
websites
do you think there was a new calendar
application
the same gentleman application having
the other Android news obviously the
TouchWiz added to it
also on the home screen you can do
earlier you can tell me what's the
difference between a TT
making mobile perfect t-mobile's as you
release full specification for their
advice yeah sprint and t-mobile Sprint
AT&amp;amp;T I should pretty much the same the
same dual-core processor brings the main
difference would be aesthetic as well as
the actual screen size the both film is
16 gigabytes of memory with expandable
up to 32 gigs safe travel a single point
to dual core processor to make therefore
camera maturing a pixel in front a
camera back
looks a little bit like the infused 14
there's a difference there
that's good thank you much and that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
