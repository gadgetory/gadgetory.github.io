Pocky Metacom and say we're unboxing the
most anticipated devices of 2011 the
Sony Ericsson Xperia Play so let's get
to it
liesl just open this package it looks as
though customs may have already wanted
to play with this device while they had
it in the possession so open okay so the
box is a little mangled but that
shouldn't be a problem let's see here it
shows that we have Wi-Fi b/g/n we have
our five megapixel camera four inch
screen the sony ericsson xperia play the
playstation some 3g HSPA on this side we
have the sony ericsson emblem and let's
see here what else do we have
just the PlayStation PlayStation
Certified Android device so let's open
up this bad boy okay so inside the box
we have our Sony Ericsson Xperia Play
and we'll just set that to the side for
one second underneath this piece of
cardboard we have our 3.5 millimeter
headphones and that's a stereo headset
and we also have a micro USB sync in
charge cable and our European charger
this is the European version and let's
see what we have in here a minimal
documentation of course we are not sure
if this came with all the paperwork so
we'll just set that aside and get to the
guts and glory of this unboxing which is
the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play and let's
see if I can power this device on okay
so there we go so the device feels
really good in hand it feels kind of
similar to a PSP go the buttons feel a
little bit better and I wondering how
gameplay will work with these
directional pads here opposed to the the
toggle button the joystick that's on the
PSP go of so let's see we'll just wait
for this to load for one second okay so
while that's loading we can compare this
to a couple other devices we have a PSP
go right here and they're about similar
in size they're same thickness it looks
though they're the same thickness we can
open up this device here and open up
this one you can see how the button
configurations are a little bit
different it'll be interesting to see
how games are played with these uh touch
pads opposed to this joystick you can
also compare this to a iPhone 4 and it's
much thicker than the iPhone 4 of course
we do have this gamepad here ok so this
is the German version so I'm going to
have to figure out where I need to go to
change all these settings a little oops
is all I'm right here so we'll just pick
English for the United States and then
I'm guessing that means to accept so
stay tuned for the hardware and software
tours coming up next and if you like our
videos make sure you give us a thumbs up
and also leave some comments down below
