now calm and today we're checking out a
new live wallpaper for android called a
butterfly Fantasia it actually comes to
us from the same developer who created
the popular a circuit board and a spirit
bomb live wallpapers this one is also
unique with a bit of artistic flair to
it so let's take a look alright so as
you can see this wallpaper consists of
many butterflies flying around they're
flying in from different directions
there are different sizes and they
actually fly at different speeds as well
so you can see that the color tone is
set to white this is by default we can
actually change that which I'll show you
in a minute to add to the overall
artistic look these random splashes of
color come up let's go ahead and swipe
through the screen you can see that the
wallpaper doesn't slow down the
interface at all the butterflies still
fly at quick speed so that's good to
know we can actually interact a bit if
we drop an icon down this flower will
pop up and then a giant butterfly flies
in and lands on it so a nice little
touch we'll wait that wait for that to
finish up ok and then with we double tap
on the screen you get a strobe effect
and then it goes into slow motion so
again with the artistic feel to the
wallpaper let's do that again very cool
ok so if we go into menu here we can
change some options so will increase the
amount of butterflies to 30 if you
wanted to you can get rid of those
splashes of color I'll leave that on for
now and then we can change the color I'm
going to go to blue and then if you
wanted to set a custom color you can do
that as well so I'll go home and now our
butterflies have a blue tint to them
you
okay so let's actually check out another
color here before we wrap up I actually
saw transparent that might look somewhat
nice so a little bit less bold kind of
blends in here nice to have behind all
your icons and things of that nature so
this was a quick look at a butterfly
Fantasia live wallpaper you can get in
the android market for a dollar and
twenty cents for more smartphone news
