self-healing display and no 5g even if
the company already built the chip
capable Sprint and LG are planning to
actually do a 5g smartphone aka the
possible LG g8 and Apple is apparently
focusing on building Health's chips as a
one thing to compliment the Apple watch
I'm high metal Iveta and since steagle
is pretty much out of jokes and there's
really nothing funny to say about
Wednesday I guess we're back to our
regular scheduled programming this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with leaks I know that's odd but
there are no deals today so let's talk
about the BlackBerry key to L e which
I'm not sure if it's limited edition
what I do know is that the
specifications are pretty much the same
that we apparently know there's just a
new blue color or sort of bluish color
we have a possible event being teased
August 30th which is pretty much Eva and
I'm gonna be there so it's gonna be
great I will keep you posted now let's
talk about Oppo as a the company pretty
much just spilled the beans on the r17
we get to see it's beautiful design with
that teardrop knot at the front
beautiful glass in the back snapdragon
670 we always have known that opal our
lines are well not necessarily of the
best specifications but great battery
life and probably what has us most
intrigued this that many rumors claimed
that this is the design of the oneplus
60 so yeah we'll see I was talking about
Apple as there's a very interesting
article that teases that the company is
working on more health products not just
the Apple watch I feel the Apple watch
continues to be one of my favorite
watches for fitness even if I really
only use it for fitness but apparently
there are some new sensors that the
company is working on even in
combination with companies like Asics
even with the whole deal that Apple
already has with Nike but yes sensors on
shoes sensors on clothes stay tuned
that's gonna be interesting now let's
talk about Sprint and LG as both
companies have just launched the press
release where they tell us that they
will be working on the first ever 5g
phone in the United States as of the
first half of next year first half yes
six months so we're talking about LG
this is most likely going to be the LG G
eight I believe and that's rather
interesting as we know that moto has
something that we've got rumors that LG
is probably gonna be alone in 5g which
is not necessarily good and finally the
hot news today actually have to do with
5g and the Samsung Galaxy S 10 separate
news first is that the company samsung
being has just that created an exodus
modem that's 5g capable the problem is
that the rumors are that this 5g capable
modem is not going to make it to the
galaxy s 10 that apparently this device
won't bring the technology on the other
hand we have the company also working on
this health self-healing display that
might make it to the galaxy s tennis
part of the features where even
fingerprints are going to be apparently
and smudged somehow I don't know how
that's gonna work that's gonna be really
cool but in today's question let us know
what do you think about a Galaxy S 10
with a self-healing display and no 5g at
a time when probably the LG G a will
bring the technology in my case I know
that it's gonna take some time for 5g to
deploy but the more phones out there
that have 5g the better it's gonna be s
this will allow a lot of phones to drop
off LTE and just bring less congestion
so I know that it would be great for one
of the best selling phones to bring 5g
but we'll see leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion

news earlier follow us on flying out on
