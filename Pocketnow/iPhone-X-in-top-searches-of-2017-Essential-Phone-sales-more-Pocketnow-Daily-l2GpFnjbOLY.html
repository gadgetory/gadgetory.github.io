iPhone 8 an iPhone 10 were among the top
three global searches Apple may actually
grow in market share along with Huawei
and not really Samsung and the iMac pro
goes live and I'm seriously not gonna
get one I'm hiding that I leave it out
back in New York City with the snow and
for December events oddly this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for a SmartWatch the Fitbit ionic is
probably my top ugly a SmartWatch ever
but hey if you want one it's currently
270 dollars or $300 respectively
depending on where you find it and a ton
of stores including Amazon and VA you
can learn more in the description and
the only reason I'm including the news
of the iPad pro the daily is just to
make fun of it seriously you can order
yours today for price tags between five
thousand and thirteen thousand two
hundred dollars and sure if you want to
get yourself a falcon northwest tikki
for gaming full maxed out and everything
I know it will cost you between seven to
nine thousand dollars so yeah price tags
are this crazy for pcs but thirteen
thousand still it is cheaper than the
first Apple watch essential at seventeen
K and for those of you that are
wondering just how many essential phones
have sold well there aren't really any
statistics but some current analytics
show that the camera application that is
now separate from the firmware is that
being downloaded by fifty thousand
people and well I gotta say this I mean
I've been trying the essential phone for
ages now I know that I've been reluctant
to review it I will now it's changed a
lot and I actually like the phone a lot
and that was surprised to see some of my
favorite youtubers actually using the
phone so I'll let you know what I think
in the review because with the recent
deals it kind of makes sense and how
about if we discuss market share believe
it or not according to analysts one of
the companies that's gonna grow
significantly this next quarter will be
Apple and then followed by Huawei now
the only company that is not going to
grow this quarter for some odd reason to
Samsung and this is something that I
really don't understand as a Samsung
Galaxy Note it is an awesome device in
addition to others but anyways we will
keep you posted as we see how these
numbers go from analytics to
you know what really happens and finally
the very hot news today have to do with
a tweet from sundar Pichai where he
showed us a YouTube video over the top
searches of 2017 and we see this roundup
all the time most interesting according
to sundar one of the major words that
was used was how and they made this a
very emotional video that I actually
recommend that you watch but obviously
and what things pertain to technology
believe it or not one of the top three
searches on the web was iPhone iPhone 10
or iPhone 8 obviously remember it's not
really the iPhone 8 for the longest time
we thought the iPhone 10 was going to be
the iPhone 8 so that's the reason why
the 8 was there but yeah it does show
that the iPhone has insane amounts of
popularity watch the video let us know
in the comments what do you think why do
you think that the iPhone 10 or iPhone 8
are so popular what makes people search
them so much around the world in my case
I think Apple has done a good job in
making the brand be I don't know a
fashion statement but leave us a comment
down below that's just my opinion I want
to learn yours friends again if you want
