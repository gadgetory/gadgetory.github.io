apps I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and these are the best photo editing
apps for Android with relatively
impressive cameras fastened to the
backside of our smartphones we have a
decent camera on our person at virtually
all hours of every day
it's easy to get carried away with
snapping photos of important life events
scenic places we may pass by unusual
sights and of course food but not every
picture turns out exactly as you might
want or expect sometimes you might want
to add some effects to a picture to make
it more dramatic or moving maybe the
colors are off a bit or the contrast is
too low or maybe you want that vintage
effect on Android photo editing
applications are a dime a dozen
there are literally hundreds if not
thousands of photo editors but there are
a handful of photo editors that stand
out from the rest
September Google bought Nick software
the company behind the very popular iOS
photo editor Snapseed in december the
iOS application was dropped from $4.99
to free and the android version was
released to the Play Store ever since it
has easily been my choice photo editing
application on both Android and iOS and
the one that I recommend to everyone
else
on the surface Snapseed may seem almost
identical to the masses of standard
photo editing applications but its ease
of use and the speed and ability to
tweak almost any aspect of any photo or
filter makes it one of the more robust
and intuitive photo editors around
editing a picture is as simple as
sliding your finger up and down to
choose from the different metrics and
left and right to adjust the intensity
almost every picture I take with my
phone goes through snaps II before I
share it the best part is Snapseed is
entirely free also recent updates to the
google plus applications for ios and
android have also implemented some of
snap seats best features
another photo editor that is packed to
the brim with neat features is pics art
it too is free and basically it's
another one of the dozens of photo
editors with a ton of filters that are
highly customizable but it comes with
the ability to add text to photos draw
on them add stickers and much more on
top of all that pix art is sort of a
social network in itself allowing users
to upload edited photos directly to
their picsArt account
not unlike Instagram and from within the
app you can view other users photos too
photo editor I've been using longer than
any other application on Android is
picks a pro it's definitely not the
prettiest app its interface is
reminiscent of Android 2.3 Gingerbread
but that doesn't take from the sheer
functionality of pixie it offers
everything from exposure contrast and
saturation adjustment to sharpening
redeye fixing and a wide array of
filters like pix art it also allows the
user to insert stickers text and frames
to their photos pixate is generally my
go-to application for adding text
annotating except for when I'm using the
Galaxy Note 2 and adding a big giant
arrow to point to something in the
picture but using it most definitely
requires the ability to appreciate
function over form
pick say comes in a free light version
in the premium version which unlocks
features such as full resolution export
cost 399 if none of these applications
quite do it for you there is another
option however it does cost more than
pix a pro Photoshop Touch is essentially
a lightweight version of the popular
Adobe Photoshop application for
computers but make no mistake it is
easily the most adept and well-rounded
photo editor on any mobile platform and
it's almost as intuitive and as fast as
Snapseed almost Photoshop Touch allows a
user to use scribble selection to
intelligently extract portions of images
layer photos and export images up to 12
megapixels it also includes its own set
of filters a wide array of selection
tools and other various tools for
inserting text and applying different
effects Photoshop Touch for phone is
$4.99 and separately Photoshop Touch for
tablets is $9.99 keep in mind that
Google has also added some much-needed
editing features to the stock gallery
application on Android it now has
built-in filters frames and sliders for
sharpness exposure brightness contrast
saturation etc there is also a hidden
menu for the history of the edits made
to the pictures for a quick backtracking
process this is accessed by a
right-to-left gesture on the picture
itself this editor is quick and simple
to use best of all its built-in and free
for most the built-in editor will suit
most of your needs but if you're looking
for more extensive editing definitely
check out the previously mentioned apps
that's all we've got for you now so if
