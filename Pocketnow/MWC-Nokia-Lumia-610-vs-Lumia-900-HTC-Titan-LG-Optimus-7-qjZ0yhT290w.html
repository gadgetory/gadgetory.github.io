pocketnow.com again from the Nokia booth
if you want to know if the Lumia 610 is
your next device well let's compare with
other windows phones I mean right now
we've got the Lumia 900 which you'll see
another hands-on video very soon and
will be compare them side by side you'll
notice obviously at the 610 is extremely
small it's pretty much a dwarf if we try
to compare screen sizes obviously this
is a 4.3 inch display this one is a
three point three point seven display
yeah will notice that obviously the 610
is a tad thicker you can barely notice
it sorry about the yo-yo guys can't do
much about that but notice that the
thickness this is a little thicker than
the Lumia 610 the seven sorry that the
900 obviously it's dwarfed also in
thickness and with just about everything
I mean definitely again this is a
high-end smartphone this is a not a
high-end smartphone will compare the
Lumia 900 with the other phone soon
we've got the Gigantor HTC Titan here
obviously a huge device it's not a fair
comparison remember this is a flagship
phone this will look a lot better beside
the Lumia 900 100 which you'll see soon
but compared to this phone obviously
just about is thick but definitely a
dwarf in comparison in both width and
just about everything else and then
we've got the LG optimus seven here
which is a pre mango phone lovely
picture there Tony let's see
almost the same height actually you know
considering that this is not a budget
phone the optimist 7 I mean this is
actually a little bit thicker definitely
oh they're almost the same with almost
the same height both really good windows
phones I mean just if we were to compare
it if we want to tell you hey would you
want to get a 6-10 again there's a great
entry level for your kids it's probably
for you know a gift for somebody or hey
if you're just out there for an unlocked
phone or when you're traveling or just
out to get the windows phone experience
that on a tight budget it's probably a
good way to start thank you very much
the same that we let over going out on
calm Tony on camera oh sure you got the
copy man okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
