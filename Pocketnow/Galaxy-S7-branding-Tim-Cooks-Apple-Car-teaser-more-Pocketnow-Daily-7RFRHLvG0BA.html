probability of an apple car Samsung
makes some interesting changes to its
Galaxy s7 and LG may have more than one
g5 up its sleeve I'm hi Mary veteran I'm
reporting from the land where reggaeton
is sung in Romanian this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
HTC the company has come clear on its
priorities stating that it hasn't really
changed them the company wants to
diversify into a ton of things and
definitely brn mobile are at the top now
Mobile continues to be the company's
largest business so far but that could
change as of today given the fact that
the HTC vive is now on pre-orders stay
tuned as we report more now we've got
some very interesting rumors when it
comes to the LG g5 the company never
really said that there were more than
one variant but it seems that there is
an LG g5 light in the works what's going
to be different is that instead of the
Snapdragon 820 we have the Snapdragon
652 and instead of four gigs of RAM we
get three gigs here other changes are
the fact that the LG 360 VR headset will
not be able to work with this t5 light
but yeah it will only be available in
the Latin American markets apparently
and obviously that will help with the
price tag that will thus poly over to
Samsung this is rather interesting as
the company continues to make some civil
changes to its galaxy lineup we see some
tina certification documents that show
us a galaxy s7 without prominent Samsung
branding at the top this is rather odd
as obviously the company wants to make a
statement and it seems that minimalism
is the thing to come though we're not
exactly sure which markets will get
these changes stay tuned for that as
well and then when it comes to Samsung's
largest competitor Apple we also hear
some rather interesting changes from new
sources that claim that the iphone mini
will not be called the iphone 5s II
apparently it'll just be called the
iphone SE and we're still scratching our
heads here trying to figure out what
exactly does the company mean by s ii
let us be the iphone special edition the
iphone small addition we would love to
know what you think in the comments down
below finally the very interesting news
they have to do with Apple again Tim
Cook was recently interviewed and one of
the major questions was will we ever get
an Apple car and this is rather
interesting as Tim Cook responded to
this saying hey remember when you were a
kid and it was Christmas Eve and you
couldn't wait to see what was downstairs
whenever you woke up whenever you woke
up is actually the tag line here is he's
not really mentioning that the kid goes
downstairs to see what the gifts were
and this pretty much means that we
aren't going to be waiting a while to
learn whatever Apple will bring with the
Apple car but it does lead me to the
question of the day do you really
believe that apple will ever make the
jump to a vehicle do you think that's a
move in my case I do believe it will
mainly because of hey Google is doing
self-driving cars and so we do see with
other competitors leave us a comment

opinion and friends you know the way it
