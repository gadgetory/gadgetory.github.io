screams android all over it the feature
nexus 7 seems to be more expensive than
expected maybe we're looking for a red
nokia lumia 1020 you might be in luck
i'm hi mera better and I'm sure that red
phones will one day grow into my midlife
crisis this is out daily that
Sarge day off with some interesting
leaks as I know some of you were kind of
worried because there was no nokia lumia
1020 in red being announced at the event
and so far that's been kind of a mystery
but we've got the first press renders
leaked of the device obviously being
covered in that amazing red and it does
show that it's just a matter of time
before this phone we just a market it
does have an AT&amp;amp;T logo on it so that's
not necessarily a good thing but stay
tuned we'll see how this goes eventually
and now for the not so cool news from
Nokia we know that the company was
working on their own phablet but the
problem is that this doesn't seem to be
a high-end phablet we've got some Lake
press renders of a Nokia Lumia 625 and
it sports a 4.7 inch WVGA display which
is reminiscent of the HTC Titan from two
years ago so it's kind of hard to tell
you right now that we are getting a good
fallot from Nokia most probably this
device will be for emerging markets uh
anyways now let's talk about the Nexus 7
we had some leaks in the past of a
Snapdragon 600 processor great specs and
a sub two hundred dollar price tag but
that's not necessarily accurate we've
got some retail leaks of this device
being dubbed the Nexus 27 inch which is
most probably the feature nexus 7 being
the Nexus 7 number two and well the
price tag does go above two hundred
dollars which you know I'm not gonna
blame google here I mean the price tag
actually only grows between twenty to
forty dollars depending on the variant
that you're looking for and considering
the fact that this is the latest and
greatest and only successful Android
tablet out there I think the price is
kind of fair so stay tuned and let's see
how that plays out now let's move over
to verizon in the motorola droid ultra
and i always get specked with these
names but rumors headed that the company
was going to announce these phones in
August and now it seems that the company
intends to announce them on july twenty
third um i haven't really seen the press
invites yet so i'm really not sure
this is going to happen that way but it
seems so and that's pretty much just a
couple of days away it's next tuesday
we've seen some variants of this phone
even being colored in red aside from the
typical black rage clearly you already
know so let's see if this really happens
and let's see if these new phones are
actually as good as we've been waiting
for and finally for the hot news of the
big google has just sent out press
invitations for an event to happen next
week on july twenty fourth and it
screams android all over it's going to
be led by sundar pichai and we are
expecting either Android 4.3 or the moto
extra the feature Nexus 7 or all three
combined we've been waiting for this for
a long time already and we're expecting
a lot from this event so far but it's
really kind of hard to tell right now as
leaks have been good when it comes to
the Moto X but nothing else so that
leads you to the question of the day
what are your predictions for this event
are you going to take your choices based
upon lease which would mean just the
Moto X and probably Android 4.3 or do
you believe that there is more behind a
table that Google was smarter and
keeping concealed leave us a comment
down below in my particular case I do
believe that we are getting at least
Android 4.3 at least the Moto X you know
it's a matter of time for the nexus 7 to
be out but I don't think that we are
getting any more Nexus products aside
from that so leave us a comment again
and of course for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet roll be sure you
follow us on out our comment
