learning hardware that we didn't hear
about at the event benchmarks revealed
there is an HTC U of xi plus in the
works and it since the BlackBerry motion
has already begun motion ahead of time
I'm high metal II that I reporting from
New Orleans for no particular reason I
actually spent my summers when I was a
kid in this house many years so feels
like being home this is PocketNow daily
the official news today begin with deals
if here in the market for the BlackBerry
key one probably this is the best time
to buy it is currently $50 off meaning
instead of 550 you're paying $500 and
for those of you that still wonder what
our opinion is of the BlackBerry key one
that continues to be the king of battery
life for 2017 so yeah that's a priority
for you that is a phone we highly
recommend
and speaking of blackberry the
BlackBerry motion has already begun
pre-orders in the UK it is currently 399
pounds not exactly as expensive as we
thought then again not as cheap as we
thought as well it's still polarizing
for me to give an opinion over this
phone I can't wait for it to get to the
United States but still if you preorder
it now on The Carphone Warehouse you can
get it by November 10 that's a good
option and if you notice that we haven't
really covered the patent war between
Apple and Qualcomm it's because we don't
like to cover drama but apparently it's
about to end
according to Qualcomm CEO the company's
relationship with Apple is both strong
and broad and we should be expecting
some sort of a deal between both
companies very soon how is that going to
benefit either we will learn as soon as
that happens now let's move the
spotlight over to HTC if you remember
those rumors of a possible event to have
it on over a mere second we've got
benchmarks that show us that there is an
HTC u 11 plus in the works with a six
inch quad HD 18 by 9 or fine 2x1 aspect
ratio in addition to that apparently we
get the typical specifications of the U
11 that could Snapdragon 835 four gigs
of ram 64 gigs of storage expandable
apparently it's not really gonna change
much in anything but the aspect ratio
that's not necessarily a bad thing I
wonder if the company is also going to
make the jump to OLED which would be the
only way that it would be able to work
with Google's daydream services so let's
see if that happens and finally the very
hot news that they have to do with the
pixel 2 in pixel 2 XL from Google if you
remember those rumors of the company
working on its own chip apparently it
already happened it's called the pixel
visual core and the whole idea is to
bring more efficiency in Google's
ability to bring that hdr+ that we fell
in love with in the pixel if you want to
learn specification on the chip there on
the link in the description the whole
point is that number one
Google is already working on its own
architectures I don't think there's any
other company that's providing an
imaging ship like this but anyways that
leads me to the question today are you
ordering any of the new pixels which one
did you pick of so in my case my pixel
to excel is arriving soon I can't wait
to get it and I can't wait to tell you
more mainly because I do love that hdr+
