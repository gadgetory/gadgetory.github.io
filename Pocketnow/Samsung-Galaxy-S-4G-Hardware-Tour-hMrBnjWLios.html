calm this is our Hardware tour of the
samsung galaxy s 4g on t-mobile let's
check out okay so here's the galaxy s 4g
and it's very very similar to the
vibrant that was previously released on
tmobile same thickness about 10
milliliters same weight and pretty much
same body too we'll take a little look
the top we got the speaker grill you can
see some sensors under there t-mobile
logo we have a new VGA front-facing
camera we've got a 4 inch super amoled
screen nice blacks there now at the
bottom we have our Samsung logo with
capacitive buttons for menu home back
and search around the edges we have our
nice chrome bezel over here we have
volume buttons at a lanyard hole we have
a microphone hole and this little slot
to open the back over here's the power
button / lock button and it's it in a
really nice position because you can
hold it like this and just really easily
press it with your thumb you don't have
to like reach around press the top of it
that's kind of weird so really really
nice place for the power button the top
we have a 3.5 millimeter headset jack
and a microUSB port with a little
sliding door on the back you got your 5
megapixel camera no flash speaker and
Galaxy S logo a cool paint job they're
shiny now this is a same processors the
old vibrant 1 gigahertz 512
ram the 4g does come with 16 gig micro
SD card look at that when we open it and
of course it has hspa+ 4g for t-mobile
so it should be faster now let's try to
get this open pry it and here we have
our SIM card slot there's the microSD
card there you go and here's the battery
that is a little bit larger than the
vibrant it's got 16 50 milliamps per
hour whereas the old vibrant had 1500 so
there we go put this back on and that's
about it for Hardware on the samsung
galaxy s 4g do sums up if you like this
video that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
