better and there is no shortage of many
tablet smartphones for our pockets and
purses but as we start moving towards
the mid-range in terms of pricing what
can we do to balance some of those
potential compromises how do we deliver
that bigger display in a nice premium
feeling shell but while keeping prices
in check sony thinks they've found the
right formula for balancing those
compromises with the xperia x a2 ultra
and we've been putting this beast
through its paces so here's our full
review here we go folks a 6 inch 1080p
display 16 by 9 aspect ratio with Sony's
hallmark forehead and chin bezels
against another big screen champ we've
got similar heights this phone is a
little bit wider but overall we've got
very similar screen surface area when
compared against a phone like the Galaxy
Note 8 I think Sony has done a
remarkably good job of balancing thinner
side bezels against their traditional
blocky modern aesthetic and we get a
nice combination of materials here the
back does arrive in plastic but it
blends in really well with the aluminum
sides whatever they're using to paint to
coat this rear panel feels very similar
to the edges and overall does not feel
like a cheap flimsy plastic more a
higher-quality Polycarp it gives off a
great first week impression but we do
have some concerns over how this product
will age over time how this paint how
this coating will hold up against
scratches nicks bumps bruises and other
lifestyle abuse the crown jewel feature
we get a big bold LCD display but I have
found that in bright direct california
sun this screen can be a little hard to
read otherwise it's a well-executed
display with plenty of room for you to
get your work done if we needed another
reason to proclaim the death of the mini
tablet sony is giving us a great piece
of evidence to point to another critical
victory for this brand a rear-mounted
fingerprint sensor which works in the
United States
I prefer rear-mounted fingerprint
sensors on larger phones I think the
ergonomics how you unlock the
phone in your hand just works out better
you don't have to try and slide down to
some sort of bottom mounted home button
overall this is a more accessible
package for more people who are likely
to purchase a bigger phone now there are
a ton of different ways that we can
build a smartphone in this mid pack
priced here now Sony is balancing this
huge display against a lower powered
chipset instead of a Qualcomm 800 series
processor the XA to ultra is rocking the
Snapdragon 630 they might lack a little
horsepower but I am a fan of these lower
power chipsets
delivering a hearty balance of daily
lifestyle usage while sipping a lot less
battery UI performance is generally
smooth if a bit sticky with some heavier
multitasking and the phone is capable of
handling whatever media files you might
want to throw at it
including capturing 4k video again a
tightrope walk but using a less
expensive chipset may have helped Sony
budget for a beefier camera sensor the
rear shooter here is largely the same
hardware as what we'll find on a more
expensive Xperia - some of just the
fancier sensors and accessories but the
Snapdragon 630 just isn't powerful
enough to ramp up that really crazy 900
frame per second slow-motion burst
Sony's camera app covers the basics well
if it can still feel a bit intrusive at
time superior auto feels a little
anachronistic when compared against the
auto mode you might find on a pixel or
some of the AI processing you'll find on
a hallway it's certainly gotten better
over the last couple generations of
Xperia but even something as simple as
how you tap on the screen to focus and
that is a marker that the phone refers
to after you push the shutter button can
feel very unfamiliar personally I just
feel there are more pause points when
you're going to capture photos and
videos as you get acclimated to the
camera when you compare it against some
of its competitors but a happy addition
for selfie fans there are dual cameras
and an LED flash on the front face
reminding me of an experiment that I
absolutely loved on the LG v10 in the LG
v 20 we've got an ultra wide shooter if
you want to try and capture a group shot
we've got a more narrow field if you
just want a better portrait I think
that's a really handy option for people
capturing their memories capturing those
moments when out and about
now this forehead bez
is dedicated to camera tech so the
overall audio commentary here isn't
really much to write home about
there's a capable mono bottom firing
speaker it's plenty loud for
notifications and it sounds fine for
movies and games maybe you want to play
a little music or a podcast out of the
bottom of your phone we've about peaked
on mono bottom firing speakers so the XA
is a bad as well equipped as you would
expect the headphone game is a little
bit disappointing though we're always
happy to see a built-in 3.5 millimeter
jack it's way more convenient than
dongles and adapters if you already own
some headphones or some good earbuds you
plug them right in you're good to go
Sony built a reputation on being a
high-end multimedia consumer content
consumption company and this probably
won't satisfy folks who are looking to
drive nicer cans this hardware is
totally fine for sound tracking other
activities are taking phone calls but if
the activity you want to pay attention
to is listening to nice music on nice
headphones you're probably gonna want to
shop elsewhere and lastly that brings us
to battery life we've got a nice sized
capacity here but again this oversized
display drinks up more than its fair
share of juice testing a smart phone
like this can be a bit tricky
it's handily an all-day performer when
used for just covering the basics in
terms of smart phones communication
social media and under light use if I
really hyper mild as Beast I can get two
full day's problem is for how we
normally test these phones
it just doesn't synthetic benchmark very
well really driving the display hits
that battery harder so the numbers that
we get out of this for our video
streaming benchmark just don't feel
indicative of what you're likely to see
in day to day use Church times are also
a little bit slow even though this phone
support squall comes qc3 quick charging
charging this off of the included
adapter that came in the box not very
impressive performance here either so
that's enough rambling from me let's
wrap this up where's that leave us with
the Sony Xperia x8 ooh ultra there are
some obvious points on paper and a few
design elements which might scare away
some of the consumers considering a
bigger phone if you're watching this
video you're probably an enthusiast used
to a different kind of
me amid ranger conversation aka you
probably care a bit more about
horsepower than just having the biggest
screen you can at this price tear
considering where the markets moved on
to you probably can't buy a 1 plus for
example anywhere close to this price
anymore but there are other brands that
are including beefier processors in this
middle chunk of the market the XA 2
ultra doesn't do the best job of
competing against that kind of
conversation but I'm always happy to
discuss beefier battery life the appeal
of this phone is totally neat just as
when we went through some of those
experiments on devices like the Lumia
1320 but Sony does a good job of
delivering exactly what they set out to
do this phone lives up to the
manufacturing claims if you want a big
phone in a nice overall presentation and
you want to avoid some of the sticker
shock found on premium flagship grade
devices there aren't many gadgets that
can truly go toe-to-toe with what Sony
offers here as always folks thanks so
