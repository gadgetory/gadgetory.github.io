pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour of the highly anticipated samsung
omnia 2 now this device will see a
release on Verizon in the u.s. in a few
months and also see release on several
global carriers within the coming weeks
and months as well now this particular
model is a European import and it has
the UMTS 1900 band which is pretty rare
for a European device which means in
some parts of the United States where I
live
fortunately you will be able to get 3G
on ATT so I've been getting 3G actually
HSDPA at time this which has been quite
terrific to be able to have it on on
this device so let's talk about the case
that it comes with it's more of a pouch
than it is a case it has this strange
pattern on it that's not characteristic
of leather or anything else you see it
kind of looks like a zebra and on the
back there is a hole for the speaker and
let's slide it out and take a look at
the device the most stunning part of the
omnia 2 is the screen it uses AMOLED
screen technology and what that means
for you the end user is that the blacks
are more black the colors are brighter
and and more vivid and power consumption
is a little better if you want to see a
technical definition of what a AMOLED
screen does check out Wikipedia but in
terms of the end user it's all about
color clarity and power consumption so
let's zoom in onto the top here we'll
take a tour around the device so this
particular model has 8 gigabytes of
onboard memory the omnia 2 will also
come with 16 gigabytes so you can store
photos and movies and and lots of
documents if you do that kind of thing
we have a speaker here and then we have
a front-facing video camera if your
carrier supports it now what you can't
see behind here is a light sensor and a
proximity sensor the proximity sensor is
used to turn off the screen while you're
on a call while you're holding it up to
your face which again helps to save on
the battery life so the screen is 3.7
inches diagonal it's the biggest
resolution that Windows Mobile can
support which is 800 down and 480 across
the screen is indeed
very very crisp very clear the blacks
are super black the only problem with
the AMOLED screen is that if you take it
outside you'll notice a milky white
coating appear on the screen it makes it
difficult to see things the contrast is
greatly reduced and I guess that's just
a characteristic of AMOLED screens or
perhaps it's a flaw with house samsung
made there made their display let's take
a look at the buttons here on the bottom
which have a nice kind of brushed metal
look to them if you move it around in
the light we have a very large cost
start and call n key here and this
button in the center it's not a six way
d-pad as it may look it's actually a
button that launches the program
switcher cube which we'll talk about
later
it'll also launch the program menu item
and again we're going to go through that
in detail coming up soon on the software
to our review so zooming out a little
bit we'll go to the side of the device
where we have a volume rocker and what
looks to be a soft reset hole here going
on to the bottom we have the microphone
on the other side we have an OK button
which will actually close a program so
it's kind of convenient if you're just
tapping along like so and also a camera
button the dual action camera button for
the 5 megapixel camera we have a lock
button here it's also the standby button
and on the top we get a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack which is terrific plus
the M microUSB for charging and syncing
and transferring data now micro USB is
not as standard as mini USB but at least
it is a standard unlike Samsung's
proprietary Jack's which it looks like
they're not using anymore which is great
now if we go over to the back we have a
surface that is a total total
fingerprint magnet it has a 5 megapixel
camera up here in the upper left corner
with actually two flashes to make it
extra bright when you're taking a
picture of something in a dark area if
we take off the back of battery cover
and we can do so with sticking our
fingernail in the back here and opening
it like so we reveal the SIM card slot
and the battery which is 1500 milliamp
hours that's a pretty big size for a
device of this type without a slide-out
keyboard so we'll have to get back to
you on how this fares in terms of
battery life
so overall in terms of hardware it's
clear that Samsung has made a high-end
device here it feels very sturdy in hand
it brings a lot of things that people
ask for in a high-end device such as a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack it is FM
radio GPS Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G and pretty much all
those wireless radios that you expect in
a high-end device like this so we'll be
back soon with the software tour which
will actually be in two parts one part
we're going to talk about the home
screens because they totally changed how
the home screens act and in the second
software video we're going to go through
all the programs because Samsung is
heavily skinned Windows Mobile to the
point where you actually forget that
you're running windows mobile 6.1 so
we'll be back soon with more on the
samsung omnia 2 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
