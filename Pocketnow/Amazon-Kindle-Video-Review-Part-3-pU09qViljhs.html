pocketnow.com and this is part three of
the video review of the amazon kindle in
this review i want to talk about going
to the kindle store and actually buying
something and show you how long it takes
so right now i am connected via e video
i've got a full signal here in my
shooting area i'm going to press the
Search button in the bottom and you can
use the search button from where
whatever screen you're on right now I'm
in the middle of page on flags of our
fathers so I press search and then I get
a search field on the bottom bottom of
the screen I'm going to search for
Stephen King and you can kind of see the
delay so i'm typing ki ng it takes a few
seconds for it to register but that's
okay and then i'm going to press go here
and then you get kind of a thinking
indicator down here and it asks what do
you want to search you can search the
dictionary or Wikipedia or the web or
the kindle store and it also searches
your entire library so if you have a
book that already has Stephen King
listed in it maybe on one of the pages
or it's written by Stephen King it will
show up here which is pretty neat but I
want to go to the kindle store and i'm
going to click search kindle store for
stephen king and again you get the
thinking indicator down there and here
we are it's sorting by relevance right
now and you can change how it's sorted
so just like on amazon com you can
change by bestsellers or price or
anything like that so i'm going to find
a book that has a lot of stars let's see
this one has four and a half stars
called the mist i'm going to go and
select that okay gives you a synopsis
and then it gives you the rating with
the number of customer reviews and the
price it's usually seven dollars if you
order it as a print version but it's 559
if you order it on your kindle and to
read reviews you select reviews over
here on the right
and here we have customer reviews and
you get a little blurb and like on
amazon com you can click on it to get
the full thing so here this person gave
it a 5 5 out of 5 rating and here is
their entire review now let's say I want
to go back I've decided that I want to
buy the book or at least try a sample
and the great thing about the kindle or
the the kindle store is that you can buy
any books sample which is the first
chapter sometimes it's several chapters
before actually buying it so i'm going
to click back again to go back to the
buying page i'm going to go up to try a
sample and it says we are sending the
free samples it will automatically
appear in your home screen when the
download is complete so watch down here
it's done see that that was about four
seconds for the sample to download i'm
going to go to my home screen by
clicking the home button and there it is
right at the top the mist I'm ready to
start reading this here it is from the
beginning books really download very
fast now let me show you what wikipedia
looks like I'm going to search for
something I press the Search button i'm
going to type Civil War click go
okay see we have dictionary there's a
wikipedia
now using Wikipedia is a little strange
on the Kindle because the tendency is
for you to scroll down but wikipedia
doesn't or the kindle doesn't allow you
to scroll down you have to go page by
page you'll see what i mean in a second
so you get a status bar here on the
bottom it says eighty-five percent it's
going a little bit slow i'm surprised
okay here it comes it's formatted kind
of strange right now so I'm going to
click the next page button and see where
that takes me hopefully to an index yep
takes me to an index so I want to learn
about the let's see the tactics in the
Civil War so I click on that section and
I have two choices so I'm going to click
on tactics so using using the kindle to
browse wikipedia is not the most
comfortable experience but if you're if
you're waiting in a doctor's office or
you've got some time to kill and you
really want to learn something about a
subject or just read up on a topic then
it's not that bad it's not that bad it's
a little slow it's kind of hard to
navigate here we are with the tactics
and i'm going to change the text size
let's see if i can do that yeah i can
i'm going to make it smaller hopefully
see more on the page it's got a rear
ender
doo-doo-doo come on come on come on well
maybe it's already loaded I'm going to
click next page and see what happens
there it is net now it looks like
Wikipedia okay that's very readable and
if you click next page it should just
yep continues right down the page it's
really strange how this looks actually
not that bad all right that's it for
this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
