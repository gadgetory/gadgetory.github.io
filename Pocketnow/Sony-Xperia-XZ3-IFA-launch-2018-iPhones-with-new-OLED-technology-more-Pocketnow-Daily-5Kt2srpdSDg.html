with some nice changes and flashy
colorways apple is very interested in
many LED and micro LED technology and we
may see it in the next phones and the
ZTE axon 9 was finally released focusing
on multimedia and very good
specifications I'm Jaime Rivera and yes
I apologize for the lighting you know I
was gonna say that
I apologize for the noise as well but
we're here as show stoppers a Tifa it is
awesome this is the pocket out daily
powered by qualcomm the official news
today begin with some very interesting
deals where Spotify has this new feature
where of your student and you're
interested in Spotify Hulu and pretty
much Showtime premium this wealth you're
gonna end up paying $4.99 where the
combined amount that's pretty much more
than $30 if you do the math you learn
more about the deal in the description
it is definitely interesting
no it's talking about Casio they had
their event today at Aoife I actually
was not able to attend because of
another event we were going through
which there are videos coming up but
they're pro truck WS the f30 is now live
and I'll tell you this much it's just
this rugged as the previous ones it
brings some interesting new features
when it comes to mapping and downloading
data the only problem is when they tell
me that the product is not gonna go live
until January 2019 I was like what but
anyways now let's talk about the ZTE
axon 9 I was actually part of that event
our hands-on videos coming very soon
there are a ton of technologies that are
coming here starting from that dedicated
chip that they brought to the display in
addition to the fact that it can detect
the ambience and adapt to the display
depending on the lighting it's got the
clock of Snapdragon 845 great
specifications Dolby Atmos the audio I
tested it was really good again stay
tuned for our hands-on video it is
definitely something to look forward to
now let's start about Apple we have
heard rumors that the company is
considering things like micro LED and
that's been rumors for the past year now
we hear that the company is already
working with a Taiwanese firm in order
to be able to make that happen we're not
exactly sure when this technology is
going to make it to the next generation
iPhones
but it is definitely something to look
forward to considering power
efficiencies and just the benefits of
OLED being taken to the next level stay
tuned for that
and finally the hottest news today were
the surprise of the sony xperia x III i
was part of some of the event when it
comes to the headphones and the speakers
sadly i wasn't briefed on the xperia i
am looking forward to it the current
generations was a vacation squawk up
snapdragon 845 in addition to all the
bells and whistles some interesting
color options but probably the
disappointment was the lack of that 48
megapixel camera and today's question
let us know I mean what do you think
about Sony all the changes lately do you
think that the company is delivering on
its promise or do you think that we
deserve more innovation because in my
case honestly I wasn't expecting that
egg z3 until next year with that camera
but that's just me leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion we'd like to ask you to stay up
until the end of this video for a
message from our sponsor that allows
this video to be possible and yes that
you know that most of the mobile
technology that has enabled this
industry and even this video for the
past 30 years is powered by qualcomm
from modems that outperform competitors
and data speeds according to Okla ^ the
snapdragon 845 on the latest flagship
smartphones there is a reason why
today's top brands choose Qualcomm head
