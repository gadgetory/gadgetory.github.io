brought to you by D brand to buy the
best fitting skin for your phone or
tablet please visit D brand calm it's
the best iPhone ever but let's get down
to brass tacks and see what this smaller
iPhone 7 can really do first up for you
specs junkies not a lot has changed on
paper from last year's phone you can
pause the video here to get a quick
rundown on the hardware we're looking at
moving over to design we've all started
talking about Apple products like we
would purses or shoes new for this
season Apple makes a daring design move
that's right black is the new rose gold
honestly this is a pretty sharp look for
a phone and the better blended antenna
lines are appreciated it's a shame Apple
couldn't deliver that on the other color
options yet we have to question whether
a new color and a bit of sculpting
around the camera housing really does
constitute fresh design if an iPhone is
to be considered a lifestyle accessory
shouldn't Apple be working harder at
being a fashion vanguard something to
think about
I personally enjoy the satin finish on
the matte black better than the glossy
jet-black iPhone but this will still
pick up fingerprints like crazy what we
have here though is maybe the last true
premium small form-factor phone only
Apple this year seems interested in
providing hardware options for folks
with smaller hands checking out the
screen this is likely the best LCD we've
ever seen for color and brightness
though it still loses to AMOLED displays
for contrast the retina pixel density is
fine for day-to-day activities on the
screen size but folks who really like to
get their noses into their phones or are
interested in trying out some virtual
reality will likely be disappointed in
this 750 p resolution the new home
button isn't actually a button at all
and this personally might be my favorite
new feature as it addresses one of the
more common failure areas of previous
iPhones the tactile feedback here is fed
through the phone's vibration system
which can be customized and while it has
a funky feel at first it won't take
users long to acclimate manual buttons
on older iPhones already feel a bit
clunky we're also very happy to see
proper water resistance on this iPhone
rated ip67 the iPhone 7 should handily
survive being submerged in up to meter
water for up to 30 minutes the iPhone 7
suffered no issues after our pitcher of
water test here moving over to software
we've produced several videos on iOS 10
but as a quick recap this new version of
iOS brings better gesture and 3d touch
support a new control center is nicely
laid out but the brightness slider can
be easy to miss when on the move the new
Photos app is spruced up music has a
cleaner look with more options for
cultivating playlists and lastly
messages gets a huge update for
personalizing conversations with playful
transitions in new emoji we'd be remiss
if we didn't reiterate that some aspects
of iOS haven't aged well apples home
screen organization options feel limited
in this day and age and even on the
smaller iPhone keeping back buttons in
the upper corner can be a reach this
made sense on smaller iPhones but the
software just stayed like this to remain
familiar even as screen sizes increased
it's not necessarily ideal anymore from
an ergonomic standpoint and while Apple
has been improving support for 3d touch
there's still very little conveyance as
to which apps you can actually use with
the force press the newest version of
iOS on the newest Apple chipset is
always a tasty recipe for performance
though we occasionally do see some
subtle framerate drops when flinging
through the multitasking view apples 810
chipset benches like a monster and when
paired with such a low resolution screen
we also shouldn't be surprised that this
phone is a gaming champ except for the
battery life of course which we'll talk
about later in this review cellular
performance is good but generally around
my neck of the woods
reception fell slightly behind the
iPhone 6s maybe because these new
antenna bands have a little less surface
area maybe against the glass back
galaxies we see Apple fall even just a
little further behind what was
impressive though was to see how strong
Wi-Fi reception was during speed tests
of course Apple won't let you just see
Wi-Fi reception but moving is far from
my router as I could the iPhone could
consistently pull a faster download than
the galaxy s7 now moving over to
photography we have the most complete
examination of the iPhone camera
available online in our iPhone 7 plus
real camera review as a quick recap
we're happy to see a faster focusing
system a wider aperture and optical
image stabilization on the smaller
iPhone though the last two points mainly
seemed to benefit low-light
shots daylight photos and videos are
very similar to the 6s video is
high-quality though it's frustrating
that for a phone with stereo speakers
Apple still only delivers mono audio and
Apple still has one of the strongest
games around for fun features like HDR
and slow motion video though this app is
starting to feel old and limited against
some of the truly great camera software
found on competing devices we have a
whole separate video talking about the
camera app - which has proven to be
somewhat controversial with our audience
but the most controversial aspect of the
iPhone has to be the removal of the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack in favor of
moving to the lightning connector or to
a wireless solution moving the DAC off
of the phone and over to the included
adapter or ear pods results in slightly
lower quality output than last year's
phone from the built-in jack digital
output isn't particularly impressive
it's a little different than moving an
mp3 file over a USB cable you wouldn't
call a file transfer music at some point
you need to actually create analog
vibrations in the air which your ears
can hear and out of the box the iPhone 7
is a step backwards Apple was the gold
standard when CD quality was top dog but
they just sort of stayed there as
competitors caught up then surpassed
them improving the situation requires
buying more expensive accessories which
have their own signal processing
hardware and can only be used with the
iPhone bluetooth is certainly more
convenient than lightening headphones or
adapters but currently Bluetooth 4
simply cannot compete against a
traditional wired connection when
looking at phones from HTC or LG well
Apple followed Motorola here and we're
sure that more manufacturers will follow
them but at least if you own an Android
and invest in USB C headphones you could
still use those headphones with your
MacBook no such luck with Apple's ear
pods and Apple lost a headphone jack but
gained a speaker moving the stereo
output which is certainly a welcome
change when watching videos and playing
games two speakers bring louder
ringtones and alerts but to our ears
actual quality lands mid-pack at full
volume we rarely encountered bad
distortion but highs can be a bit shrill
for phone speakers we've got a nice
amount of bass but there's a dullness to
the upper mids which can sometimes make
the phone sound like it's
stuffy nose it's a valiant effort for
Apple's first stereo phone but even mid
Rangers like the Alcatel Idol 4s easily
give it a run for its money we can
always declare that Apple produces the
most power efficient handsets on the
market but they face androids with
larger batteries as brute force
responses this year the battery grows to
a 1960 milliamp hour cell over the
iPhone 6s is 1715 milliamp power
capacity but this is still well behind
the number of Android phones which are
breaking into 3000 milliamp hour
territory we can't get too excited about
this capacity increase though as the
iPhone 7 also packs a quad-core CPU two
whole extra cores over the iPhone 6s and
this seems to bring battery life in line
with last year's phone for most of our
synthetic testing the iPhone 7 falls
ever so slightly behind the 6s though in
daily use it'd be difficult to declare a
clear Victor running our media test
streaming 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 190 Lux the iPhone 7 drained 7%
of its battery draining more than the
galaxy s7 we've already produced a full
comparison between the galaxy in the
iPhone but we got several comments about
this battery test to expand on the
discussion we ran another test playing
30 minutes of Marvel future fight this
game is terribly optimized for Qualcomm
powered Android phones but it runs like
buttah on the iPhone the Galaxy has a
larger screen with three times more
resolution and we know that Samsung
bloat keeps a lot more software running
in the background the galaxy battery is
over six months old and I also made sure
to run a level where there was a lot of
white background to keep that AMOLED
display juiced up this comparison
basically hands every advantage we can
think of to Apple and yet after 30
minutes the galaxy drained 13 percent of
its battery and the iPhone was down 15
percent the galaxy s7 is less power
efficient but it's simply going to last
longer during the day with similar use
the smaller iPhone is really at its
strongest when it's not being used and
we don't mean that as a slight Apple
still maintains the best low-power mode
we've ever seen and this phone really
does seem to be built around the idea of
short bursts of activity not prolonged
use and the charging situation
isn't particularly impressive either
after 30 minutes on the included charger
we only topped off 26% and it's a shame
such a small battery paired with a
faster charger would be insanely fast to
recharge but we're still working with
the minimum Apple can include with a 650
dollar phone so let's wrap this up
where's that leave us with the iPhone 7
a few companies can generate an
emotional response like Apple can the
iPhone 7 is a good phone but for every
step forward we find with lifestyle
features there seems to be a step back
somewhere else trading pieces around in
many ways the iPhone 7 feels like a
lateral move from the iPhone 6s less
like a true successor perhaps closer to
an iPhone 6s II if you will if you're
rocking an iPhone 6s water-resistance
and stereo speakers are nice perks but
little else will separate the daily
experience from what you currently own
ignoring Android options the iPhone 7
actually finds itself in tough
competition from the revised 6s with
more storage for $100 less and folks who
like the iPhone 5 form factor can find a
bargain in the iPhone se and both of
those phones have better headphone audio
