and largest Windows Phone 8 device on
the market the other is a stalwart of
the Android space that needs no
introduction comparing them might be
impractical but we're gonna give it a
try anyway I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is Samsung ativ S vs
samsung galaxy s3 our comparison videos
spend some time focusing on comparing
specs app launch times benchmarks and so
forth with a video like this that's
impractical though the atif s runs
Windows Phone 8 and the galaxy s3 runs
Android and if you're hoping to see a
fight between these two os's tune out
now that's not what we're doing the
platform differences are extreme and if
you're a prospective buyer you've
already given thought to which ecosystem
you're signing up for that said there
are Hardware similarities here we can't
ignore so many that the achieve s is
unofficial nickname around these parts
is the galaxy s3 with Windows Phone so
for those few people still vacillating
between Windows Phone and Android or
those just curious about how different
or alike these devices really are let's
get a little nerdy and quickly
informally compare them in the three
areas we can build display and camera
in the metrics that matter these devices
are about as close to identical as you
can get the Verizon galaxy s3 weighs in
at 133 grams and measures eight point
six millimeters thick
while the atif s comes in at 135 grams
and eight point seven millimeters by
themselves those disparities are
imperceptible but the slight design
differences in these chassis x' mean the
phones are distinguishable in the hand
the galaxy s3 with its pebble like more
rounded corners feels less substantial
and its hyper glaze coated battery door
is very slick the atif s is still more
slippery than most phones but the
coating on its faux aluminum battery
door feels almost semi-gloss instead of
polished up front the displays on both
phones are covered by Gorilla Glass 2
button feedback on each device is
identical except for the HOME key which
is much less mushy on the Atif s than
the s3 despite these and other minor
differences like the galaxy s3 is big
notification light and the higher
placement of the power standby key on
the atif s the feel in hand is very
similar on these devices and aesthetic
concerns are likely going to be the ones
to dictate which one you prefer
under that gorilla glass to protective
layer sits an identical panel on each
device a 4.8 inch Super AMOLED display
at 720 by 1280 resolution this is one of
the most concrete examples of the
differences or lack thereof between
these two devices while the disparate
interfaces make these screens look
different under certain conditions and
the achieve s is less granular
brightness controls mean it always
features the brighter screen hopping
into a browser session with some test
patterns reveals that these displays are
indeed a perfect match in color display
and gradients from the highly saturated
colors to the deep blacks common to
AMOLED these screens are one in the same
that holds true for the camera hardware
as well other news sources have said
that these devices use the same optics
for their primary shooters and that
looks to be all but confirmed in our
brief testing of course you'll get more
customization options with the wider
array of photo editing software
available on the Google Play Store but
that's a gulf that Windows Phone will
hopefully close over time from a stock
perspective though the galaxy s3s camera
comes with much more utility bundling in
features like burst shot HDR smile shot
and so forth all features unavailable or
requiring a third-party app on Windows
Phone so despite the identical hardware
the galaxy s3 still comes out on top in
the camera department
taking the OS platforms out of the
equation these are indeed very similar
devices with their primary
differentiators lying principally in
their aesthetics if you're on the fence
between Windows Phone and Android
there's not much here in the physical
world to make your choice easier between
these two devices the tie breaker will
have to take place in the virtual world
of software
we've got a whole lot more on the atif s
over at pocketnow.com including an
unboxing and hardware tour a comparison
with the lumia 920 and of course the
full review we also discussed the Atia
vests in depth on the pocket now weekly
podcast and Jaime Rivera covers it
almost every day on the pocket now daily

you don't miss any of that pocket now
