let's just say he got a lot less than
expected
the always connected PC went light today
and we might be able to hook you up with
one very soon
it looks like Samsung already set a date
for the Galaxy Note 9 unpacked event I'm
Jaime Rivera and what was your highlight
for the weekend because I spent it
making one of my favorite videos of all
time stay tuned for that this is
PocketNow daily what I love about events
is obviously competition pushing things
around with deals if you're in the
market for the Google pixel to excel
it's $150 off you also get a Google home
Mini and if you're in the market for the
pixel book I still find it expensive but
it's still $250 off you can learn more
in the description now copy Texas on its
way and a soos has just announced a ton
of crazy stuff one of the coolest ones
being the ROG phone mail to figure out
that name but the coolest part
this device maxes the clock speed of the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor 22.96
in Gertz it's actually a record and
we've got crazy specs eight gigs of ram
512 gigs of storage maximum a four
thousand milliamp hour battery and there
are other bells and whistles you can
learn more in the description as well
now let's talk about the always
connected PC that also went live today
my advice to you go to a Microsoft Store
and have a look the HP Envy x2 and also
the asustor Nova go go live today I've
actually had one to play with over the
last couple of days there's a video
coming soon
over my impressions so far I'm very
impressed with the Qualcomm Snapdragon
835 and we actually apparently will have
a device to give away stay tuned for the
rules it's really worth it
now according to Bloomberg those of you
waiting for the galaxy note 9 from
Samsung sent your calendars for August
9th as apparently that's going to be the
day where we're getting the unpacked
event we don't know exactly when it's
gonna be a lot earlier than Aoife which
is sad I actually was expecting to see
it in Berlin but yeah Galaxy Note 9
can't wait to see what we get and
finally the hottest the news today let's
call it the hottest because I don't know
man
WWDC happened today we get Mac OS Mojave
we get iOS 12 Apple confirmed they're
not merging they're providing tools in
order to be able to help you port
applications between operating systems
easier watch OS 5 has some enhancements
in addition to TV OS most important with
iOS 12 there were changes to AR in
addition to other bells and whistles
probably the one I loved the most was
the whole feature of how do not disturb
is finally being able to do what I've
wanted it to do the most which is be
able to help you schedule when you want
the phone to not disturb you in more
productive ways as I don't want to be
getting all those notifications and the
company is getting a little more
granular on this we will let you know
more as soon as we have a look at it as
it should be available to developers
very soon let us know in the comments
what do you think about WWDC were you
impressed or not because I considered it
a snoozefest honestly I felt that a
little hardware would have made it
better but Apple was clear at the
beginning only software and that's what
we got leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends

earlier flow wasn't finding out on
