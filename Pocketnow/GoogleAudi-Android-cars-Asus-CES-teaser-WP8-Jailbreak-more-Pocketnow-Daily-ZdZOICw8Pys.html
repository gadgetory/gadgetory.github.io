Android a quick vehicle for CES 2014
asustas is diverse to my solutions for
CES as well and believe it or not there
apparently is a jailbreak for windows
phone 8 in the works I'm hi Mary better
and just as you i am going to take a
couple of days off with this whole new
year's thing because i'm probably gonna
be wasted this is pocket now daily well
if we came here for official news the
problem is that for the holidays that's
kind of a tough one man well all we've
got is teasers for CES let's start it
off with Samsung the company is
apparently planning to bring us another
64-bit chip and the reason when I say
another is because the X in 06 is
already in the works X is typical 64-bit
arm-based chip but apparently the
company is working on the X and O's s
which is a custom-made 64-bit chip that
is apparently going to bring some unique
features that we still don't know about
obviously they have to announce them
first so stay tuned we'll keep you
posted at CES and speaking of 64-bit
chips these are kind of pointless right
now in the iphone 5s and iPad air if you
don't really have extra ram to take
advantage of that extra computing power
and as it turns out it seems that Sam
say is also working on bringing those
different RAM chips to take advantage of
this we're talking about 8 gigabyte
chips that are in the works apparently
these are also going to be the news at
CES we still don't know if we're
actually getting a phone that's powered
by these immediately but stay tuned they
gigabytes of ram that'll be the day and
speaking of CES issues has already begun
teasing their event and well their ad is
called what number are you and what we
have in this ad is a lot of balls
rolling around with the number four five
and six so apparently the reason why
this is is because they're teasing that
we're gonna have a four inch of 5 inch
in a six inch phone we're just waiting
for the company to also power these
phones in the same way so that you don't
feel that you're buying a mid to your
phone with the four-inch phones a stay
tuned CES will tell us everything will
definitely be covering the event live
and I've been repeating the word pun
soul over and over again just to not
forget it because the next news are from
Windows Phone as we've got this Chinese
dev team called on Seoul and the idea is
that they have already jailbroken Lumia
920 and we can see this because there is
a video showing us the device running a
third row of tiles which we know that is
currently available for only 1080p
devices so stay tuned as a pair
they are building an app store just like
cydia we just don't know when they're
planning on doing so and hopefully we
won't be getting apps there at least and
finally for the hot news of the day
probably one of the biggest teasers for
CES 2014 is google and audie
collaborating on building an Android
equipped car and no this is not a
self-driving car yet though they are
actually working on that they're
building one that brings us
entertainment and information so
apparently obviously the android based
operating system will just interact with
you and some sort of entertainment
system we just don't know exactly what
we'll get but that leads me to the
question of the day what would you like
this android equipped vehicle to do for
you because in my particular case if
they can figure out a bill google now
into that connected to the internet
permanently and make my phone even
smarter than i would really like that
especially if they give that to me for
free but leave us a comment down below
what would you want and friends you know
