Sony Xperia z2 and we are taking a look
at what it does and what it doesn't in
the short hands-on video well we have
the screen off we'll just take a look at
the exterior aspect of the phone it
looks strikingly like the Xperia z2 it
has the same sandwich glass built two
layers of glass between actually I
should say aluminium between two layers
of glass but this one does not inherit
the IP 55 and 58 ratings this is of
course the special finger print edition
which is the black edition of the phone
I'm just kidding nearly four point eight
inch screen on the front which is a qHD
resolution of 540 x 960 underneath which
we will find the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400
processor clocking in and 1.2 gigahertz
and while we were talking about the
display even though it's a qHD smaller
resolution display on a four point eight
inch screen we're glad to see that Sony
I'm not sure this goes through nicely in
the recording but has definitely
improved the viewing angles which was a
great problem back in the initial Z days
helping the processor is one gigabyte of
ram 8 gigabytes of storage which are
expandable via the micro SD card and
this phone also has a dual sim variant
and also LTE capabilities for network
operation it also inherited the focus
shutter release button and that
signature powering on button flipping
through the back there's an 8 megapixel
camera LED flash and I've see Sony
Xperia brandings and as I mentioned in
the beginning of this video this one is
not submersible this one is not
dustproof so what you see is what you
get don't go diving with this taking a
quick look at the software will try and
find a Settings icon which is right here
flipping all the way down to the about
phone we have angry for that free unlike
for that 42 which is on the Xperia z2 of
course with Sony's proprietary user
interface which is very fluid even on
this lower end device let's go quickly
into the camera application long holding
the button right there it's a bit slow
to start we are seeing the same layout
as on the z2 with the modes superior
auto mode manual mode of course all the
social modes you have to read our Z 1
and Z 1 s reviews to find more details
out about each and everyone of this
until we get also this phone in our labs
you have to deal with this short video
which is just a quick demonstration and
hands-on of the Sony Xperia m2 I've been
Anton Hannah behind the camera it's
still in verse that amount sony booth
thank you very much for watching stay
tuned for much much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
