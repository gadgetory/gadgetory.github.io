pocket now Tony behind the camera here
at mwc we just checked out the PadFone
here at the ax Sue's booth now it's time
to check out the fonepad let's take a
look so first one taken a little
hardware tour here this is the phone pad
and this is a source is new either
7-inch tablet or mega sized phone you
can see the earpiece called out up here
this can be used for voice calls which
I'll demo in just a second this we're
going to come across to the back here
first of all this is the titanium
outside team this is a champagne gold
version this device also available in a
titanium gray depending on your tastes
and you'll notice the most notable thing
down here is the intel inside logo it's
because this is powered by an Intel Atom
z2420 cpu clocked at 1.2 gigahertz and
if we go ahead and pop the top cover off
we can see by the way that's backed up
by a gig of ram 16 gigs of storage and
that is augmented via microsd up to an
additional 32 gigs of memory there's
your micro sim slot for all your
cellular connectivity needs pop that
back on in addition to cellular we've
got 80 to point 11 BGN bluetooth 3.0 no
camera on the back but there is a camera
on the front and that is a 1 point 2
megapixel unit the battery life is being
quoted at nine hours I don't have a
milliamp hour rating I think it's a
little bit north of 4200 but don't quote
me on that yet and there's that display
this is a 1280 x 800 wxga resolution
display with 10 finger capacitive touch
and there you can see the issues skin
subtle in some areas not in others as
Android for dot one dot two so if you
hop in the launcher you'll notice that
is almost a I mean that's actually is a
stock experience it's almost
indistinguishable from a nexus 7 say you
come back here you see some of the
Seuss's widgets including my favorite
the little foam pad charge indicator a
little more impressive on the PadFone
maybe but we're still pretty cool here
little male indicator the clock but
really really when you notable when your
drop-down notifications right this is
entirely different obviously very very a
sous and also when you say fire up a
text message here which by the way it
can be just a
regular old SMS because this is a phone
and you notice the different keyboard
there that issue says is thrown on here
you're just talking about the feeling
hand a little bit since we've had our
hands on a couple 7 and 8-inch tablet so
far this the metal backing does feel
pretty good in the hand it actually
calls to mind a lot of other
aluminum-clad have phones in particular
just because of its size we've got you
can't really can't really see too much
of it under here but you have the
speakerphone here low early mounted
headphone jack I mean it feels it's
definitely in the same family as the
nexus 7 just by virtue of its size and
because there are only so many ways to
make a 7-inch tablet but the metal feel
in hand is it feels good but I'm not
entirely sure I'd want to throw this
down on countertops quite as freely as I
do the Nexus 7 just because I feel like
this is going to get scratched up a bit
more than then a rubber backed device
but I'd certainly priced correctly and
one feature at at least one feature it
doesn't have that you can't find out the
Nexus 7 is that top mounted earpiece
which if we kind of bring it up from the
head here you can see what it looks like
in case you're wondering in case you
don't live in an Asian market where this
is what this is common this is what the
fonepad looks like against your head not
sure I could live with it but if it is
something that that interests you this
is definitely device to have a look at
especially considering its pricing which
is fairly aggressive for a device in
this price range i believe it's around
249 so anyway just a quick look the
issues phone pad here at the sous booth
at mwc 2013 will have a bit more on this
device going forward but for now michael
fisher with pocket now that's Tony
behind the camera thanks for watching
we'll talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
