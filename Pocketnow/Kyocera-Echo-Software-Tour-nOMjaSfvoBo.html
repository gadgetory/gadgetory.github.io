pocketnow.com and this is a software
tour of the kyocera echo first dual
screen android smartphone that happens
to be on Sprint let's get to it so in
the previous video we talked in detail
about how the dual screen configuration
works how you can actually get once one
app on one screen another app on the
other screen and use two apps at the
same time we'll put an annotation up on
the video right here now but if you want
to watch this video first we'll put the
annotation back on the video at the end
so you can jump back to take a look at
that because it's pretty important to
understanding how this device works so
in this video we're going to talk about
settings built-in applications overall
experience of the device and we've got
the final review coming up soon on
pocketnow.com now of course you can use
the kyocera echo in the single screen
mode like so but what's nice is that
when you open up the second display the
screen comes out of standby so you don't
even have to unlock it so it's going to
turn on in a sec here we go and it ships
with the android 2.2 basic default
launcher which is kind of boring so i've
installed launcher pro here just to see
if third-party launchers will work with
the echo and fortunately they do so
we've got launcher pro here it works
very well even the the specific widgets
work they scroll nicely so so ADW
launcher and the other launchers that
you might use to replace stock android
will work but you have to get a special
application called tablet mode extension
in order for it to work so if we scroll
down a little bit we should see it down
what they want to do that should see it
down here tablet mode extension here it
is it's a quick little app that you
download from the android market and it
allows you to scale a nap across both
screens even a launcher if you turn this
off it doesn't work so you might as well
leave it on I can't find it in the
background processes so it doesn't seem
to be taking up any ram to run now take
a note of the battery thirty-eight
percent and start the timer now we're
going to kind of keep an eye on the
battery life how much it declines every
minute I'm not going to cut out the
video so it's just going to be a
continuous play here okay so let's jump
into the program list here the app tray
and talk about some things that we have
here we've got battery use kyocera
actually has brought that forward
they're just linking to the setting
which allows you to see what is using
the most battery life naturally on the
kyocera echo you're powering two screens
display is going to be at the top this
device was did it sitting idle for about
24 hours which is why cell standby is
thirty percent and display is
twenty-five percent in terms of battery
life if you keep this on automatic
screen brightness you should get through
almost today but probably not it really
depends on how much you're using the
tablet mode if you use it in single
screen mode you'll definitely get
through a day if you're using the tablet
mode a lot you're going to have to carry
around that extra battery that comes
with the echo so if we go over here to
display I've got auto brightness turned
off because for the sake of this video I
had to boost the screen brightness
turning on auto screen brightness just
makes the screen way too dim although it
really helps to conserve battery life it
has a light sensor so when you go
outside the screen gets bright it gets
visible one of the problems with the
echo is that if you're wearing polarized
sunglasses you can't see the screen
which is pretty annoying so I'm going to
turn back turn off auto screen
brightness you can see where we are
right now so we're at about seventy-five
percent so keep that in mind when you
are looking at the battery meter when we
go back to the home screen and check
that out okay so let's go back here in
settings not much to talk about in here
we can go to SD phone card storage we
can see that with the 8 gigabyte class 2
micro SD card we're getting about 7.5
gigabytes of space which is good because
the device only has about 408 around 500
megabytes of usable memory before you
install programs and things like that so
it's nice that it comes with a microSD
card although you'd be hard-pressed to
find a device these days without it you
can sideload applications which is nice
so you can check off install
applications from unknown sources that's
a good thing let us jump back to the
program list here some things we want to
take a look at if we go into echo top
apps it's going to take us to this
website it was already loaded
which tells you about the tablet mode
extension which is a must if you have
the echo and then it shows you these
featured apps and you're thinking to
yourself okay these apps must work in
dual screen mode right only if only a
few apps will be able to run
simultaneously like the web browser for
example and all of these apps as we
talked about in the last video so i went
ahead and i downloaded one of these apps
thinking that uh oh maybe one of these
games will work simon in the simulcast
mode but no so the game i downloaded i
pay two bucks for this and i'm going to
get a refund at the end of this video
because it's horrible is called shopping
and if i do the double tap nothing
happens and the graphics are horrible so
it's and the sound is horrible too so I
want gotta wonder why kyocera is
advertising these horrible apps that
don't even work in the dual screen mode
my guess is that there are no other apps
that work in the dual screen mode
besides the ones that come stock on the
device which is a shame but the sdk is
out there for developers that want to
make their apps Amal task capable we're
probably not going to see any the
kyocera is echo is just one device so
let's go back in here and take a look at
the the app list so a lot of these apps
are all of them will work in tablet mode
very nicely so here we have the calendar
we can go to you know a month view or
that's not right go into a month you
over here and it looks great it scans it
scrolls to both displays just fine as do
most applications that you'll find even
third party apps on the kyocera echo
here's an entry HD games it's taking you
to a game loft website which will
presumably show you some HD games but
we're not terribly interested in that
let's go down a little bit more so some
advertising here get named Koh games I
don't really need that to be in my
application tray if I want named Koh
games I'll go to the market and get them
we've got the sprint stuff we've got
sprint and a scar here on the kyocera
echo and it has problems authenticating
the device because probably
signed up for that we've got sprint TV
here a lot of sprint stuff of course if
we go over here or if we can have to put
it into portrait mode it's going to
download sprint TV from the market and
of course you've seen this before it
allows you to watch on demand TV or rent
a movie although it will cost you cancel
that or it's going to install in order
to use the service see what else we have
here the phone application is
interesting it doesn't have quick dial
unfortunately so as we talked about in
the last video if you're trying to call
Brandon and you want to be our a do it
just it doesn't pull up the contact
which is kind of annoying and this is
one of the apps that works in simultext
so we can pull up say YouTube on the
bottom while the phone is on the top and
there you can see it coming through
weren't actually not going to go through
with that we've got sprint football live
sprint radio a lot of spritz stuff
TeleNav gps navigator of course you can
use the built in google maps navigation
for free it comes with the sim 3 where
the sims 3 but you actually have to
download some content in order to get
that working and that's pretty much it
there's not that much on here which is
kind of a good thing we get the standard
sprint stuff but we get a little bit
less crap where than we would get with
an AT&amp;amp;T device which is always nice
device performance we're going to show
you full benchmarks when we do the four
of you on pocket now device performance
is good it snappy but it is a little bit
bulky at times it has frozen to the
point where I take the battery out put
it back in applications launch pretty
speedily web browsing performance could
be a lot better let's go to
pocketnow.com we'll go to the desktop
version after it loads kind of a graphic
intense web page with some flash content
I've got it set to ask to turn on
plugins so it's not going to actually
load the Flash content and it's a big
bummer you don't get multi-touch in the
browser and they do that because if
you're pressing with two fingers on the
display you're probably trying to bring
up the simultaneous try it again
up came up then it went away real quick
so now so here's an example of where
it's really not very responsive so I did
this I'm there it is about five seconds
later right so I hit the back button and
it still guess it's done loading so just
so I just flicked on the page nothing
happened it might freeze right now if
we've too many windows open okay um so
yeah it is uh here's an example of where
it just it's not stable I would have to
take the battery out I'll be right back
and we're back after resetting the
device taking the battery out and
putting it back in and unfortunately
that's happened several times during our
test period hear the echo doesn't seem
to be the most stable device out there
unfortunately it feels a little bit
unfinished unfortunately and I guess
that's that's what you get in these
types of situations so we're at thirty
six percent battery life it's been a
little bit over two minutes so we're
doing it about one percent per minute
but I've seen it go down as high as
three percent per minute which is insane
when you're doing simulcasting with to
web pages and the screen brightness is
not on automatic so you can really burn
through battery really quickly in
certain situations on the kyocera echo
so that was a quick look at the software
we're going to have a full review coming
up on pocketnow.com we're going to talk
in detail about battery life and
performance and all those other things
in terms of the the basic software
offering it's good that we don't get a
lot of crap we're but the device
definitely could be faster and it should
never crash I mean android is a mature
product by now and it shouldn't become
unstable to the point where you have to
take the battery out so if you like this
video please give it a thumbs up and
again we're going to put up that
annotation of the previous video where
we talk in depth about how the simulcast
feature works it's really interesting
and actually that part of the phone is
quite innovative so take a look at that
video and thanks for watching that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
