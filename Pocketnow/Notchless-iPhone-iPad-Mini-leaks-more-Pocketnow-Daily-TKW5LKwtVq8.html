is on track into helping us get notch
less iPhones eventually some new iPad
Mini leaks have emerged confirming some
rumors and the bunking others and if you
still want a mate 20 Pro hold on because
Huawei is launching some more color
options I'm Hani Metairie bed I
reporting from show stoppers at CES I
apologize for the microphone this is all
Jules's fault let's get through the news
this is pocket out daily the official
news today are on the channel and on
Instagram as most of our coverage from
CES 2019 is there I'm trying to make the
daily more about everything else we
didn't cover like for example Xiaomi
there are rumors of the company is
working on its new pair of air pods or a
competitor they look a lot like air pods
in the design they have some minor
enhancements that actually in my opinion
make them better but even better if I
should say that again $65 is apparently
the price tag we'll see if it happens
now how about if we talk about the
Samsung Galaxy has nine as we've got
some new benchmarks and they are hot
particularly because well it's called
the Galaxy S 10 light one of them but
the benchmarks say Snapdragon 85 six six
of ram 128 gigs of storage 3100 milliamp
hour battery that is not light at all
let's see if it happens now it's talking
about Huawei set your calendars
apparently the company is working on two
new color options for the May 20 pro
those of you that are in the markets of
Iowan I would highly suggest you wait it
out a little cuz apparently we've got
fragrant red which I like and then
comment blue coming up now the price tag
is barely gonna go up a little bit by
like $150 but that's just rumors we'll
keep you posted on that one as well
and for those of you in the market for
buying iPads I have told you don't buy
yet and that's because we're waiting for
a new iPad Mini we've got some leaks of
the shell of the back it seems of the
design mimics a lot of the iPad air 2 or
the entry-level iPad it seems that there
is a cutout antenna for LTE which is
great now the time frame is what we
don't have but we will also look into
that as well and finally the hottest
news today have to do with iPhones and a
company called AMS which is an apple
supplier that apparently figure
a way to reduce the size of the knotch
and what the company is doing is
actually adding some of the sensors to
the back of the glass it seems that
they've figured out some algorithms in
order to allow them to put for example
the RGB sensor behind the glass in
addition to the IR sensor which is great
but in today's question let us know I
mean what do you prefer do you prefer a
smaller notch which we've already seen
from other companies like oneplus or do
you prefer Apple to figure out some
other solution because in my case
honestly whatever the company does to
remove the notch will be great for me
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
