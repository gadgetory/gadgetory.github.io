five galaxies as sin variance instead of
four in the following months new renders
in specs of the regular Huawei P 30 show
us that it's a very good phone and we
get some weird very weird renders of
iPhones or what they could look like I'm
Jaime Miller Yvette I'm reporting from
CES we've already got videos live it's
been kind of crazy
this is pocket out daily obviously CES
is all about official news we already
have videos from Huawei from Samsung
from LG with their new gram laptops it's
been pretty much laptop day-to-day we've
also gotten more videos coming up some
of them are still private we will be
showing them once we're allowed to and
they go live tomorrow so again follow
the playlist a lot of this stuff is
really cool now it's not about boe the
company is showing off a foldable
display that we're actually looking for
here at the sands Expo a lot of stuff is
still being built so it's kind of hard
to find places right now but most
importantly it seems that Huawei will be
using their display technology which is
rather thin we will keep you posted of
that happens all right but over the
weekend we saw something that's got
everybody's skeptical some iPhone
renders from the back that came from
mice universe and I just have to say
either there's a reason why camera
lenses are asymmetrical or there's also
a reason why this is horrible but it's
not the first time we've seen so many
cases where iPhones look terrible on you
know renders and everything and then in
the end they look better so we'll keep
you posted what ends up happening we're
still very far from iPhones being
launched now let's talk about Huawei
we've got some CAD renders of the Huawei
p30 and well even though the design
looks slightly different to what we
currently see with the p20 Pro if you
look at the camera specifications and
just about everything in the internals
it's pretty much a p38 p20 pro with a
better processor whatever the case may
be obviously Huawei has been doing a lot
when it comes to photography and the pea
lineup is it's oh wow I can't wait to
see that p30 pro and finally the hottest
news today have to do with Samsung and
five variants of the galaxy s 10 I was
about to say three but yeah we've got
three that are apparently pretty much
almost official the light the regular
and the plus
but then we see two other code names
beyond X and bolt we obviously know that
at least one of these is going to be the
5g variant but five phones I mean let us
know in the comments what do you think
what do you think these other two phones
are gonna be about do you think it's
just gonna be 5g
or do you think there's something else
because in my case I think that's we're
probably just gonna get one more skew of
5g but let us know in the comments down
below and also let us know what you
would like to see from CES 2019 friends
