will lift the band for Huawei and US
companies to work together but notice I
said it looks like Samsung claims that
they rushed the Galaxy fold and are now
testing it and going through a recovery
period and for those of you that had
high hopes that the iPhone designs might
change we've got some CAD renders that
say otherwise I'm high matter Iveta
and yes this is the horrible face of jet
lag but we're back in the studio that's
a good thing
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals because yeah
we're pretty much almost the prime day
and you know that things go crazy with
Amazon in that particular way but for
those of you in the market for Amazon
speakers and I actually just I read the
script that I'm like yeah I actually do
want one there currently 57 percent off
depending on which model you pick I'm a
huge fan of the echo I have to admit so
I do recommend them you can learn more
about them in the description now let's
talk about the future of Android Beam
which we know is dying on Android Q and
for those of you that we're wondering
exactly what sort of an alternative we
have apparently there will be a fast
share service that's coming to Android
and even to iOS and the whole idea is
that just like airdrop works where the
connection begins through bluetooth and
then sends the file through Wi-Fi
apparently that's exactly the way that
this service from Google is going to
work so stay tuned for that I'm really
looking forward to that but obviously
the biggest question is fragmentation so
many phones that are not going to have
Android q and I just I hope that it's
not dependent on Q for that to work now
for those of you that did not like the
design of iPhones with that stove in the
back and everything we've been covering
so many rumors and apparently they are
going to stay the way they are we've got
some CAD renders from trusted sources
and we even reported that there was a
possibility that we didn't have a camera
hum for the stove in the back apparently
that's not going to be the case of you
look at these renders you could totally
see that there is a design for the
protrusion and it's I know it's I feel
that it's gonna look horrible
oh my god I yeah a lot of people are
already speculating that it's because
Johnny I was leaving in whatever the
case it could be I don't know man but
this looks
now let's move the spotlight over the
Samsung and the Galaxy fold for those of
you wondering about the future of this
product the company's mobile CEO DJ code
just came on record and pretty much
confirmed he feels he rushed the galaxy
fold to the market they're currently
testing it and I like that in his whole
statement and in the interview that he
conducted he was pretty much clear that
he's thankful to reviewers for being
able to discover so many things right
now apparently if the 2,000 devices are
being tested with all the changes that
they've been working on they've
discovered more things and they're
expecting to launch it pretty soon but
he doesn't provide dates or speculation
over how whoo I don't know how close we
are to that possible launcher stay tuned
I'm really looking forward to it I
missed the galaxy fold and I hope that
they figure things out and for those of
you wondering about the future of Huawei
we've got a lot to talk about yes I know
their word news over the weekend we
covered some of it on the recap we're
gonna continue here dates for the huawei
mate X or the May 30 for example are now
emerging apparently there is a
possibility that the made X is going to
launch in September we hear them 8:30
with a launch until December but here's
a thing because the source of the news
is pretty much everything that's
happening with 5g in Russia we're
assuming that it's the 5g variant of
them 830 that's going to launch until
December and that we get to make 30 at
some point within the fall which is when
usually the mate lineup gets refreshed
whatever the case may be stay tuned as a
obviously the mate X particularly is the
one device that's got a lot of us crazy
and finally the hottest news of the
weekend have to do with the Trump
administration the g20 and his statement
over the future of Huawei and how
relationships are going to continue
between the United States and this
company here's the thing there was a lot
of information on the news over yes
the u.s. is lifting the ban on Huawei
well it continues being in the entities
list so it's going to take some time but
the thing about it is the statement from
the Trump administration from President
himself is really what spread the news
according to the Washington Post the
POTUS will be meeting with the US
officials to
the pressure on the huawei ban however a
formal lift on the ban has not happened
at the g20 summit
he said that companies will still supply
Huawei with their products as he claims
that they are not a threat to the US and
the advancements in Silicon Valley are
great when asked about selling Huawei
products in the United States he said
they would have to save that for the end
the g20 summit is still happening and a
lot of negotiations are going on not
only about Huawei so we will update you
on whatever things happen thing is and
today's question obviously is I just
reported we have the May 30 coming up
the mate X the biggest question is I
mean if the ban lifts would you buy a
huawei product after everything that's
happened or are you skeptical because in
my case I mean this is proof I mean if
they're lifting the ban then I wouldn't
worry I'm actually even considering that
the reviews that I had pending for
huawei I should start working on them
again after everything that's happened
but there's no if you want to see these
reviews and your thoughts over if you
would buy a huawei product or not going
forward leave us a comment down below
