proactive Syrian multi-window support
apple watch OS who also gets announced
giving developers more teeth with
applications and apple music also makes
the scene with a terrible performance by
Drake I'm hi Mary that I am yeah let's
face it this is the WWDC 2015 edition of
the parkin out daily
yes this is official news base running
with OS 10 and Capitan or El Capitan as
they were saying at the event Apple has
made some minor improvements to the
operating system but these improvements
are actually very cool starting with
Safari tabs which are now going to be
smart you can actually pinned them to
your tabs and have them available to you
in a way to make favourites better but
probably the coolest feature is major
improvements to Mission Control where
you can now tile windows side to side
which was terrible in OS 10 still is and
the fact that you can actually use
Mission Control in order to be able to
move from one application to the other
and actually create these tiles on
different separate windows there are a
lot of again not very major enhancements
of OS 10 but this update is gonna be
free and it's definitely cooler than
Yosemite another major announcement
today was Apple music the acquisition of
beats music just became official and
well this is an application that pretty
much works like Spotify and the fact
that i'll charge you ten dollars and
value stream music but the cool thing
here is that for example number one the
family package only costs five dollars
more compared to spotify which this cost
five dollars more but only gives you two
users whereas apple music gives you six
that's crazy but in addition to that we
get dedicated radio stations we get
curated playlists it seems we also get
the option for artists to connect with
listeners which is really interesting
new artists have a new platform to show
off their music as well a lot of things
that we would like to test before we
judge we also get watch OS 2.0 for the
Apple watch and these updates are major
particularly because you are getting
native applications now these
applications don't necessarily have to
be just the representation of what's on
the phone which is great that'll mean
that the apps will be faster once they
get updated but for example this native
application support allows a third-party
developers like the fitness area to use
health kit in addition to your heart
rate sensor in addition to a lot of
things there is Siri integration there
are a lot of really cool things coming
to watch OS to one of them being for
example the fact that you can now get
third-party options for watch faces not
as
early to get more watch phases but for
them to tinker the watch face and give
you more options to select so yeah a lot
of things that we will be testing in a
video very soon and we did get some
minor updates that are pretty major like
for example new transit services for
Apple maps were Apple maps will be smart
enough to detect how long will take you
to commute to a train and then if you
will arrive to the Train on time in
addition we also get enhancements the
Apple pay it now goes international and
yeah we also get Apple wallet now
because that's the way passbook is going
to be main going forward again minor
updates that were really substantial
particularly in Apple maps and finally
for the very hot news of the day the
biggest update was iOS 9 we thought it
was going to be conservative but no it's
not particularly with Siri now it gets a
lot smarter than it was you can tell
start to show you the photos of your
recent trip to Utah it'll give you a
filter of just those photos which is
awesome but yeah it gets a little more
like Google now but better you can slide
to the left you get your frequent
contacts you get the information of the
place that you're in right there and you
also get other data that you can add and
obviously developers will be able to
tinker with this because there is now a
search api for this but yes sir he gets
a lot smarter but that's not it we get
multi window support on the ipad and in
a very cool way except for the fact that
it only works on the ipad air 2 at least
the bigger part of the snapping to lure
you can't i'll windows from side to side
there are other options like sliding
your notes from one side and stuff like
that again other things that are really
cool but that is not it we get a new
notes application a new news application
from Apple and the list is just so vast
that I would rather you read it on the
links in the description but it does
lead me to the question of the day what
do you think about iOS 9 would it make
you particularly buy an ipad now that
you get multi-window support in my case
yes you'll probably say that sensing
galaxy tablets can do this but no this
is a native thing meaning all
applications that support a special
layout thing are able to work like this
so leave us a comment down below what is
your case friends you know the drill
with you when I get the news earlier
before this video is filming she follows
on parking our common structure youtube
channel as well it followed me on
twitter I'm a loose quarter iveta please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am Hina
thank you very much for watching we'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
