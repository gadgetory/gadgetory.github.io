name Sindar Pichai its new CEO the
galaxy s6 edge+ might find itself a
keyboard accessory no one plus two might
not be as timely as many would want I'm
hi Mary Vera enjoying the benefits of
scratches on this $400 SmartWatch this
is parking house daily let's begin today
with the oneplus two retail options for
those of you that have invitations begin
in North America in other countries
tomorrow but interesting it seems that
the company will not be able to fulfill
these demands even with the invites two
or three weeks until their European
demands are met and this is extremely
skeptical we're waiting on word from one
plus over this but yeah it seems that
you won't be getting your phone as quick
as you want it to another device that
we've been waiting for for a while since
mwc 2015 is the Huawei watch we actually
wonder if this product is ever going to
happen but as it turns out we have seen
the device being used by people
particularly Huawei employees and on the
other hand that does seem that the
company is gearing up for a launch in
September but hold it right there in
China if you want the watch elsewhere it
seems that that will take longer if ever
and it just seems that Eva will be a
good time for another launch Huawei LZ
now we've been talking about rumors of
an iphone 6c to happen until next year
but famous tipster Evan blass just came
on record to say that this product will
be announced with the iphone 6s and 6s
plus now hold it right there there are
rumors of an iphone mini and we assume
that that will be the iphone 6c but it
could also be that Apple just wants to
launch a larger plastic chassis iPhone
and name this the iphone succeeds really
hard to predict what we're getting not
really sure if this will be the iphone
mini but we should learn more on
September ninth as the rumors plant and
another product that we are waiting for
an announcement in the next few days is
the galaxy note 5 and galaxy s6 edge+
you can understand how much I love that
name but interesting we've got German
retailers showing off accessories and
one of these is very interesting it is
full keyboard that you could just snap
on the phone because that's something
that people still care about it seems
it'll cost around 60 euros it's not
going to be cheap but then again it's
not going to be expensive for what it
really is so stay tuned we should learn
more in the next few days and finally
for the Shocker news of the year i would
say of google or should i say this is
going to be confusing all right so larry
page and sergey brin just announced the
new company that's called alphabet and
instead of google owning this company
alphabet owns google sergej brent is
going to be the president of alpha vet a
Larry Page will be the CEO and then send
our pitcher is being named the CEO of
Google and the whole purpose of this is
for alphabet to take on the other
projects of Google that are a little
more complex and not focused on search
like for example self-driving cars etc
etc and then Google will focus on its
core business even though it's
diversified over the years into so many
things but it leads me to the question
of the day what do you think about
today's announcement of Google alphabet
you know the whole changes now sundar
Pichai being the lead in my case I like
the fact that Google is focusing on its
core business that is great news I just
wonder what will happen to Android if
sundar Pichai is going to be the CEO of
everything now let's just hope they name
somebody else but leave us a comment
down below how do you feel friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the nose earlier before this video
was filmed make sure you follow us on
talking I'll calm as a sharp changing
channel as well and follow me on Twitter
hi manish watery Vitter on Instagram but
I meta data please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
hey mebbe better thank you very much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
