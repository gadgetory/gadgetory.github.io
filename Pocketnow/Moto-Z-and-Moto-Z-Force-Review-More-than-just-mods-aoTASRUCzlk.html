one stone here in that Motorola's new
flagship phones are more alike than they
are different they'll be sharing this
review as siblings are often loathed to
do when forced to share things these two
devices come from a fully in twined
Motorola and Lenovo partnership ringing
both companies cultures to the forefront
moto delivering excellent consumer
choices in business great construction
alongside lenovo's influence for
experimentation and multimode usage this
pairing results in one of the more
exciting accessory systems we've ever
seen for a consumer handset both phones
follow similar design guidelines a mix
of metal and glass achieves a premium
look 5.5 inch quad HD AMOLED screens
with fingerprint sensors located under
each display above each screen we get a
loudspeaker doubling as your phone call
solution and a 5-megapixel selfie camera
that also has a front LED flash the top
of the phone is home to the shared
microSD and SIM card tray the right side
of the phone holds power and volume keys
which we found to be a touch on the
small side and the even spacing caused a
little tactile confusion when first
using the phone but we quickly
acclimated to this fiddly button feel we
get a USB type-c port on the bottom in
the rear of the phone is pretty busy a
sizable bolt holds the camera system and
the bottom panel is covered in dots and
dimples for the Moto mod accessory
system the tech specs are also fairly
similar both phones have Qualcomm 820
chipsets four gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of built-in storage so where
do these phones differ first off the
Moto Z camera is a 13 megapixel shooter
while the Z force moves up to a 21
megapixel sensor and includes phase
detection autofocus the battery on the Z
force is also larger 3500 milliamp power
to the 2600 milliamp power in the
regular Z and the force includes a
shatter resistant screen like the Droid
turbo to back to aesthetics the Moto Z
is a shockingly thin phone like a
radical evolution of the Droid Razr this
definitely feels like a lenovo idea
where something pads are built as lean
as possible but relying on fast charging
for folks on the go it's tough to judge
these phones naked as more than any
other phone we've reviewed they feel
designed to be used with some kind of
moto mod
a style backplate a mod will cover up
the techie look of the rear pins and
even the thinnest style mod will even
out the camera module to sit flush with
the back of the mod the Moto Z force is
taller wider and thicker it's just a
fraction of a millimeter thinner than a
galaxy s7 but moto engineers have done
something clever here in tapering the
sides to the rear of the phone it shapes
the Z force in a way where a slightly
larger device can still use the same
mods as its smaller stablemate looking
at the displays these are very pretty
screens colorful contrasting AMOLED
panels with very good outdoor brightness
even after a week though we're still
having issues with the fingerprint
sensors which on the moto Z and the z
force act more like power button
replacements we're just so well trained
to reach for a home button down here
that we're accidentally turning the
screen off every time we mean to hit the
home button this is not a familiar way
to use a fingerprint sensor checking out
the software modal is sticking to a near
stock Android look very basic options
for customizing home screens you're
stuck with a 4 by 4 grid it's clean if a
bit stark but purists should appreciate
less manufacturer blow I personally
switched over to Nova Launcher after a
day though just to get back some options
for a tighter homescreen grid there are
only a handful of manufacturer changes
here the front face sensors will wake
the screen when you wave your hand over
it the camera launches with a wrist
twist and the moto assistant returns to
augment the capabilities of Google now
it's well-worn territory and very
familiar being that these are droid
branded devices though Verizon has seen
fit to include some value-added software
on our behalf hmm Verizon cloud audible
caller ID ebay empire gem swab hotels
comm NFL mobile slacker slot machine
game and the verizon navigator hoof you
can't uninstall these but you can
disable most of them with how lean the
user interface is we would expect these
to be some of the performers and they
are both phones chew up basic usage
messaging email social networking and
multimedia playback both phones also
make good use of RAM as it's rare that
we have to fully reload services when
toggling back and forth between a
handful of
happily gaming performance shows a
slight improvement over other phones
using a Qualcomm 820 released earlier
this year Marvel future fight has
consistently performed poorly on
Qualcomm hardware but here it's almost
as smooth as what we've seen from X and
O's powered phones and is noticeably
smoother than the galaxy s7 running on a
Qualcomm 820 it's very slight but we do
see an efficiency advantage for many
games on the Moto Z over competing
Android flagships a quick word about
networking around town we get excellent
reception where we know that Verizon has
strong signal those in good coverage
shouldn't have any issues with Motorola
antennas and that holds true for Wi-Fi
performance as the Z stood neck-and-neck
with the galaxy s7 connected to our
router call quality is great and the
earpiece speaker is respectively loud
under normal conditions switching to
speakerphone doesn't require that
awkward dance of moving the bottom or
back of a phone around the top of your
head and we like that a lot now talking
about cameras we have the most in-depth
examination of the Z and Z force cameras
available online where you can see over
ten minutes of photo and video samples
from both of these phones as a brief
summary both are good but not quite
top-tier imaging options in producing
this review these phones had yet to be
made publicly available so some bug
fixes are certainly in order on the
whole we prefer the higher resolution z4
sensor not only for the extra pixels but
it generally delivered more even-handed
white balance and had more consistent
autofocus performance both phones
deliver solid results when covering the
basics and features some innovative
settings like software stabilization and
HDR modes for UHD video and mobile phone
photons will certainly appreciate manual
controls even if they do feel lifted
from a Lumia unfortunately a number of
the fun features could use some polish
as panorama shots are mediocre at best
and slow-motion video could certainly do
with being spruced up a bit we'd also
like to see moto and the ability to
capture RAW files in this app for folks
who like to edit we're ultimately happy
with this camera as it shows Motorola's
continued evolution over some of the
truly awful cameras of Moto's past but
the Z and Z Force just can't quite climb
into the top tier of phone photography
solutions we got to flip the script on
audio though as the
delivers solid sound from the front
facing speaker but we're we're really
impressed is with headphone audio sure
the lack of a dedicated 3.5 millimeter
jack is a bummer and we're not looking
forward to keeping track of this adapter
but the sound quality through this port
is very good the moto Z down samples
high resolution audio playing everything
back at 16-bit but the actual output is
loud and punchy this is delivering a
better signal-to-noise ratio and
includes a more powerful amp than the
Galaxy s7 or the built-in DAC on the lg
g5 but what good is all of this cool
tech if you can't power it battery
capacity is one of the differences
between these two phones so it's
unsurprising that battery life is
different between these two phones
running a media test streaming 30
minutes of HD video over Wi-Fi at 50
percent brightness the Moto Z drained 6%
of its battery while the z4 strained 4%
and these numbers definitely resemble
our daily use where we ended each day
with significantly more remaining
battery on the force ultimately though
we don't think we'd be overly concerned
with the runtime on the Moto Z unless
you really tax your phone hard
throughout the day and there is
something fun about the idea of slapping
on a mod to add more battery when you
need it but we'll have more to say about
those mods in just a bit a recharge
speeds were a little funky though
testing the Moto Z several times after
30 minutes on the included moto turbo
charger the best week a top off was 38%
this isn't necessarily bad but we were
easily able to best that on the Z force
with a 43% recharge after 30 minutes no
small feat considering the significantly
larger battery we might hypothesize that
the smaller moto could be slowing
recharge speeds down to keep heat in
check we're not sure what could account
for this difference in performance
lastly we have to talk about this Moto
mod system motorola is aggressively
launching a trio of mods alongside the
phone and re received the JBL sound
boost speaker back the lenovo inste
share projector and the Tumey battery
mod we have a separate video reviewing
each of these in greater detail but as a
quick summary this is a fun accessory
system which we think will be easy for
consumers to understand
use the issue here might be buying into
an ecosystem while we wait to see how
well this method is supported by
hardware partners but we can't find
fault with the actual operation here
activation of each mod is seamless and
we're happy that there are actually
products to play with for folks
interested in the Moto Z mind you we
already delivered a moto Z versus LG g5
comparison video so you can imagine how
that showdown concluded so let's wrap
this up where does that leave us with
the Moto Z and the Z force motorola has
a really interesting pair of phones here
the Moto Z represents a solid flagship
though battery life is a touch on the
lean side but if we were pressed to pick
between the two
we'd probably side with the Z force over
the Z shopping these phones on Verizon
we're looking at six hundred and twenty
four dollars for the Moto Z Droid and
seven hundred and twenty dollars for the
Z force Droid if/then is your thing you
can't beat the regular Z and it will
give off a stunning first impression
however the additional battery nicer
camera and more durable screen on the Z
force are well worth the additional
hundred dollars if you have the means
the additional girth which happens to be
less than the thickness of a galaxy s7
is hardly a compromise as to how these
phones compared to other flagship
devices we have an interesting fight on
our hands
these Moto's aren't quite the best jack
of all trade devices instead part of
what you're paying for is this moto mod
system which requires additional buy-in
for the accessories you might want if
you're always traveling with a Bluetooth
speaker or want better battery life in
the field but don't want to lug around a
battery pack moto mods will increase the
cost of your investment but are arguably
more convenient to use it's a premium
offering backed up by some bleeding edge
technology which means it's gonna cost
you some cash to play along still though
this is certainly one of the most fun
gadgets we've gotten to play with in
quite some time
you know novelty is cool like that as
always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
our full moto Z coverage and definitely
check out that camp
review between the Moto Z and the Moto z
force for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag
now some gadget guy on Twitter and
Instagram and I will catch you all on
the next review
