in less than a week no get teases in
october twenty second event and they
include even a laptop and the blackberry
founders want to go and buy it back I'm
high Nevada and regardless of who fixes
or buys blackberry that's not going to
pull my z10 out of the drawers happening
this is out daily lets her stay
off with some official news if sony has
just unveiled their experience z1f which
is the z1 mini that we talked about a
couple of weeks ago and as it was
rumored back then this is a device
without compromise finally finally we
get a small phone with flagship
specifications the same specs as the Li
one only have a smaller chassis with a
4.3 inch 720p display which is awesome
but yeah there's a catch sadly this
device is currently slated only for the
Japanese marketing which still not sure
if we'll ever see it on our shores and
even if it does we're not sure if it's
gonna be timely enough so stay tuned for
that let's see how that goes now let's
do some blackberry talk because there is
still a little bit left out there and
you know that the Fairfax financials
deal pretty much didn't happen the
company is still working to find the
four billion dollars that they need to
spend on blackberry to buy it back from
public as it turns out the company
co-founders have just made themselves
public in order to try to buy back the
company and make it their own once again
is really interesting and ironic at the
same time it's still there is a lot of
great stuff within blackberry and
currently the company is looking into
dividing itself to be sold in pieces so
this is a good option we're just not
sure if it's gonna be worthy enough or
timely enough anymore Nokia's up next is
the company is teasing their October
22nd events and if you find a banner for
the teaser kind of weird don't worry
you're not alone the company is teasing
us a phablet which we were expecting in
a tablet which we were also expecting
but we're also apparently getting a
laptop a nokia brand that laptop and
don't be surprised this is not new the
company's been working on building
computers for years and failed attempts
so it could be the company as now bring
this computers as well and just think
about this proposition nokia is now
becoming more like samsung
Apple more like other companies and this
is really really interesting let's see
what we get at the event and for all of
us that are crazy waiting for the google
nexus 5 we're expecting an event to
happen at the end of this month but
we've got some credible sources stating
that apparently we will be getting an
announced on october 15th which is
actually on tuesday and that's really
close i don't think it's really gonna
happen that way because we don't have
any presentations or anything still you
know friday is still left so anything
could happen by the weekend as well and
yeah we are expecting a ton of things
coming from google very soon let's just
see if it does happen next week there
are more days on the week than just
tuesday as well and finally for the hot
news of the day we've got some leaked
photos of the HTC one max being used
which is cool but that's not really the
cool news even core is the fact that
we've got some credible reports that
show us that the fingerprint scanner at
the back is going to be more than just a
security biometric apparently you can
program the scanner to remember your
fingers and depending on which finger
you use to touch the scanner it'll
launch a specific application or perform
a specific task which is awesome just
think about it you give it your pinky
and it'll make a phone call or something
like that obviously this is just the
concept we're still not sure if this is
really going to happen but you know that
leaves you to the question of the day
would you consider that to be the genius
fingerprint scanner move that other
company should do you know honestly I
find it awesome i find it really cool as
long as acc allows us to do that when
the phone is on standby because if i
still have to turn on my phone and if i
still have to unlock it and still have
to you know do the fingerprint scanner
thing then what's the difference between
doing that and just pressing the
shortcut leave us a comment down below
