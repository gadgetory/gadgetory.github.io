for the galaxy s6 have already investing
heavily on apple watch edition security
and Motorola seems to be on the right
track after years of struggle I'm hi
Mary vetta and yeah I am extremely happy
that monday is over this is pocket out
daily brought to you by lynda.com the
official news should I have to do with
Motorola many of us were worried about
the company going into the hands of
lenovo and not google but that's
actually played positively for motorola
they landed the nexus deal in addition
to the fact that new quarter results
claim to the company sold 10 million
phones a first in a very very long time
i think since the time of the razor it's
been a crazy time for motorola that's
just great to see them on the right
track but sadly we still don't know
about revenue or other stuff like that
now let's talk about apple we know that
the company is getting ready for its
Apple watch and apparently the launch
will be sometime in April according to
Tim Cook but I've ever wondered exactly
what Apple will do for that apple watch
edition an 18 carat gold and how it'll
keep it safe within its Apple stores it
turns out we further the company is
investing on retail employees that are
specific to luxury and they're also
investing in safes that include Mac safe
power adapters inside for them to be
able to charge the Apple watch overnight
because you actually need to do so so
stay tuned for that and many of us have
been waiting for the successor of the
pebble steel the pebble continues to be
one of our favorite smartwatches ever
and the company CEO just came on record
to stay two things number one it they're
working on a new framework for its
operating system and we thread a lot of
technical stuff doesn't really help us
know exactly how that's going to benefit
the UI but yeah there are changes coming
and we should be waiting for hardware
sometime later this year and that means
so many things hopefully that will be
soon but we don't know if that'll be mwc
it's already closed i'll talk about
microsoft and windows 10 we had heard
rumors that the company was going to
push it's a preview mobile preview
tomorrow and a lot of us were gearing up
to it but apparently some credible
sources claim that note the company is
not ready for that yet
could be that they're only going to push
it the sun closed room of developers and
not specifically to the public and
that's probably gonna be the case but
again stay tuned keep your watch a
steady and hopefully we will be covering
news that we do get it and hopefully go
to try and finally for the very
interesting rumors of the day let's talk
about the galaxy s6 which is already
gearing up for EM the vc 2015 and if
you're wondering what colors were
getting apparently we're getting four
colors this time seems that Samsung is
working on listen to this electric blue
a green that looks more like teal of
gold obviously and white no black
options no silver options these are the
colors that will be in the original
launch and we've seen Sam's and then
relaunch the phone with other clothes
eventually but it leads me to the
question of the day if you have to
choose the galaxy s6 what color would
you want because in my case Silver's
always my favorite color and meaning
silver like the LG g3 or silver like the
gunmetal grey of the HTC One m8 that's
my favorite believe is a comment down
