that if Apple were to be banned Huawei
would protest we have a list of a ton of
changes that will be coming to iPhones
either this year or the next and
Qualcomm and Lenovo just announced their
plans to make the first 5g computer next
year
I'm hiya metadata and I think that we
will need a comments video for the
comments video because the amount of
comments we got yesterday on the recap
was insane thank you so much guys this
is pocket out daily brought to you by -
Lane the official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for a
Chromebook I would definitely recommend
less expensive products and even the
pixel book but if you like the concept
of the tablet the pixel slate is
currently $200 off I don't recommend the
seller on Varian which is already sold
out sadly for those people that bought
it the m3 is a little better that one's
pretty much at the price of the seller
on but I do recommend the higher tier i5
and above which is the one I have that
one works fine Bigler in wanted
description now let's talk about Foxconn
in the whole recent events you know
we're hearing about the possibility of a
Apple band from China the u.s. ban of
Huawei Foxconn just came on record to
state that as a No DM they might be
seeing some fluctuations in the amount
of manufacturing that they have but that
they're not expecting this to be
anything that's not something that we've
seen before this is rather interesting
because we rarely ever see statements
from Foxconn period so yeah we don't
understand why but the statements there
now let's talk about Qualcomm and Lenovo
as a Computex is currently happening in
Taipei and well we just got an
announcement from Lenovo Qualcomm that
we should be expecting as early as next
year a full-blown computer that's 5g
connected obviously this is going to be
running on the new qualcomm snapdragon
8c X platform
I assume that with the same X 55 G modem
not exactly sure how that's gonna work
but I do love the fact that we are going
to get a fully connected computer it's
called Project limitless I can't wait to
see the final design or whatever it is
that we get now let's move the spotlight
over to iPhones as we've got some
trusted sources claiming a couple of
separate things starting with the fact
that
for either the Sears iPhones or the next
year's iPhones we can expect a couple of
things the first one being then
apparently 3d touch is going to die but
not necessarily it seems that Apple is
working on a new way to provide us
haptics and that enhancement is going to
replace 3d touch on the other hand we
also hear that well we will be getting
touch ID back on iPhones somehow we're
not exactly sure on which one because if
you remember the rumours it was all over
the display you could unlock your phone
with your fingerprint that sounds
fantastic and we also even hear that
bluetooth is finally gonna work as it's
supposed to multiple devices being
connected to one iPhone that's all great
in addition to 5g connectivity all these
things are expected we're just not sure
which generation and also in addition to
that we also hear of an iPhone se -
probably making that launch that we've
been expecting for like forever
obviously we're still far away from
getting any news on the next iPhones and
the render is for the stove design is
actually starting to grow on me and
finally the hottest news that I have to
do with Huawei and the company's
president coming on record with
Bloomberg over how the company would
react if the ban were removed or if a
band - Apple would happen and I like the
interview I highly recommend you follow
the link of the description watch the
whole interview he claims things like
for example the fact that he loves that
this is happening because his executives
were already becoming a little stagnant
and a little bored of their jobs and he
was like we love that this is shaking
the corporate culture up and it's
helping us start over that's all great
but even more interesting is when asked
about Apple he was like now if Apple
were to be banned which he doubts it
will happen he's like we would be the
first to protest he even came over to
claim that they consider Apple a mentor
a leader and obviously somebody that
they looked up to a company that they
looked up to obviously I really liked
the interviews with the sky because he
is definitely probably one of the most
humble people that I've seen on
interviews but still let us know in the
comments down below what do you think do
you think that Huawei's approach should
continue to be that they're just gonna
ride this out or do you think that the
company should be a little more
aggressive about what's happening to
them and figure out a way out because
they even claimed
and we're gonna be lifted we would
continue buying us products I think that
there should be a little more
aggressiveness but I also have to admire
how calm they've been about everything I
mean this could pretty much cripple any
company but with the size of Huawei it's
understandable why that's not
necessarily their case and folks I just
want to take a minute to tell you about
