Moto X launch Sony is reportedly working
on building external smartphone cameras
and VLC returns to the iPhone after
almost three years I'm Jaime Rivera and
I won't be held responsible for my
actions from here and until Monday this
is PocketNow daily Lester's day off with
the interesting product announcement
says motorola has now sent out press
invitations for an event to happen on
Argos first that has to do with the Moto
X which we thought was gonna be
announced that the Google event that's
happening next week so this is getting
really interesting and according to
Larry Page he is very proud of the phone
so coming from the guy that's proud of
Google glass I'm expecting something
very cool
when we go over two other announcements
well you know that the team old Nokia
Lumia 521 was never the most handsome or
powerful smartphone out there but it was
the cheapest Windows Phone in the market
I mean that thing would cost 150 bucks
no contracts and now t-mobile is
dropping that price of just $100 no
contracts and if you hit the links in
the description you can actually get an
extra $20 off this phone I mean that's a
perfect price now let's talk about the
Nexus line of best we've got some recent
leaks of the Nexus 4 running Android 4.3
there are some significant improvements
in performance everywhere so that should
be very interesting but as I from that
we've also got some big specifications
of the Nexus 7 we get a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core processor but it doesn't
specify which processor it is we get a 5
megapixel camera the fact that we didn't
have before and we also saw the leaks of
what the device will look like so stay
tuned next week hopefully and you know
it's been almost three years since Apple
picked out VLC from their App Store
because it brings some copyright laws
I wonder which ones and as it turns out
well they're finally approving the
application again as of today being
compatible for the iPhone and the iPad
you can run pretty much everything
that's compatible with VLC if you know
what I mean and you can actually even
use airplay aside from other features
that come from the iPad if you have an
Apple TV for example so yeah I thought
were you you'd better start
hello - before they pull it out again
and finally for the interesting news of
the day if you didn't think that the
Galaxy s4 zoom and the Nokia Lumia 1020
were cool well Sony seems to be working
on a new project with their alpha unit
you know their DSLR camera unit in
building lenses or should I say cameras
that adapt to smartphones to enhance the
current cameras of these smartphones to
be better meaning yes this is pretty
much a lens but it brings a battery pack
it brings external storage options and
it pretty much turns your Smartphone
into a real camera or at least that's
the idea you know I feel that it's
actually even cooler than having to
carry the bulk of an extra camera if you
don't really need the extra camera all
the time especially if that accessory is
pocketable but anyways that leads you to
the question of the day would you like
to use this feature will you consider
that an external camera that attaches to
your phone would be something that you'd
want in my particular case honestly I
feel that smartphone camera lenses not
necessarily separate cameras but camera
lenses should be something that should
have happened the long time ago or
adapters with a camera fine let's bring
that also to the table again it would
all narrow down to the price I mean if
they're not gonna charge you the same
price that is a charge for lenses for
DSLR cameras then yes this could take
off but leave us a comment down below
what would you prefer of course it's
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone itself or machine you follow

youtube channel as well
