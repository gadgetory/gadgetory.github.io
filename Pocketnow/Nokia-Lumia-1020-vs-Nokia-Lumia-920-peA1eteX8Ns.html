smartphone photographers for about nine
months now but the Nokia Lumia 920 has
finally been ousted as king of the
smartphone photography hill by the Nokia
Lumia 1020 or has it I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow let's find out when it
launched in the winter of 2012 the Lumia
920 promised to bring Nokia's high-end
PureView camera experience to Windows
Phone and it did that at least in name
the devices optical image stabilization
and excellent low-light camera
performance served it very well but it's
eight point seven megapixel resolution
meant it couldn't replicate some of the
more advanced features of the 41
megapixel Nokia 808 enter the Lumia 1020
the long-awaited long rumored fusion of
true PureView technology and Windows
Phone and the smart phone photographers
dream device but with a hefty price tag
of two $99.99 on an exclusive AT&amp;amp;T
contract in the u.s. is the 1020 really
enough of an improvement over the much
cheaper Lumia 920 let's find out in this
comparison and make sure to follow
PocketNow on social media so you don't
miss our full Lumia 1020 review coming
soon from the front these devices look
quite similar notwithstanding the
different casing colors of our review
units here the WXGA displays are
identical in size at 4.5 inches and the
button configuration earpiece and camera
placement and even carrier and
manufacturer logos are placed in more or
less the same places on the front the
differences are in the details the ten
twenties display is AMOLED instead of
the nine 20s LCD technology delivering
the now-familiar
super saturated color and true blacks
along with much improved side visibility
the protective layer atop the screen is
made of newer third-generation Gorilla
Glass as well which should offer greater
scratch protection along the sides the
Lumia 920's ceramic buttons have been
replaced with aluminum ones on the 1020
and the speaker ports have also been
condensed into a single row off to
side making room for a lanyard hole for
all you wrist strap users out there we
were sad to see the nokia smile
eliminated on the 1020 the top and
bottom bearing a much more symmetrical
cross-section than the nine 20s but it
takes looking around back to see the
biggest hardware change the tidy and
minimalistic in lozenge-shaped camera
bezel of the 920 has given way to a
massive aluminum disk in the center of a
flared crater that totally dominates the
backside of the 1020 while the 920
featured a holistic and balanced
artistic back cover design the 1020 is
comparatively brutal it's almost funny
in its complete lack of subtlety there's
no question that the centerpiece of the
1020 is its 41 megapixel camera the only
other detail on the phone's back cover
is the dual contact point for the
wireless charger attachment something
not needed by the 920 and a concession
nokia made to get the 1020 s mass down
on that subject let's talk about how
they feel in the hand at 158 grams the
Lumia 1020 is much lighter than the 185
grams of the Lumia 920 and that's pretty
evident when you pick these devices up
now it's not light enough to seem cheap
in fact the polycarbonate casing feels
quite premium in the hand especially
considering that all the 1020 color
options are offered in a matte finish
instead of the gloss found on some of
the 920 colors the 1020 can't win all
the points though it's impossible to
overlook that camera bump on the
backside well it's easy to feel it out
with a fingertip due to the surrounding
flare in the casing it definitely sits
right where your fingers want to go when
holding the phone in portrait now while
it's much easier to avoid getting a
fingertip in the lens on the 1020 than
it was on the 920 there's no denying
that the camera hump makes the newer
phone the more awkward one to hold and
the more awkward one to place on a
tabletop as well under the hood there's
an interesting mix of similarities and
differences which make clear that the
1020 is not just a 920 with an 808
camera bolted on to start with the
embedded batteries are different while
they boast the same
and power rating the output at different
voltages and they therefore carry
different watt our ratings Nokia's
official specs bear this out and they
cite different values for many scenarios
with each device to see our full review
when it lands for more detailed battery
endurance information each device is
powered by the familiar dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 running at 1.5
gigahertz augmented by 32 gigs of
non-expandable storage out of box
there's between 24 and 26 gigs free on
each the 1020 does pack an extra gig of
ram for two gigs total and it also adds
a barometer to the 920's sensor package
of accelerometer compass and gyroscope
the rest of the load out from Wi-Fi to
3G to 4G to bluetooth to NFC is common
between the devices in terms of the
general Windows Phone 8 experience these
devices offer very similar experiences
outside the camera which we'll get to in
a second that said the 1020 does ship
with Windows Phones gd-r to package
alongside Nokia's amber update among
other improvements the new software
gives you the ability to adjust display
color saturation and temperature to your
liking it also includes some fun
usability bonuses there's a persistent
clock called glance mode on the standby
screen together with the option to
double tap to unlock the phone which is
nice if you're a fan of terrestrial
radio there's good news here as well
because the updates UNCHR upon the FM
radio functionality of Nokia's Lumia
devices nice touch
now while these upgrades are a little
feather in the 1020's cap for now some
Lumia 920's are already receiving their
update packages as this video hits the
feed so it won't be long before this
particular advantage is nullified on
AT&amp;amp;T so 9:20 owners rejoice we said
before that the camera was the
unquestioned centerpiece of the Lumia
1020 s hardware and guess what that's
true in software as well where the 920
ships with just the bare-bones windows
phone camera app the 1020 comes out of
the box with no fewer than three camera
shortcuts the traditional Windows Phone
app alongside Nokia's smart cam and
Nokia pro cam
now the stock Windows Phone 8 camera is
nothing special and frankly we wonder
why it's even included Nokia's smart cam
might best be thought of as a value pack
wrapping a lot of individual lenses into
one title so you can capture action
shots remove unwanted photo bombers and
so on but it's the Nokia pro cam app
which drives the 10 20s massive 41
megapixel shooter and it's this app
you'll be using most often thankfully
pressing the camera shutter defaults to
pro cam out of the box just be ready to
wait about 1.5 seconds longer for the
heavier app to load and for the camera
hardware to engage on the 1020 versus
the 920 after all you don't get
something for nothing we'll have a
separate video going in-depth on all the
features of the 10 20s various camera
apps so here we'll just focus on how it
compares to its predecessor we put these
phones side-by-side when we fired up a
bunch of photos using out of box
defaults that's 8 megapixel resolution
with Auto settings on the 920 and a
special dual shooting mode on the 1020
that captures both a 5 megapixel JPEG
and a full resolution 34 megapixel photo
for editing purposes in the low-light
conditions that made the 920 famous the
results are still impressive with
default settings but it also becomes
evident how the 920 almost tries too
hard compared to the 1020 s dimmer but
clearer shots the simple fire-and-forget
action of the 920 s camera in low-light
is still excellent and it's actually
more convenient if you don't like
fiddling with settings but the 1020 is
capable of truly stunning low-light
photography if you know what you're
doing or even if you just read the
tutorials in more conventional lighting
the differences are less dramatic but
still significant once you look closely
on average the 1020 produces colors
which are deeper and more true to life
than the 920 and of course the higher
resolution means far off detail like
text is almost always much more readable
with the newer phone the higher
resolution also allows for one of the
hallmark tricks of the Lumia 1020 the
lossless zoom that together with the
1020 s much more customizable focus
exposure and white balance settings
means the phone is capable of some truly
beautiful photos
well beyond the reach of its predecessor
in terms of video results were
comparable in a side-by-side walking
test the image stabilization worked
quite well on each phone with each one
delivering crisp colorful 1080p video
with rich full sound the 1020 lagged
behind the 920 in terms of adjustment
speed taking just a bit longer to
automatically adjust focus and exposure
but otherwise the video performance
between these phones was right on par
the remaining differences between these
devices are pretty minor callers said we
sounded similar and voice testing and
all the standard functions of a smart
phone from texting to tweeting to
browsing worked almost identically on
each device the added gig of ram might
help the 1020 and some of its more
ponderous tasks like running the heavy
camera apps but in everyday use these
phones don't perform all that
differently
the real dividing line as you might have
expected is the 10 20s onboard barometer
just making sure you were paying
attention no of course the primary
difference here is the camera and the
920 shooter is still an excellent choice
and still outperforms almost any other
on the market the 1020 s camera
absolutely schools it in every aspect
but simplicity sure the ten twenties RAW
images will take up more room and the
cameras hardware and software are
definitely more cumbersome but in return
you get a camera that will literally
outperform any other smartphone camera
that has ever existed whether that's
worth an extra two hundred dollars on
contract is as always up to you
but given the generational leap in
camera performance that the 1020
represents we think the pricing is just
right listen if you want to save money
on a solid camera phone the Lumia 920 is
still an excellent choice especially
since it'll also eventually get the pro
camera software update but if you're
looking for the closest possible thing
to a professional-grade photography
experience on a smartphone there's just
no comparison the Lumia 1020 is the
device for you
folks we're still comparing the Nokia
Lumia 1020 against other devices on
other platforms and we're giving you in
depth feature explorations just as
quickly as we can make them both here on
