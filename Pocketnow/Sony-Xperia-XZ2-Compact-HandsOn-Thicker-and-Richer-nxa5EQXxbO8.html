small phones and thank you for not
making them suck actually that's the
other way around the company has known
how to do this for years
reporting from MWC 2018 I'm gonna leave
it up with Jules Wong on camera for
PocketNow and this is our hands-on of
the sony xperia XZ - contact brought to
you by invisible shield great hallmarks
of a flagship xperia smartphone have
also usually been packaged in a device
with a screen starting with a number 4
in this case the Xperia XZ to compact
stands at 5 inches but the reason this
phone has actually gotten slimmer is
because of the 2x1 aspect ratio which is
quite common for smartphones today and
makes it just more probable than ever
the thing about it is this little
plastic phone is chunky for its size at
12 millimeters thick and some 168 grams
but hey at least it is in glossy plastic
and it does include an aluminium trim
for added sturdiness the device is
powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
and it's linked up to adequate memory
and other specifications that we expect
only on high-end flexures the stereo
speakers on the compact should be quite
powerful hopefully as much as the
regular Xperia x8 - and the 19 megapixel
camera at the back is set to be capable
of shooting a crazy 1080p at 960 frames
per second as well s or K HDR video ok
maybe we might be able to live with
these 12 millimeters afterall if you
consider the fact that you're getting a
very pocketable flagship all around
obviously only time will tell
expect a global launch in March and more
coverage from PocketNow shortly
thereafter all that happens here is
award from our sponsor
