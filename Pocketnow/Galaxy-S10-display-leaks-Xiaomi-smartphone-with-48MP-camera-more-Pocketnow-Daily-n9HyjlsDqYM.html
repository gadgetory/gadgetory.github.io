what to expect for the Samsung Galaxy S
10 selfie cameras xiaomi will be
releasing a phone with a 48 megapixel
camera very soon yeah you heard that
right and honor just the pretty much
tees that they're already working on a
forty eight megapixel camera on a phone
as well i'm hiya meadow Iveta and studio
number two with the worst allergies ever
but you know the way it goes this is
rocking out daily sponsored by swap off
the official nurse today begin with
deals uh it's all about the razor phone
- it's now $100 off and tons of
retailers but the interesting part is
that in addition to that part well the
company has just switched out one of the
major software updates that claims to
fix everything when it comes to the
camera better HDR performance better
everything up to the point where I was
planning to do that review this week and
now I'm gonna definitely yeah I really
want to give it a try now so uh yeah
razor phone - stay tuned and I'll let
you know if it's worth it now let's talk
about the samsung galaxy a8 s the worst
name and smartphone history was pretty
much just announced it got teased hours
before the event and another thing
happened an hour before the event that
I'll let you know later most important
thing is we've got three cameras at the
back we've got that punch hole in the
front we've got a Snapdragon 710
processor specification is actually not
bad I just I really am curious as to
what markets are getting this phone and
yeah the punch hole is it's huge and yes
let's talk about honor as the company is
just surprised everybody one hour before
the eighth the galaxy a8 s was announced
sorry about that
honor pretty much just teased their view
20 and yeah it's gonna be announced in a
couple of weeks of officially but they
pretty much tease that the punch hole is
coming to that phone and according to
honor they're gonna launch it before
everybody else we're talking about a
Karen 980 processor which is already
making the while we made 20 pro look
really good but most important 48
megapixel camera 48 megapixel camera so
yeah that's even got more megapixels
than the Huawei made 20 pro so our
right this is a way to grab some
headlines and it looks really good in
the teaser up stay tuned for that and
now let's move the spotlight over to
Xiaomi as well
they have already claimed as well that
they're launching a 48 megapixel camera
on a phone it's apparently going to
launch early next year and this by the
way with ass company CEO the most
interesting part is yes I mean we know
that Sony launched the sensor Xiaomi
collaborates a lot with Sony so I am
expecting for that Sony sensor to be the
one that we're getting here and even
though there don't seem to be any plans
to for this to launch in the United
States apparently we're gonna get it in
the time frame of CES or stay tuned and
finally the hot new should they have to
do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10 the gift
the rumors that keeps on giving of this
time particularly because so you saw
those punch holes that we are now seeing
on the 8's I hope I don't have to say
this name again but anyways it seems
that that's not going to be the final
design for the s10 we've seen a ton of
leaks but now we've got famous tipster
Evan blast showing this three models
three of them with the punch hole in the
middle which I find to be more
symmetrical and I'm not saying that they
look better or worse it's just the one
seven blast grab some stuff it's I I
really trust his leaks and so yeah it
seems to the punch hole is in the middle
but according to Evan blast none of
these units are the 5g variants so
there's still one more to see and that
could be the one with the punch hole on
the right which is a rumored to have a
larger display let us know in the
comments down below
punch hole on the side punch hole in the
middle which one do you like the most in
