behind the camera we are still at war
away still at MWC 2014 you've seen this
meeting at that x1 one of the probably
coolest things that I've seen here is
the fact that this is a 7-inch tablet
and here you have another 7-inch x YZ
probably one of the biggest deals that
Huawei CEO was making was the fact that
you can't hook this in your pocket but
you can't put this one I mean this has I
forget how many millimeters are in this
bezel when you compare it to the iPad
Mini this looks like a tablet look look
this looks more like a phone obviously
my hands are huge so don't let this
mislead you this is a big product but if
you compared to the iPad Mini for
example you have two very big advantages
with this huawei tablets the first one
being the fact that obviously is small
it fits in your pocket sadly it still
stuck to this lanyard I can't show you
how it fits in my pocket but notice the
iPad Mini the footprint is just so
different between these products this
pretty much seems completely different
to the iPad Mini even though it looks
like it looks like a big iPhone I'll
tell you that but aside from that you
have to buy different sizes for the iPad
Mini Mini meaning 16 32 or 64 gigs 128
gigs for the iPad Mini whereas in this
tablet you get 16 gigs of storage and
there is expansion through micro sd on
this tablet as well so there are some
advantages to it aside from the fact
that obviously this is a less this is a
less expensive tablet and there is also
a phone so you'd also don't get these
functionalities with the iPad Mini so is
this a better product obviously we need
to have to bring it to the pocket now
labs and tell you which one is better
once we really compare these products
but so far I totally something I am
quite impressed with this product I'll
probably say that this is the first
Huawei product I've ever been press
would so totally behind the camera Hind
everybody locking out.i calm we will be
back soon with more coverage I am
already sweating this is a big venue but
it's packed with people be back soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
