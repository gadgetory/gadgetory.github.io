I do a snake's body and then also the
United thousand in a second so the X
I've is sort of a mid-range android 2.2
smartphone it's
sub 1 gigahertz CPU and the 3.8 inch
play in a time when
for tegra two powered smartphones this
is kind of
interesting I mean even sure what they
show you here too it's a nice looking
relatively thin
android 2.2 point one smartphone it's
got a slender design hopefully the price
will be rights got a nice rubbery
coating on the back to the branding the
Xbox got a five megapixel camera with
nice big speaker there but as mentioned
it's just a vanilla installation of
froyo is
especially the prices right now this is
it
good work in the US over 3g
850 or
nineteen hundred bands for AT&amp;amp;T we don't
t-mobile so this is a European phone
coming january 2011
let's take a look at this other guy a
little bit different here for camera
will focus is the you 9000 it's a little
bit more high-end it's got a 1 gigahertz
processor yeah that's running android
2.2 froyo this soon was to have the
right bands to do AT&amp;amp;T 3g the sign is
correct although it's ed Ã¨ up there
implying that it's getting hedge data so
let's boot up Google Maps just real
quick whole thing about this phone you
9000 is pretty slender it's got almost
of boxy shape to it you don't really get
to see that much nowadays and it's not
even a locust rubber edge here which
says mentioned this is an android 2.2
vanilla installation just like the x5 so
you're not going to have really skin to
sort of clock things up and make make
things ugly which I guess is a good
thing
that is the Hawaii again sorry if
mispronouncing at you 9000 kind of a
cool slender device for a higher end in
the middle of the ground x5 ideas which
is not slated to go to the US as again
so for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
