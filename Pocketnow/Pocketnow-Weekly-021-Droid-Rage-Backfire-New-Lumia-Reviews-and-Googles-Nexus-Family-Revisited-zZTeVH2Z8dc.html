weekly hello and welcome to episode 02
one of the pocket now weekly the
once-a-week podcast from pocketnow.com
where we discuss what's hot and what's
cool in the world of mobile technology
from windows to android to iphone to
other platforms we like just as well
sometimes I'm your host Michael Fisher
senior editor at pocket now and I'm
joined by our managing editor 27 hours
without a cigarette anton d Naja good
afternoon to you sir good morning to you
guys can grab and buy our android guy
the man with the nexus collection Joe
Levi how are you good morning pocketnow
he's obviously much better than I am I
was gonna say Tony just was gonna leap
through the internet and strangle Joe
small blessings I'll take him home for I
can get him it's good to have you back
on the show there Joe it's been a little
bit this has been a little while always
good to be here you know it's always
live tweeting always live tweeting this
is the my favorite part of the of the
pocket now podcast my favorite accident
from the podcast I want to jump right in
with a with it with a we've had a lot
going on this week as usual and we have
a lot of devices to talk about whom we
have some some reviews and so after the
buzzes that went up this week and just a
whole lots going on but probably most
visibly is this thing that I think we
are all three of us can weigh in on this
was a suggestion from Tony to talk about
because Microsoft has kicked off its its
newest windows phone marketing kind of
son yeah stunt it's not even a campaign
and it's not really even that new it's a
reboot from from last year and it is
something that if you're on Twitter
you've seen probably marked by the
hashtag droid rage or order response
windows rain is rate right so Microsoft
has like has this
we'd that says do you have an android
malware Horror Story reply with hashtags
roid rage with your best worst story
best or worst story and we may have a
get-well present for you so Microsoft is
capitalizing on this kind of non non
story about Android malware experiencing
some kind of uptick and it has been I
kind of looked at the hashtag I just did
a quick search of it before coming on
the air and it looks to me like one of
the biggest backfires in in a very long
time I mean Tony as you mentioned
there's there's this response hashtag
called called windows rage yeah
androidcentral has gotten something
that's gotten retweeted a whole lot
where they're like whoops just activated
another million devices today sorry
about that Windows Phone right right hey
good one and even like individual users
not just you know not just fan sites are
responding with the just using the droid
rage tag completely improperly what do
you guys think about this I I am I I
hate it when companies engage in like
you know attack ads against each other I
hate it when Samsung does at Apple I you
know what how how hilarious / annoying
is this to to each of you any of either
of you can weigh in well the Samsung to
apple stuff I kind of like because it's
not really I hate it and it's terrible
and it it's not full of hate and anger
and animosity it's just kind of politely
poking fun this this is calling out the
dogs this is going to war and it's just
not up to par with a company that we
expect better guys if my kids were doing
this I put them in separate rooms that
or I put them in the same room until
they were friends again absolutely I
agree i think it's i think it's childish
and it's for a company maybe there's
Tony maybe you can weigh in on this if
there's some kind of PR formula that
says the exact right time to weigh in
with a with an attack ad and maybe we
just stumbled across that time period
and that's why they're doing this right
now I have not worked and I have not
studied marketing but I have worked in
companies where
had marketing departments and I
personally don't believe that any
marketing campaign which is attacking
another product the competition is is
Dean for success now those who are
following me since since I've been
writing in technology probably know that
I don't really like Google's open model
in terms of controlling malware which is
every now and then appearing inside the
google play store I would prefer an a
priori system and that's not in place
but still Google does a great job at
kicking malware out and uninstalling it
from phones but you guys know which is
the first question I am being asked when
talking about phones know what isn't so
somebody walks up to me gets his Android
or hers Android device out and the first
question how do i install applications
without buying them yeah so that's
that's the problem i had never purchase
I mean I have never installed
applications which I have not purchased
or which i have downloaded or installed
not officially the problem is when you
go to a third fourth or fifth party
store and you download I don't want to
point fingers from where applications
you are probably exposing yourself much
more than you would if you would just
limit yourself to Google Play sure and
that's that's my point I i think is like
I I do limit myself to google play as do
i think a lot of legit Android users
like globally and I have I know I am
conscious of the fact that there are
viruses and there's malware on on
Android you know on the Android platform
and you have to kind of be careful with
with your side loading and stuff like
that but I mean like that seems to be
the whole foundation for this for this
campaign right the microsoft says they
have a to-do list for android users step
one wait for your android phone to get
infected with malware and then you know
the way they make it sound is is that
everybody is exposed now we've been
using android since the early days and i
have personally never encountered a
situation where me or my data was
jeopardized because i think the rule of
thumb here and
Joe would probably agree with me if an
application or any software bit is too
good to be true then it's probably not
so if you find a super super game which
costs like point ninety nine dollars
that's probably not the real deal or if
you find a copy the cheaper copy of a
popular game up there you just don't
want to purchase that because it's
something's fishy yeah yeah i mean i've
i've had android since the t-mobile g1
so a year after android came out i
personally have never had any malware or
anything that could be considered
malware on any of my devices and i do a
lot i push the envelope a lot i am one
of the people that of anyone would be
likely to be infected then I haven't
been the the closest that I've come is
on some of my kids devices where they
have gotten apps that have airpush
installed which I hate but that was
what's their such an ad campaign it's a
way of monetizing apps by putting ads in
them except they're not in that apps per
se they show up in your notification
tray really yeah so it's annoying but i
get i get females almost every day
asking me to upgrade my apps to put them
in there so i can get so much more money
off of them wait to my eyes so the ads
go in the notification tray the ads go
in the notification tray even when your
app isn't running there are some people
who claim that no it will only run when
the app is running but I I don't know if
I believe that her I haven't seen that
to be true well yeah and that's it that
sounds like a fresh window to exploit
for these people out there who do you
know write these malicious android
applications but I don't know I you know
I mean we can't spend all day on this
it's just it's it's it's very
interesting when when I PR campaign
backfires and I think this is droid the
droid range thing a rage thing is right
in the middle of this and if you have a
minute you know anyone on any of our
listeners either of you guys if you guys
just want to laugh just plug into roid
rage into the Twitter
urgent just just watch this this s storm
absolutely you know taking hold and you
know what and I think it dis bears
repeating at this point even though
we're about to leave into the windows
section of the podcast look I i do like
Windows Phone a lot and I like it more
each day actually I had a total fanboy
moment last night where I spent I
realized i had spent about an hour and a
half to two hours on various windows
phone forums and like I had spent 25
minutes organizing my home screen and
you know this isn't because I was doing
it for a reason I was just kind of
having fun nerding out with Windows
Phone so you know I'm whatever i'm in
the club I get it it's awesome I just
think it's a really stupid campaign and
a lot of the back wait a minute wait a
minute what you're in the club and
you're rearranging your windows phone
home screen yeah what's the what's it
better with that okay I may be the
married guy in Utah I know that's not
what you're supposed to do when you're
at the club no not that Club Joe Levi
this I was at college I'm just well be
there yes no I wasn't out if actually if
I ever manage to visit the club's that
Tony references pretty often if I ever
enter a Romanian Club Tony please remind
me to to rearrange my home screen while
I'm there I will thank you and we'll
text yo Levi I'll know this is so while
we're talking about Windows Phone a
while we're talking about home screens
yeah let's let's leap into the window
section because it's been a massive
Newsweek for for us it's been a big one
for nokia there's been a lot going on
with them with nokia from apps to
business events to device reviews and
the latter is what i want to kind of
leap a start off with here because we
just reviewed the nokia lumia 822 and
it's our first quick review listeners so
if you're missing this in the headline
if you are a fast reader like I am and
you sometimes miss the details it is not
a full it is not our typical full review
which tend to go what guys between 2,500
and four thousand words something like
that oh I thought you're talking about
how many hours it takes us to prepare
them oh right yes
it's not a typical 25 day review
presents yeah yeah and it was really
it's been kind of interesting you know
working with with everyone to come up
with that kind of pared down format and
we're going to alternate between this
format and the traditional review format
for devices going forward and I think I
formerly had a word of explanation at
the top of this one which I which I
liked and I found I found it beautifully
wordy and we'll craft and then Tony came
along was like no this is a quick review
you don't need 800 words explaining why
it's a quick review which makes a sense
I get to teach the purpose of the quick
remain exactly so anyway if you haven't
seen it yet go it you just went up this
morning go ahead and check it out let me
add a 22 quick review and um guys I
gotta tell you if if you have not headed
out if you're you know into windows
phones are into smartphones in general
and you just want to see something new
and you're in America because this is a
verizon wireless exclusive variant of
the 820 you should go to 0 verizon one
of the store and and check it out
because it is really really interesting
it is a very ugly phone I don't think
there's there's any way around it this
phone is is is just hurting visually
some people will like it but it reminds
me as i said in the review of a bar of
soap like it's this thick kind of
battleship ask thing with with with
sharp lines and i don't know it maybe
it's because i have the white one and
maybe it's because it's got the chin
maybe it's because it's really thick and
really light and it feels kind of toy
like but if you look at it from the
front or you look at it from the back it
looks like a decent phone but as soon as
you see it with the side view yeah wow
yeah if we see from the side view and it
looks like like something that um not
not like a futuristic 80s concept but
maybe something that would have been on
MacGyver like if MacGyver was you know
in the mid 80s you know he's checking
out some some office with some high
technologies like ah check out this new
remote control from the future MacGyver
like that's kind of what it looks like
you're being you know NE marche it
really does look like a hotel para so it
does Tony you don't tell me you think it
looks it looks good to you no it does
not
don't have to emphasize that I am you're
right we're being a little mean it's
what's on the inside the count exact
that is and what's on the inside like
matches almost completely matches what's
on the de lumia 920 the much higher end
device the casing design well it may not
appeal to everyone it actually feels
wonderful in the hand and if it weren't
for the inferior display which I talked
about you know in the review and in the
videos it obviously performance doesn't
suffer at all because it's Windows Phone
right but it's just amazing how
something even if you weren't told the
price you weren't told the model number
or whatever but you held the 822 in one
hand and the 920 in another you could
instantly tell which one was the the
premium device and which one was the
mid-range but da 22 has amazing guts and
it has LTE and that's something that the
810 doesn't obviously the t-mobile's
variant because t mobile doesn't have
LTE so yet it would yet exactly sorry
excuse me but it's it's it's fascinating
because it's this kind of like
transcendent device it's this it's this
phone that's like oh hey yeah i got a
mid-range model number and i got a low
price tag and it's not i don't i'm not
the prettiest but i've got an amazing
set of features and its really really
cool in that we'll just go out and watch
the video i mean you've got a video
where you compare the 822 to the 920
yeah if you bring out some stuff that
we've been talking about but just the on
device experience they're almost
identical in speed and fluidity and in
all honesty if nobody knows that it's an
8 22 and knows what that means someone's
gonna ask what phone is this oh it's the
the Nokia Lumia well okay and that's all
that's gonna matter because it performs
as good as even the high-end stuff which
is really quite impressive right n plus
go ahead has something which others
don't have removable battery and microSD
slot exactly and it's still a paradox to
me that this thing and it's not just a
microSD slot like thrown in as an
afterthought right it's not like this
thing where it's like yeah we'll put
this in because we can like you can
expand the memory up to 64 gigs
additional I mean that's something that
I remember blowing me away at the galaxy
s3
because I think that was the first
device I had heard of that could do that
and you know the fact I mean you can you
can have double more than double the
memory in this 822 or the 820 for that
matter as in that this you know the
supposedly higher-end Lumia 920 I mean
that's a big deal there knows question
for you yeah you've handled both devices
what does it make the Lumia 920 a
premium phone and what does this what
why is this a 22 a mid-ranger or or
what's the difference aside from the
camera things what's the difference
which sets them apart in terms of
premium and mid-range primarily on specs
you're talking the camera is is a big
one and the end the display and the
build quality and we talked about the
build quality a little bit but just just
to touch on it then kind of move on it
is unmistakable the feel in the hand you
get from these things yeah if you hold
the 822 in a vacuum like like Joe
suggests yeah no it's just that new
Nokia Lumia for verizon and it's fine
and people are like oh that's a good
weight and it kind of looks like a toy
but it feels good in the hand but then
you put the 920 in your hand and people
might say holy god this is heavy but
they are also going to like feel that
curved glass on the edge of the screen
they're going to feel that the kind of
concave nokia smile thing and the
polycarbonate even feels better and
these are both glossy devices by the way
the white 822 and the white 920 are both
have the gloss finish but because of the
removable battery you tap on the back of
the 822 like I'm doing now and it's this
kind of hollow what I'm getting on the
inside yeah this is this toy like
witches you know once again in a vacuum
considered by itself it's not going to
bother anybody you hold the 920 on the
other hand you know which one is the
premium phone and it's there's no
mistaking it then you you are you know
running them both at the same time and
on the video this didn't show very well
but the what is it the super not the
super sensitive touch because they both
have that what is nokia call their high
frame rate they're 60 Hertz thing on the
screen it's like I don't know that mean
the clear clear motion or puremotion hd+
god I hate all these brand names for
features but like the the higher frame
rate the fact that the Lumia 920 screen
never really drops below 60 frames per
second
that is something that I didn't expect
to notice and I do when you go to
another device it's like oh wow that
it's it's strange it's running Windows
Phone just as smoothly but it's not
visually as smooth it's tough to explain
so it's not really a lag it's just more
of a not quite as buttery smooth see
exactly it doesn't appear visually as
buttery smooth that's still one to one
and it's still there's no lag to speak
of but it's um it's visually much
smoother maybe it's because of the
resolution um it's it's probably the
resolution in combination with the frame
rate cuz I I've been telling you I've
like I can see the frames now on a 30
FPS you know or whatever this the other
day but is my friend if you can see
frames in 30 FPS you got great eyesight
I do I well remember what I remember the
thing that one of the things that
occupies a lot of my time is running a
YouTube channel where we routinely shoot
it like you know 240 FPS and so I can I
can tell the difference between 30 and
60 pretty well but at any rate and then
there's the camera Tony you mentioned
this it and I don't want to spend all
day talking about this so this will be
the last thing I touch unless you guys
have another question the camera on the
810 in the 822 surprises the heck Adam
II because it's really good it's it's
not pure view branded it doesn't have
the optical image stabilization but it's
it delivers really really good results
especially in low light if you remember
to use the scene settings in the
viewfinder software like if you look at
the the photos I've captured in the
review you know they're not not going to
win any awards but there for a mid-range
device for an 8 megapixel mid-range
device with a sensor that small it does
a really really fantastic job especially
an idea i agree with you i had the
opportunity to review the 610 which i
believe was the first known to should
come with tango yeah well it has all
specifications and that phone aside from
the fact that it was dirt cheap also had
great camera performance so nokia does
one thing right right cameras and the
camera performance regardless but that
whether it's a premium device or am I
Granger uh well what what's interesting
is that the
Lumia 900 had a really crappy camera
remember that like the I remember
getting the 904 review for about two
weeks and I was like wow I can't believe
how bad this camera is especially since
it's calling out the carl zeiss optics
and like what's what's the deal here but
oh that's optics I thought that was a
feature where you could have your name
engraved on the back of the phone brutal
Joe is referring to the very soft metal
that was that bracketed the lens on that
thing oh god I had that thing scratched
up inside two days just from taking it
in and out of a pocket there was the
first question i asked a nokia rep when
I saw the 920 was like did you guys
change the metal on that camera bezel
and he was like yeah totally we know
it's bad so yeah we fixed it yeah um so
anyway yeah that's the 820 to take a
look at the review we've had some cool
comments on the on the YouTube the full
review video and on the comparison
videos some people are saying the 822 in
the 810 the special variants are getting
all the love and the 820 isn't getting
enough coverage and all these devices
that have the same core right there all
the 820 in spirit it's just interesting
to see these modifications done for
carriers because it's not like it's not
like the HTC 8x which is the same
Hardware almost between verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
with the exception of some radio stuff
you know I mean it's not like that it's
it's like nokia has actually built a
complete custom chassis for both
t-mobile and Verizon Wireless with this
820 variant I think that's pretty cool
even though I don't particularly like
the way it came out in this instance
speaking of Nokia stuff because we are
only halfway through our nokia news feed
Adam Lane had an awesome video up I
think it was yesterday was yesterday the
photo Beemer of story does any member
five yes yeah so nokia released this no
keys been on a tear by the way they've
been releasing apps for Windows Phone
into their nokia collection or updating
them or doing something like every day
every day I go into the everyday I go
into the Microsoft Store on my Windows
Phone devices and there's a new Nokia
collection title in there
and there's one called photo Beamer
which is really strange title for a nap
so it immediately caught my eye and this
is an awesome awesome feature if you
guys both seen the atoms video i have
but then you go on and i will ask you
something after that sure sure Tony I
mean I Joe have you seen it yes I have
seen Adams video then if you haven't
seen it it's a it's a very good video to
watch interesting concept it is awesome
and it is also also kind of cool to see
Adam Lane talk to his xbox because I
don't get that was it was an awesome
Adam lanes like yeah we're gonna just go
to a go to a YouTube year we're gonna go
to a URL in the browser here and then
I'm expecting him to like cut to a
keyboard but he like he like talks over
his shoulders like Xbox go to the good
of the web browser or whatever he says
it's awesome it's it's a great video but
the deal is and yes I know you've been
able to do that forever I'm not of that
much of a newbie I've just haven't seen
it in a while but the deal with photo
Beamer is you go you install it on your
Windows Phone your nokia windows phone
specifically and you go to a URL on
either a computer or a you know a
computer attached to a TV or whatever
anything with a web browser you go to
photo be more calm and when you fire it
up on your phone you can scan the QR
code that pops up on the remote device
on the TV on the computer whatever
you're using to visit photo be more calm
and it creates a data link between your
device and the device you're using to
show your photos and then you can swipe
through your gallery and it displays
photos from your gallery on the larger
screen around the remote screen and it
does the transitions and with swipes and
yeah it's really pretty well done it's
really really awesome and I mean I
that's all you have to do is seriously
you fire up photo memory you scan the QR
code boom you have a connection and you
just swipe right from your hand and it
changes on the screen it's not
instantaneous said there is a delay I
actually managed to get like a five or
six second delay between photos at one
point but I mean it's it's such a cool
simple free app and it's something that
I think I I'm still stunned it well at
how well it works for her
simple it is yeah so to explain the the
concept and please a little bit of the
delay being a web guy in my other life
you've got your device that has this app
on it you've got any device that has a
web browser so in this case Adam uses
xbox but anything with a web browser
will work or should work and then have a
connection yes and an internet
connection on both sides so the QR code
essentially just sets up a session
between your phone and that particular
web browser the phone then we'll upload
that image and those images can be
relatively large and your internet
connection may be relatively slow to
some server somewhere that then it has
to download from that server to the web
browsers so there's going to be some
inherent delay especially as we get into
very very high resolution images right
on so it's not just going from your
phone to the web browser in front of you
it's not that short it's actually going
to some server out on the internet and
back I see so it's kind of justifiable
that there's some some delay don't be
too upset with it I totally get this and
I can totally agree to the fact that
it's super cool and I understand the
difference between this and the standard
DNA which was there on LG phones from
day one but I'm trying to think of a
real-life scenario when I would find
this useful oh but you know i'll give
you one I like when I I visit my my aunt
and uncle right who have a giant big
screen TV and they're a little case ave
so they've got a web browser you know
you can browse the web on their TV if
you want you know rather than using
weather and wondering whether my handset
has DLNA support or you know and trying
to figure out that kind of stuff like
it's just as simple as like hey Uncle
Jim go to photo be more calm and let me
scan this QR code real quick boom
instantly I'm kind of showing them
pictures you know what I mean like yeah
I'm a fan of DLNA I don't know why
because maybe I can playback videos and
music too yeah and and that that's
actually a functionality gap that I
would like to see filled now G is that
possible with something like this with
photo Beamer can you pass any kind
any kind of data through an app like
this from a psychological standpoint
yeah technologically speaking yeah yeah
so I mean I wonder if that will be a
future enhancement and maybe maybe
they'll go premium with it can't be you
know it can't be cheap too I guess it's
nokia paying for this some for the
server space or no i actually didn't do
enough research on where photo beamer
came from i don't know if they devised
it or they bought it or they're just
offering photo beamer under their name
and it's made by another company i don't
know is there an equivalent on on other
app stores for this guys do you know off
the top of your head like android or iOS
mm-hmm i haven't seen one hmm but either
I like Tony think that DLNA is where
we're going it's taking us a long time
to get there Apple decided to invent
their own thing which they always do
they've got what is an air player waking
yeah yeah they've got airplay which
works great if you've got an entire
Apple ecosystem running or if you've got
an android that can take advantage of
that because we can do stuff like that
because we're Android so this photo
Beamer is is kind of a an in-between you
don't have to have the apple ecosystem
you don't have to have a DLNA setup at
home or at and Martha's house configured
all you gotta do is have some screen
with some browser and it'll work from
your phone guaranteed it just works I
think if it fills a gap for the time
being but DLNA will eventually as soon
as it gets you know broader adoption
across Aunt Martha's house will replace
it well basically if you have a computer
which is connected to the Internet and
that computer runs windows from
Microsoft you already have the backend
necessary for DLNA all you need is a
phone which supports the RNA which most
of the phones do and then you're all set
you just connected the same Wi-Fi
network and you're you're good to go one
of these days I'm gonna go ahead and try
out DLNA and it's the coolest thing ever
I'm gonna go ahead and real once you do
it it's awesome yeah it sounds icky but
it's awesome well no you know what this
is gay photo Beamer is geeky but it's
one of those gee whiz features that's
another thing
right way I feel like DLNA is something
that is still firmly rooted in geekiness
and you try and you kind of bring up
DLNA to a friend it's when they ask
about the features on your phone and the
guy I feel like maybe my eyes were at
least would kind of glaze over like what
is that acronym that I don't care about
oh it's about connecting two TVs who
cares but you show them like this
something that doesn't require much in
the way of setup at all you do this QR
code scan with your phone that nobody is
nobody's heard about except for the past
month thanks to the ad push and like
what's this weird of doing with his
Lumia oh holy crap how'd you do that I
feel like this is kind of gonna do a
little bit not much but a little bit
toward pushing Windows Phone toward you
know amor oh wow gee whiz that's that's
cool can I do that those are clean thing
I was like wait a minute um anyway let's
let's let's let's let's move on because
there's there's Saturn news and then
happier news from from the world of
Nokia and this is weird they have nokia
has sold its headquarters building and
they've stayed on as a primary tenant so
they're not leaving but they sold their
headquarters in a espoo espoo be
pronounced head its espoo only in
English SS ball yes bo I think it says I
think I don't know but I think okay um
did see this is sad because I'm just I
think I just finished reading some
stories about like a benign 20 sales
numbers are up three hundred percent for
Windows Phone whatever that means and
you know nokia lumia demand is very high
and lumia pre-orders are matching the
iphone pre-orders in the netherlands and
and then it's like no kiss selling their
headquarters and that's you know
obviously this isn't this doesn't mean
the companies like folding or anything
like that but a company it is it's not a
good sign this is exactly it's like this
is what i want to ask you guys for your
input on i mean i don't think it's I
don't think there's any debate that a
company that's doing well doesn't sell
its own headquarters building but how
bad do you how bad a sign do you think
this is very really very been really it
just just put yourself in their shoes
and imagine your needs
to sell your car or your home and stay
there as a tenant just for you to get
your hands on more cash in idle mode it
literally the title loan you could
barely but ok how many factories has not
yet closed in the best how many people
were fired there's there's nothing left
to sell from nakia which is not
essential it's except for the 4 THQ
right so now I wonder though I mean it
so they got 220 million dollars us for
this for this thing which isn't a whole
lot of cash and grand scheme of things
but as Stephen says in his story you
know is it could give the company some
breathing room while while the Windows
Phone adoption because it comes on so I
feel like this is the point at which it
when the Lumia line really has to take
hold and it we don't know yet whether
that's going to happen on Windows Phone
8 or not but it doesn't look bad it
certainly looks like a much brighter
picture than it did for the initial wave
of Lumias running Windows Phone 7 so do
you think that I'm still hopeful for
Nokia's futures I guess what I'm saying
even though they sold their their
headquarters building but and that was
that foolish is that typa don't I think
this gives a totally new meaning to
nokia is all in on Windows stuff I think
you are totally I would have to concur I
don't ever think that hope is a bad
thing you know let's never scourge being
hopeful because nokia is a fabulous
player they make wonderful hardware
we've seen that that the Lumias look
really really nice and just in my
opinion is an android guy we really need
that other player in in the arena to
make things better mmm for all of us
selling your corporate headquarters to
me just says we couldn't get a loan to
help get us through this rocky period
because nobody wants to give us money
the bankers aren't hopeful so let's
start selling assets that then we're
either buying back which means instead
of paying back 220 million it's 212 20
million plus tax right or they're
leasing it which is
they're not even gonna get it back there
they're just throwing that money down
the drain and it's like Brent you're
just following up on what joe just said
it's not even naki asphalt I mean nakia
is doing everything in its power to
bring good devices out there with good
looks good materials totally it's the
fact that Nokia now depends on the
success of a product which comes from
another company what they have very
little control over yes or or or say
they did their best they brought
everything which was in Nokia's power
even their HQ they brought it to the
game and now it's no more up to them
that's an interesting look success or
failure that that that that's a very
good point and the phrasing that you
just used Tony was very interesting like
nokia has has really really put itself
completely at the mercy of Windows
Phones success or failure and that is
going to be viewed as either well just
another thing they had to do or you know
maybe in a year or two down the line
when the company is flush with cash
again as a result of the success of this
Lumia effort it's going to be viewed as
the the darkest day when nobody really
knew whether it was going to you know
succeed or flop and it'll be interesting
to see which way it goes i will say Joe
I agree I think I think hope is never a
bad thing and to inject a little bit of
hope before we move on here you know
sprint did this sprint did something
very similar they didn't sell their
headquarters but sprint the
third-largest carrier in the United
States sold its network basically it's a
it back I think about three or four
years ago when it was doing really
really poorly it basically made a move
to get rid of all of its physical
Holdings it sold its towers and to
another company I don't know if it was
Eric center tower co or something like
that and basically just said no we're
going to be a service provider we don't
want to deal with the real estate aspect
of this and that was their PR spin but
of course the real deal was that they
were losing so much money that they
needed a quick infusion of cash to stay
alive I think
you know just to be a jerk because I can
yeah you guys imagine that board meeting
when Stephen Elop came in together with
the I don't know probably the CFO or
somebody who who knows numbers when he
wakes up in the morning and just says it
says stuff about things and he's like
guys we need to sell this yep can you
imagine I know I mean that would be a
hell of a meeting to have right before
lunch but my point is that sprint still
exists you know what I mean and they're
actually doing really well now as a
result of that move that they had to
make and it's that thing you have to do
right it's like wow I've had this pocket
watch for forever but if I don't sell it
on eBay right now I'm not gonna be able
to pay rent like you know I've been in
that situation before it sucks but i buy
your pocket watch yeah yeah you know I
appreciate it I wouldn't wish you'd
spend a little more money on it anyway
um we'll see how it alternately plays
out for nokia just a really interesting
not the brightest chapter in the
company's history but i still have hope
for their survival but not based on
their low-end offerings nokia is
introducing the Lumia 620 and Tony I
will definitely want to hear your take
on this as the guy on the team who i
think has handled the lowest end nokia
device there is and that's the 610 right
there was at the time the 620 is a
really really cheap windows phone 8
device that its primary like point of
Attraction seems to be that it has a
double like finish it's a two hundred
fifty dollar phone first of all unlocked
which is pretty cool but what is it like
they did these are brightly colored back
covers on this lumia 620 that are
finished first in one color of
polycarbonate and then sprayed over with
another color I was probably carbonate
or something like that d i don't know
all i know is there's a there's like a
lime green and a bright yellow phone on
my screen and a pink and blue and a
black and a white yeah so these are
nothing to get excited about and we kind
of bandied around an email yesterday on
the team like why is what is the deal
with this like this low-end Lumia pushed
this 510 this
620 the 610 the seven I mean it will
tell you wrote this story what are your
thoughts on this device and where's it
going I think Nokia is is thinking in in
two different ways first of all we've
heard I think recently but also at the
beginning of this year to that in order
to succeed in being a competitor for
Android nokia needs cheaper devices
because android devices are very cheap I
mean low end and some mid-range devices
so in order to grab if they want to have
a chance at grabbing a small chunk of
that market they need cheap windows
phones and on the other end Stephen ela
every time I listened to him or I watch
his keynotes he is also talking about
those people who want to be or who nokia
wants them to be first-time smartphone
users the first connection to the
internet they want to connect 1 billion
people to the internet they try that
with Asha phones in the emerging markets
and they're trying to do that again with
this lumia 620 with the 610 and as you
mentioned with the other low end phones
yeah whether if it's a good thing to
have a such a low-end phone in the
portfolio I say yes because Windows
Phone whether if it's 7 7.5 7.8 I'm sure
it will be or eight it is designed in
such way that even with lower specs it
will still run buttery smooth and once
you get that experience of course give
or take an application or two like Skype
which are not working you can have that
experience be part of an ecosystem and
Nokia as well as Microsoft are desperate
to get their hands on you customers now
this is a very very interesting point
because I we talked about this a little
bit in the email thread as well like I
totally get that impulse right there is
still so many this is the refrain of
struggling smartphone makers everywhere
there are so many non smartphone users
out there let's capture them let's make
sure they're on our platform first we
need to get them but you know I feel
like people who are on dumb phones still
and I'm not talking about the people who
just want to be on a flip phone forever
and hate smartphones I'm talking about
regular people who are eventually going
to upgrade to a smartphone don't care
like
when they dream at night about the
smartphone they're going to get they
don't dream about a mid-range one cent
phone on a contract they don't dream
about a hundred and fifty dollar phone
that that's you know just cheap thing
that's I look it's multiple colors you
not and even though they are the end
consumer and the target of this device
they are really not think of this and
introducing the equation the carriers
when you go to a carrier let's say any
carrier in this world will probably buy
a couple of hundred thousand devices
from you Nokia and we'll put it on an
offer either a prepay offer or a low-end
cheap contract and here's the phone for
free or here's the phone for one dollar
or one other currency and that's how
they need to capture users but I don't
carriers like Kent carriers tell a
manufacturer to take it to take their
product back if it doesn't move that
well the world the globe the earth is
kind of huge so you were not necessarily
talking about the US market only here
we're talking about those carriers in
other regions you up to which are not
the top of one two or three carriers
which are third fourth fifth carriers
which need also to have something
attractive in their portfolio no I get
that and yeah I'm not no I'm not taking
in a mirror in a mirror centric view of
this all I'm saying is like I remember
what happens when you know like best buy
best buy is a huge retailer in the
States it's just you know it's an
example I have because it's fresh in my
mind and when they got shipments of the
HP TouchPad and it turned out to be a
flop you know there were those rumors
that were being reported on words like
best buy is best buy wants to send two
hundred thousand touchpad units back to
HP you know I mean cuz he's they can the
carriers do have the option to do that
if a device doesn't move right can't
they just tell the manufacturers to take
it back like I don't know I don't know I
don't know enough about the business
relationship to think it all depends on
with contractor comes with the device
not but they've always got 11 little
tool in their toolbox and that's well
we're not gonna order any of your new
device that you have such a big media
push behind until we clear out all your
inventory to ensure right
and in fire said yeah there since that's
never gonna happen cuz the new ones out
then they can negotiate better deals and
swaps and whatnot yeah I don't know
about you guys but I can see this lumia
620 in a nice colored box with the
carrier logo on it going for I don't
know ninety nine dollars or or forty
nine euros with a prepaid sim inside it
with a number and five dollars or five
euro credit which you can talk and then
top up sure I just don't know I can see
it too I just don't know if the
customers that are looking for that kind
of like really bare bones smartphone
plan are gonna wanna well you and I are
looking when we're going to Berlin or
Barcelona well yeah but I'm not gonna
get a 620 give me the 920 all right
let's I want to I want to save my
surface RT discussion for when Brandon
is back cuz he and I have to trade notes
and we're running a little behind but um
while we're talking about companies in
decline just to close out windows phone
really quickly oh geez HTC can we yeah
just come on man i am so i hate it i
feel like this happens every every
quarter because you know what it does
every single quarter HJC announces their
numbers and today there are thirty
one-point-four percent down compared to
the same quarter in november 2011 to the
month yeah to the month right okay yeah
and october numbers were 61 percent down
right i'm looking at the right up that
you did here Tony this is now you
updated this story with a metric that am
I reading this right is is maybe would
give us a little bit of hope I was a bit
perverted when I when I came up with
this headline HTC is 31.4 percent down
compared to November 2011 but is 23
point eighteen percent up compared to
last month so in the picture of this
moment they are climbing but compared to
last year they are still down so they
are on a climbing trend why do we think
they're on a climbing trend is that a
combination of the 8x paired with the
DNA I think yes that's in so we have
October's numbers from last year to see
if there if this is ciktim cyclical or
if this
some real recovery a really good
question here somewhere but not in my
reach yeah unwinding the October numbers
were well October's numbers were 61
percent down from the previous October
yeah i'm not sure and we we probably
will need some more some more time to
fully analyze this time which we don't
really have but we say this almost every
podcast we love you HTC and we really
really really are kind of always
plugging for them to succeed but
hopefully this decline that we're tired
of seeing can be arrested by this
mysterious flagship device which will
carry us into the android segment of our
podcast which was is very very new new
rumor news i think it's only about two
or three days old there is a rumored m7
and this is not the droid DNA right this
is not the international version of the
droid DNA this isn't the what is that
called the deluxe but as far as we know
as far as we know it's something rumored
for early 2013 this comes from an
analyst i think and it's anything that
comes from analysts i'm kind of i'm
always like all right well what are you
know we'll see but it looks like a lot
of outlets pick this up and it looks
like this m7 at this point still looks
maybe like it could be legit as a
flagship model scheduled for a q1 2013
release this could be very well the
deluxe is the LX or the j butterfly /
droid DNA for for europe or
international use but i think and this
is my personal opinion HTC made a very
very big mistake with releasing the
droid DNA only on one carrier and only
in one country I would have done it
differently released an international
version probably one or two weeks after
that go with a carrier and capture the
holiday season now if they do want to
come out with a phone which will
probably be the international version of
the DNA and they will do I dare they
will do it's not going to be earlier
than CES or MDC then that's already too
late see I thought that it was coming
much
than that I thought that it was kind of
like on the roadmap and already they're
like ready for ready for shipping right
now but it's it's not is that that
correct it should have I believe it
should have been their first priority
well here's the thing though right when
I can see why they would do this like it
I agree that they should not miss the
holiday season at all but when you do
the droid DNA and you put it on verizon
what happens is as we've seen in our
comments a bunch of people on the
internet and I mean hundreds of people
go what America only this is crap and it
generates a whole bunch of buzz for the
device and then when you release it
internationally there's this kind of
built up too mad as long as you don't
wait too long so I can understand why
they would have made that that kind of
you know decision but I I just I don't
know if it's going to ultimately pay out
or not I know the droid DNA is really
hot and HTC probably doesn't have the
money you know how we complain about HTC
not advertising enough completely
Samsung well I don't think HTC has the
budget necessarily to to match Samsung
on that so they need a carrier partner
in the states to say yeah listen name
this thing the Droid and we'll pick up
you know half or three-quarters of the
marketing bill for you to move these
units you know I don't know I'm sorry I
lost you dare completely no I didn't
lose you so long I'll chime in on
samsung has done a really good job with
creating brand recognition for their
devices you can go and get a galaxy s3
on virtually any carrier out there and
all pretty much the same time you know
obviously there's some a month here a
month there where you can't but that
leads up to the anticipation within a
quarter let's say you have complete
saturation across the major carriers of
this wonderful fabulous device that
Samsung's leading with HTC has well
they've got this platform and here it is
on verizon USA and we don't know if it's
kind of coming anywhere else and it just
slows down and the buzz and the hype and
all of that synergistic marketing that
could happen
or the device just Peters decoupled from
the carrier isn't there right right yeah
and you know it's a chicken or the egg
thing too because you know Samsung has
gotten to a place they've built
themselves up to a place where yeah they
have a lot of buzz in this because a
very successful brand name with the
galaxy s2 galaxy note but you know and
they've gotten that respect from the
carriers where they can push a launch on
all four US carriers and a lot of
worldwide carriers of the same almost
the same time in HTC isn't there yet and
I think that they have to play ball with
with a carrier that says yes we'll give
you an exclusive and yes we'll we'll
spend some advertising dollars on your
behalf but it has to be an exclusive you
can't release an international version 4
X months if I were HTC I'm not sure I
would be doing anything different
exclusivity is just killing everybody
it's gonna kill innovation and it's
ultimately going to come back and hurt
the carriers well look what it did for
the iphone though right the one
exception yes I don't know I don't know
it's it's it's it's a crazy thing are
you going to get one Tony when it when
it turns international absolutely and I
would have I would have probably spared
enough money to get one unlock this
holiday season but HTC didn't seem to
want me as their customer since I'm an
international customer you know I chose
this is this is why I'm so bitter and
angry yeah from a business perspective
I'm always aiming or in thinking I
should always aim at capturing a huge
chunk of the market instead of a limited
one you know we can argue that I don't
know everything or anything about this
maybe they have problems at their
factories with yield rates and and stuff
like that it's still the way I see it
the HTC deluxe or whatever its name will
be would have probably outsold and this
is going to be bold the galaxy s free
this holiday season that is a bold that
is a solid bold claim but you know what
I'm not ready to disagree with you
because it has the buzz behind it yeah
um and it's a great phone and it is it's
a great it's a great fun we talked about
with a great company podcast and one in
a while but here's the thing Tony I
don't think that HTC made that decision
you know spitefully or thinking I think
that they are really are
they have their hands tied I really
think that they're in a rough spot and
they need to kind of take offers as they
come and if if Verizon came along with a
sweetheart deal because for whatever
reason verizon needed to you know re re
solidify their droid brand in the
absence of some compelling motorola
offerings because the razr maxx an HD
and whatever are not really bringing the
heat then you know if your HTC and you
don't have many options maybe that's
what you have to go with and then hopes
Italy I agree with you but I think
verizon or any other carrier could have
waited one month and after an
international launch because by the time
HTC comes out with this they will not be
the first 1080p international global
phone on the market anymore because
Samsung snaps its fingers and they can
do this quickly and from what we've seen
LG is already preparing the follow-up to
the optimus G with 1080p screen going to
AT&amp;amp;T and I bet LG will also release it
globally yeah yeah and we talked about
it we weren't planning on talking about
that but just to drop that into the feed
we are getting reports of what is at the
e 960 Tony yes and is that is that the
thing we've talked about is the Optimus
g2 or is that another device ID forgot
that is that it sure looks like it's
going to be the follow-up to the optimus
G we've heard some rumors of a 1080p LG
phone the f 2 20 if i recall well now
this i believe will be and this is my
speculation the international version of
that phone which will probably be a
carrier phone and south korea and if my
predictions turn out to be true we'll
probably see this phone it's either at
CES or at mwc but i think it will be CES
for the AT&amp;amp;T version and mwc will be all
about the optimus g2 or whatever the
main will be right we'll see i think the
the 1080p revolution is certainly
certainly upon us and i agree that HTC
may have missed an opportunity here to
milk their time as the only 1080p phone
on the market by not doing the deluxe on
an international scale first and that's
a point i made an a 22 review where I
was like you know
yeah you can deal with the yesterday's
display with the display with
yesterday's specs you know for a couple
months but the more 1080p screen and
start flooding the market the worse it's
going to look when you look at your
phone and you realize it has a display
from 2011 yeah so it is a big big force
in the market and I will see how it goes
for HTC and LG both both companies we
like Tony you like LG I think better
than anyone else that I know so I've got
my fingers you can't leave me out of
that I I'm a big LG man as well I didn't
know that Joe well it's you know what
you have an opportunity to talk about LG
for a little bit because Joe Levi has
taken another look at the Nexus 4 we've
been doing some stuff at pocket now
recently where we've been kind of
sending our review devices to different
members of the team so we can get
different perspectives on it because we
all have different views as is evidenced
by by all of our podcasts and all of our
discussions and I had another look at
the surface RT this week and I'm going
to talk about that next week when
Brandon's back on the show but Joe has
taken another look at the Nexus 4 and I
read your piece Joe and I liked it a lot
and part of these pieces that is fun is
that you can you your expectations have
already been set right you've read
you've read your teammates review or if
you're a listener you've read 11 pocket
now team members review and now there's
somebody else with a completely
different take on it saying well okay
well here's here's my view I agree with
these things I don't agree with these
things and here's what I think overall
overall Joe just what's your because
neither Tony nor I have handled a nexus
4 what's you will bring me one in
Barcelona will I is that the plan yes
you will Oh terrific I just don't know
it yet well now I do I'll r I'll add it
to the list I might bring myself one um
based on based on what Joe tells us now
I mean Joe how how and love are you with
this thing and or how much do you want
to get it out of your house well first
of all there's two different things that
we've got to discuss the first is
Brandon when he did his review it ran
through everything ran through the
equation and came up with a cumulative
score of seven out of ten right and that
is causing a lot of comment and
discussion not only on our review but
so on my not really rebuttal to the
review but the the second look at it yes
so if you haven't been over to the the
website make sure you read it I
essentially go in and justify Brandon
seven out of ten this is a seven out of
ten phone so that's the first side out
of the way boom that having been said
this is my favorite phone that I have
ever used or none what it is my daily
driver I love this thing I would not go
back to a Galaxy Nexus I would not go
back to the sgs3 this is my phone of
choice seven out of ten notwithstanding
if you have any doubt about getting this
phone unless one of those things that
reduced the score you know cost points
in the review just really gets under
your skin LT you want this phone realty
eat no I don't care LTE this phone gets
13 to 15 megabit per second on my t
mobile HSPA right now I've beat that
point in the ground alright but that is
that's amazing and this is without the
wireless charging or right this is just
the device itself yeah this is just the
device itself just checking just
checking um that's that's really not
what I not what I expected to hear now
this is a good point and and I want to
just mention this briefly you're talking
about a phone that is your favorite
phone basically ever that scored a 7 out
of 10 but you agree with the seven out
of 10 this is the paradox that I don't
think a lot of people understand and
rightfully so because it's very
confusing how can your favorite phone
ever score not low but score it
thoroughly or as the Lumia 820 to write
in it well exactly how can how can your
favorite phone in the world match
numerically the review i just gave to
this phone that we spent 20 minutes
discussing how it looks like a bar of
soap right and that is really the core
the way we've been doing our reviews we
deduct points for certain areas that
aren't done up to snuff the nexus 4 is
slippery it is more slippery and gross
and slimy feeling
than the samsung galaxy s3 which I just
ride yeah from four in four heads I just
abhor that feel and the msg today you
know we reduced points for that mm-hmm
cuz it slides out I able to top of that
yeah I you know just for that I can
adjust my my daily activities and at the
end of the day I I can get past that
because what's inside of that device and
the screen on that device are just so
much better we can't give super extra
bonus points for those that cancel out
the negative points for the other you
know that wouldn't be fair to two other
devices that we've reviewed in the past
so it's got to take a hit for stuff that
doesn't do perfectly or doesn't do up to
the quality that we'd expect but we can
still give full points for the other
stuff that we do expect and when you
average things out it drops it down so
the the point if I've got any
statistician friends out there in the
audience we're averaging things here
which has an inherent bias the three
points that that this phone lost in my
opinion are outliers they're things that
if we would have done a median or if we
would have done another type of of
figuring of that score the outlier on
the edges would have been dropped off
and it might have scored better so are
you are you worried are you worried
about dropping it I want to know yeah
this is I'm very I'm so worried about
dropping it that I did not take the the
back protective cover off you left the
film on film I know yeah Tony makes a
very good point it's not going to help
just gonna hold the shattered pieces
together well I funny I put some thought
into it and I thought glass especially
Gorilla Glass usually is pretty robust
and durable until it starts getting
scratched and when it starts getting
scratched then it's more prone to
breakage so if I can keep that back
sheet of glass from getting scratched
i'm going to i told you so many times
don't place the nexus 4 on your stash of
diamonds
haha how did you know I had a stash of
time do you remember bags that's the
only thing that can scratch your phone
well but your glass back though I i I've
scratched up glass last front moans last
front tablets just just did it and I
just did it to my lumia 920 it's in my
pocket just dropped my 920 on its face
twice in the span of 45 seconds one
night and I wasn't even you know
impaired I was just stupid I was just
dumb and I've scratched it up already
and that's girl of glass too i mean you
know class class scratches particularly
when I guess particularly when your
phone the phone that's driving it into
the ground as 185 grams heavy but like
it what is I don't know I get so worried
when I think about buying the nexus 4
because it is the google device i would
like to carry first i bet so many others
and on a fairly related note without
touching the nexus 4 i'd give it a zero
out of ten just because LG italy said
that they will not bring the phone to
Italy oh did you guys miss that spot no
I saw it in the headlines but you know
this is strange I mean what what does
Google and LG think there are like five
or six Google Play stores around the
world where he can buy this phone what
about countries like Italy Romania okay
yeah other countries which don't have
the phone how can LG it's only say we're
not gonna bring this phone to Italy I
mean just screw those million people
that's an interesting question I mean I
did you know I don't know I feel like
it's getting so much buzz I'll tell you
why because it's probably because it's
getting so much buzz the United States
is because of its price point and
because of its value for the price um
that you know we I don't think they I
don't want to say LG doesn't need those
million prospective customers in room
however many million prospective
customers you know I I just think that
they don't they can't afford to take
their focus off of what they're trying
to do in regions where it is cheap right
now like America yeah I think that this
is a backfiring thing I think that this
happens when you heavily and I mean
heavily subsidized a phone like Google
does with the nexus 4 and then poor LG
cannot sell this phone for its true
price because
people say okay its one third of the
price in the US or other countries yeah
that's because Google subsidizes it yeah
it could be you know I don't know I feel
like I feel like when you boost the
price if I think of a nexus 4 at a more
conventional price the price that it is
sold for in some non American countries
right now or that it's going to be sold
for I can't imagine ever buying it I the
only one of the driving factors behind
the nexus 4 for me is the fact that it
is so cheap so Tony I think that that
reinforces your point I think it's you
know that's that visibility may have may
have shot LG and Google and the foot and
it in an international sense but or
maybe maybe just maybe LT says okay I
don't need you to buy this phone and
italy by the optimus G it's the same
thing it's mine and this is the price
for it right well there is there is that
as well and the optimus G is we've said
time and time again is a really good
device so it could be I don't know if
it's tactically speaking I don't know
what LG's thinking there but i do want
to stay on the nexus 4 just just well we
before we jump over to the to the other
Nexus device but Joe you've got cm10
running on that thing yeah yes and I
have not seen your I've not seen
anything on that because I've been too
busy with other stuff how how is that I
mean I have not run ass antigen mod
build in a very long time and I feel
like what the nexus 4 just as kind of
like putting on my average Joe hat it's
like what this is the nexus for this has
got stock Android already i'm getting
updates why do i want a sandwich in my
build is it just for like little things
like UI enhancements what's what do you
like better about the CM build then then
stock jelly bean you're not the first
person to ask that in fact a lot of
comments on both the video and the
article are are our readers asking the
same question its stock Android why
would you want to custom rom it which
really kind of confuses me because the
reason i get nexus devices is so i can
customer on them it's easier it's it's
so much nicer to be able to do that and
in my opinion that's
kind of what a Nexus device is designed
to do that's one of its main purposes is
so people out there in the community can
can root and confess some ramen can just
go to town on it and it's it's a nexus
that's that's what you do with it it's
there for that so to answer the
questions for for you Michael for
everybody else why cyanogenmod it has
not only the core features of Android
just the stock launcher the stock
everything else but it also takes that
and it improves upon them it takes out
some of the weird stuff that ninety
percent of the people out there want but
the ten percent of us power users could
do without we can remove that we can
toggle that off we can turn that off we
have so much more ways that we can
customize it for example i have three
home screens i use profiles I like being
able to theme my my phones my devices
and whatnot I can do all of that in
cyanogenmod and can't really do that
easily with with the stock if Brandon
were on he'd love this the AOSP browser
is the browser that comes with
cyanogenmod not chrome so I'm running
the aaos p browser he would live on my
Nexus 4 not chrome so I've got all of
those speed improvements and all of that
fun stuff never yeah yeah the second
point is looking at the the benchmark
numbers and we just ran quadrant and
geekbench which are two of the more
telling benchmarks in my opinion when we
ran those stock it performed a little
bit slower with cyanogenmod than with
the stock rom with stock configurations
as soon as we went in and started doing
some of the tweaking and just very minor
tweaking we're not talking even
overclocking just minor tweaking we
jumped up in Quadrant I scored 4908
compared to 4722 and in geekbench to 21
37 compared to 1856 so just minor tweaks
on cm10 really really improves
performance and speed without not really
battery life it lets you take the thing
into the garage and do what a nexus
phone was originally designed to do
exactly yeah I totally get that and
that's that's good i'm glad i asked the
question because I'm I did not know that
a lot of commenters we're asking the
same question but you know that's that
that I feel like asking the question I
feel like that that group that question
being pot that popular is interesting in
that it's it tells us something about
how the Nexus brand is perceived these
days I think people do forget in myself
included that the nexus one when it came
out was supposed to be was a developer
device you know was the thing you used
to tweak Android as a dev before they
kind of before regular people started
picking it up so regular people before
non-developers for you this tells you
that before when we did have the nexus
one and to a lesser extent the next s
that were marketed primarily as
developer devices the Nexus brand has
now moved out of that type of perception
into the mainstream this is now a
mainstream device oh that also gives you
all of the benefits and advantages that
a developer device would if you want it
to it gives you freedom it gives you
flexibility and you can't beat the price
I am so oh good Tony I was about to say
that I don't necessarily think that
people are buying a nexus phone or a
nexus tablet because they want to do
extreme tweaking most people probably
have learned from previous mistakes and
the huge thank you goes here to all the
carriers and OEMs who do not support
phones with timely updates because the
Nexus bird guarantees timely updates and
I think this is very important for
Android users yes yeah agreed and I
think you know that that hybrid of in
smartphones because we're going to talk
about a nexus tablet here in in like
like like 20 seconds but that hybrid of
a device like like a nexus smartphone
with a history of being a geeky
developer device with all of its timely
updates with all of its straight from
google goodness mixed with this kind of
new cachet
like hey here's this thing that's kind
of as well recognized as a galaxy brand
name but maybe not really and like you
put them it's like what is this nexus
thing what's going on that that is kind
of like it i feel like its consumer
catnip I feel like Google is still
sitting on this wonderful resource pool
with the Nexus brand that I think it's
going to continue exploiting as it goes
forward and I really hope they don't
bungle it up because they didn't manage
to torpedo it with the Galaxy Nexus
debacle on verizon wireless probably
because it's just one carrier in one
country globally and that's good and it
looks like they're determined not to
repeat that in the future as we've seen
with the nexus 4 where they're not
they're like screw your carrier's you're
messing up our whole thing so we don't
need to cater to you the nexus 4 doesn't
have alt you deal with it I don't like
it but you know what it's I think it
probably was a good business decision
Joe Levi has almost the entire Nexus
collection over it over in Utah if not
the entire Nexus collection yes he
should the entire it's as he should I
agree as he should meanwhile and I'm
sitting here with my nexus 7 still
loving it but being like man I would
like it I'd like to get my hands on a
nexus 4 well you want to get that nexus
10 back in your hands because it's got
that super super awesome back that is
entirely true I if the listeners you
don't remember i unbox to the nexus 10
because it was shipped to me and then i
sent it immediately out to Joe Levi for
his full review that's been posted I
really liked the hardware I really
wanted to get to know the device and
having spent some time with the surface
now I'm used to landscape tablets so Joe
briefly because we don't have too much
time what was the nexus 10 changed your
life how does it factor into all this
Nexus talk I have been a 10 inch tablet
hater since I got my motorola xoom I
just think it's too big it's too clunky
that forms that factor is just it's too
big it's too big to be practical for me
to carry around with me as soon as I got
the nexus 10 that changed it's about the
same size as the zoom quite a bit
thinner quite a bit lighter at least you
know I don't have the numbers in front
of me but it feels lighter ok on it
finally
is a 10 inch tablet that I would carry
with me and even the Lyman android guy I
don't burst into flames when I pick up a
fruity device so I've I've touched iPads
and I'm i can compare those as well
they're still in my bucket of 10-inch
tablets that I just don't like to feel
to carry around there's something about
the nexus 10 that that I don't know if
it's the contours I don't know if it's
the grippy back it probably has a lot to
do with the front firing speakers and
probably an awful lot to do with that
gorgeous screen that makes the nexus 10
the first 10 inch tablet that I don't
mind carrying around with me and
actually enjoy using and that's held
true since you received it and that's
that still true today you still use this
still true today yes interesting what do
you what's the app situation like I know
that the Android tenant shab situation
hasn't changed much how are you dealing
with apps that are stretching to fill
that that big hole screen says I mean
how painful is it yeah it is well Scotty
it's not as painful as it might be for
some others although I have had
experience with you know with the iPad
and some very beautiful apps over there
I don't use it daily so I'm not used to
this tablet centric makes it look
beautiful display that some of the apps
that have been custom crafted for the
10-inch iPads you know the I'm just not
used to it so when I come over to my
nexus 10 I'm used to those same apps on
the neck 27 I'm used to the same apps on
a nexus 4 or a Galaxy Nexus and they
look almost identical there's not a
disconnect and it doesn't look bad to me
now seeing how some of the people have
built their tablet based apps there's so
much room for improvement I agree and
that's where Tony says it's painful it's
just not it doesn't get under my skin
like it has a lot of other people and I
can only encourage developers to to
start taking advantage of the space and
and making their apps flow
and fit better and better utilize the
entire space that you have to work on
look for me it's not a game changer or a
deal breaker to not have those special
format maps let me ask you it as an app
developer as a guy's you because you've
written a nap or two in your time right
I've got a couple apps in the market in
the entrance to the point that you're
going toward I'm a web developer and as
a web developer you're more I has to
develop for I don't know what streamwise
my stuff is going to be displayed on
right right right but I mean just just
philosophically speaking as putting on
your fear broad developer head well you
know say you were developing an app for
Android would the nexus 10 inspire you
to develop a beautiful large screen
android app is it enough is that is it a
beautiful enough piece of hardware to to
spur you to spend some effort on it
specifically more so than just the nexus
10 seeing that Google is now officially
backing that size and that resolution I
put more stock in it now than I have
before I mean we've had 10 inch tablets
before the resolutions have been
different across all of them essentially
so if I were sitting back and saying I
don't think this 10 inch fact form
factor is going to take off in the
Android environment this would now be my
indication to say okay let's put some
time into making our stuff look gorgeous
on a 10 inch tablet I think that's where
we're Joe just hit the nail on its head
head on straight on and the problem with
google and i don't know much about
coding applications but i think that the
problem with applications for the
android platform is not screen size with
screen resolution for instance on the
apple ecosystem the 10-inch form factor
has two resolutions or the tablet the
broader concept the tablet form factor
has two resolutions in the Android world
a tablet whether if it's seven inches or
10 inches has multiple I don't know how
many but at least three or four
resolutions so I think that that's
problem Jake Odum application I'm sorry
I'd say it's got even more than that I'd
go six or eight different resolutions
that is just in red and then probably
that many again on smartphones so it's
it's whether whether Googlers or android
fans love it or not it's this
fragmentation that probably kills the I
don't know the effort or the decision to
go with a tablet dedicated application
hmm that kill me if I would be a
developer yeah you've got to put more
work into well not only just developing
but into testing I mean you've got to
have these devices in hand to be able to
really know how it's going to look and
how it's going to behave the emulators
they try in fact I haven't even gone
back and seen do we have a 10-inch
emulator in the android sdk I'd assume
we do but the emulators suck they then
what resolution would that views exactly
you know they don't give you the true
feel of what you have in hand you've
also got a numbers game to look at how
many people are running at that
resolution versus the other where do you
want to put your time do you want to put
it into creating new levels for your
game or adding these ten new features or
fixing these ten new bugs more do you
want to put that time into something
that you know five percent of your
customers are going to see because they
have these large resolution tablets so
it's it's all just a business game it's
where do we want to to invest our
efforts where are we going to get the
most return on that investment and this
finally is the tipping point where we're
going to start seeing more and more
emphasis put on the 10-inch tablets the
higher resolutions because those numbers
are starting to increase and it's
becoming more justifiable from a
business perspective to do so so the
nexus 7 had its own kind of built in
sales motivator with its very very low
price the nexus 10 is still pricey and
you know maybe rightfully so because
it's packing a really high res screen
and whatnot and it's light and beautiful
and whatever but it's like what is it
starts at 399 doesn't
am i right am I wrong yeah yeah yeah
that's that's right price point yeah so
it's very well and competitively priced
when compared to other 10-inch tablets
right but it's still not a 7-inch not an
insult me it's not that it's not
anywhere near in the ballpark in the
next 27 this is kind of like 199
threshold of like ah man I can rock and
I can spare 199 so in light of that I
mean how big a success to you each think
this is going to be to close out the
nexus 10 before we move on oh I think it
will be I think the nexus 10 as it is
right now will probably take a lot of
users from other companies who are
making 10-inch tablets and I'm not
necessarily referring to Samsung even
though the note 10.1 isn't such a great
advice personal opinion here but i think
that the nexus 10 with its high
resolution and great build quality and
the nexus factor has got what it takes
to to launch okay Joe I'd have to agree
this this finally gives people a Google
branded device that is at least on par
with the Apple equivalent devices and
for a little bit better price it gives
people another viable option where they
might not have known about samsung or
motorola or some of the other companies
that are making android-powered 10-inch
tablets and it puts that on on the radar
for them it's not going to be the ninety
nine dollar or the 199 Nexus 7 that's
you know it competing with ebook readers
alright but it's still priced
appropriately for what you're going to
get and it's going to it's going to
succeed it's going to do well and we're
going to see new versions of it down the
road not to use the buzz word from 2010
but the word that I think of when I
think of the new Nexus brand is
ecosystem and I have said this on a
podcast before I'll say it again I do
kind of wake up mornings with insane
ideas that I'm just going to go onto my
computer go to google.com / nexus and
order all three of them because the idea
of having a device a device in each form
factor small medium and large running
the same platform and
that play nicely with each other with
things like Google Chrome sink you know
what I mean being able to hop from one
device to another and kind of have this
faux continuous client experience is
incredibly alluring Michael Fisher you
are finally understanding Apple fans who
own the iPhone the iPad Mini and the I i
yes indeed yeah that is true that no
totally absolutely I get that and it
goes beyond just that you've also got
the google play store which now is
finally a viable alternative to itunes
where you can have all of your music
collection you can have your works you
can have your movies you can have your
movie and they're available across all
of those platforms as well yeah and then
you combine that with wireless display
and you can watch all of that on your
big screen TV without wires there's your
you know your airplay competitor as well
so Google is finally to the point where
ya from a device and media perspective
they are a real competitor yeah and
that's six that's real exciting to see
because I think it's going to turn up
the heat under apples but to uh that's
just one one thing to note here yes they
do they are there but what they need to
work on is to make the content available
and more regions I can understand about
devices about six five or six or seven
max Play stores they need to do that
with content with books with movies
applications are all over in every
Google Play Store and every region but
if I in Romania I want to buy a nap I
can do that with no books no movies no
music mmm yeah that's entire Apple has
the lead I agree and I feel your pain
google is taking things a little bit a
little bit differently as an app
developer I can tell where i want my app
distributed i can say i don't want this
to go to Romania because I'm afraid Tony
might pick it up don't sell it there or
sell it in Romania for 10 times as much
as I would anywhere else I have that
control as a developer as developers we
want our apps as far and as wide as we
can go and
as level of a playing field on price as
we can that generally speaking the same
type of distribution model can be
applied to other content not just apps
so that's books that's movies that's
yeah there are copyrights and right
that's the other people these license
agreements you have distribution models
you've got exclusivity agreements you've
got all this stuff that comes into play
so it's not google's fault that it's not
there they do need to put the screws on
and and get those license and go she ate
it yeah but it there absolutely but
let's let's put the blame where the
blame lazy and it's on the content
providers for not letting their stuff go
into those other countries so take that
animosity and rage that you have for
google and put it on to the whoever it
may be time warner MGM touchstone
whoever it is that's distributing those
and not letting them be distributed in
your country feel like i'm having a
ingrid a flashback to I earlier episode
in a week I mean Apple wasn't the same
situation at the beginning when they
launched iTunes as a service and an
offering and I think it's about it all
comes down to how well you can negotiate
the terms and I think that it is
possible I don't I also think that it's
not in their best interest or not as
high as on their priority list as I
would like it to be and speaking of
priority list unfortunately we are we
are running very short on time as usual
yeah as usual with I not that not that i
don't find digital rights management
scintillating but we and i could not
care less about this leak but we have to
talk about it just very briefly Tony
would you please tell us a little bit
about the iphone 5s leak and what you
think about it this image was was leaked
to what was it two days ago I think
though it was it was yesterday and
refined swimming from summer in Asia if
i recall well e trade's robbery in china
and it is basically a picture of an
iphone 5 from its back and
then the case of the iPhone open and
that's all I'm going to say about this
because i personally think that we're
not looking at anything else but an
early prototype of the iphone 5 before
it has received its FCC approvals and
all the other things needed for these
types of phones to go on sale there are
a couple of tweaks we have two pictures
side by side the five and the so-called
5s I think those are technological
modifications from the early stage of a
prototype until the final stage of the
finished product I think it is too early
to talk about an iphone 5s at the moment
even if Apple is going to do a twice a
year cycle of releasing products the
iPhone 5 is still a new phone it's still
just getting its way into markets like
China so I think that this is bottom
line an early prototype of the iphone 5
I would tend to agree it looks like that
to me it doesn't look terribly
interesting I think that the more
interesting part of this leak or you
know whether it turns out to be
authentic or not is do you guys think
and this will be the only question i
asked in the in the iOS section do you
guys think that apple will do the same
thing they did with the four in the 4s
do you think that the next iPhone will
be an iterative bump and it'll be maybe
even called the iphone 5s I think yes if
you take a look at the internals of the
iphone 5 they are excellent if you're
not comparing them to components of an
android phone I mean the iphone 5 runs
buttery smooth on iOS 6 so there's
nothing really not too much to bump in
terms of specifications the CPU is good
the RAM is enough the screen is good the
resolution is good what I think apple
will do is whenever so this is again a
personal prediction whenever we'll see
the iphone 5s it will probably have a
minor spec bump of some sort but i think
it will launch with the new iOS a
redesigned one which will have probably
Johnny I've signature on it and that's
going to be the selling point at the
iphone 5s it's from the Android side of
thing at least curve we're gonna see an
iterative bump some time but it's going
to be more focused around a way
than it is around guts because they just
did a major overhaul to to what's inside
the iphone and they've just introduced
the new screen resolution so we can't do
anything with the screen or we're going
to have developers mad again they just
upgrade the speed upgrade stuff mark
camera out the battery so yeah yeah it's
going to be iterative it's going to be
and here's than the new iphone 5 which
just makes the old iphone 5 it builds on
it it makes it better all right so just
like the 4s came up with iOS 5 I think
and with Siri and the iphone 5 with iOS
6 I think the f of finest will come up
with something I cannot put my finger on
it or at my head around it but it will
be focused on the platform yeah read
well I think that's completely
reasonable and I don't disagree at all
if I did I would I would say something
but I don't um let's do short on time we
are so short unto them but you know that
doesn't mean we don't read listener mail
and we had a we had just one that I
wanted to read very quickly because
William Lee has been waiting very
patiently for us to read any of his mail
on the air and I like this as a little
as a little wrap-up point because we
have as always talked about every
platform every major platform there is
in the news today on this episode and
William Lee has a two-point piece of
mail that is very short he says I
remember Michael talking about if
there's a good reason such as camera he
would sacrifice weight and thickness but
now it is proven not to be as impressive
he's talking about the Lumia 920 here do
you still think the Lumia is a wise
choice if we are buying a daily driver
to use for at least a year that's the
first part of his question William I
have to say yes absolutely in my
experience the Lumia 920 has been
excellent if you're in the market for a
windows phone I really wouldn't
personally wouldn't wouldn't buy
anything else and is the camera is
disappointing yes but but only in the
sense that my expectations were
artificially bumped by the PureView
branding and also once you learn how to
use the scenes mode once you actually
you shouldn't have to do this I'm not
making excuses i'm still irritated but
once you learn how do you
use the various tweaks in the viewfinder
software you can make some really get
some stunning pictures out of that
camera not to mention all the lenses and
stuff and the slight overexposure
problems the JPEG compression problems
are easily fixed in a software update
that we've heard time and time again
nokia is actively working on so yes i
still think the 920 is an absolutely
solid device and for a smartphone camera
it's difficult to do better but this and
this applies to everyone and this is a
great way to wrap it up so I'm glad
William asked to wrap it up can everyone
contribute their favorite phone
currently selling so webos doesn't count
thank you thanks for the reminder
somebody knows that somebody podcast
likes webos stay tuned by the way we're
gonna have a cool web OS video I think
in the next week or so well let's let's
contribute I'll go first do as far as my
favorite phone that is currently selling
the 920 is the is the one I own so that
one is I I have to answer personally
that would be my favorite on Windows
Phone but overall I think that currently
selling the nexus 4 would probably have
to be the one that I would I would
choose just kind of off the cuff and you
know for reasons why rewind about an
hour we talked all about it you can't
choose the nexus 4 because you haven't
had it in hand you haven't used it for a
week mmm that is true that is true but I
mean you know I know give me give me
photos yeah and also give me photos of
like you know six seaside mansions i
will pick my favorite one despite not
having been at any of them you know what

broad question that I like okay Windows
Phone Windows Phone 8x by HTC Oh android
HTC one x+ and of course the iphone 5
which happens to be my current daily
driver not because i'm a fanboy but
because I'm
locked in the ecosystem because I prefer
the applications in terms of aspect on
the apple ecosystem versus the others

impressive it's interesting I've we

pronunciation Joey for the final
thoughts well I've got my traditional
it's a great day to be alive but I
wanted to go into just a little bit of
what you guys are talking about of all
the platforms out there android is the
only one that has a development kit for
doing just what you're making fun of we
have the ADK so an android-powered
toaster or plant water detector or
fridge we can do that
off the shelf ready to go SDKs and
whatnot today so you'll see it on
Android first thats Sarah Michael D D
remember that iOS application at Aoife
to monitor your your plans do I ever I
just threw away that business card
recently actually a Tony and I were Tony
