Samsung Galaxy Note tens and well get
your wallets ready
it looks like Facebook is finally going
to pay for the camera John oolitic a
scandal from 2016 and according to a new
report Apple may be killing their high
praised or anticipated they are glasses
that we never got to see I'm Jaime
Rivera and yeah I know I realized that
it was Friday and I kind of wasn't
prepared so I shouldn't even be
recording this video this is firing out
daily the official news today finally
begin with deals I don't get it I mean
deals have been kind of slow but if
you're still in the market for a really
good phone that's not that expensive
LTG seventh in queue which we love for
it stack and it's camera is currently
three hundred and fifty bucks on B&amp;amp;H so
yeah that's actually a really good
option you can't find it in deals on
Amazon but I find it to be a little too
pricey at 435 dollars there but if
you're interested both links are in the
description now let's talk about the new
13-inch MacBook Pros that we discussed
the recently where Apple made a silent
update where they killed a non-touch bar
13-inch MacBook Pro and they gave us a
touch bar variant that I was looking at
it I was like 1.4 gigahertz on the
benchmarks but being a quad-core
processor that's weird
and it turns out that it's actually more
of a custom chip for this computer and
benchmarks are making people go crazy
the single core tests and lunch marks
haven't been that great but the multi
cores or 83 percent faster than the
previous generation just get an idea
there are already videos on YouTube
particularly the one from TLD today from
John where he puts it to the test
editing video I highly recommend you
watch that and guys I'm already enticed
for that computer because it starts at
1200 bucks and we're talking about a
very powerful MacBook Pro that's great
to see
let's hope they bring that technology to
the 15 inch or to the higher tier ones
we'll see now let's talk about the pixel
for excel a couple of days ago we talked
about some rumors of the pixel for where
we saw asymmetrical bezels bigger at the
top smaller at
the bottom I like this design and then
we saw the stove at the back now we've
got some links of the pixel for excel we
don't really see much of a difference it
seems that we still get the asymmetrical
design and then we've got the cameras at
the back and probably the most
interesting part is that I mean we were
expecting an either punch hole or a
knotch and I'm gonna tell you I actually
like the design of this asymmetrical
bezel though it could just be that the
hutt notch is being covered by software
which is something that we do see and
developer options for pixels so we'll
see about that and let's move the
spotlight over to apples a our project
there were so many rumors we had a ton
of analysts predicting that the company
was working on you know a our glasses
they hired people from microsoft's
hololens project and well now it turns
out that it seems that the projects been
put on mothballs and the way it goes is
that apparently the guy that they hired
from Microsoft which was leading the
project for the AR glasses left apple
and therefore what they've done ever
since May apparently is scrapped the
whole team and shuffled them around into
different projects so yeah it seems that
the whole AR project is on hold
obviously Apple is bidding a ton on AR
when it comes to iPhones but I haven't
really seen people using it much other
than for IKEA furniture and for you know
Pokemon go but you don't need an iPhone
specifically for that so yeah apparently
that's not gonna happen at least any
time soon but apparently it could also
be that the company is going to work on
something new that could launch later
we'll see and how about if we talk about
Facebook and the whole scandal Cambridge
analytical we know how this affected the
Trump campaign or benefited the Trump
campaign and how much this just became
completely crazy up to the point where I
really don't want to use Facebook I know
a lot of people are not really trusting
Facebook and it's developed and spiraled
this whole mess of figuring out how
companies are using social media to
manipulate the opinion think about it as
apparently Facebook is going to pay five
billion dollars in a fine that the
scandal also requires Facebook to
provide certain additional measures to
improve privacy for users and the only
problem is we
still aren't digging into the whole
verdict yet and we don't really see how
they aside from the fine are going to
guarantee that they won't try to
manipulate user data or user opinions or
whatever think about it as currently
it's at the FTC that it's moving to the
Justice Department
apparently the Justice Department will
never go against the FTC so yeah the
fine is a go god I just
i I'm sorry I'm just not a fan of
Facebook and finally the hottest dish
that I have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Note n plus or
pro whatever the final name is going to
be as one of the biggest questions that
nobody has been talking about until
today is the possible price tag how is
this phone going to be priced as it
stands if you want to buy for example a
galaxy s 10 that starts at 750 then
850 and then 950 or 999 I believe it is
when the galaxy s 10 plus yes I think
it's around there think about it as
apparently the Galaxy Note is gonna cost
a little more and I'm talking Galaxy
Note the standard variant is apparently
gonna cost almost the same money as the
SN plus meaning $9.99 and then in the
case if you want to go for that note 10
Pro we're talking 1150 and obviously
we're not exactly sure if we're talking
about 5g and these numbers are in Euros
obviously we're expecting those to be
the same numbers for US dollars but the
thing about it is in today's question
let us know what do you think I mean at
a time when we've got phones that are
being so disruptive and I'm talking
about the pixel 3a
I'm talking about the oneplus 7 pro do
you really think that Samsung should
continue charging this amount of money
for a phone or do you think that's
warranted because in the case of the
Galaxy Note you get more features when
compared to other phones in my case you
know if I'm gonna pay a thousand bucks
per phone I'd paid for a note that's all
I'm gonna say I'm not saying that I
justify the price I'm saying that I'm I
don't have a problem in paying more
money for a phone that does more but
that's just me obviously this is my
opinion we would love to know what you
think in the comments down below
