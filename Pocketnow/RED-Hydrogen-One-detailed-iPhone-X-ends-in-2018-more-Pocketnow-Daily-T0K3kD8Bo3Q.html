founders already using prototypes and
loving it and WC rumors point to the
Huawei P 20 not making an appearance and
it seems the iPhone 10 will be no more
after the next update I'm Jaime Rivera
and I ran for the first time today in
2018 and the only reason when I finished
the run was because I needed to get back
to the car
this is parking out daily the officials
today begin with Verizon
buy-one-get-one-free deals we just made
a video on the Galaxy sa which is
included in the list in addition to the
Moto z2 Force we've got the LGB 30 and
the coolest one the Google pixel 2 is
also on the list obviously there are a
ton of conditions you can learn more
about them in the description now let's
talk about the Apple home pod for all
four or five of you that still want to
get this product pre-orders begin on
January 26 you can get your own by
February 9th I still consider the home
pod to be one of those products that I
don't need don't want to buy for so much
money but we can't wait to get it for
review and tell you more about it now
let's talk about the first and probably
only generation iPhone 10 as we've got
some trusted sources claiming that
apparently the phone will be no more
after the whatever launch of whatever
iPhones come later this year apparently
it's gonna be so expensive for Apple to
make that phone less expensive as it
usually does with older iPhones that it
might as well just launched three new
iPhones with a better price tag we will
tell you more as soon as we get more
details now let's talk about MWC 2018 we
already began to get press invitations
this time for huawei and we were
expecting the Huawei P 20 to make an
appearance but sources claims the B 20
is not going to be announced the company
wants to focus its guns on its launch in
the United States and less products
would probably be the best approach now
again these are just rumors we will keep
you posted as we're pretty much just a
month away from MWC and finally the most
interesting news today have to do with
the red hydrogen one we've got the
company's founder telling us that he's
already got a prototype he's been
testing it out and he's been blowing
people away every time he gets to show
it to everyone
there is a full list of all the
specifications being detailed most
interesting ones Snapdragon 830 5x and
well I already has Qualcomm what the X
stands for as to my knowledge it jumps
directly to the 8:45 so hopefully this
is not a typo we hear that this phone
will be dual SIM include expandable
memory and the modularity is awesome
probably the coolest thing is the 2d
quad HD display that allows you to view
content and 4 V which is the way they're
dubbing the holographic capabilities and
you'll also be able to record video and
holographic quality and apparently this
is a new way to record video as well it
leads me to the question today are you
excited by this red hydrogen one or not
in my case I would like to see that
whole cinematic camera approach module
probably that would be the main reason
why I would invest in such a product but
leave us a comment down below love to
know your opinion friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow us
I'm fucking out have comments treptower
channel by hitting this button appear
you know watch yesterday's parking out
daily up here and our thoughts on the
iPhone 10 down here it also follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscore to get on
Instagram but Jaime metadata please give
this video a thumbs up if you like what
you saw I'm hi everybody I thank so much
