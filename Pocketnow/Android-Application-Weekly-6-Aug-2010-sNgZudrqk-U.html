Paco calm and this is a new segment
we're going to try and it's called
Android application weekly so we're
going to review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started so
this application is called bump and it's
been around for a while on the iphone
and is now available on android devices
so the program is pretty easy to use all
you have to do is bump phones together
to share either phone information photos
emails address even applications you can
also share your entire contact card if
you want so you can just select that and
you can share everything on your device
and the program is pretty easy to use
take your phone and another phone tap it
together and it syncs using a bluetooth
connection this is called the coupons
app and it is free on the android market
it's a very simple application used and
has hundreds of different coupons that
you can either email or text message to
your friends or yourself so all you have
to do is click on here send the coupon
to yourself if you like you can also
check local gas prices I have one that's
two dollars eighty six cents at fred
meyers i can also go to more information
and you check barcodes unlock login and
check my favorites my tracks is a free
gps enabled application created by
google that allows you to keep track of
your speed distance and elevation using
your onboard GPS so the program is
pretty simple you just click down here
and start reporting your track when
you're finished you will end up with a
track and you can view your previous
tracks right here this is where you can
also upload to the google user maps
where others can view your tracks and
also plot their own courses
picsay is a free photo editing
application for your android device and
it allows you to add different stickers
word bubbles and titles you can also
change the appearance of distortion and
we have many different effects down here
and go down to one and let's say we want
to go down to tint we can change the
tint by moving our slide either right or
left so I like that will click that
there and now we've changed our picture
you can also send these to your friends
and save them in your gallery Springpad
is a free application allows you to save
certain tasks and notes to yourself so I
have a couple here from last week i have
my stairs just a photo and also the
movie inception so you can also view
ones that i looked at today and i looked
at this restaurant so if i want to add
more i can go down here click Add type
let's try and say I want to find a
business it'll search around for the
businesses in my area and I can go to
log cabin log cabin tavern add that and
now it's on my notes so this is the
android app weekly and we hope you have
enjoyed this little segment we'll have
one of these on every friday of the week
and hopefully we'll be integrating to
iphone so leave us some comments and
also a great thumbs up if you liked our
video and we'll be sure to post the
