its WWDC conference with a couple of
products hinted welcome takes a stab at
its mid-range lineup with a new batch of
processors and people though seems ready
to take a stab at hardware very soon I'm
hi Marietta and let this show that I
cannot wait for Street Fighter to reach
the Nintendo switch this is PocketNow
Daley if I should lose today begin with
deals if you remember yesterday we
reported on the LGB 20 going for just
three hundred dollars in attorney Bay
seller now we have the LG g5 five
available for 270 now there in mind even
though the V 20 was a better deal the
problem was that phone was exclusive to
Sprint or as this one is factory
unlocked so the d5 is still a good time
and let Amazon show Phil Schiller how
it's done for those of you that saw the
news yesterday of him criticizing
speakers because they lack the screen
well the Amazon echo show just made it
to the market well just got announced
it's a screen for absolutely everything
it even allows you to do I don't know
video conversations it allows you to
order stuff online it allows you to use
it as a camera or should I say as a
monitor for your cameras wherever you
set them it looks really cool can't wait
to see how it is in the end I think of
other interesting moves we've discussed
recently that t-mobile might be
investing and building its own
smartphones and sort of a limited
warranty today we find the first leaked
images of a TCL made smartphone that's
apparently going to be the rebel t1 so
apparently this smartphone will be
t-mobile's feature Android phone with
some sort of unlimited I don't know
whatever is going to be provided what I
do see is stereo dual speakers at the
front that is going to be awesome
of TCL has made an amazing job lately so
yeah can wecan see what we get now for
those of you that the brown or don't
like the concept of the snapdragon 6
to DES the company has announced a new
processor snapdragon 616 m13 630 and
don't consider these flashes they're
based on the 14 nanometer architecture
which is pretty much the same as in
Snapdragon 820 1 you get all the
benefits or at least most of the
benefits of discount dragon 835 like for
example
Bluetooth five in addition to support
for quick charge for whenever that airs
so yeah whenever these processors come
out the only difference is obviously
there's not the ten nanometer chips like
the sanitary 35 but spill I mean from
using the BlackBerry key one on the
snapdragon six to five oh my god that
battery life is insane and finally the
very hot news they have to do with Apple
and its announcement of its WWDC keynote
which is happening on June 5th press
invitations were already sent out and we
hear that there are a batch of products
that are coming we don't necessarily
hear anything for mobile you have to
remember if there is going to be an iOS
11 it will be announced at this event if
there will be that smart speaker and
that whole new paradigm shift and it
will be announced this event in addition
to whatever changes will be coming to
the Apple watch etc etc this is pretty
much going to pave the way for whatever
next generation iPhone benefits we could
have when it comes to software so
anyways it leads me to the question of
the day what do you predict that Apple
will be announcing at WWDC do you think
that it's only going to be software and
enhancements or do you think that it
will bring some new hardware in my case
I think that Apple should really
consider bringing new hardware I mean if
it announced the pendant generation
iPhone now and then launch it in the
fall I think that would be a smart move
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends you
know the way it goes if you want to get
the news earlier before the videos
