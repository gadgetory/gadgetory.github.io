your pocket you're in the market for an
Android tablet with a big screen and
powerful innards and you don't see the
need for a stylus
well Samsung's Galaxy Tab pro 10.1 was
built just for you the question is will
you like it if you take it home let's
find out I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is our video review
of the Samsung Galaxy Tab pro 10.1 the
Tab pro 10.1 hardware will hold very few
surprises for those accustomed to seeing
Samsung tablets on retail shelves it's a
wide thin lightweight device with a trio
of controls below it's 10.1 inch Super
Clear LCD the screens pixel density
stands just shy of 300 pixels per inch
producing a crisper image than we're
used to seeing at this size though
straying far from the center line will
get you a substantial wash out in the
color palette in the hand the Tab pro
10.1 suffers from the same handicap of
nearly all tablets with an 8 to 5 aspect
ratio it's fairly difficult to type on
in landscape and fairly awkward to use
in portrait but in exchange you've got a
nice wide screen area for viewing HD
video and browsing the web so there's
that in terms of innards our review
model is the SMT 520 the Wi-Fi only
Edition with the Exynos 5 octa backed up
by 2 gigs of ram and 16 gigs of storage
there's also a microSD expansion
available for those interested in
loading their own media onto the tab
Bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi AC and IR round out
the connectivity package with LTE
included only on the Qualcomm powered
variant the Galaxy Tab pro ships with
the newest major build of Android 4.4.2
kitkat with Samsung's newest third-party
UI running on top the magazine UX and
all of it is running on hardware that's
some of the newest and most powerful
available sadly despite all this newness
Samsung's software still struggles it's
the half-baked sense of it all that
bothers us the most the widgets
inexplicably sliding off the homescreen
the surprise app crashes the formatting
problems when using multi window
that last bit really gets under our skin
multitasking is one of Samsung's most
compelling offerings and to see it
executed so terribly with apps like
YouTube and Twitter is very
disappointing and then there's the
magazine portion of the magazine UX
which turns out to be much less
ambitious than we were led to believe at
CES it's less a home screen replacement
than an accessory while you can plug in
features like a calendar more Samsung's
email client those add-ons are very
limited at this point and even when
displaying the news and social feeds
it's designed to show it's pretty wonky
it doesn't always automatically refresh
itself it has only the barest
customization options and our version
frequently timed out with a Flipboard
error when we tried changing its
settings we're hoping an update will
arrive to fix these and other
shortcomings we've reached out to
Samsung for comment and if the company
provides one it'll be available in our
full review linked in the description on
the plus side there are some
enhancements worth getting excited about
the new multi window launch pad makes
much more sense anchored to the side of
the display the new multitasking button
is very welcome and Samsung's watchon
feature for controlling a home
entertainment system is still excellent
if you're the type of couch potato who
splits your attention between the TV
screen and your tablet display when
you're vegging watch on is meant just
for you we use the Galaxy Tab pro 10.1
over the course of a week in home and
office settings for work samsung
includes the excellent han come office
suite and remote pc software as well as
NOx and on device encryption for play
even graphically demanding titles play
well on the 10-inch screen and for both
worlds
Samsung offers an array of Galaxy perks
to sweeten the pot when you buy one of
these the aged megapixel camera around
back is nothing to throw a party over
but it's nothing to sneeze at either
well you probably wouldn't want to take
pictures with it in public it's plenty
capable of doing so in a pinch and it
adapts well to a range of lighting
conditions it's also plenty sharp for
photographing text to be scanned into a
document the front-facing camera will
portray you in a reasonably
during light under most conditions as
well video from the primary camera is
surprisingly clear with quick auto focus
and exposure adjustments though the
framerate isn't the best we've seen and
the microphone is very susceptible to
wind noise we should mention that this
is a rather windy day so audio artifacts
can be expected in my hands are shaking
a little bit not that it's cold but
speaking of noise the Tab pro 10.1 x'
speakers can make some it's not as loud
as some other devices we've used but the
sound from the left and right speaker
ports is crisp and should serve you well
for watching video or streaming audio in
a quiet room
finally there's the matter of battery
life the Tab pro 10.1 packs a 31 watt
hour battery and despite the high
resolution screen at lasts a fairly long
time with heavy use we've been able to
average two days between charges with
the screen on time of between 4 and 5
hours without USB 3.0 though the Tab pro
does take its sweet time charging around
5 hours from empty to full so make sure
you top it off before a road trip in the
end the Galaxy Tab pro 10.1 is a mixed
bag we like its broad feature set it's
powerful suite of bundled software and
its high resolution screen and
controlling a TV from a tablet never
fails to give us a geeky thrill but the
software is just so inconsistent it
feels almost like a pre-production beta
build of an Android UI and it's not it's
on sale right now for $499 a price tag
we think is a little high for software
so in need of polish were you expecting
more well that's what the written review
is for for benchmarks screenshots and
in-depth impressions and more check out
