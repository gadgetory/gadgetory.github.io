8 by HTC emergence t-mobile takes its
uncarrier plant seriously with a new
unlocking mechanism and I can I fields
that capacitive display should be better
and plans to prove it I'm high metal
iveta and if you can still understand
what this video is saying that means you
have not started to party yet shame on
you it's Friday this is fucking out
daily for those of you living in the
United States is probably not a deal but
for those of us that live outside the
United States if you didn't know Google
Play Movies has launched just a couple
of months ago it's been only a few weeks
or months so for us this is something
new and the company wants to show it off
so what Google is doing is offering
deals in 17 countries where you can buy
movies for less than 10 bucks but when
you think about the fact that netflix
has been in these countries for about
three years already there is a reason
why they're doing this so hey the option
is there Lisa description full details
on which countries another official and
very odd news AT&amp;amp;T has just picked up an
LG G this thing you know that phone that
had us all confused on verizon and then
it ended up being a watered-down g3 with
a qHD display among other very bad
specifications the case says that 18 he
just picked up the phone but it's not
really the same phone you actually get a
720p display which is more like the g3 a
that got launched in Korea only with the
same letter specs of the verizon variant
g3 Vista is probably not what are the
best bones of the year but for those of
you that are not wanting to spend much
money this is an option though bear in
mind there are other options that cost
the same hundred bucks after a two-year
contract and better phones actually now
if there is one carrier that hasn't
stopped surprising as t-mobile the
company is saying they're uncarrier
policy very seriously what they're doing
is launching a new application allowing
you to unlock your phone you don't need
to call customer service you don't need
to do anything all you need to do is to
be eligible links to the description for
full details on how to be eligible but
there are two types of unlocks temporary
and permanent and obviously that will
depend on where you are in your status
but you know temporary your permanent
whatever it's a great way to do it and I
wish all carriers would do the same
one of the most anticipated devices of
the year is one that everybody says
won't happen but that continues to
happen in rumors the HTC nexus 8 as it
turns out the vice is apparently on
certification in South Korea already
even though HTC said they were in
building a tablet and we've got some
these and specifications here again like
the description we are between 5 and 4
gigabytes of RAM among an 8 megapixel
camera Tegra k1 processor among other
things this could be a very good product
hopefully of HTC brings their own design
to it which is obviously what I think is
going to be the case so let's see what
we get as certification means we should
be getting this product very soon and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day microsoft research has just
shown up the way they think capacitive
this place should work the problem after
the iphone launched is that the physical
buttons disappeared and they had a
purpose gaming for example is difficult
on a regular display because you can't
really feel the controls and but
microsoft this thinking is to adding
capacitive feedback to the glass in
order for you to feel texture when you
touch it something very interesting but
there's a full video with the full
explanation of the links in the
description and that leads me to the
question of the day would you prefer to
go back to hardware buttons or when you
consider this technology that Microsoft
is bringing is great because in my case
honestly I do feel that I would love
some hardware keys like for gaming for
example but that doesn't mean that my
preference is the only one leave us a
comment down below what do you think
like buttons capacitive displays or
would you like this new technology brens
es you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video is
filming she'd follow us on talking out
comment subscribe to youtube channel as
well it also follow me on twitter Jaime
