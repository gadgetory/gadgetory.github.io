Park geun-hye com this is part 4 of the
video review for the eaten Blowfish xyx
moving on to performance probably when
the surprises I've had with this device
is that even though you don't have a
strong processor and probably
performance is not really its top model
one of the things you'll notice is that
I have the Matrix Revolutions playing
here and well honestly this is a qvga
video it's not really vga but you'll
notice there is no lagging whatsoever so
at least I've noticed that if you play
videos that are in lower resolution than
with the device supports you'll
definitely get a good performance really
good so you could practically use spb
mobile DVD and practically play videos
that are in qvga content and you could
say you won't have any lag in while
playing them which is good now obviously
if you bring vga videos like for example
part 2 of the ipaq review that i did
recently you'll notice that there is
lagging in a full VGA video while using
this vga device so definitely if you
want to play a movie here you're going
to have to go for a small resolution if
you want to get good rendering
definitely you cannot get the best
rendering if you go for full BGA support
like you'll see here this is pretty much
it for what it can do for videos or what
I can explain it can do for videos
probably battery performance in what we
can talk about is decent I could
practically take out a whole day with a
normal incoming and outgoing calls but
you can't expect it to do really good I
mean as I mentioned the device is a bit
laggy it is a bit slow and definitely
the the amount of resolution and the
amount of processing power that requires
from the processor is is large so
battery power is definitely not probably
it's best model for the 1,500 milliamp
battery that it uses in the gaming part
probably one of my said one of the sad
things I found out about this device is
that even though yes you get a cute or
solids
stuff like that but none of my own qvga
games playing on this device they do
play but they play really slow
apparently definitely the processor or
the resolution does not support older
games or the pixelation that it's
included so sadly all my old games don't
play they do but real slow really
unacceptable definitely gaining for this
device unless I could probably be
mistaken but I've tried all the games
with with no applications running and
everything just to keep it fair for the
device and definitely i don't get the
performance that i am is that i am
expecting and the board games that i get
yes i do get a lot of pixilation and
stuff like that moving on to pretty much
bugs i haven't noticed really many books
in the device definitely everything
works I would say as retail this is not
retail that's the fastest device
probably the only book that I have
noticed in this device is the fact that
even though you got this a really neat
bluetooth interface to connect the
headsets for example and pretty much any
other thing that goes through bluetooth
us you'll notice here probably one of
the things i don't like this is that
even though it's really practical to get
a bluetooth headset set up because you
get the passwords included and
everything you don't have to actually
type anything it's a very seamless and
practical way to connect there is a
squeaking noise when she connect
headsets i've tried three heads that's
already with this device and even if i
don't use headsets I don't know if a
probably 10 has tried it too hard with
what pertains to sound quality but I
haven't really liked the sound quality
of this device it is a bit squeaky it is
a bit of unacceptable when I when I
begin the call it'll actually start to
call at the beginning and you won't hear
the call quality initially as you want
and people are listening to you and
they're saying that they actually hear
you as if you weren't speaker mode
I could assume this has practically
something to do with my review unit I
can't guarantee it's not going to be
part of yours but definitely if you're
into going into 650 try this first try
how people here you and your calls if
they can hear you find it and if not
well it's a simple return and that's
pretty much the way you'll solve it this
is pretty much it and what pertains to
performance gaming and pretty much bugs
the device overall is not bad is it's
this and its really good and definitely
as I mentioned the this vga screen does
make a big difference into enjoying your
experience with the device a bit more
this is pretty much it for part 4 that's
pretty much wraps it up for the video
reviews of this device I hope you
enjoyed it so thank you very much for
parking now calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
