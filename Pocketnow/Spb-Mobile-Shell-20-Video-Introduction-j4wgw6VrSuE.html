through some of the enhancements that
spb has made to this popular windows
mobile application the first is adding
gestures similar to HTC Touch cube if
you take your finger and slide it across
the screen you will get these animated
transitions to one of three pages at spb
has provided the first is the now screen
current users will recognize as now
screen but will notice some changes to
the view the first is at the bottom in
previous versions there were two soft
keys a closed in an spb menu that has
been replaced by four finger friendly
icons the first is the now screen the
second is the spb menu third is the
photo contact viewer and lastly a close
button to bring you back to your today
screen you can also navigate through
each of these views by using your
hardware soft keys giving you the same
animated transitions you can also use
your d-pad to do the same navigation
just by bringing it over them or you can
actually navigate to anything that's on
that screen that you're currently on the
next view is the spb menu again current
users will notice some changes to this
view the first is at the top you will
see 10 icons across the top these two
icons represent the most used
applications or your favorite
applications that you may have a pin
door locked to this view this gives you
quick and easy access to your you'd most
utilized applications below right below
it you'll see six icons that are clearly
labeled and are nicely sized forefinger
use again current users will notice that
the Start menu has been removed from the
center of the screen and has been
replaced by the Internet button if I
click on the programs button will get
this nice animated transition into this
view and you can use the same gestures
to get through the screen
you can also use the arrow keys at the
bottom your soft keys or you can use the
d-pad to navigate to get back to this
the main view just keep tapping on the
left until you get back the next view is
the photo context view spb has provided
15 locations for your favorite contacts
you can just click on it and your list
of your contact will show up and you can
just pick and choose which ones you want
to add once added it will show either a
photo or the name of your contact and
when you click on that contact their
information will show up such as their
phone numbers whether or not you want to
text them or bring yourself to the
pocket outlook to get even more
information and lastly we just have the
close button which brings us back to the
today's screen with the familiar spb
today's plug-in it still has the same
four icons so if I click on them each of
them has sub menus that will drop down
and you can access different information
here you can set these icons to show up
all the time or just auto hide just by
pressing it again I will be doing a full
review on spb mobile shell shortly so be
on the lookout and this has been a first
look at spb mobile shell version 2.0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
