pocketnow.com if you're looking for an
Android 2.3 smartphone that's super thin
and that has a really fantastic screen
you can't beat the Sony Ericsson Xperia
Arc and the Samsung Galaxy S 2 in this
video we're going to compare them let's
get to it people want to get in here
we're gonna talk about specs we're going
to talk about hardware software web
browsing performance benchmarks price
and availability and a lot more so you
can determine which of these super-thin
devices with really great screens is
right for you so let's start off with
the Samsung Galaxy S 2 you probably know
the specs by heart now we cover it a lot
certainly we've got the dual core Exynos
processor 1.2 gigahertz we've also got a
full gigabyte of RAM 16 gigabytes of
storage or 32 gigabytes although that
model isn't really shipping right now
you can buy one of these unlocked for
about six hundred and thirty-five
dollars now both of these devices are
very expensive because they're not on
the carrier in the US but around the
world in Europe especially you can get
both of these phones at a lower
subsidized price so that is the Samsung
Galaxy S 2 now we've got a 4.3 inch
display the resolution is w vga which is
800 down by 480 across really the most
common resolution these days the Sony
Ericsson Xperia Arc has quite a
different spec she has a single core 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor the
mighty Snapdragon we've seen the CPU in
many many devices as a strong performer
not as strong as the Exynos as we're
going to see it's got 512 megabytes of
RAM and in terms of storage has one
gigabyte onboard although there is a
microSD slot also with this device now
we can buy this or you can buy this
anyone can buy this for about $600 in
some cases cheaper around 500 bucks
unlocked if you search online for it
again this phone is not available in the
US on a carrier right now it might go to
8 T we're not sure about that yet but
definitely unlocked and around the world
and especially in Europe you can get
this any lower subsidized price now
let's talk about hardware and by the way
the screen on the Xperia Arc is a little
bit smaller than on the gap
cs2 4.2 inches instead of 4.3 inches
the resolution is slightly greater it's
f WVGA so that is 854 down you get extra
54 pixels by 480
neither of these devices have the newer
stock of qHD screens that go all the way
to 960 by 540 but that's okay there's
not that big of a difference between
WVGA or f wbj in the case of the Xperia
Arc and the higher qHD display now I
mentioned that both of these devices are
thin and while they are thin let's look
at them individually and see how the
thinness is pulled off on the galaxy s2
we've got a very thin bezel it's very
close to eight millimeters and then
we've got a thicker part down here which
probably adds about another millimeter
maybe a millimeter and a half but most
of the device is very thin the Xperia
Arc is a really interesting design it's
got that arc design in the center at its
thinnest point it gets very close to the
eight millimeters although not quite
that you find on galaxy s2 and then it's
thicker probably around ten millimeters
a little bit more than 10 millimeters at
the thickest parts but in hand the
Xperia Arc feels super thin as does the
galaxy s2 in terms of fit and finish
both of these devices for you a very
high quality in hand I think you'll
notice that it with the Xperia Arc it
feels a little bit more slippery because
we got we have the shiny plastic on the
back whereas on the galaxy s2 we've got
this sort of texture that doesn't pick
up fingerprints unless you've got a lot
of them on there but definitely the
Xperia Arc picks up fingerprints
although you have this really cool
design on the Xperia Arc hopefully you
can see it it's kind of white down here
or at least a greyish color and up here
it's black so you get this cool fade
down to black now in terms of cameras
both of them have eight megapixel
cameras you get 720p video capture on
the arc 1080p video capture on the
samsung galaxy s2 the art can actually
do HDMI out which is kind of rare these
days so here's the adapter at the top
and it's a micro sized adapter safe to
get a special cable for that to work you
can do video out on the samsung galaxy
s2 but you have to get a special adapter
especially a USB plug you have to go and
buy something separate although I
is the same can be said about the Xperia
Arc since most people don't have a type
D connector laying around the house
so let's turn both of these devices on
we're going to test boot up time let's
find the power button it's on the side
on the galaxy s2 it's on the top on the
arc press and hold and they both should
be off I felt them both a vibrate yep
and the boot up test is not particularly
relevant most people leave their phones
on all the time but some people still
turn them off at night so this actually
matters so that you can lower the time
between when you turn on your phone you
can check your email and operate the
device okay so we got a picture first
from the galaxy s2 and we'll let that
sort of settle down media scanner
running of course we'll wait till the
media scanner is finished okay it's
finished on the galaxy s2 preparing SD
card sort of the same kind of deal here
we're gonna zoom in on the screen to get
a better map viewing angle here okay
we're done so galaxy s2 is quicker now
we're going to go into settings WoW is
that a little freeze we're forced close
oh that's a great first impression there
we're gonna go into settings to
determine which one has more all right
we've got text messages there we're
gonna go into settings to determine
which has more RAM right now just we
started both devices up we're not
running at any applications except for
the ones that are running in the
background we're go to running services
here and we can take a look at RAM we've
got 113 used on the arc a little bit
more on the galaxy s2 608 and megabytes
free on the galaxy s2 207 megabytes free
on the arc so three times more the
amount of RAM free on the the samsung
galaxy s2 which doesn't always tell the
story because Android is a very good at
managing program memory and unless
you're running many games at the same
time but you can't even do anyway it's
gonna be hard to use 600 megabytes of
RAM in day-to-day usage ok let's go back
to the home screen and talk about the
software first let's talk about the
galaxy s2 of course we've got Samsung's
proprietary interface here which they
call TouchWiz
we've got a variety of widgets here
screens we can customize them we can
pinch out and get this sort of zoomed
out view and add multiple home screens
if we want these widgets are nice
they're not the most amazing widgets
what's cool is Samsung has added a new
way to add widgets so we can actually
add them with this little interactive
thing we slide around it kind of makes
it easier to see your widgets if we go
into the application tray this is all
customizable you get a sort of iPhone
esque
way of looking at your applications and
we can go to a list view if we want back
to grid view and we can go to edit and
this allows us to move around icons and
kind of customize and you can even
customize the back add a folder and so
on and so forth and this interface is
present throughout all applications so
in the browser and email and calendar in
context it's all there very nice
interface that makes this home screens
look at least visually pleasing now
let's take a look at the interface on
the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc Sony
Ericsson has gone with a less animated
interface here than they did back with
the x10 and other devices that really
flaunted the Timescape Mediascape thing
you still get elements of the Timescape
media scape in fact if you go into the
application tray this still exists where
you can flip through in a very 3d
environment your Twitter updates your
Facebook updates your text messages your
contacts and your emails some people
like this but some people think it's way
to visually intense but for those that
want something more simple here you have
a choice of multiple home screens you
can swipe through you can add widgets to
them obviously you don't get a fancy
interface like you get on the galaxy s2
to add widgets but this will look very
familiar to most people there aren't
that many added widgets from sony
ericsson just you know this Timescape
one you also have this way of flicking
through your YouTube videos or your the
videos that are on your phone in a 3d
environment and you've got a clock a lot
of basic stuff again quick shortcuts to
your music your photos and to your
videos from there if we dive into the
program tray over here we get this
iPhone esque layout just like you get on
the Galaxy s2 so we can flick through we
can tap this button in the bottom right
corner the icons will jiggle again like
yeah
you can move them around on the screen
customize them they all set to a grid in
the upper left corner again like the
iPhone like the galaxy s2 can swipe to
the right we can customize add more
panels if we want when we're done we hit
this button or we can change the listing
order so we can make them half abetik or
most used recently installed and so on
and so forth so so very simple in terms
of how Sony Ericsson has put forth this
interface it's almost close to stock
more so than the Galaxy S 2 at least and
we're going to run some benchmark tests
and quadrant standard between the Galaxy
s2 and the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc
we're gonna jump right through the
results and the results are in and if
you measure up the Sony Ericsson Xperia
Arc against other single core phones it
really does a really great job I mean
it's thirteen hundred and seventy five
which is a very very strong score again
for a single core device but we're
seeing 3200 here on the galaxy s2 if you
if you benchmark any dual-core Android
phone you're gonna get benchmarks that
are off the charts so we're not even
going to proceed with other benchmarks
obviously a dual-core phone is going to
be faster than a single core phone but
of the single core phones the arc is one
of the fastest and remember that this
device the arc is $100 in some cases in
more than a hundred dollars cheaper than
the galaxy s2 so you might be losing a
little bit of speed but it's potentially
a really good value so let's open up the
web browser and see how they compare in
terms of web browsing speed okay here we
are and open up the browser
we've got plugins turn to on-demand so
it shouldn't load any shouldn't be
loading any Flash content we've got both
devices on Wi-Fi we're gonna go to
pocket now on both see which one gets
there faster and you can really see the
difference in the screens right now so
more contrast is found on the galaxy s 2
the Xperia Arc has that Bravia Engine
and a lot of people think that the
colors are just unbelievably real on the
Xperia Arc and as we flip through and do
a comparison you're going to see that an
action the colors are just really really
good on the Xperia Arc contrast
definitely the best on the galaxy s2
thanks to the Super AMOLED plus display
and they're off and actually the arc is
beating the galaxy s2 okay while they're
loading us flick down the page both of
them can keep up with a flick while the
page is loading without getting
everything into program memory
well the arc beat the galaxy s2 it's
doing something and it stopped okay well
let the galaxy has to finish alright and
we're done we can scroll down the page
on both a little bit shoppi
on the Xperia Arc let's zoom in see what
it's like very smooth on both I'd say a
little bit a little bit more choppy here
on the arc let's click on this link here
and both tap
both are very very capable
okay and the Galaxy has finished a
little bit faster than the arc but again
the arc is doing a great job of keeping
up with a galaxy s2 we've tested a lot
of phones against the galaxy s2 and in
almost every case it wins so we're happy
to see a phone keep up so again we can
scroll down the page let's go to a more
complex web page we'll go to end gadget
which is very long and scrollable so we
can see really how the GPU and the CPU
performs okay we've got Engadget loaded
on both are going to scroll to the
bottom directly and just go to the
desktop version so we can see the most
graphic intense rendition of this
website so they're off and let's see
which one gets to the site first galaxy
SSI head start there and loading the the
top page elements here comes the arc
like this is some sort of horse race
let's flick down the page while they're
loading no checker boards on either
which is fantastic let's do screen
reader rotation speed test while they're
loading ok galaxy s2 their galaxy s2
there I'll just turn the camera off the
tripod so you can see the viewing angle
it's very very wide on both devices but
when you get to a really extreme viewing
angle on the galaxy s2 you can see the
screen a little bit better whereas it's
becoming kind of inverted the screens
keep timing out a little bit inverted on
the on the arc okay both have finished
loading we can scroll down the page
they're both pretty smooth again the arc
is a little bit choppy when it comes to
scrolling down the page it's hard to
beat the galaxy s2 but in terms of page
render times the the arc really can keep
up not necessarily beating the galaxy s2
but certainly almost a matching its
speed so right now we just clicked on
another link we'll see where this takes
us and then we'll wrap up the the web
browser speed test here okay and the
galaxy has to finish it looks like we
jump down to the comments but here we
are at the top so Sony Xperia Arc
definitely no slouch when it comes to
web browsing
so at the end of the day the Galaxy S 2
is definitely the better device here if
you just look at the facts I mean it
browses the web faster it loads faster
there's more RAM available but in terms
of value the Xperia Arc might be the
value in Android right now it's fast
it's beautiful its thin its light and it
can really keep up in a lot of ways in
terms of web browsing - to the Galaxy S
- so if you're looking the same 100 or
150 bucks which is a lot the arc is a
great choice still and you can get the
arc in a version that is AT&amp;amp;T capable
we'll post a link on how to get that
particular version in Europe they're
already selling it they've been selling
it for a while but you can import into
the US use it on AT&amp;amp;T if you want as an
unlocked phone if you liked this video
please give us a thumbs up and thank you
very much for watching that's it for now
