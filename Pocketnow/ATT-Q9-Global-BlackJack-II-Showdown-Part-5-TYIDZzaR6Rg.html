pocketnow.com and this is part five of
the showdown between the AT&amp;amp;T q9 global
in the blackjack two in this video I
want to talk about software and see
which one's stronger out of the box so
I'm going to start with the q 9 and to
unlock you do the unlock soft key and
then star now to lock it's kind of
interesting you press the HOME key and
then the space the space bar it's kind
of unconventional usually it's a press
and hold of the call and the button but
it's easy to get used to so let me let
me get it into focus here zoom in on the
screen a little bit okay here we are so
I'm going to start I'm going to go into
the start menu and kind of flip through
here and show you some things they're
unique so everything here in the first
frame is is pretty standard messaging
calendar contacts activesync 18t music
cellular video media net then over on
the second side here we have IM and
email which will take you into the get
good if you want to use that sort of
email or get express mail and they also
have 0 Z messenger as number three we're
going to go back here if we go into
office tools we have mcafee virusscan
now I've never used antivirus on a
windows mobile device I don't plan to do
it use it anytime soon because I don't
know of anyone that's had a virus on
their device but if you are worried
about that kind of thing when you when
you start it it will install the program
for you and I don't want to do that
someone to go back into the start menu
okay so let's go to my stuff this is
where things get a little different than
other devices so let's start in my
device it's kind of a file manager
that's what it is it's a little more
robust than the standard file manager in
windows mobile standard to go to my
documents they don't certainly take it
take you to my documents same with my
pictures and video and everything else
is pretty standard you get down here to
personalize my cue and I kind of like
this from here you can customize the
right softkey on the home screen and I
really like this because you can you can
specify the name so if you have a
particular website you like to go to a
lot of course i'm going to right pocket
now
and then you can go to you can choose an
Internet Explorer favorite you can
choose anything from the start menu to
link to or any other application so this
is really helpful that you can you can
do this you can't do this on the
blackjack two so I'm going to cancel
this because I don't want to change that
and then home screen settings will let's
see link you right to the setting that
you're used to in the control panel or
the settings as they call it windows
mobile standard and they actually give
you some really really good colors
choices there's a lot of colors if I
expand the list here there's about two
four six eight about 11 of them usually
you'll get you know five or six colors
and I really like this one called in
material I'm going to click done and it
should load in about a second or two
there it is kind of reminds me of the
tmobile shadow colors kind of a coppery
type scheme kind of looks red on the
camera right now but in person it's a
copper color then we go to Home screen
shortcuts and we can specify how big the
icons are if we want to show text so if
we do show large icons and show text I'm
going to go back to the home screen and
well I don't see any text all right well
I wonder to what that applies it's
probably a different home screen that
i'm not using right now so let me go
back into my stuff and personalize my
cue from here you can also change sound
and ringtones and you can adjust the
start menu view I like to have the list
so though some people like the iconic
view so here is the here is this the
selector you can actually choose by
folder which is great so if you go to I
am an email if you remember that screen
we can change it from list view to icon
view and it's rude most devices don't
let you choose all the way down to each
folder so that's really great okay so
I'm going to go back here back up a
little bit and I'm going to go back to
this domain start menu this phone comes
with
opera is usually a 2500 if you want to
buy it it's $25 so it's great that they
threw it in here this is the default
browser opera mobile is much better than
pocket Internet Explorer it lets you
view web pages kind of at a iphone like
zoomed out view and then you can select
a part of it and zoom in and pan around
so that's that's a welcomed addition
going over to the right if we click on
applications here we have some standard
things a lot of AT&amp;amp;T branded stuff you
know you can download TeleNav Internet
Explorer is hidden over here camera
application file manager that kind of
thing and over here on the next page is
my cast whether Bluetooth settings
documents to go this doesn't have office
mobile on here which is surprising but
it does have documents to go which will
let you view PowerPoint Excel Word files
and that kind of thing so let's go back
again go into system tools now you can
format the storage card do a lot of
other things like master clear which
would be like a a hard reset you can do
master reset which is a standard
rebooting of the device memory manager
which kind of lets you see how much
memory you have and how much how much is
free and that sort of thing settings
will take you right to the settings menu
I wish this was out more in the
preceding menu rather than buried in
this where are we here we are in the
system tools menu so I actually assigned
settings to number two on the keypad so
if i press and hold to i get right into
the settings and then we have a very
plain old task manager here that shows
us the programs that are currently open
but it doesn't tell you the memory usage
which is a bit annoying and from here
you can kill the applications and
whatnot so that is system tools and i
added google maps it's a must-have
application or Windows Live search and
then TeleNav navigator if you pay for
that which is between five and twenty
dollars a month depending on how much
you want to use it so that is software
on the q 9 global alright so let's take
a look at the blackjack two to lock the
blackjack two you press and hold the
right end call button and to unlock you
do the same sequences with the q9 and
I'm sorry if you catch a glare on the
screen the blackjack
was very very shiny so it catches the
light once in a while alright so let's
start off here I'm gonna go back into
the start I'm going to start in the
start menu like I did with the q 9
global and we have the same exact thing
that we had in the q 9 global some
singular or AT&amp;amp;T stuff and you know
messaging and calendar that's sort of
bit and we're going to go over to the
right here and then things are a little
different we've AT&amp;amp;T mall we've I am an
email and of course we've 0 Z messenger
we don't have get good or express mail
here call history organizer let's see
what's inside of there so some standard
stuff that the q9 doesn't have actually
such as let's see doesn't have a
stopwatch the q9 smart converter that
kind of thing which could be helpful if
you're traveling internationally d-day I
never really knew what that was and
every Hughes dit maybe someone can
explain that to me someone to go back my
stuff is just a a file organizer going
back games if you remember we didn't
find games on the q 9 for some reason
but you know we have the standard bubble
breaker and solitaire on the on the
blackjack two we've internet explorer
this doesn't have opera it defaults to
internet explorer over on the right to
applications and see what we have in
there a camera file explorer telenav a
PDF viewer q9 takes care of that with
documents to go on the next on the next
frame here we have RSS reader the q9 did
not have that Smart Search to you know
flip through things then we have Office
Mobile which is refreshing so you can
get the the full version of Excel and
PowerPoint and word well the full
version as full as it can get on your on
your smartphone the capabilities aren't
that different from documents to go
which is on with which is on the q 9
okay so we have that let's go back a
frame and where are we here in this up
yep back a frame again and then if we go
into settings it'll take you right into
the settings menu and there's TeleNav
again and Google Maps now this does have
a task manager you press and hold the
home
and then you should get a task manager
and this is a somewhat better task
manager than on the q 9 but it still
doesn't show memory usage per program it
only shows you a memory use down here
hopefully can focus a little bit this is
a twenty nine out of 10 9 and so not too
much of a difference there so it's a
really tough call between the two
devices the motorola q9 global has opera
it allows for some better
personalization with the right softkey
and and some more color combinations
whereas the blackjack 2 has the real
version of Office Mobile and it has some
other smaller applications like smart
converter and a slightly better task
manager in the end they're about equal i
think that the q9 is a little bit of a
little bit ahead because it includes the
$25 Opera Mobile which I think a lot of
people would find useful and it really
helps your internet experience so the
winner for this round in the software
Department is the q 9 global one more
point for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
