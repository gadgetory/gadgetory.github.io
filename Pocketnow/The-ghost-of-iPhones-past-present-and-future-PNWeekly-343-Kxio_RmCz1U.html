weekly from PocketNow NXT developers
recorded on Friday the first of February
2019 I'm sorry Phoebe wary yeah I know
welcome to the shortest month of the
year everybody and congratulations on
getting through what seems to be the
longest week of mobile tech news clearly
we have a lot to talk about on this
episode we're pushing forward on all of
the things that make us go from 5g to
foldables to whatever we can come up
with or really whatever the industry can
come up with because everything's coming
out the woodwork these days I am of
course Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and I'll take the opportunity
to wish everyone happy Lunar New Year as
well which begins on Tuesday so just a
few days from now so next week this is

anyone wants to throw in my way I'll
take it my friend I was yeah I can't eat
moon cake though let me just say that so
I will be spending some time with my
family after the show not necessarily
for Lunar New Year but I'm definitely
ready for my lunch so let's get into our
show TK Bay is back with us in place of
Brandon for this week how's it going
with you man I I'm doing good I'm doing
good and I'm happy to be able to join

joining us when he gets a chance to you
later obviously as anybody who watches
the show knows his internet tends to be
a bit of a thing oh there you go I was
just like about how bad your internet is
Jaime there we go
Jaime is back we'll go ahead and just
give him a wave as he gets set up and
we're also introducing somebody new from
the matrix I mean the matrix and if you
get well he is in New Jersey we're
talking to max a blonde oh no did I say
that right by the way bond on Oh bond on
oh okay because I hope he'll butcher my
last name all the time it'll be fine I

brownies so well that's and that's the
thing video and this is a last name it's
not a middle name yeah there was my mom
my mom's my mom's
previous name of course oh alright cool
so now now that everybody is in let's
going to get into our stories um okay so
we normally have a worksheet that we use
in order to look at all of the stories
before the show goes live every week I
get a little bit excited to like go
through the stories pretty quickly I get
to the office earlier every single week
to go through all of them and I think
it's gonna be a nice easy show this this
one may not might be a little different
there's a lot to talk about not only
because some of the stories we're gonna
talk about at the end of the show
actually made it onto local news that's
how big that story is but for now we're
gonna get into a lot of little pieces of
information that we might be getting
during MWC after all Mobile World
Congress is in a few different is in a
few weeks and we're getting a lot of
different leaks and
that might be happening and the first
one that we're gonna look at is by Sony
with the Xperia xz4 all right anybody in
this I know that hi may you have and
because I was the one who did the review
on the honor but have any of you others
who used the new honor with Sony's
latest sensor that's at 48 megapixels
I have no idea what you're talking about
you have two phones can I have one thank
you they took that one but they took the
red one back no one of the it was a
giveaway going on and the other unit was
for the giveaway so I actually
personally hand-delivered that unit back
to them in fares the area yes all right
I I've never had separation anxiety as
much as when I give phones away I don't
know why yeah but yeah it's they're very
nice yes I have spent quite as what
about a predicate amount of time with
that phone definitely yeah same and okay
take a quick thoughts from you about
just how fantastic is that camera photo
wise at least for the wise is just the
way to describe it I this is by far the
way I envision trying to take pictures
with with phones the reason behind that
is the ability to shoot of 48 megapixel
image and you don't have to worry about
zoom or worry about any kind of crappie
you just take that 48 megapixel
megapixel image and then crop to do
whatever you want the composition is
yours you're able to just fit everything
you want and it's it's something that
I've learned from hi Mia even from
before with shooting video you know
shoot in 4k but render in 1080p because
they have more control into what you're
doing in the image and it just does it
so well
I like the AI clarity that they have in
there and I had a fun time taking
pictures with it in Paris of course we
were snowed in but you know it was it
definitely it's a pleasure it's nice to
see something so good and just
unexpected because you don't really
think it was gonna be that good til you
have it in your hand yeah so I I go a
lot of those thoughts as well I mean
it's it's a fantastic sensor being used
in a very effective way partially
because honor has such a close
relationship with Huawei so a lot of
those features make it onto that sensor
so my yeah my final
not in that review was I can't wait to
see what everyone else does with this
sensor and now here comes Sony saying
we're gonna want you were gonna one-up
it even further
so apparently according to a Japanese
publication we're not going to get just
that 48 megapixel sensor that is in the
honor of you 20 but 10 she the xz4 is
going to have something of 52 megapixels
mm they haven't announced that sense or
some kind of skeptical over what it is
exactly that's what I'm saying but the
thing is well the reason why I wanted to
bring up what TK was saying about the
honors because even if it's not 52
megapixels the 48 megapixel that is
official is already pretty great so I
don't know the Xperia might be a very
exciting phone yeah but but how about if
we get the Sony camera with a huawei
software on that thing because like Sony
suffers like trash it's like concerning
is like one of those companies where
it's like if Qualcomm made a phone but
they wouldn't know how to take advantage
of their own processor that's Sony that
is Tony for you that is true now max the
sony Sony phones what's the last Xperia
that you've used I have never used an
experience has got to be the first one I
think right now is probably the best
time to try it out because not only the
sensor but also because I mean we're
seeing a lot of stuff happening this
year that hopefully will enhance Sony
phones to the point where they become
really really compelling because over
the last number of years you you may not
know this max but they're kind of the
same every single year I have I have
noticed that just from my own research
and everything like I've you know they
stick with the same I want to say like
rectangular body but like they don't use
the same sort of design language it's
like a iPhone or whatever with like
curved corners and stuff it's always
like this super boxy thing I've tried
getting units of in Subway's sometimes
I'm just like I'm not even got a father
just looks weird don't bother like it
takes forever to get units from these
guys and then like I did the review on
the XZ 3 and and on the XE 2 and I was
like alright these phones are good they
feel great and everything and it's just
I'm trying to understand like glass is
not made by Sony like the metal is not
made by Sony meaning you know these are
thus not looking after that what they
make is camera sensors and that's the
part they get wrong
yeah yeah I am in the process of trying
to get a view 20 unit like TK has
because just just the design is very
attracted to me it's really nice
actually
with rich at near win and he just got
one and so I was asking him about it and
stuff but I'm just like looking at it in
his video I'm like oh my gosh that looks
sick so I'm working on it but we'll see
okay well this this is again this is a
leak a rumor well we'll call it a rumor
cuz I can't even really say it's a leak
because we mean we can't really
corroborate it and whatsoever right um
so we'll just say it's a rumor for now
but my point is it may be 52 it may be
48 in either case is probably gonna be
pretty great because we've already
experienced the 48 now let's go to
something that is actually pretty much a
fish on that is we're going we're going
we're one-upping literally every little
part of a phone that we possibly can so
here comes Samsung this is ridiculous
keep going we need one terabyte in the
phone no no remember it was one of your
tag lines for the note 9 to remember
this is the phone that you'd be able to
put it 512 on top of the 512 yes and you
couldn't buy a fine salt back then no no
back then no no no you know and so it's
like I don't know it's great it's
bragging rights and this is what Sam
strings does see Samsung makes chips and
they're good at it and they build them
into their phones they get it right it's
I don't know I I like I have one
terabyte on this laptop that I use for
work um the only reason I need one
terabyte is because of ProRes when you
render and ProRes it's like shoot
I think it'll eat up your hard drive in
a couple of videos well yeah you just
you the advantage of pro res it's it's
such a large pipe for you to throw in
all media that you know there's just
lossless format it's great but that's
this is where you need it like if you're
editing a video like I could totally see
myself using an iPad with one terabyte
because of the like minus 256
do a lot of the thumbnails that we do I
use a lot of that software and so for
that plus I want to start doing my blog
editing on that iPad pro that's where I
need one terabyte but on a phone it's
like now what am I gonna throw in there
yeah max you've you you flashed an
iPhone a second ago which which model is
that this is the the 10s I have this is
actually on loan from horizon but I've
enjoyed it it's got 64 gigs of storage
on it though so I think so that's the
thing like I to get even more you got to
pay way more is that gonna do you think
that's gonna be the case with Samsung
with this one terabyte thing oh
absolutely but the thing is I like I
would strongly advise anyone not to ever
buy a terabyte of storage in their phone
they will never use it like I just
general people like the general consumer
to like I have problems trying to fill
up a 128 phone like I have a 1 plus 60
and like I've maybe fill that up 35 40 %
of the way so you're just imagining a
terabyte it's just it's ridiculous but
and then the price tag it's like $1600
yeah like like if you want to boost so
here's the thing so if the retail price
of that phone let's assume let's assume
that the retail price of that phone is
$1,000 let's just make up that that's
the price tag $1600 oh my god if I want
to get one terabyte on a MacBook Pro its
$400 why is 60 why is six to eight
hundred dollar premium over one terabyte
well okay to be fair I feel like like
okay this this particular one terabyte
drive if this chart is to be believed
the read and write speeds are pretty
fantastic they're not that much higher
than the previous one but what I'm
thinking of here is that it should be
these read and write speeds for like 128
gigabytes or 2 or 56 kilobytes it should
be that and but because the how I give
Android can take advantage of read and
write speeds that are that crazy either
man well perhaps so yeah that's true
it's definitely better than using an
external sd card sure that actually have
slower main reading right so but what
about incentives like wouldn't Samsung
like if you're gonna get a one terrible
at hard drive flash memory whatever
inside of a inside of a phone like this
why now give some incentives I know
everyone got really mad that there was
like pre-loaded content on certain
phones and whatnot but this would be an
interesting way of making people
actually enjoy one terabyte by putting
things like fortnight in there or a lot
of movies and then you'll have 900 80
gigabytes left yeah how about you TK had
me feel about the the storage option
here I think yeah I'm wrong with you
guys I think it's way way overkill I
think the 512 model of the note 9 was a
hard one to even try to fill up I tried
that one oh my god I i if you if you
check out the channel I get the plate
with a lot of things yeah you had a
chance to play with that one and it was
one of those ud2 there's just no way but
the problem is you also still had
expandable storage so that's the other
thing my question that I may be looking
at slightly deeper on that one is if
they offer the thousand terabyte
internal drive are they considering
removing the internal storage expansion
is it is that in lieu of you know like
when they go with a higher storage
because they want to say well look you
don't need to worry about it you don't
need the SD card anymore this will take
you used the filler you did that with
the s8 didn't they no they did it would
be s 6 OS 6 that wasn't one okay and
that was the reason why they did it that
would do just what TK said they said
that the memory would not be or the
storage will not be fast enough for what
they have to get but back then and in
those days of Android like there was a
substantial difference and and the like
keep good load apps on the SD card and
there would just bark them down and so
just throw the experience the out the
trash that was ya know so 5 I think 512
is overkill 256 I think is I would say
for me about the sweet spot that I'd
like to say that that's a good one
because whenever you're testing the
phone like for what we do and you try to
go out and show a lot of 4k a lot of
pictures and go on an actual trip to
kind of get all that content you want to
have that buffer room you want to be
able to say look I'm never gonna fill it
up 64 should just go away I don't that
64 shirt exists this is not a 64 should
go away go away
but like the problem is when you have
devices like the one +16 McLaren where
you get 256 gigs for $6.99 $6.99 it's
like 10 10 gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigs
and you're not gonna fill those up man
like like the only phone where I see
myself filling that up and judge me all
you want is with an iPhone 10s or 10s
max I could I would want one of those
with a terabyte because of their video
capability it's like their codec for 4k
at 60 is second to none in mobile so I
could totally seem I could totally see
myself vlogging permanently with an
iPhone just because of the codec and
then that storage would be useful for me
for that you know the thing about it
like galaxies are good like they're
they're scratching great when it comes
to video but it's like when you grab a
video between again a galaxy galaxy note
9 and an iPhone 10s man shoot I'll pick
the 10s that's just the way it is you
know yeah indeed okay so as we keep the
train rolling on features that were just
one upping during MWC LG is looking to
bring 5g to they're not the G series
though that probably would have made
some sense but but LG is looking to
bring 5g to they're V series and that's
the phone that potentially will be going
on Sprint's now we've talked about 5g
like crazy we know that's gonna go on
Sprint whether or not that's actually a
good thing or something that we could
look forward to that's all stuff we've
talked about before but this is my
questions everybody it's 5g enough to
bring the V Series this far forward in
the release cycle isn't the wasn't the V
Series an ephah exclusive type of phone
like this is really right and so you
imagine the build just show it off and
they'll announce it and we'll get it
onto leaf oh that's very possible
last year they also that the whole v35
thing where they played that little
nomenclature you know they but the
reality is yeah I think we're happy was
saying is this is more of a proof of hey
we kind of did it just to say that we
could do it and
you know it won't be available because
they need they need the infrastructure
they need to be able to actually deploy
it correctly true ya know anything this
is like this is like the punch hole race
where it was Samsung and honor and all
these companies announcing the phone
first but you know in the end nobody had
launched it yet and so that's what LG is
doing they're just gonna announce their
phone first but for what I mean unpacked
is gonna happen how many days before the
LG event four days before the LG event
and we know Samsung's gonna do the same
so it's like yeah what you know yeah
max are you on the 5g hype are you are
you get hype on 5g yeah no no no if it
matters to me until like next year and
then you know then I'll start getting
hyped but until then like you know the
only person rolling out 5g at this point
is AT&amp;amp;T and that's not even 5g so like
it's not gonna reach anybody and not
gonna reach anybody where it matters and
so like next year so yeah I'm not gonna
ride on anything but I do want to say
one thing about this V 50 thing I
certainly hope they do not call it a V
50 B 50 like thank you my friend
whatever they've been or not I swear
because the rumor says it's gonna have a
six inch display and all this stuff
I am Qualcomm eight fifty five four
thousand milliamp hour battery I think
this is gonna be like a V 45 or
something like they did to be 35 from
last year and then say be 54 Eva yeah it
probably should be to be honest because
if these if these leaks are to be
believed these phones in 2019 are gonna
probably be the only ones with notches
and it's like what you're already behind
and that just an Aussie just disappoints
me a little bit like now not to say that
the notch actually breaks functionality
in any which way but it's just one of
those things like you look at it and
you're like oh no I agree I agree but
how about if we get another LG this is
gonna be the LG v 40s Plus think exactly
you remember Josh you remember when we
went to the briefing last year yeah at
MWC and they were like this is the LGV
30s plus thank you we were expecting to
get a g7
at that briefing and then it was like
what yeah and there and we were like
what exactly is different here under
like AI and color same specs oh you get
different colors we get a yeah mm-hmm
that's when the thinkyou thing was was
introduced you can imagine how well that
presentation went yeah well speaking of
ridiculousness
have you guys been looking at these
iPhone renders that have these
ridiculous like the their own version of
the stove on the back of their phone
like oh yeah but can you imagine Apple
designers like looking at these concepts
and renders and being like hmm maybe we
should do that one or how about if we do
that one because it's so early right now
we haven't even started designing and
these guys are already creating renders
for this thing like seriously this is
the most ridiculous looking thing and I
hope it's not the case because number
one stove number two the camera hump
like that entire thing is just it's just
the best of the bunch well we're gonna
call it yeah well okay so potentially
there might be a new camera that will
that whap here on the back of the latest
Apple devices that uses laser technology
may be a time of flight camera but a
lasers laser technology to sense object
detail in proximity those are things
that we've seen in and lt had and now
didn't LG have a like a laser sensors
it's like the g3 exactly laser autofocus
exactly built-in since then yeah could
be without a hunchback yeah exactly
so yeah the so potentially the other the
other rumor about this is that iOS 13 is
going to get a dark mode but perhaps to
the dismay of a lot of users who have
been very loyal to Apple over the last
number of years there might be an actual
change to the port on the phone going
from lightning to USB see now how many
years that first happened okay he can
actually you know what let me get let me
go to you real quick then
because Jaime over there is actually
experiencing this change with his iPad
pro yeah okay for me I'm more
four-unit universal ports I mean we
don't want to keep going between
different cables all of androids already
on us PC I all your peripherals are all
starting to come out with us PC we have
yes PC on the you know GoPros and so on
Apple needs to kind of we need to just
have one format and make it simple and
not having to carry all of these things
on top of the fact that we have to carry
dongles with our laptops so to me having
that move I think will make it better
for us but I didn't know that there are
people you know that there is concerns
with the the way with the iPad pro so
please do tell us the problem is it's
not the connector it's what the
connector does it's it's like all right
so I have flash storage here I want to
connect it to my iPad because I want to
throw in some video that I want to throw
into my vlog and boom it doesn't work
yeah problems like that and then the
other problem you have is obviously
there is this like crazy ecosystem of
lightning based made for iPhone MFI
products yeah that now don't work on USB
see because Apple has not created female
lightning to mail USBC connector and
there isn't any and so like for example
the microphone that I use for daily I
can no longer use it on the iPad because
I can't connect it to USB see and these
MFI services only work on lightning and
so if you have anything that's NFI like
if you if you wanted to connect that
ipad to one of those smart speakers then
you find that any hotel room they don't
work like there is no adapter you know
the biggest question is like it's not
that I care about what's gonna happen
with the feature mmm if I it's I care
about what happens with all the
accessories that I have right now like I
know a lot of people like a really good
friend of mine as a musician and he
connects he uses this apogee connector
which is not cheap at all to connect
this guitar into connectors as his organ
and none of these things work now and so
that's the reason why he hasn't upgraded
to the new iPad he wants it but he's
like but what am I gonna do with my
stuff you know that would be my that
would be my thing to that the move to
USB see basically makes every peripheral
every accessory that you had in the past
just wasted money
and IA as much it's weird right like
when USBC was first coming out everyone
was complaining about it because they
didn't want to change their standards
they didn't want to change their tables
this would be the same exact argument
for anybody who currently has Apple
phones like Mac scooter rocking a-10s
what if the 10 SS or tennis - yeah
whatever that what if that changes
things up for you like well to be honest
I'm not too heavily invested into the
Apple ecosystem like Phi any means so
like I'm a big Android guy and I only
have USB C cables so having an an iPhone
in my life invading that with its
lightning connector it gets annoying so
if Apple puts a USB C port on the next
iPhone I will buy it instantly just me
that this it would be the best poked in
the side by Apple to my boy we moved to
USB see here's an adapter for your
lightning honestly it's fine again my
prom with USB C on iPhones is not like I
think USB C is probably one of the
coolest inventions I love using them on
my macbook pros I love that all Windows
laptops are moving except for the
surface I don't know why so don't get me
wrong I like the move what I don't like
is again Apple's implementation on iOS
devices
yeah in the case of iPads alone like
fine I don't care if I can't connect
twice well I do care
it's just Apple really needs to figure
out a way to sandbox files out I think
that's the term I don't
I probably wrong but like I don't care
if they don't want us to access the file
system but they need to figure something
out because if the the biggest does
anybody well none of you use Mac's but I
remember when I bought a Mac oh you do
you do TK I remember I don't know what I
bought a Mac yeah I remember when I
bought a Mac originally my first concern
is are all my things from Windows gonna
work on the Mac and so the biggest
selling point like the first thing that
I looked on YouTube was does this work
and I was relieved to see him and a lot
of people would be like oh they work the
same that's all great
but the problem is when you have
different implementations of USBC on
iPhones this is really frustrating for
people that are considering switching so
not only all USBC protocols are created
equal that's what people need to know
exactly it may look the same but it
won't function the same and you're right
you're right and that in my opinion I
think that's apples misstep there with
with the iPad pro specifically because
this is a creation tool a lot of people
will use it it's not just a media
consumption tool that adapter should
have been either I invented or at least
included in the Box - at least
accommodate the existing user base they
did it when they moved from the twelfth
pin connector to the lights it was the
whole what do you do but they included
options and you know that transition was
hard but it because we moved to
something better it does your adapters
that's the thing like after the 30 pin
and that's great exactly and that's what
they need to do they need to keep their
consumer base they need to make sure
take care of their consumer base I think
that's the better way and I I personally
love my Mac guy nothing against Windows
PCs I just from a from a reliability
standpoint I can tell you that I've had
almost no crashes within the last two
years on my macbook pro not to say that
Windows bad either just you can depend
on it it works you turn it on and it
works it works great fair and one one
last thought on this for a USBC if in a
perfect world every use for me at least
every USB C port would be Thunderball 3
it adds another wrinkle in the confusion
that is I know I caused the thing is
like I do use a new GPU on this made
book in order to I want to don't get me
like that I want to build a TT PU you've
made me want to get an EDP you man there
you go because gaming there's it's just
more fun and the thing is that there are
there are other ways of getting that
kind of gaming performance out of it and
apples throwing their hat into the ring
so there is could could you see Apple
actually being or rather the service
that they're creating it would be the
Netflix for gaming I don't think I like
that term but I kind of see where
Apple's coming from with this because
apparently a new service is going to
come out that will allow for games to be
played via a streaming service now
there's there's a reason why I actually
kind of like this even though I'm not an
Apple user even though I don't use Mac's
I can see this being a thing
because anyone who does game on the
regular can't usually do it on a Macbook
streaming is the way to do it so that
kind of made sense to me actually well
that that's in videos implementation too
they did the GeForce now implementation
for on the Mac that's one of the great
ways of plane is a streaming it's it's
where I do believe cloud gaming is gonna
be a big big player in the near future
specifically with you know triple-a
titles new games specifically would kill
this don't want to invest in the
hardware but yet still want to be able
to get a great experience you guys know
that Google Google did one right Google
has Google stream right now I try to get
in I couldn't get in I yeah
it's I'm hoping it does actually you
know take off at there other than just
the initial test that we saw but it
would be amazing if we have some kind of
a streamlined process that allows us to
again like I said it just because not
everybody's gonna be buying the the
higher-end models and they want to maybe
play some really good titles and I feel
like streaming and if they can do this
game fly of of you know nothing like a
custom game file and that is a that's a
throwback right there yeah you know
Netflix for yelling wait what happened
to gameplay
oh yeah yeah are you a big gamer Mex
as I want to make sure we get max in on
this one yeah that's all right
no question now why am I always the only
one who teaching me things but no I'm
completely against gaming on streaming
man I I haven't tried it yet I've been
hearing some good things though
depending on your internet connection
obviously yes so my biggest problem is
is like I travel a lot and so when is it
that I want to play a game more when I'm
on a plane and I've got a lot of time to
spare and guess what doesn't work it's
like you're on a 15 hour flight that
China I want to play a couple of games
in oh crap they need to connect dammit
that yeah I invested in in gaming I
would need for an option for offline
gaming which not all games do and that's
the biggest problem like if there was
like a mode where I could still play
something offline then great that's my
thinking I think Apple's just gonna you
know instead of selling individual games
will feature
you of them in a package you can pay
monthly for to play like exclusive
titles and stuff you'll be able to
download them that's my thinking but
then again I'm not a gamer so I don't
know or the calculators Odyssey that's
it okay the so just brought in an
interesting thought that maybe you could
download down one of the games and then
be able to like have kind of like a
steam implementation of it but then of
course there might be some sort of DRM
on it it has to connect to the internet
at some point over the course of let's
say three to five days they do that on
Android from time to time as well the
problem re run oh yeah that's right the
problem with that in my estimation is we
go back to the original problem on a
MacBook it's not easy to get these kinds
of games to actually install that's
reason why streaming actually
circumvents a lot of those problems that
you don't have the specs for it you
don't have the you don't actually have
the OS for it because obviously a lot of
these games what I've made for Mac OS
exactly you know so that's that's the
one that's the wrinkle in all of this I
feel like the PlayStation want to do
something like that like we have a
PlayStation now hmm
it does it does work I have the worst
internet connection at home for that
kind of thing but I have heard from
people that it works quite well and I
remember trying to use it one time music
because they had a PlayStation TV where
you could actually stream PlayStation
now to it so you office you all of a
sudden had like the entire library of
ps2 and ps3 games via stream yeah and
it's a great idea like I think it is a
great idea because especially now that
we live in the world of subscriptions
and that's one place it should not was
or is haven't done in a long time though
I still want to get into google stream
though I really wanted to try that out
okay so from the gaming I don't really
have a great second Thank You Jules for
the kudos on the segue on that last one
but but yeah I don't really have a great
segue for this one but I will say it
seems as though and I don't think
anyone's really surprised by this
Android and iOS people are pretty much
gonna be staying put in their platforms
because release cycles were Hardware
starting to elongate a bit there's
really no reason to actually change from
one platform to the other or really
there's not a whole lot of incentive
in the - too often and as far as this
graph shows as as joules are showing
right now a lot people are just kind of
staying where they are it's oh that
particular graph or anybody who's
watching the live right now that's from
the consumer consumer intelligence
research partners and that graph
basically shows that everyone's kind of
just sticking where they are people like
what they like yeah yeah sure sure
I like chirp know I like everybody that
I I know people I've got friends and
probably you know sometimes we get extra
samples with phones or stuff like that
and they're they probably have issues
like with their phone and I'm like I
think I have an extra one that you can
borrow while you get your phone or place
or something and they're like oh what
iPhone is it Oh Hank no it's an Android
phone they're like oh but I need a knife
like something for like so invested man
it's true
and I noticed that the less tech-savvy
that somebody is the more they they want
to not try something else that's not
iPhone they probably I think that the
galaxy s4 was like the worst
introduction to Android because I know a
lot of people switch to Android with
that galaxy s4 and then they immediately
came back
I mean well back then there was a much
more compelling case for staying away
from the if you could man always
remember those areas but ok so Jules has
a really good question you know we can
go a little bit into this I don't want
to go too long on this the war of ant
war never changes the war between
Android and iOS like was it even worth
debating if you basically are in your
ecosystem and you're never gonna change
anyway because now whenever we do versus
and we ever whenever we do comparisons
between these two ecosystems it's almost
as if it's a crusade to get people to
come over to our side but you know no
one was gonna do that like it doesn't
seem like it anymore
TK Maxx your thoughts iMessage
oh god yeah neither do i and yet you
said why I stick to there's a reason why
there's always an iPhone either in my
bag
my pockets there's just it's up social
media yep no I agree and Instagram is 10
times better on iOS and is on Android
like myself my son is one of those
people that will never accept an Android
phone he will like it doesn't matter how
old the iPhone is you will take that
this meme of this like toad and like
really it's like all boxy like all 8-bit
grounded yeah yeah and this is this is
what this is what snapchat looks like on
Android I mean they're designed and
they're they're first developed on iOS
and then they are later ported over it's
it's just the way that they're focusing
on 90% of their consumer base yeah
Instagram snapchat I mean I've seen them
at events and the way they talk you but
they don't even think I'm going
existence now it is fair to say that
apps are starting to get better on
Android for instance the pixel it's
starting to develop more you know better
experiences for pixel phones it still
doesn't solve the problem though that
you know a lot of people they're not
buying pixels they're buying Samsung's
and LG's or what-have-you so hopefully
at some point in the future it gets
better but yeah they just need to get
prettier that's what we need with the
picture I think so yeah there's no I
will say like I have noticed significant
changes not necessarily just on the
pixel when it comes to Instagram on
Android it's just like for example
boomerangs on iPhones lasts twice as
much than they do on any Android phone
like the codec for video even if they're
using like more of the core video and
not just creating like a screen shot
like they did before
even you will notice stabilization on
the iPhone that you won't notice on the
pixel you will notice dynamic range on
the iPhone and Instagram stories that
you won't notice on an Android phone and
so it's just God there has to be
something they can do like the big duty
to fix it because whether we like it or
not like of our business is social Matt
in our case
whether I like it or not I have to be
carrying an iPhone it's at any point in
the day right right
fair enough and like and like you said
your your son will not do use anything
other than an iPhone I guess the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree
[Laughter]
and on that note that's it for that I'm
just kidding no that's the end no cut it
off there we're done you won't be able
to come back alright so from from that
awesome joke alright we have okay how
would you actually feel if there was a
phone what the with the Energizer logo
on the back Oh what you mean that
energize it that makes couple eye
cavities that are in my drawer right now
the plenty oh yeah
like I would find it a little bit
disconcerting that that phone is not
thick enough to actually hold double-a
batteries I want and is why you
surprised there was a KFC phone what
yeah no your that a Pepsi phone - mm-hmm
yes yes I remember that like it depends
on your region then you'd be shocked I'm
I'm shocked that they haven't made the
move seriously mmm go with your best I
think the Pepsi phone is still there
yeah yeah right
yeah I I you know why did you put it on
the docket I want to try these phones
okay I will do that I will I will
absolutely try that phone out no done
perfect a user for this Sunday
I mean Pepsi's all over the freaking
Super Bowl right so the way go Rams
anyway the the the energizer phone the
one thing that kind of gets me about
this article is that energizer known for
batteries has nothing to say about the
battery it's gonna be three to four
thousand million powers that's it yeah
and I would just love booting up that
phone and it's the bunny you know what I
would love I would love to try it out
for like a couple of hours and then
notice that it has terrible battery life
and so you didn't hear the pun it's like
it doesn't keep going and going and go
what if they said it's a four thousand
milliamp hour alkaline
yes all right doesn't have a replaceable
battery you know what I'm saying I think
it's great I don't think that signs are
replaceable batteries are coming back
yeah I mean oh no they're not put its
energizer mm-hmm it just would be the
same right yeah yeah like that would be
their claim to fame like oh look we
stuck with the removal black you can
have those they have those two buttons
that you press to see what the level is
yeah yeah oh my god this is just it's
just a reference fest at this point
because we're talking about energizer
all right that was our new segment for
today we do have a couple of big stories
to talk about and we're gonna go in and
get into our a little break for a second
speaking of our break I need a refill

all right we're back and we're back from
the break and it's already been it's
already been a lively show why we max
like let's let's let's get a little bit
of your background for a bit for our
audience because obviously you're new to
the show I mean you're new to half of us
here I think and yeah exactly so let's
get a little bit of info like where were
you from what kind of work do you do
like you know let let our audience know
oh yeah sure so I'm from New Jersey
I've lived in Tennessee South Carolina
multiple places around the country
basically when I was 14 I was just
looking at technology news sites because
I was super into it I've always loved
technology I've always had a fascination
with computers and stuff so I started
looking at everybody and they're doing
uh doing tech news I was like I could
just do that so there's a free website
builder called Weebly and I just threw
together a sort like a makeshift
technology website where I could just
write about Apple stuff so I started
doing that and this people started
reading it stuff but people want it more
as people do most of the time so I just
expanded it to cover a bunch of
different topics and technology and
stuff like phones laptops basically
everything pocket now covers and a lot
of other people but I just wanted to put
my own spin on it because it's me
writing and stuff so it was actually
originally called embedded but in 2070
and I changed it to Maitre Docs so I
could use embedded as my my media
company which is sort of in the process
of being built I'm working on that but
for now which is maître Docs and it's
I've gotten pretty far so I basically
just cover phone news like I love like
you know if you're gonna throw together
a special phone with like two screens on
the back or whatever and three or four
cameras on the back like I'm gonna write
about it so I like all like the
interesting stuff in technology and
everything so I just like try to have
fun with it and stuff I try to pump out
as much as I can
I've gotten kind of far with it because
like I was invited by CES I was elected
as a trailblazer like journalists so
like they flew me out and stuff I got
the cover this year um yeah so you had
that ribbon on yeah
yeah yeah you had the trip actually I
have mine and it's hanging right here at
my desk to let everybody else see it as
you can see I was a trailblazer cool
experience everything but um yeah I'm
starting to uh get somewhere and I do I
just want to say like I wanted to say
this at the opening and I hope I'm not
taking up too much time here I just want
to thank like you guys for like thinking
of me to like come on the podcast
especially Jules because I was in
contact with him for a CES trail a
trailblazer uh a collaboration article
that I was doing and I did invite hi may
as well because yeah it's alright I mean
I you know if you still want to send in
your submission by all means go right
ahead we haven't updated but I did I met
him at the 60 launch remember yeah yeah
yeah I was taller than he was but I know
and we apologize I mean we we do realize
that this is a very crazy show and
everything I mean we don't we don't want
to we don't I mean it was just it was a
pleasure meeting you and I just I wanted
to reach out just to see if you were
interested but um yeah I did just want
to thank you guys because I I've always
loved this podcast I've always listened
to it every week just trying to adjust
my camera here and it's kind of been
like a goal of mine to get on it so it's
pretty cool that I'm on it now you're
definitely welcome back thank you thank
you sir appreciate it awesome man well
welcome to the show dude and yeah the
that's let's go and get to our topics
then for this second segment so for our
for our in-depth I mentioned at the
beginning of the show I was so I'm so
flabbergasted by the fact that these
stories actually were making it onto my
network television news not mine I mean
my parents were watching and then it
came out and I was really I was really I
was really surprised because this whole
like this whole thing about Facebook
trying to it's a very invasive thing
that they were trying to do now whether
or not it was actually maybe I'll use
the word illegal or perhaps nefarious we
can go in and debate on that but but
basically what what happened was
Facebook was trying to pay actually I'm
sorry I shouldn't be talking about when
we'll talk about something else when I
was something else right now before we
get into Facebook sorry about that
drills we're talking
about why apples revenue tumbled with
their new Josas like you can switch the
spine it's fine let's talk about Apple
first before we get into the Facebook
stuff already gearing up for that
Facebook conversation where you really
okay well we can well let's keep your
thoughts in mind because I want everyone
to kind of rev up for that one because I
think it's gonna be a great discussion
for now let's go ahead and expound on
apples revenue actually dropping with
their first not first but one of their
earnings cause of the CRA so all right
well we did talk about it a little bit
before because there was already a
projection that the revenue was going to
have dropped now Tim Cook will try to
give two really big reasons about it one
of them being subsidies from carriers
but also I don't remember what the other
one was but mainly the fact that the
iPhones were supposed to be at a quote
unquote great value I think they're
blaming China maybe a little bit for an
exchange they're the right one Jules
think right for an exchange also in
develop markets less subsidies but I
don't know do you guys all buy it I
guess is a question I was looking for
dude like if I had to buy my iPhone 10s
like if it had to come out of my money I
would not I would not it's just the I'm
like $1,000 it's like a company model
the base Mont yeah for the fans like
yeah mom and it's it's like for me if
this were me and like dude like imagine
in our case like most of us like we like
our incomes aren't bad even even with
the ability to pay that much money for a
phone I wouldn't I have no problem in
paying $3,000 for a computer because I
get value from it because it serves
specific purposes that I test the
cheaper computers and can't do the
question is what can that phone do that
makes it cost so much more money man
it's just Apple as I love how this
reality the store should just cut up
caught up on them I was waiting for it
to happen I told you guys when the
iPhone 10 came out I'm like I hope that
people don't buy it just to prove
if people go out crazy and buy it it
just gives every other company a reason
to raise their prices and that's what
happened yeah the other company raised
their prices and so it there had to come
a point where that that idea had to
collapse like in the case of the iPads
you know people bought iPads and you
know the market when I'm crazy initially
and they were affordable and everything
and all that was great but then there
came a point when people realize that
they don't need a different iPad every
year yes that's the thing if they're
gonna buy a phone for that amount of
money they're not gonna upgrade every
year it doesn't matter like their iPhone
upgrade program only works in the United
States they everywhere if they want like
I like that upgrade program because you
get free you get AppleCare pretty much
for free Apple Care Plus if you do the
math but it's like god dude that the
price was just stupid and if you notice
like iPads grew in sales for the first
time in like four years
Mac's grew in sales significantly in
comparison to the past but then iPhones
which make up 65% of Apple's income or
down 15% and that that was an accident
waiting to happen
it was just gonna happen yeah and not to
not to discredit any of the reasons that
Apple or rather Tim Cook are trying to
like sort of give here but there are a
lot of different reasons being given for
the fact that the actual products
themselves can't be brought down in
price this other story that we have here
has to do with screws literally that's
the fact that this this very special
screw that was supposed to go in sue
them at the high Mac Pro either did not
they didn't get enough of them or
they're too special to be able to be
made there were also thoughts about
labor costs out in China and even though
all of this is is a factor what they
were trying to say with the iMac Pro
also is that it was supposed to be made
in the US so of course that would also
make labor costs you know a little bit
more extravagant so there are so many
reasons are kind of coming out for all
Apple products as to why why the prices
are so high whether it be carrier
subsidies Jules just said in our chat
right now that the iPhone 10 are at a
Japanese carrier was still going for
$1200 Wow so yeah I can learn in a very
we're in a very special part of the
world in the case that we can actually
look at the market from a particular
standpoint but we don't have the
experience that people in Japan people
in Korea people that I don't have but
the problem is this in the in the case
of Apple then you have companies like
Xiaomi who will teach you that if you
make so much so here's the thing
Apple has an advantage that every other
Android OEM doesn't have unless they're
based in China and it's called they own
the store they get 30 percent cut for
anything that's sold in that App Store
and so Xiaomi has proven that they can
completely remain profitable and make
good money by selling phones almost at a
cost and making the money from their
their software services so one is Apple
the problem is not how much it cost the
problem is how much they want in how
much they want to make out of each
product how much profit they want you
know Apple really needs to drop their
profit projections man like their profit
projections are like higher than certain
companies in certain countries a
external what it would like was their
external debt like their profit numbers
are crazy stupid well you know and so
obviously they look great in front of
investors in everything but you know
it's just they they either drop their
profit margins and accept the fact that
they're already making good money out of
software services or their this is just
getting this a bit bear in mind this is
just what quarter number two after the
launch can you imagine how quarter three
and four are gonna be before the next
iPhone yeah for sure okay so we also
have oh sorry
see this is such a while a while a queue
up our next story TK and Max I want to
make sure we get your thoughts on these
projections so whatever thoughts that
you have on Apple's sort of fall from
grace perhaps but just in the very least
their revenue drops well I can chime in
just real quick TK no let me go but
personally I just think they made their
phones too expensive
when all of the rumors that were they
were circling before the the tennis was
announced I really genuinely thought
that we're gonna price the tennis at
$8.99 because I thought that would
decent starting price and then you get
the tennis max for $9.99 that would give
I phone ten buyers an incentive to spend
another thousand dollars they get a
bigger screen
I mean somewhat of an incentive I mean
it's still not much of an upgrade but
regardless like they would at least get
a bigger screen a bigger battery but I
think they just set themselves up for
disaster
I mean they keep charging more and more
for their phones I'm sure they realize
that they have to charge less in order
to convince people to buy them but for
some reason they're just not doing that
and I don't understand why but go ahead
TK I know I'm with you I think the they
reach for the sky approach that we've
been going year after year ever since
last year with the first thousand-dollar
phone and now we obviously see more and
more people following to hymies point as
well yeah when when people buy it you're
validating their assumption but the
reality is a 799 it's not an affordable
phone the 10r
right now is free you can get it
actually included in a plan because that
that's the way to get it to go I think
the market will normalize I think
realistically you're right that you know
JB in the US we are in that certain
subsidy area I mean I love being on jump
on the man to be able to afford go with
$100 phone because I'm not gonna pay
$1200 for the same behind me said it's
just too expensive but I lease my phone
and I jump from one phone to another and
that just justifies it for me so I hope
I hope this is a good learning
experience at that where they can
actually start normalizing a little bit
realizing we've gone too far we need to
just adjust it and keep our market our
market share where is there's no way for
them to take over the entire market
Android is already strong enough this is
something they need to kind of just the
numbers will make them realize it well
I'm a touched upon the fact that
expectations from Apple themselves need
to be measured but it seems that the
entire market also might need to
reevaluate their expectations because it
seems that it seems that there were a
lot of analysts out there who were
overcorrecting maybe the hype for the
iPhones were still very very high and
the thing is that kind of sustainability
that that guy that kind of hype is not
sustainable year year year year after
year and this year that proved to be the
case so any other thing like I was
I was recently immediate that cut
quarters a couple of months ago
and for me it was really interesting
that there is still a huge there's a
billion their mentality is like we're
working for the next billion the next
million users that are not in the United
States they're in India and in Africa
these people like right now the idea is
to get as many people connected as
possible and so a lot of companies are
not even investing they're not even
going crazy over what Apple's going for
and the problem is like they're our
country's going through recessions right
now like you mean China's economy is not
at its best so what exactly was Apple
expecting I I thought that the iPhone 10
was gonna be like all right it's been 10
years we spent so much in R&amp;amp;D and just
like in the first iPhone this phone was
$500 was a two-year contract you guys
remember what the first iPhone was what
did they do that was actually if you if
you look into the history the first
generation iPhone was only costing that
for like four months
that was the launch was in June like the
announcement was in January the launch
was in June by the music events in
September they dropped the price to 399
puts it 400 yeah okay and then for the
launch and they killed the four gigabyte
model they sticked only to the a
gigabyte model for $4.99 plus a two-year
contract and then by the launch of the
iPhone 3G they won - - it was one that
was it 199 or $2.99 was it - your
contract DK it was the 199 with the
three or the two-year contract that was
yeah I get it
you invested so much in R&amp;amp;D the first
phone had to be expensive fine but there
was no reason for the iPhone for us to
be just as expensive I feel that Apple
was like all right you know what let's
just keep the iPhone eight which is a
good phone I actually recommend the
iPhone eight let's launch the 10r
but it's just they they I love that this
is happening honestly I'm sorry but I
have to say it I love that this
happening because this is what's gonna
teach companies come on guys come on
fair enough and just to give one last
note on that final piece or the most
recent one that last piece that the
projection is that
for the second half of this year things
are gonna get better because you have
things like summer discounts and all
these deals but the thing is this is
such a complicated issue for Apple and
also for just consumers in general
because like we said earlier we are
probably the ones who will get those
kinds of discounts in a heavily
subsidized area of the world meanwhile
in places like Asia India all those
other places there may not even be those
kinds of deals so it's still gonna be
the same problem even with those
projected increases in revenue that's
one problem and the other problem is
that because Apple has decided to not
provide numbers of how many products
they've sold only revenue this is coming
back to bite them because obviously if
they provide these discounts if you do
the math and you look at how much Apple
has sold when it comes to the iPhone
sales obviously there is this like hype
there's a spike during the third quarter
because of the because of the iPhone and
then there's others a natural drop
because the Mahr there are new phones
coming out the product is on its its arm
is slow into the cycle during the low
end of the cycle it's not like if like
the numbers are already there of the
amount of people that buy so that
numbers not gonna change
they're just gonna make less money out
of those phones because of the discounts
if they do accept to do the discount so
it's it's I don't think it's gonna
happen analysts have been proven to be
completely wrong with the iPhones in it
yeah well let's see how the adjustments
actually happen okay so we have one
final one I love that Jaime is so fired
up I'm gonna start with max on this one
max Facebook Facebook approaches you
says we're gonna pay you a little bit of
money every single month all you got to
do all you got to do is install this
particular app that we want you to
install and just use it just use it
every month and we will give you in this
case that's as $20 a month that was back
in 2016 let's say now you find out or
rather even though you opted into this
app and you know that it was tracking
your data now it's a big deal how do you
react to that kind of thing probably
with anger resentment towards Facebook
which was probably resultant to me
deleting the app from my phone and
Facebook as a whole yeah
yeah we all but guys I was just gonna
say that's exactly what we're talking
about here so this is the story I was
talking about that actually made it on
to network television it actually made
it onto a lot of newspapers and
publications tenkara TechCrunch rather
reported that since 2016 the company was
distributing a data sucking VPN look at
that that oxy amor I like that in the
form of a Facebook research app for both
major phone platforms Android and iOS so
what they were told what Facebook was
telling people was that they were
recruiting users aged 13 to 35 to join
it was an opt-in type of deal and they
were being paid $20 a month to use the
app here's the thing
it was tracking every little thing you
did on your phone it was tracking your
data inside and out and Apple caught
wins not only did they catch wind of it
they actually took that VPN off of their
App Store and I'll just go ahead and
mention these two things real quick
they actually disabled all of its
internal applications for employees who
actually work at Apple who could have
potentially gotten into this VPN program
obviously we have companies like Apple
and Google who track already because
you're an employee if there's everything
that's happening you don't want anybody
else to be tracking the same exact stuff
unreleased applications under audition
in bar communications exactly embargo
and NDA's so Apple not only did that for
their internal applications they also
did they also did so for Google
applications but very recently they did
bring back the certificate for Google
applications on their on their platform
so I think right now my main question is
in terms of privacy and I don't even
have an actual question I just want to
know if all of you are what your
reactions are to this and the fact that
it became such a hot story such a big
story that affected kind of everybody in
a way because now we're seeing that a
big company like Facebook who has
already had such problems it's still
doing crap it's still doing this kind of
stuff it's it's just it's very it's the
same reaction I mean when you think
about the fact that yeah exactly it's
you do you don't know what you're
getting into even though you thought
you're getting into something simple
it's not just standard and there's just
the implications because then you're
like trying to remember like what did I
talk about what kind of information that
I have on my system at a time and
specifically if you use your phone at
work exactly Apple and Google would both
be very very upset if some leaks could
have happened during that time so I
think it's the amount of ways that
Google that Facebook has to be able
actually collect data on us not only
through Facebook through Instagram now
it bugs me you know when I get
notifications in my Instagram
application for my you know Facebook
notification so that to me is just the
reach so it's always surprising to see
how far would they go but there's not
being you know upfront about the fact
that what that they're tracking way more
it's I mean even with permissions they
you know users should have been aware
what they're opting what they're giving
up for that 20 bucks a month and I think
Facebook was actually saying that they
made their users aware of it they were
never secretive about the fact that it
was actually tracking data that was on
the phone but you know when you think
about the general consumer number one
they're being paid to use an app you're
probably gonna say yes to that number
two do you ever actually when you go
into the Play Store for example or even
the App Store and you press install and
that horse feel comes up that says you
know all the things that it does do you
actually even read it
and like you know it kind of plays in my
opinion this is the reason I'm a little
bit upset about it it plays upon the
naivete of the general consumer and also
it's not that Facebook was being
secretive about the fact that attract
data they found a way around a couple of
the certificates in the Apple App Store
so the the the thing is that it actually
broke the rules of apples tos because
because all applications are supposed to
have certificates and are supposed to
have private privacy policies those
certificates are limited if you're a
developer you have a limited amount
because that you can distribute and so
that's the thing it's it's it's not
alright all I can say about this whole
Facebook thing is I think the correct
word that you mentioned originally is
nefarious it's just like yes you did
disclose it yes you did tell it but why
like it like I I don't think that there
had that there's proof of
more desperate company I think the word
is desperate than Facebook like it's
it's crazy the amount of stupidity like
I I've been wanting to kill Facebook for
the longest time because it's literally
gossip central enough in Latin America
that's just the way it is but it's just
it's it's sad to see that they are
willing to ask consumers to be part of
something like this right like are you
really that desperate are you really
that needy or your developers and your
engineers so inept that they are not
able to figure these things out on their
own they have to get consumers to
provide their private data photography
their messaging like seriously you need
that you guys can't do a better job that
that's the way I see it I honestly am I
don't think I think the word is pissed
it's just I'm so happy like for example
my son does not use Facebook I love that
a lot of the you know a lot of the newer
generation Millennials don't use
Facebook I love that they don't I'm just
right now I'm really sad that they also
own Instagram and whatsapp yeah that's
because those are two services that were
great before Facebook and that I've
chosen to continue using just because
like for example they they kept a lot of
their leadership and so these apps
continued on they're on their way of
being but oh my god man I don't know
honestly I I don't I don't recommend
people use the service anymore it's
terrible well how about this how about
this wrinkle in the story and max I want
to get your thoughts on both Facebook
and this next part apparently Google was
doing something similar yeah though
ridiculous yeah so Google apparently was
kind of skirting these certificates
these enterprise certificates and even
though Apple and Google have started to
work together to figure out how to fix
that kind of thing Google also said
themselves that you know we we it was a
mistake for us to kind of you know not
adhere to the tos to the energy to
Apple's enterprise program but the app
has been disabled and we're working with
Apple to like fix where those mistakes
occurred we've also been very upfront
with users about the way that we use
their data from this act the thing is
like yeah Google is kind of doing the
same thing
well apples Apple for once is sort of
policing these kinds of things but max
thoughts from you about this whole
privacy issue so first of all I think
it's completely insane that both Google
and Facebook even considered building an
app that would install the certificate
on your phone that they they had to know
it was in violation of Apple's Terms of
Service right I mean am I am I the only
one here that doesn't you know that
thinks that way or you have to build the
app like that's right build the app of
course you know that it either violates
or doesn't they can't argue ignorant
come on man
yeah but the thing is this is not an
isolated incident there are people
figuring out that apps like Amazon
doordash Sano's they have the same
certificate issue so it's not it's not
really an isolated event so I'm not I'm
not trying to say that the producers of
the apps have like they were negligent
or anything like that but in the way
it's kind of possible don't you think
yeah it's no it's absolutely it's the
whole thing just kind of bewildered me
because know what why would what do they
need the apps in the first place
like why do they need all this data like
they just whenever like a privacy spill
or whatever you know a data leak when I
have you whatever something like that
happens I'm like what are you guys
leaking you're leaking photos and videos
and stuff that you know dumb people
around Facebook have uploaded so it just
if people there's me why they need all
this information on you in the first
place just as go and build an app that
they know is a violation Apple's Terms
of Service to build that and ask people
hey we'll pay you if you've installed us
on your phone so we can collect this
data like what are you going to use this
data for anyway yeah that's always been
that's always been my my stance when it
comes to this kind of stuff like it's
one thing to opt-in to have your data
tracked what I want to know is what
you're going to use it for and that's
almost never answer that questions
almost never answered like oh no it's
not like the last your permission that's
why you know both Google and Apple
they're improving the way that app
ask you permission to like use your
location he was a bunch of different
sensors on your phone use your camera
like I thought it was interesting that
Marquez did a marques Brownlee mkbhd if
you don't already know for some reason
he did a video well you know when he did
a video on the V zone X I think it's
called the V bone X right with a the pop
up camera yeah okay so yeah well I think
this was a good representation of how on
private Facebook is whenever you would
open up the Facebook app on the phone
the yes if you go to whatever video what
is our I guess you have to scroll back
probably a year I guess it's been a year
since then but if you go it's like a few
minutes into the video he says oh and
also if you open up the Facebook app the
camera starts popping up so it just that
makes you concerned about your privacy
and then just moves on but I think that
goes to show you you know just what
Facebook wants to do with your phone and
how much data wants to collect from you
so like even if you don't deliberately
take a selfie you're kind of giving
facebook selfies every time you open up
the app it's like a shutter button yeah
pretty much
I should have the we should we should
all test that out I think most of us in
this chat right now have defined X we
should try it out with it I don't have
it with me right now
I'll have it next I don't have a period
yeah well I'll bust mine now because I'm
using it for a piece that I'm that I'm
filming a little bit later after this
cast after lunch rather but yeah the
that's I always go back to the same
thing like you know there are some
answers to what this data is being used
for and of course that's targeted ads
that's targeted marketing stuff like
that that's they already do which they
already do so they keep in mind it's not
like they're lacking on the data point
there exactly so they do that already
and we all have those stories where
Facebook is already tracking you in
certain ways or Google is tracking in
certain ways and that's the reason why
if I say the word meditation once all of
a sudden on my Instagram app I have
products for meditation and it's like
it's everywhere it's creepy right it is
creepy but at the same time if you have
the knowledge of knowing that that's the
reason why they're using
and if that's the only reason I would
actually kind of be okay with it surely
you're aware of Rob you're aware its
technologists not it's not being done in
the background and you know exactly like
you said it's just knowing you can up
for something as long as you know what
you're opting for not just the blank
statement carte blanche come in and do
whatever you want all right but like
it's it what I'm okay with is the stuff
that they show on the surface so when
you install an app it asks you can I use
your location can I use your your
contacts all that kind of stuff there's
stuff you see on the surface that they
ask permission for I'm okay with that
I'm trying to figure out why you need to
install the certificate on my phone what
other data you're gonna record because
you've already shown me a bunch of stuff
in prompts before I open up the app for
the first time so what else do you need
from me and that you're gonna pay me $20
a month for yeah that's that's what's
crazy to me now there was a term that
various comes from because I'm just like
yes there's no but yeah exactly there's
no better way of knowing that somebody
doesn't like this there's no better way
of knowing that someone has like weird
intentions in mind and when they pay you
trust me bro it'll be fine bro it took
exactly yeah it's like somebody it's a
it's like somebody asking me to like
co-sign a car for them I'm like what are
you talking about like thank you five
hundred bucks like no like do that I'm
good for it man I'm good for it just
sign on the bye payment I'm sorry guys
I'm going through my privacy settings
just to make sure that my camera's not
active on Facebook like what like no and
you know what it's funny cuz like you
were telling us about this during CES I
me that you wanted to kill Facebook for
good and that's through and what I found
funny is that you still wanted well you
found it funny too is that you want to
kill Facebook where you still using
whatsapp and that's like your number one
app but yeah but the thing about it is
like in in Latin America we don't use
text messaging like at all like zero
nobody you get texts from like shoot
like whatsapp is the text messaging
service your period it's also in Europe
and so obviously I've been using
whatsapp since it was whatsapp since it
didn't belong to Facebook and so call
that
like just like people say oh I message
for iPhone okay whatsapp is like a very
big deal breaker not just for me like
how else would I communicate with people
here that's the problem
yeah fair this is something that will
bring up in another show potentially
Sochi if we do a deep dive into this
kind of privacy stuff but again we
talked a little bit earlier about how we
live in a very specific part of the
world where things like privacy things
like even carrier subsidies are a thing
and not so much everywhere else I
present Exhibit A of what this kind of
future might look like we chat we check
controls everything in in technological
China and everyone there you opt-in by
installing that app but everyone can't
live without it it does everything from
sending sending in your your money to
other people to actually paying for
things in stores like when ISA and I
were in Shenzhen one time we were using
WeChat to communicate with our friends
who are there but then we actually went
to a place to buy tea and we paid for
using WeChat like this is probably the
that is probably the future that some of
these companies are looking for to
actually have that kind of control over
it and one of the things that worries me
is that I think that the app that is
closest to achieving that is Instagram
or whatsapp like I think that these are
the two apps have the most potential to
become WeChat
yeah Jools just brought up even I mean
even darker is this black mayor office
on China is testing a Social Credit
System with constant monitoring of its
system of its yeah I read about that
part yeah
no no exactly judging and grading and
reading other people's social stature
and their trustworthiness their credit
worthiness it's like wow
okay yeah having other people judge you
yeah and then one of our one of our chat
comments sorry that we haven't been in
the chat more this has been one hell of
a show these are all deep fakes from
cotton these are all deep fakes none of
these faces are real yeah that's the I
don't know if anybody has even like
dived into the world of deep fakes yet
that could also be something that
Facebook is trying to use that's why the
camera comes out they want to get more
of their ego and started deep faking you
you know like we being public figures
all of us we probably
I don't know Jaime I'm pretty sure you
might have but like have you ever had
like an account on Facebook tried to
impersonate you I have I haven't Twitter
okay Twitter I had on Facebook it was
super creepy and imagine if the deep
fake like stuff actually happened on
that on that so it's actually really
convincing so all this is so crazy and
it opens up a whole Pandora's box of
like implications and whatnot and I'm
trying to figure out how to wrap this
without without it being so depressing
it's Friday
happy Friday people it's true TGIF
everybody go get some ribs at your
favorite restaurant I'm here like you
you know as you mentioned before you
know it's it's a good time spend some
time with the family even if you don't

time to do so yeah upload all your
photos on so we chat and Facebook yeah
