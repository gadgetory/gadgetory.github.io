long ago you said we updated that
coverage with the blackberry classic
review last month and we even took it to
CES too late you said we told you we
couldn't get a blackberry Passport no
excuses you said well congratulations
thanks to AT&amp;amp;T you're finally getting
your way I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow here with the AT&amp;amp;T blackberry
passport unboxing and first look the
story begins as all unboxings do with
the Box a big one in this case a Borg
cube of a package that says rectangles
are for conventional phones and this
Blackberry is no conventional phone
let's put it aside for a second though
as we take a quick look at the box
contents which I'm happy to report are
nicely packaged into individual cells
kind of like the Yoda phone - we took a
look at in January even with all the
challenges at blackberry the company
certainly hasn't forgotten how to
present a product and in a rare show of
restraint AT&amp;amp;T didn't really mess with
him the wall wart is BlackBerry branded
the included earbuds bring a deluxe
feeling flattened cable and a curious
ear gel design and some of the paperwork
even has its own little impenetrable box
that took me way too long to figure out
how to open coming back to the passport
itself let's get this out of the way
here is your obligatory shot with a real
passport lol oMG et Cie peeling off the
protective film on the back cover gives
us a first touch impression of the mat
slightly rubberized finish and combined
with the heavy weight almost 200 gram
mass it feels very well made just like
the classic did rather than a full panel
removable back cover there's an access
plate above the fret concealing the
Semin micro SD card slot it's a clever
way of keeping the sides free of ports
and other penetrations and I like it up
front the four and a half inch square
display is protected by a film bearing a
reminder that texting and driving is a
stupid idea this is true
as you can see the AT&amp;amp;T variant is a
little different than the global version
and not just thanks to the silk-screened
Deathstar a silver mid plate encircles
the whole device and the corners are
more rounded reminiscent of the classic
those looking for a more edgy modern
design might be a little letdown but
this is good news for in hand comfort as
the corners won't dig into the palm and
the keyboard Holly geez you guys the
keyboard I was straight-up scared to
start using it because of the way the
spacebar horns in on the bottom row it
looks bizarre but I was surprised how
quickly that stopped bothering me in
less than five minutes if you're
wondering the key feedback offers more
travel and a softer kind of click eNOS
than any other smartphone it's like
using one of those low noise office
keyboards with silent switches from back
of the day and it feels incredible the
jury's still out on the punctuation row
being stuck on the display we'll see how
this goes in a longer look of course
finally the software is blackberry 10
dot 3.1 with all the active frame
universal search and blackberry hub
action you can handle for my thoughts on
this latest blackberry software check
out our blackberry classic video review
here on YouTube and Adam doubts
follow-up coverage at pocket now and
keep in mind this video is not a review
but just a first look for further
thoughts on the BlackBerry passport for
AT&amp;amp;T stay tuned
for Joe Levi's impressions coming next
week if videos like this or what get
your very blackened subscribe and give
us a thumbs up here on YouTube and
please visit us at pocketnow.com for
tech news of a more textual nature until
next time this has been michael fisher
with pocket now captain to phones on
twitter reminding you to keep those
thumb exercises up because the
smartphone qwerty keyboard isn't quite
dead yet

next time
