today in New York City we got our first
look at the newest version of the camera
app Samsung is supplying for its big boy
productivity phablet like the note 5
last year the note 7 also follows the
Galaxy s4 camera hardware reducing
resolution from 16 megapixels last year
to 12 this year and we expect that this
Note will also be a monster at low-light
performance like its Galaxy S
stablemates
while the hardware isn't breaking any
new ground the software has been refined
breaking away from some of the old
tropes of former Samsung cameras the
overall effect is a slightly cleaner
interface which adds a few gestures for
navigation when launched we get a basic
auto mode that covers most shooting
situations well the left side of the
frame is home to HDR flash and a
settings menu the right side houses
shutter buttons for photos and videos
but eagle-eyed viewers will notice one
button missing where we used to switch
modes that's now accomplished with a
left-to-right swipe and here we have
familiar options for pro mode panorama
slow motion and more a swipe from right
to left holds our collection of filters
which are applied in real time this
might remove two buttons worth of
clutter on your main viewfinder but we
don't think this was really a problem
that needed fixing and funnily we still
have both a button and de gesture to
change from the rear camera to the front
as for actual operation we aren't
expecting significant differences from
the s7 the optical image stabilization
is well balanced and speed reigns
supreme throughout all of this
experience dual pixel focusing is
insanely quick as is launching the
camera manual mode delivers the same
options we're accustomed to control over
shutter speed ISO exposure and white
balance and we're still disappointed to
see those exposure options are disabled
when shooting video no for video though
is the ability to capture HDR video we
couldn't walk away with any footage to
show off here unfortunately but some of
the samples looked brilliant Elling
we've had issues with other HDR
solutions for moving images though as
balancing changes in exposure can be
tricky and on the note HDR is limited to
1080p at 30 frames per second of
might not be a full-time solution for
folks who enjoy faster frame rates or
higher resolutions will definitely be
digging deeper into this feature later
during our real camera review and there
you have it folks a quick first look at
the note 7 camera Samsung delivered one
of our favorite shooters of 2016 at the
beginning of this year and the no traps
that camera up in a fresh coat of paint
with the new app layout we always hope
to see bigger evolutionary leaps as the
note used to be the vanguard phone in
Samsung's lineup but it's tough to
complain about this device receiving one
of the best cameras we've played with on
any phone still you know we'll be
tearing into this deeper and we'll
report back when we've got more to share
