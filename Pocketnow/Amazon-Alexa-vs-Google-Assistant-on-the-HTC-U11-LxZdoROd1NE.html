interact with services like characters
can in science-fiction we've got a ways
to go but competition will get us there
faster Amazon is supporting another
Android phone bringing Alexa to the HTC
u 11 so it's time to take a look at what
you can and can't do by talking to
software how do these ecosystems
currently compare the U 11 turns out to
be a killer testbed for this kind of
showdown for being a powerful phone with
great microphones and good speakers now
what we're talking about today is
different than the Alexa companion app
which all phones can use HTC joins
Huawei and having a specialty app
produced for more echo like interaction
for the full Amazon experience you'll
want to install both of these apps
pitting Amazon and Google head-to-head
there's some overlap in covering the
voice search basics
we're always dying to show you how
voices can tell you the weather or
complete an inquiry into the captainship
of our favorite starship of course I'm
joking voice search isn't really all
that impressive these days what is kind
of fun though is plugging an Android
phone into amazon's playground of
services there are a ton of skills to
choose from audio mini apps that can
deliver news reports play your podcasts
and interact with a variety of IOT
devices though I wish the Seinfeld
trivia app had more questions I maxed
that thing out pretty quick Alexa's vibe
is really fluid chaining together
comments where Google assistant is more
of a one-and-done style interaction and
Amazon's outreach has been terrific
working with third-party developers to
support smart home devices and fitness
trackers and not too shabby for a
product that started out as a voice in a
fancy Bluetooth speaker the main
difference between Alexa and Google's
assistant is the output from a query
both can talk to you but only Google
will display text to compliment answers
or confirm commands what Alexa isn't so
great at is controlling stuff on your
phone she's pretty good at searching and
shopping through Amazon but obviously
she won't help you search for other
buying options and while Amazon music is
expected Alexa won't plug into other
music services like Spotify or Pandora
lastly this is still a separate service
which runs on the phone HTC and Amazon
have worked together to deliver
voice activation though it can't clear
your lock screen but integration is
still very surface level when compared
to Google's native voice interactions
like the ability to control phone
hardware enable and disable phone radios
Google assistant is a native part of the
operating system and that helps quite a
bit at working with all of the guts of
Android like the ability to open apps
and message contacts and messaging might
be frustrating for some amazon has a
service called drop-in calling which is
currently not supported on the phone
build of Alexa so let's wrap this up
Alexa Google assistant which should you
use well why not both the great thing
about the you 11 you get a triple whammy
of software Butler's to improve your
interactions it's one of the only phones
with this amount of user assistance
Google Amazon and HTC zone quieter
assistant aiming to proactively feed you
relevant info when all of this is on one
phone it can feel a touch schizophrenic
and the user needs to remember which
assistant is capable of what function
but you ultimately get the most complete
vision for what we can currently do with
Voice Actions Amazon's great network of
home automation and shopping
side-by-side googles on phone control
and app integration we've seen a lot of
commentary which implies this is an
either/or choice but there's nothing
really stopping you from using both in
the growing AI space of series Bixby's
and Cortana's this Amazon and Google
combo is actually pretty handy as always
