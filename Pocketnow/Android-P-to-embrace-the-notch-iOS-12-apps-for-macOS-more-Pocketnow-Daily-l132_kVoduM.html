ice cream and it'll be all about notches
Apple keeps adding crazy price tags to
the home pod as if it wasn't already
expensive and we get renders of
Samsung's newest wireless charging
technology I'm Jaime Rivera and again
the only way to get you this video on
time was to pre-record it so yeah let's
go through the news this is pocket out
daily the official news today have to do
with deals the essential phone is one of
those products that I will review at
some point I promise I will it it's
gotten good software updates it's gotten
great over time and it's currently for
five hundred twenty three bucks on sale
is it worth that amount of money yes I
would say a solid yes if you're
interested you can learn more about it
in the description so remember the
rumors of Apple not changing the home
screen in any way with iOS because the
company is working on things that are
more important that same source is
claiming that what Apple is doing is
working on allowing iOS applications to
work on Mac OS but for those of you that
don't know Mac OS applications don't
really sell much because you can still
side load them if you ever need to so
obviously the App Store is not really
doing at its best and there are a ton of
iOS applications that we would wish
would work on a larger display that goes
beyond the iPad to a certain degree
provide added functionality it
apparently that's what Apple is doing
for iOS 12 take it with a grain of salt
this is also the same source that got
the whole Trump thing wrong a couple of
weeks ago now let's talk about Apple's
home pod as yes it's sold out and it's
not sold out depending on where you look
at it to be honest with you we've
decided not to review it because it
didn't seem to be interesting enough but
reviewers are liking it up to the point
where we might even consider it over
time the only problem is we highly
recommend you get this product with
Apple care because guess how much money
it costs for you to repair a home pot if
anything goes wrong with it 250 bucks
I know 250 bucks is insane you can learn
more about that in the description as
well now let's spill the spotlight over
to wireless charging one of the features
that we actually like from the Samsung
Galaxy lineup and the company has
continued to pioneer up to the point
where we've got designs and renders over
what to expect
I am going to report that apparently the
park is gonna get smaller which is great
cuz it's significantly bulky right now
even more interesting fast wireless
charging is coming but there are
possibilities that there is faster
wireless charging them there currently
is and that would be great news as it's
currently good but it's not as great as
charging with a wire currently on
samsung devices and by the way these are
the only phones that have fast wireless
charging at the moment apparently
they'll cost 90 bucks so let's hope it's
worth 90 bucks this time and finally the
very interesting news that they have to
do with Android pee as we already begun
hearing what to expect obviously we're
not as really close to Google i/o but
it's gonna happen next couple of months
it's apparently being the pistachio ice
cream right now it's reportedly bringing
significant changes in the user
interface and for those phones that are
going to be supporting notches it seems
that it'll bring functionality to
support notches which is I'm gonna
scratch my head over this but yeah for
those of you that comment over all of
your hate of the iPhone 10 supporting a
knotch end today's question let me know
what you think about Google's possible
move to actually embrace this approach
to technology because in my case the
essential phone already taught us that
it can be done better I wish more
companies would do that leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
what you think friends again if you want
to get the news earlier full of us I'm

channel by hitting this button up here
