another Nam here at the launch of the
HTC One in New York City and checking
out how the one compares to its
immediate predecessor the Droid DNA so
as you can see HTC has maintained the
design language here if we can kind of
tilt the phones there and maybe get some
light on them you can see that curved
build that adheres itself to your palm
very well has been maintained but on the
HTC One if the build is all aluminum and
there is there are very little
concessions to the non aluminum
components here this is a kind of a
single cast block and it feels amazing
it is also much much smaller feeling in
the hand even though it does not much
smaller than the Droid DNA even though
they are similarly sized the DNA appears
larger because of that five inch panel
this 4.7 inch panel is the same
resolution on the HTC One at 1080p but
it is has a higher pixel density because
it is only 4.7 inches diagonal you can
see the edge to edge you can see the
bezel size is comparable between these
two and you can definitely tell that
they're from the same manufacturer
because their design language is similar
but it is a very very big departure for
HTC in the design department that
extends the software as well this is
powered by a Snapdragon 600 processor
backed up by two gigs of ram not microsd
expandable as we were thinking initially
but you can get this device in 32 or 64
gig configurations and this is the new
blinkfeed which Brandon showed you in
his hands on
go too far in depth here but obviously
the biggest ribeyes the biggest revision
to HCC cents in a very long time and you
have your traditional app drawer there
on the DNA so we're seeing you just much
more traditional HTC Sense arrangement
here's your app drawer in the DNA
compared to the app drawer here we have
more not white space it's black space
here but just more space things have
been thought about differently that
clock is now omnipresent with the
weather the buttons have been rearranged
down below a double tap on the home
button gets you to multitasking whereas
there's a dedicated button for that on
the DNA which depending on what yeah
exactly there's a lot of there's a lot
of chrome left in the sense for whereas
it since 5:00 they've really done a good
job of cleaning things up look at that
the calculator is a great great example
of how things have just been flattened
out you can even see the difference in
the keyboard here it's definitely been
flattened on the new devices space
between the keys has been taken out and
it is a little better
this device the HTC one is going to ship
with both Pro and the stock Android
browser out of the box let's do a
comparison speed test one two three and
obviously we're not testing load times
here downloading the same page the
present both popped up instantly and
we're also not on the same net was
loading at Google Search page but as you
can see so let's see a responsiveness
here first
I'm very difficult to hold both of these
phones just check responsiveness a
little bit we have pinch-to-zoom on the
DNA very very responsive we came to love
the DNA's responsiveness despite its
heavy sense skin but the one kind of
takes it to another level here I mean
the scrolling speed has been slowed as
slower so it's a little easier on your
eyes but his responsiveness is right on
par and bring back a notification shade
they're just a ton of new features in
the new version of sense that we really
have to explore here but obviously the
biggest change in sense in a very long
time a very very significant shift not
only for HTC but for possibly for
smartphones in general we'll have to see
going forward put up on the camera real
quick the DNA incorporates a very
standard 8 megapixel shooter the same
one we saw on the HTC One X 1 XL whereas
the new one incorporates what agency is
calling ultra pixels which is dual dual
four megapixel sensors doubled up to
create what HTC is going their best
camera experience ever
and that's backed up by a whole lot of
new software there which we're going to
take a look at obviously you've got your
filters here but the real story is HTC
Zoe and the added settings built into
this device so we're gonna check those
out over on the other side of the room
but this for now just a quick comparison
for the Droid DNA and the new HTC One
Michael Fisher with pocket now stay
tuned for more
