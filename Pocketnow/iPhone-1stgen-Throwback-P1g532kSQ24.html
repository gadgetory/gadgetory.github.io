two things here were two keyboards lots
of them rumors of a phone made by Apple
lots of them for many of you this might
not sound appealing but for those of us
that saw the birth of the iPod and its
evolution
we know how hot it was to see an iPhone
which we hope was better than the Moto
rocker disaster of two years earlier
that day came On January 9 2007 a Steve
Jobs took the stage on his most iconic
presentation ever to announce a phone
that was also a widescreen iPod with
touch controls and an Internet
communicator if you were like me back
then using motorola q or a palm tree or
a blackberry or even an HTC 10 - there
was no way you weren't gonna be struck
by the iPhone and that's actually
because this was the anti smart phone
since it proved to be smarter than all
of its competition but it was also the
first phone oriented to consumers for
consuming content and not really a
business tool like all the rest of the
phones were surely what's left of our
demo unit after Brandon minimums
extensive view shows a lot of scars of
wear and tear and the fact that it still
works like new almost a decade later as
proof of its durability this phone was
the first in almost every single one of
today's trends like for example back
then displays ranged from 2 inches to
2.5 inches and this was the first big
3.5 inch capacitive glass display made
by the same company that later dubbed
the Gorilla Glass it was the first
aluminum and glass solution in a jungle
made of plastic and was slimmer in its
body than anything built at the time the
concept of a chrome ring around the
front or a single home button may be
common to you today but back in 2007
this was a huge departure from what
existed in the old move nonetheless now
when you look at the spec sheet you saw
a lot of good and butts at times when
phones barely shipped with one gig of
storage and when microSD card
barely
got to two gigabytes this phone ranged
from 4 to 16 gigs of storage which was
great it supported great Wi-Fi
capabilities and fast connectivity
something which was odd and very slow at
the time and the same can be said about
its Bluetooth capabilities as well it
also performed great even with a small
foreign 12 megahertz arm11 processor
sadly 3G was starting to become
ubiquitous in this phone ran on edge
speeds and it's 1400 milliamp hour
battery was not replaceable and it's
aluminium design made cellular reception
challenging all that being said agree or
disagree this was the first modern
smartphone design that we saw and proof
of it lies in how every single phone
effort followed in its design and the
reason why all these companies got sued
for it it polarized an entire industry
and true to Steve Jobs claims on the
event it did reinvent the phone now the
true reinvention wasn't in the hardware
but really in the software as opposed to
say Windows Phone running on a window
seat kernel instead of a full Windows
kernel iPhone OS R an OS tens kernel
this allowed for the phone to do
everything it did in a much better way
than its competition stupid things like
flick scrolling which are common today
but back in 2007 were true shockers or
one of the things this phone could do
back when browsers required a mobile
version of any site for it to load good
apples WebKit engine made the New York
Times load in its entirety allow you to
smartly pinch-to-zoom
DoubleTap on blocks of text and again it
was a true shocker for everybody that
saw this up to the point where almost
every competitor adopted WebKit
eventually today watching YouTube videos
is common on your phone but you had no
idea what it was like to try to do that
in 2007 until the iPhone figured it out
HTML email isn't a topic for today but
back in 2007 the iPhone was the only
phone that could do this today having
Google Maps on your phone is a default
feature but back in 2007 you can only do
this on the iPhone
threated messaging everyone well back in
2007 again the iPhone was the only
device that could actually do this well
the list even goes as far as videos and
movies where this phone beat the pants
off any other phone that was more
powerful than it because again it could
do it in a smarter way using an iPhone
back then was code for good and
experiences there wouldn't be an app
store until a year later but then again
nobody else actually had an app store so
you could really only do basic things on
this device or use web apps at times
when competition did have applications
and websites like Canon go but these
weren't as good or as cheap as they are
today you also didn't have a
Notification Center and notifications
were extremely annoying blocking you
from doing anything else there was also
no control center so instead you have to
leave whatever is you were doing and go
into the settings application to do
basic things like deal with screen
brightness again though to be fair and
this is me comparing this phone by
today's standards back then we didn't
miss any of these things because we
didn't really have these it's 2
megapixel camera was dull for today's
standards but decent for anything you
can buy back then the same was said
about its battery life since even though
it wasn't perfect that allow you to play
music more than any other phone you
could buy and again it could do everyone
of the tasks you can do back then with
ease compared to again competing devices
the coolest part about owning an iPhone
though was really the fact that it was a
work in progress and Apple made that
very clear
this phone survived through three years
of software updates up to iOS 3.1.3
it proved that Apple was committed to
its customers by pushing this phone as
far as it could and hey for five hundred
dollars after two-year contract they
better figure that one out and they
actually did
so after seven years and eight different
iPhone models I guess you understand now
why I phones are so popular if you think
of it this isn't just the first modern
smartphone but the origin of modern
tablets as well
Steve Jobs was right this phone was five
years ahead of its time when compared to
anything out there I mean it's a Android
so long to look good and Windows Phone
too long to compete it still is the
best-selling smartphone in the industry
and even though Apple has been
victorious for slowly stretching their
7-year old design we can't deny that
even today this old phone still looks
gorgeous that's it for our throwback of
the first generation or iPhone that you
own this phone that you like it that you
want it back in the day because in my
particular case I didn't have it and I
didn't want it so leave us a comment
down below and tell us your experience
