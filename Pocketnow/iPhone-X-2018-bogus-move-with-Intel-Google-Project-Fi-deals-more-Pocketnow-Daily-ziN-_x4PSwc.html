gears from the usual Qualcomm Intel
strategy and we're worried deals for
project fine make it sweeter than ever
for you to get a phone with one of the
best network alternatives and more
information claims of the Huawei P 20
will be about more than just cameras I'm
Jaime Mehta ravenna and I just spent
Super Bowl Sunday recording this because
I'm traveling again this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals we can not stress enough how much
we recommend project fights probably one
of the coolest services out there
particularly for roaming or if you want
to go unlimited without paying so much
money and the company now offers
something very interesting the original
pixel Excel for 549 bucks with Phi or
you can go for the Moto X 4 for 249
bucks which is pretty much when you pay
down for installments and the Moto X 4
is actually a phone we recommend a lot
so you can learn more about it in the
description deal ends by February 14 now
for those of you that join me in
frustration over how long Sampson takes
to get you an Android Oreo update
Samsung's customer care just came clear
that by the end of February we should
expect to have our Oreo updates they
don't think the company is not
guaranteeing is when each region is
gonna get the update but at least it
seems that the company continues on its
usual strategy of leaving updates until
the next phone launches I hate that and
speaking of Oreo xda-developers recently
kind of unraveled that the Huawei P 20
may be about more than just great
cameras we've heard about that triple
lens camera and whatever but even more
interesting Huawei is sticking to its
guns of launching the latest and
greatest Android on its new flagship so
we had Oreo with the mate 10 now this
Pete 20 apparently will bring Android
Oreo 8.1 this is great we can't wait to
see exactly what we get though we don't
expect to know anything until mid-march
pretty much now let's move the spotlight
over to Apple and talk about issues as
the company has chimed then on to
complaints the first one being that the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus apparently
have trouble connecting you get no
network even if there is Network and the
company has just launched a new repair
option that you can learn more about in
the description even more interesting
the iPhone 10 is having trouble with
delayed calls and this is actually
rather complex more details in the
description as well and yeah we'll keep
you posted as soon as the company
acknowledges that there will be
something done about the 10 and finally
the very interesting news today have to
do with the iPhone 10 2018 and min cheek
whoa KGI we trust their reports a lot
and this time we hear that
apparently Apple wants to change things
with the whole Qualcomm vs Apple Apple
vs. Qualcomm lawsuit apparently
Cupertino wants to apply some pressure
the recent rumors were that we would get
70% modems from Intel and 30% from
Qualcomm because of the CDMA
capabilities apparently the new Intel
chip is able to provide CDMA
capabilities so it seems that Apple
wants to apply some pressure by not
ordering motives from Qualcomm which is
a big deal the biggest problem is Intel
modems have not been great at all when
it comes to connectivity I mean we
actually look for what kind of modem we
get on our iPhones because battery life
is not great and reception is not great
we can usually trust Qualcomm for this
so it leads me to the question today I
mean is it a deal breaker for you or you
the type of person that actually looks
up if your phone has an Intel modem or
Qualcomm or you just don't care leave us
a comment down below in my case I do
care and I hate that my phone has a
metal modem friends again if you want to
