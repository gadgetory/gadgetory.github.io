I'm sure you've already heard lots about
the oneplus 60 : parking out daily has
been loaded with tons of teasers and
rumors galore and now it's finally time
to tell you what was right and what was
not
I'm how you met Aviv a tie with pocket
now and I've just spent 24 hours with a
1 plus 60 so yes here it is in its full
glory I'm sure there are probably some
reviews out there already I had some
issues being able to get my unit with my
travel plans but let me start by saying
that pretty much most of what we heard
in rumors is true there are some very
interesting new things and then there
are others that I wish would have
remained as rumors our care package
includes more than your standard
unboxing there's now this sort of
sandstone finish opposing the previous
black boxes inside a red chamois which
is unexpected and welcomed in the middle
is a box full of cases with the
sandstone being my favourites there's
also a pair of bullets headphones with a
USBC connector and you know where I'm
going with this one and the devices on
the left the retail box that you'll be
getting now follows on that same sense
don't finish peel the plastic off and
open to see the device front and center
which took me a bit too and snap we've
got literature below with a transparent
dark case a sim ejector tool and
stickers below the desk charger wall
plug and the red USBC cable along with
your dongle since the headphone jack is
now officially killed now let me do the
honors and remove some of this plastic
and before you yell at me in the
comments you guys know that I hate
screen protectors I mean we've got
Gorilla Glass six here anyway to start
with the hardware let me begin by saying
oneplus thank you for sending me the
midnight black variant at launch you
have two color options mirror black and
midnight black but this one being my
favorite because I feel it's there's
fingerprints better and I also find this
to be one of the coolest innovations
from one place they pretty much pioneer
this finish in addition to essentials
like the mute slider on the side that is
also here an interesting change is that
once you hold it versus the one plus six
the first thing you'll notice is that
it's slightly thicker at eight point two
millimeters and heavier at 185 grams
that's because there's a larger 3700
milliamp hour battery which I expect to
be great as the one plus six was already
pretty epic inside we continue to have
be specifications like the new Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 six or eight gigs of ram
a boost at the starting storage now at
128 gigs or options for 256 dual-sim
capabilities
crazy-fast - charging and no there are
still no wireless charging there are
still no IP rating but this phone is
confirmed to be splash proof said again
up for the first time we're greeted by
the oneplus animation and then the
option to opt into a few programs we're
then requested to connect to Wi-Fi set
up the carrier which I'll do later set
up your Google account and then if you'd
like to restore from another phone I
decided to say no since one plus has a
very cool device switch application to
make that easier there's a password pin
after that that's requested you can then
set up base to unlock which is still
here and then there's the new on display
fingerprint scanner setup which I will
definitely be testing extensively over
time once all those touches are done we
go into the oneplus device which and it
took me around 10 minutes for my data to
be transfer for one phone to the other
though I wish my launcher layout would
have remained as apparently that wasn't
really ported now one of the most
significant changes to the one plus 60
is
it's display which you might have
noticed has changed slightly the radius
corners are now wider when compared to
the six and which makes the bezels now
more symmetrical to the phone's body we
have a larger six point four one inch
optic AMOLED panel at full HD plus
resolution and nineteen point five by
nine aspect ratio the notch is now
smaller and conforming to the radius
curves with the earpiece now being snug
on the chassis sadly it still doesn't
assist as a dual firing speaker so make
sure you don't muffle the single firing
unit at the bottom as it will completely
kill content consumption have an IP
rating but less charging there you
notice the spec sheet the one plus sixty
pretty much brings the same camera
arrangement and specifications of the
one plus six
but oneplus claims improvements in the
algorithm for higher quality photos of
people text food and improvements the
HDR there's a new nightscape featured is
going to be its long exposure night mode
which fared very well in our preliminary
tests obviously we need more time to
assess if we notice any changes and then
when it comes to software we've got
oxygen OS 9 point 0.3 on top of Android
PI for those of you that think that your
Google pixels have stock Android I would
say that that fact Falls true more for
oneplus devices than any other the
oneplus 6 was one of the first devices
to get the final version of Android Pi
very early and the 60 is also one of the
proud few to support it today oneplus
made some important enhancements to
features like gesture navigation yes you
do have the pixel pill here along with
the standard navigation buttons but my
favorite is honestly the navigation
gestures from the bottom and I love that
my complaints about the Google assistant
not having a gesture we're now solved
with it being able to be assigned to a
long press of the power button gaming
mode is also here now it changes to the
way it portrays notifications which I
find to be great and my favorite changes
boost mode which helps you launch apps
faster by retaining frequently used
features in RAM for those of you that
called oneplus overkill about the spec
sheet
overall my first impressions are
extremely positive when it comes to the
oneplus 60 I mean you guys know that the
oneplus 6 has so far been one of my
favorite phones of 2018 and the 60
builds on that this is also the first
time that you'll be able to get a
oneplus device on a US carrier with the
mirror-black a gigabyte variant being
exclusive to t-mobile there is a minor
price bump - 549 for the entry-level
Siksika bite and 128 gig variant 579 for
those of you looking for eight gigs in
128 and then 629 for the a gig 256 gig
variant now I won't deny I am extremely
sad that the headphone jack was killed
and I'm not gonna justify the option of
you getting wireless earbuds but at
least the oneplus Wireless bullets are
cheaper than most other options out
there and given the fact that the price
of this phone is not as high as other
devices let's just say that the starting
price of both units is not gonna be that
crazy obviously our review period has
just begun let us know what you think
about the oneplus 60 in the comments and
which comparisons you would like to see
