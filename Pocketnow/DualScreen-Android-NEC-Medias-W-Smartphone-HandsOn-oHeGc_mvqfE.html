here at the NEC booth at MWC 2013
checking out the new NEC medius w the
dual screen Android smart phone / tablet
let's take a look and showing us the
media SW today is Alex with NEC oh it's
nice to meet you very well this is it
so we have here's our answer so that we
see it's from of the phablet another
really large screen handsets today we
going to sleep all affected so when it
is fully shut it would look like that
and say my first case there I cannot
show ok 12 my 2 millimeters when it's
shut when it's completely shutting plan
it would operate as a normal free engine
Android handset so this screen will be
off on the rear and this is just your
normal single screen Android handset I
can run the Maps application
as you would expect see and what version
sorry what version of Android is it is
4.1 okay so line open that Michigan see
is automatically but now expand it to
dispute two screens women are able to
gesture one others most wrinkles now we
treat it as one large horizontal screen
so this is a tablet mode as we call it I
get as your desktop this your
for something like email we've truly
slightly differently
rather than just across the whole screen
group so as you might naturally expect
we have an inbox here we have a quantity
on the row content there again you can
rotate to landscape mode see your email
and if you got a long list like me of
emails then you can see more detail in
that lo sure you want to write a new one
you're going to be treated to a nice big
easy to type on people that dominates
the entire lower half that's right
what's that roughly there so this buddy
I'm glad you asked that so when I'm in
there obviously now you like you'll
select here maybe I want to look up
something on the web so I can actually
vary on my email here this was my email
list and there's just loading up you can
see so the browser's over here emails
over here running both apps concurrently
at one I see what kind of processor
makes that possible what's inside here a
one point five units one point five
billion so far and then probably two
gigs of ram or or one you know
want to go around back that okay as you
saw actually browse again in both modes
or widescreen or portrait or landscape
without the I prefer in this way okay
and what's the weight on this a 183
grams so it's about as heavy as a Nokia
Lumia 920 which for two screens isn't
too bad and can you tell me about a
little about the camera with the
resolution would got a 2-1 cameras and
8.1 megapixel camera on there okay so
they're actually sentences is just the
one camera okay let me show you an
example how you can gesture between the
two screens this is a photo gallery okay
I wanted to share this picture Facebook
or something I can just drag across
Facebook email Bluetooth wherever once
again and then I'm ready comes into the
share function up and obviously third
other third-party apps can plug into
that you can if you decide to enable any
Play Store applications let's say Angry
Birds everyone has left for us it just
runs as normal in this tablet mode
and actually I'm still not very good at
this game and when you hit the
multitasking button is it just to come
up on the left hand comes up on the
right here and there you can and is
there a special manager for managing the
application across two screens or is it
just you just open one on one screen
than one on the other so what we have
the applications standard applications
will be treated across the two screens
or pursue written some special ones like
email galleries protected
somebody so this this is how you bring
in another application that's where you
manager at the moment we've got here on
this model we've got browsing we've got
sort of notes and screenshot
applications and we
the gallery and as you're in capture
presumably you'll add more as time goes
on and on that subject do you have any
notes on availability or pricing at this
time and so what we are showing here
today we've got in media SW handset
which is the black answer here this is
going to be available in Japan this year
in April I've got NTT DoCoMo Network
okay okay this model here is the red one
this is our global sugar type model
and as of today I cannot give any
announcements I'm afraid one other neat
picture oh it's like your attention to
this video playback because of the
unique form factor we imagine people
again I want to enjoy the video in this
mode
haha so actually if you notice the other
screen is up so you wanted a share of
some moment in push this button here
you able to see line the video on both
screens fascinating and where's the
speaker located where's the audio coming
from on this one around back somewhere
oh it's down here so side to side firing
so okay you can see it in this message
right
well that's outstanding once again this
is Alex from NEC thank you very much it
was a wonderful tour and we really
enjoyed it Michael from pocket now Tony
