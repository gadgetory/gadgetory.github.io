happening lately of very thin
smartphones high-end design lower than
flagship price points and a Snapdragon
615 processor under the hood last year's
Oppo r5 was one of the first and this
year's Oppo r7 takes the trend a step
further I'm high metal Yvetta with
pocket now and join us for our first
impressions of the Oppo r7 the most
striking first impression of the r7 is
that even though the phone is thinner
than the iPhone 6 at 6.3 millimeters it
feels sturdier in the hand thanks to the
added weight at 148 grams this phone is
a hair thicker than its predecessor and
also a few inches smaller but we're
actually gonna praise this given the
fact that it returns the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack the overall feel is cool
to the touch think through the glass and
aluminum finish and if the top and the
bottom antenna separations are made of
plastic it's really hard to tell thanks
to the silver coating the Shatford edges
on the sides are smaller than the ones
we've seen on competing phones leading
us to believe that they'll be less
acceptable to scratches and even though
the button placement of the power and
standby key is a little awkward at the
left some software features allow you to
solve this by double tapping the home
button or the this way those software
features have been the most pleasant
surprise of the Oval our seventh color
OS has never been our favorite Android
skin on any of its predecessors but that
has dramatically changed with version
2.1 OBO has opted for a more
minimalistic design that does away with
most few more visit and the launcher
responsiveness is top-notch no matter
how fast you want to navigate some of
you may be disappointed with the fact
that it's still running KitKat but after
so many Ram horror stories on lollipop
this is actually one of the things that
I like the most about this phone
one of the things that I highly praises
oboes new approach to notifications
which combine the best features of both
hit cat and iOS on one phone you can
select which applications you want to
notify your lockscreen and you can even
control the notification ticker
something completely new to Android at
least for me so you can choose which
applications you want to just buzz your
phone or you can choose which ones you
want full notifications from in the app
settings I have noticed some bugs so far
in my first couple of days where oboes
font doesn't behave well with
third-party applications but will report
back on this problem with our full
review overall though my first two days
with this phone have been rather
pleasant the battery has lasted through
each day of moderate to heavy use and
book rapid charging takes the 23 20
milliamp hour battery from 0 to 75
percent at around 30 minutes or so the
Snapdragon 615 has proven to be a good
processor selection for regular tasks
but you will notice it eating up when
playing games like Sky Force and also
when rendering detail on photos as you
slide through them let's take it a
little bit speaking of photos the camera
has also led to a positive experience so
far this is definitely not an LG g4 but
if you're used to iPhone photos you'll
feel right at home here
launching the camera by drawing a circle
on the inactive display is also a very
welcome feature but it's something that
Oppo phones have been able to do for a
while I was also surprised that Oppo
decided to move the front mounted
speaker buried in the earpiece of the r5
to a separate speaker at the back cause
to sound louder on the r5 thanks to this
change but we'll see how the back
mounted speaker behaves after a few days
of use and that's the biggest takeaway
with our first few days with the Oppo r7
does this feel like a more mature
product from Oppo but a few comparisons
in our full review will help us give you
our final verdict for now make sure you
leave us a comment down below with the
things you would like for us to test
from the r7 and you make sure you also
