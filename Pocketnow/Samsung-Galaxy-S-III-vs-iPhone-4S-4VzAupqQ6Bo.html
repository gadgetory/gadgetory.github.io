pocket now calm the Samsung Galaxy s3
and the iPhone 4s are two phones that
are so popular I think even my grandma
knows about them and she doesn't even
have a phone in this video we're gonna
put them head-to-head and compare them
in every way that matters let's get to
it
okay here they are two very different
phones the first test we're going to put
these through is the boot up test which
of these devices turns on faster so
we're gonna holding down the power
button until the logo appears and boom
they are off Galaxy s3 a little bit
faster right out the gate now most
people leave their phone on all the time
but there are still people that turn off
their phone each night before they go to
bed so they don't hear any reminders or
notifications or see any blinking lights
so for those people the boot up test
matters a lot because in the morning you
want the phone to turn on as fast as
possible so you can access your email
and all of your information so it looks
like the galaxy s3 was first and the
lockscreen is usable we can unlock the
phone and get right into our home screen
so we're gonna turn these off iPhone 4s
was about four or five seconds behind
let's talk about the hardware on these
two devices Before we jump into our
other tests so let's start with the
iPhone 4s the iPhone 4s is definitely
starting to feel dated it's a 2
generation old design and when it came
out it was a really cool concept a glass
on the front glass on the back is
stainless steel band on the side it we
had seen nothing like it but now a
couple years later we're starting to
think that the iPhone 4s design is kind
of a liability in fact if you drop a
typical Android phone or Windows Phone
on the ground that has a plastic backing
like the Galaxy s3
you're gonna scratch the back on the
iPhone 4s you're going to crack the back
and do permanent damage as I've done
right here and then you got to go to the
Apple store you have to send it off to a
third party to get the back replaced so
the new iPhone the iPhone 5 is most
likely to have a back that is not glass
as nice as it is to have glass on the
back it is just too much of a liability
so this design is starting to look dated
it's still relevant it still feels good
in the hand but it just it's starting to
look old and the iPhone 5
coming out in the fall will probably
probably bring something new to the
table finally so the Samsung Galaxy s3
in a way looks like a standard candy bar
phone but it's got some really cool
design cues it's got a really thin bezel
all around the screen and what you can't
really tell from pictures until you have
it in your hand is that the white of the
phone or pebble blue or whatever color
you're getting is outlined by silver so
what you have and maybe you can tell on
video what you have is this huge screen
outlined by white outlined by silver it
just looks beautiful it looks kind of
like art then we've got these kind of
geeky tech looking proximity sensor and
the front-facing camera reminds us a lot
of the Samsung Focus 2 actually these
devices look a lot like if you kind of
ignore the screen size and on the back
we've got really shiny plastic this is
the marble white no wonder they call it
marble it is so shiny and so slippery I
kind of wonder if it's uh it's gonna
fall out of my hand even when I'm
holding it firmly so in terms of
thickness the galaxy s3 is thinner than
the iPhone 4 in the iPhone 4s hopefully
with the new iPhone we'll see something
even thinner because to be honest the
iPhone 4s starting to feel a little
thick in comparison to these new devices
that are coming out so now let's talk
about how fast applications open that's
day-to-day stuff that really matters
we're gonna go through a variety of
tests so let's unlock both of these
devices we'll slide to unlock we'll
swipe the water or whatever with that
nature UX and so let's double check that
all apps are out of memory and we're
going to just make sure we're going to
close all of these apps there aren't
many and over here on the galaxy s3 no
recent apps no apps in memory we just
boot it up we are good to go first thing
we're gonna launch is the calendar very
common app that people use let's see how
fast they open and which opens faster so
over here it's called s planner here
it's called calendar okay that was
exactly at the same time with the
animation it looked like for a second
that the galaxy s3 was faster let's do
it again it's possible the iPhone 4s was
a millisecond faster
eyes aren't fastened enough to detect a
millisecond difference but for all
intents and purposes they are the same
in terms of launching the calendar let's
try with a third party out we're gonna
jump into Facebook here certainly these
are slightly different apps because you
know Facebook for Android Facebook for
iOS are slightly different but they are
loading the same kind of data so one two
three go okay galaxy s3 was first with a
splash screen let's see which loads the
data first definitely the galaxy s3
loaded the data first these are over the
same Wi-Fi network so we're not having
to deal with Network issues alright so
galaxy s3 one the Facebook test let's
launch the camera extremely important
you want the camera to launch a rocket
fast so you can capture that moment so
we're gonna hit camera buttons here one
two three go iPhone 4s was definitely
faster let's just double check because
the iPhone 4s launches the app fast but
the viewfinder isn't actually showing
anything let's actually look closely at
that okay the galaxy s3 actually is the
viewfinder faster but the iPhone 4s
launches the app itself but what really
matters is when you're ready to take a
picture and it looks like on the on the
galaxy s3 you're ready to take a picture
slightly sooner than on the iPhone 4s
now we're going to test out internet
browsing speed extremely important of
course you want the device to blast
through loading a webpage and really get
get get you there as quickly as possible
so lunch the browser's world using stock
browsers on both and pocket now is
actually going to come through on these
but that's okay we're just gonna load DD
having a pram with scrolling here we're
gonna load the desktop site on both on
the home page then we're going to move
around and determine which sort of has
the better performance so try to get to
the home page here see on the iPhone 4s
everything's loaded
everything's buffered I see no white
space which is good on the Galaxy s3 is
still loading out stop let's do the same
test foot down really quickly
everything's loaded there is no
buffering whatsoever and well you we
always say this when we compare the
iPhone against any to any other device
you get to see so much more information
on the screen because we don't have this
bottom bar here Android tends to keep
things up top was a double tap to zoom
in Galaxy s3 has been turned on to
reflow the column as it has done their
pinch-to-zoom very smooth on both okay
let's get Engadget loaded here so we're
gonna go to the same on both the same
time we might get one mobile and one
desktop yep
well actually no both Mobile Galaxy s3
was faster that was good that we got
mobile on both so that we can go down
here and hit desktop hopefully at the
exact same time not directory some AOL
advertising they're slightly off there
the iPhone 4s was a little bit ahead
because I hit the button slightly ahead
but let's look as they load really quick
scrolling here on the galaxy s3 a little
bit less fluid on the iPhone 4s but
that's just how the scrolling algorithm
is working and we are getting some blank
spaces if you saw that before see right
there it kind of blanked out for a sec
and over here on the galaxy s3 let's see
if we can recreate that and everything's
just right in memory right now and and
there's no chance of seeing any blank
spaces on the galaxy s3 so that is a win
with galaxy s3 let's zoom in up here and
tap on this link that was at the same
time the galaxy s3 responded a little
bit later so the iPhone 4s is a little
bit faster and it won iPhone 4s won in
that test scroll down the page
everything's loaded scroll down the page
everything is loaded so it looks like
about a tie for the web browsing
performance in terms of I'm loading
everything into memory so that you don't
see any white space the galaxy s3 is the
winner here but in terms of getting the
page up faster the iPhone 4s is coming
out ahead in this test so both very
capable web browsing machines now let's
talk about dictation Siri is on the
iPhone 4s and s voice is on Galaxy s3
basically the same concept let's see
which one works better okay so for
launching s voice on the galaxy s3 you
double tap the home button
and to launch Siri on the iPhone you tap
and hold someone do a tap and hold
what's the weather for today okay they
both understood what I said let's do
something else
remind me to call Matt tonight at 8 p.m.
good good
all right they okay they are going crazy
but they both understood what I said um
make a new calendar appointment tomorrow
at whoa point is here that you shouldn't
use to voice recognitions programs at
the same time they both are quite good
in my day to day testing I found
actually Syria to be more accurate more
of the time but s voice doesn't have
that issue where the network goes down
on Siri sometimes it says sorry I cannot
get a network connection we're sorry the
something is down happens actually a lot
on Siri much more reliable on s voice
but it's not as accurate as consistently
as series now these are two very
different displays we've got a Super
AMOLED screen here and an LCD IPS panel
on the iPhone 4s typical of an LCD is
better color saturation more accurate
color saturation I should say typical of
an AMOLED is deeper blacks but sometimes
colors that are a little bit artificial
so we're going to compare them now
something also to note is that the
screen on the galaxy s3 is higher
resolution 1280 down 720 across versus
960 by 640 the iPhone still is a higher
pixel density but on both it's very
difficult to perceive pixels I'd say
because of the pentile matrix on the
galaxy s3 you have a higher chance of
actually being able to see pixels in
fact let me see if the camera will pick
this up look at the Google Play icon and
hopefully we get the camera to focus you
can see pixels on the Google Play icon
and we're going to talk more about this
in the final review when you compare
this to like the HTC One X it's a
difference you can definitely tell if
you have really good eyesight that this
is a 10th
matrix and that does impact how things
look on the screen especially text and
things that are close up let's see how
close up we can get before the camera
freaks out that's pretty close and I
think by now you're seeing some pixels
here right around or that triangle bends
anyway small issue but we're comparing
them so we might as well talk about
these things so let's click on to this
first image here and right away you can
see that the screen here on the galaxy
s3 is a little bit more cool the green
is more greener if if that's a word
probably is things might look a little
bit more natural here oh you could say
about the iPhone 4s let's go to another
image here these all have a lot of green
in them because it's a rainforest
picture this one actually has some color
so the colors are a little bit more
vibrant maybe a little too vibrant they
really pop you can see the blacks are
just true black here on the galaxy s3
and over here on the iPhone for us you
can't really tell because there's no
black on the screen but blacks kind of
come out a little bit gray so let's look
at a picture of say John Mayer I'll
picture him this morning if we want to
look at some skin tones actually maybe
he's a so here we go and as you can see
right away John Mayer's face and all
these pictures look a little bit read it
just thought the colors are a little
overdone and over here on the iPhone for
us they're a little bit more natural
it's tough to tell which is more
accurate but you can tell the difference
right here that it's definitely more red
over here and the whites are whiter the
the blacks are blacker but it's just
it's a little bit artificial it's a
little bit cool in temperature compared
to the iPhone 4s which is has become a
little bit more warm when the Retina
display first came out on the iPhone 4
of this cool the next generation they
made it warmer on purpose to make it a
little bit more natural but it's still
not quite there yet of course the the
galaxy s 3 screen is just so much bigger
so for example if we go into YouTube
there's just a tremendous difference in
the viewing experience it's so much more
pleasing on the
cs3 because it's like having a mini
Theatre in your pocket so let's go to
the YouTube app and here we go
skill of the year let's find one that
might be interesting we'll just go with
the first one we see here see which
renders first the iPhone 4s might have
been slightly ahead and it's just a
night and day difference on the iPhone
for us it's puny and small with black
bars galaxy s3 it's large and in charge
so that's a little test of YouTube
finally we're going to talk about gaming
here and then there's going to be one
more final part after this for video
comparison in terms of the 1080p
recording capability but let's jump into
grand theft auto 3 here we're gonna go
into the downloaded apps and there it is
here we're going to go over to the games
folder and we're gonna launch them at
the same time slightly different
versions of the game but they have the
same underpinnings so this will be a
good test we're gonna leave all the apps
that are open in the background because
that's just a good reflection of day to
day performant reflection of day to day
performance so when I launch them okay a
little bit faster on the iPhone 4s here
remember for hitting a quad-core
processor on the galaxy s3 so I'm
expecting the galaxy s3 to smoke the
iPhone 4s or at least if not smoke but
beat the the iPhone for us in terms of
game performance okay so let's see which
brings up the next screen first iPhone
4s up we've got a crash here on the
galaxy s3 that's embarrassing for the
galaxy s3 alright we'll go back into the
game
we'll come to the same screen on both
maybe we can skip past these
introductions blah blah blah let's go to
tap to play
and we're gonna have to start a game
here try to press them at the same time
new game see which loads first galaxy s3
first there we go showing maybe it's
quad-core colors we've got this intro
video that we're doing to try to move
past DOCSIS there's a little bit ahead
here press these buttons here okay and
they're off to the actual gameplay
another little video lot's little videos
here see you better drive brother
alright so we are going to play on the
iPhone for us first I've actually been
practicing so I should be pretty good at
this game
alright let's see I'm looking for any
sort of hesitation or sputters and I
just saw one there oh definitely saw one
there and I think you did too because
you're looking the same thing I am
pretty smooth when you hit cars and
crazy action things happen once in a
while you get a skip and that's not a
good experience I can also tell you that
the this game is nicely scaling to the
full resolution of this phone because
when you see the galaxy s3 you're gonna
see that it's not really made for for
1080 or 720 p displays alright let's see
how this guy does have the sound down
you got a little sputter there make a
left sharp left
okay probably a little little sputter
there these are small but again these
sputters really impacted gameplay so
quite smooth and I got to tell you it's
much more pleasing playing on a larger
screen that's that's kind of a
no-brainer so a little bit of sputters
here and there gt3 isn't the the
smoothest game ever even if you take
another quad-core phone like the HTC One
X it's not amazing it's not nearly as
smooth as it was on dick on a console
let's talk about pricing and
availability the iPhone 4s is available
for 199 bucks on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon that's
for the 16 gig model and the price goes
up from there for the 32 gigabyte model
and the 64 gigabyte model now the the
galaxy s3 is going to be available on
every carrier just like the galaxy s2
like the galaxy s1 so you'll have more
choice in that area it'll also be
available in 16 32 and 64 gigabyte
configurations depending on which
carrier you're going on and it's priced
around the same $1.99 now there's
actually gonna be a red version on AT&amp;amp;T
if you like your choice of colors LTE
versions on really all carriers except
of course t-mobile they don't have LTE
so you're gonna have a lot of choice
when the galaxy s3 comes out in late
June on all carriers now stick around to
the end of this video where we're going
to compare 1080p video recording on both
of these devices in the end these
devices are very very different the
iPhone 4s is admittedly turning stale
and boring iOS 6 is coming soon the
iPhone 5 is coming soon the galaxy s3 is
definitely a better choice if you want a
more modern experience better hardware
software is questionable depending on
like whether you like Android or iOS
certainly both are very capable but yeah
the galaxy s3 is just leaps and bounds
better than the iPhone if you're
comparing Hardware alone and raw
specifications but again this is a weird
time to compare the two because there's
a new iPhone coming out we're gonna have
to see what Apple brings to the table
with that so again keep them keep your
eyes on the video we're gonna we're
going to show you some video comparisons
and hopefully you enjoyed this video
thanks for watching that's it for now
all right we're testing the 1080p video
capture of the Samsung Galaxy s3 and the
iPhone for us at the exact same time
have some sort of vibrant plants here
we'll move in up close we'll pan around
to kind of quickly see how it does with
motion and frame rates there's a green
color see how that comes out and then
we'll sweep outside to where it's really
bright move up towards the sky see how
fast the white balance changes and we'll
see how the video quality is all right
we're testing the 1080p video capture of
the Samsung Galaxy s3 and the iPhone 4s
