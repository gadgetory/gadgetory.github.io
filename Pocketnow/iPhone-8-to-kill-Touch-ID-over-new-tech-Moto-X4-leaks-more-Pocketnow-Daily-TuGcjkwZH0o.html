away with touch ID altogether in favor
of something else leaks of the Moto X
Porsche was a very discrete update to
its predecessors and Samson might be
working on its own Bixby speaker even
though Bixby is not yet final I'm
hanging metal Iveta and happy fourth of
July to everybody we can't wait to get
done with this video to go celebrate
ourselves
this is fucking out daily the official
news today begin with deals to a certain
degree remember that the Nokia six is
one of those devices that Amazon is
going to be offering as an exclusive for
those of you that want subsidies on a
smartphone over ads now in the case of
the Nokia 6 there is this new copper
color that is going to be an Amazon
exclusive at least for a bit you can
pre-order it now the only problem is
you're going to have to wait for it
until August you can learn more on
description I was talking about HTC the
company is reportedly working on a new u
11 but problem is apparently this is
going to be some sort of a mid-range err
I am one of those people that do believe
that the U 11 is probably a little too
large the cavae should have brought this
5 inch variant to be a successor to the
HTC 10 but Randy this might happen we
might get edge sense and everything the
only problem is that the specs might be
of a premium mid-range err we will keep
you posted as soon as we learn more now
let's talk about Samsung the company is
reportedly working on digging Vic speed
to a whole new level so long as it can
figure out the original level which was
to actually get it to launch on its
Galaxy s8 in English it turns out the
service is still on beta it only works
for certain people but Samsung might be
working on bringing this to a speaker
because that's what everybody else is
doing right let's just see how that
works could it be that we get an
announcement in August because
apparently that will happen this year
for those of you that have been
following the rumors of the Moto X 4 and
this device being the budget-minded
device that will be offered with project
5 we've got the first leaked images from
Evan glass it looks a lot like a moto Z
without the Moto mod capabilities yes it
seems to have a glass back the cool part
is that that huge camera hump is
apparently going to bring dual cameras
so let's just see exactly what kind of a
budget device this will be over time and
finally a very interesting rumors that
they have to do with the iPhone 8 mainly
because we've got another publication
following KGI telling us that yes we
will be getting 3d facial scanning on
the next generation iPhone but
apparently not just because we want 3d
facial scanning apparently Apple wants
to get rid of touch ID it seems that the
whole concept of putting the fingerprint
scanner on the screen is either going to
be that's going to happen or it's just
not going to happen
all and this is rather interesting we've
seen Samsung pretty much try to kill the
fingerprint scanner with its placement
on the Galaxy s8 the question for today
would be if you feel that the market is
ready for us to get rid of touch ID get
rid of the fingerprint scanner on the
iPhone in my case I wonder exactly why
Apple would do that given the fact that
it barely just added it to its macbook
pro alignment but leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
