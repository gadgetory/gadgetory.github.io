partnering with Leica for the dual rear
cameras on its new smartphone but before
we can tear into a proper review we have
to get this thing out of the box I'm
Juan Carlos bag nail for Pocket now and
here's our first impressions of the
Huawei p9 cracking open the packaging
we're treated to the familiar trappings
of most flagship phones the device
greets you up top a little tray divides
the phone from the included accessories
small containers hold the USB cable
charger and some earbuds an additional
folder is included but oddly there
weren't any papers inside for us to not
read over although this is a slick
presentation greeting you with your new
phone purchase the p9 gives off a
premium first impression aesthetically
it's a polished up relative to low-cost
offerings like the honor 5x a harder
edges and it's a flatter slab of
rectangle than the curvier look of the
g8 there are obvious comparisons to be
made here between the p9 HTC's and
iPhones but Huawei is delivering subtle
elements which keep this device from
being an outright copycat the rear
mounted fingerprint sensor and cameras
which stay flush with the phone body are
two examples thin shiny chamfered edges
helped this device sparkle in daylight
and an LED hidden in the ear speaker
grille delivers subtle alerts for missed
notifications we've got a 5.2 inch 1080p
LCD powered by a cure in 955 octa-core
processor our review unit came with
three gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes
of storage with microSD card expansion a
3000 milliamp hour battery is packed
into this petite frame and USB type-c is
the port of choice for charging and
syncing firing up the p9 the first boot
was fairly quick about mid pack for the
nicer phones we've tested recently and
the setup process is free from an
abundance of custom logins or additional
services to sign into it's worth
reiterating that Huawei continues a
tradition of including an excellent
fingerprint sensor and the training
process is one of the fastest available
on any phone unsurprisingly we're using
Huawei's emui custom launcher this
homage to iOS removes the separate app
drawer so all app shortcuts and widgets
are combined on your home screens we've
seen this layout on a number of Huawei's
in the
and if this setup doesn't appeal to you
you can always install another launcher
all of this feels on par for activating
a new high-end phone but general
performance isn't what's interesting
about this particular handset we really
want to look at those dual cameras on
the back while we're still shooting to
prove a full camera review the early
testing looks promising this like a
designed system delivers some bright and
colorful photos dual 12 megapixel
sensors paired with an approximately 27
millimeter equivalent field of view and
F 2.2 apertures are all respectable
metrics what's interesting here and
which requires more testing is the split
between the two sensors the inside
camera is a standard phone camera
solution the outside camera is a
monochrome black and white shooter like
the rods and cones in the human eye each
camera handles a specific task this is
supposed to deliver brighter images
better clarity and to allow for more
flexibility when shooting some of our
first images would seem to support those
assertions and we'll have more to report
on that front soon a spoiler alert the
ability to adjust background blur after
the fact is pretty stonking cool and
some of the best software processing
we've ever seen for this effect after
that the regular smartphone questions
remain how's the battery hold up to
daily use how's the audio playback how
does the curent chipset compare to
Qualcomm and Samsung powered devices the
Huawei p9 is off to a solid start
and now we'll dig deep to see what this
thing can really do as always thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to this channel for our full coverage of
the Huawei p9
and hit that thumbs up button for a
little more positive reinforcement for
PocketNow i'm juan carlos Becnel you can
chat me up on twitter and instagram has
some gadget guy and i will catch you all
on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
