third of you wishing you'd waited
another third grateful you didn't and
the remainder completely apathetic well
for those first 60% or so we've got a
video we think you'll enjoy i michael
fisher with pocket now and this is the
Samsung Galaxy s5 lte-a aka the s5 prime
this device comes to us from the folks
at 28 Mobile a Hong kong-based Swedish
owned retailer serving smartphone and
tablet customers all around the world if
you'd like a galaxy s5 LTE a of your own
visit them at the link in the
description below now if you watched our
unboxing of the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy s5 a few
months back this will be a familiar
though not identical experience the
first thing you'll pick up is that the
box has differ in size and there's a
good reason for that
the newer phone comes with Samsung's
desktop charging cradle in the box and
it also comes packing a spare battery
and a data cable alongside the
integrated charger and earbuds oddly the
included cables aren't USB 3.0 but the
sheer volume of extras means we're not
too bent out of shape about that out of
the device itself despite some lofty
expectations across the web this version
of Samsung's flagship does not feature
enhanced fit and finish sure anything of
that sort if you didn't like the build
of the galaxy s5 you're not gonna like
the lte-a version but once you get
underneath the screen protector which we
might as well do now silence please and
power on the device you lay eyes on that
pixel packed quad HD display and you
start to realize why some people are
miffed at Samsung for releasing this so
soon after the stock s5 this is a
next-generation display backed up by a
more powerful processor a better
graphics processor more RAM than we saw
in the US version and obviously the
faster LTE advanced radio that gives the
device its name even though that latter
bit will only give it an edge in
countries like South Korea for the
moment this is still a very compelling
package to those who value specs
of all whether you call it the s5 lte-a
the s5 Prime Thor you simply refer to it
with an expletive because of the timing
of its release we're gonna be taking a
close look at it in the next few days if
you have questions of your own
tune in to Thursday's pocket net weekly
podcast and send them to us we'll answer
them live on the air and leave a comment
down below with specific questions you'd
like us to answer in our s5 vs s5 prime
comparison and full review coming later
in the week in the meantime refresh your
memory in the stock Galaxy s5
see our full reviews and comparisons
here and at pocketnow.com and once again
thanks to 28 mobile for the device loan
until next time this has been michael
fisher with PocketNow thanks for tuning
in we'll see you next time alright

it's a device that has about 60% of you
it's vice that I was about 30% let's
just try it it's a device that has about
30% of you grateful you well for those
first 60% of you or so we've got a
device we think you'll enjoy gosh this
is the Samsung Galaxy s5 lte-a aka
galaxy s5 prime it's a device that has
about 30% of you wishing you'd waited
another 30% completely apathetic and no
