third of you wishing you'd waited
another third grateful you didn't and
the remainder completely apathetic well
for those first sixty percent or so
we've got a video we think you'll enjoy
I Michael Fisher with pocket now and
this is the Samsung Galaxy s5 lte-a aka
the s5 Prime this device comes to us
from the folks at 28 mobile a hong
kong-based swedish owned retailer
serving smartphone and tablet customers
all around the world if you'd like a
galaxy s5 lte-a of your own visit them
at the link in the description below now
if you watched our unboxing of the AT&amp;amp;T
galaxy s5 a few months back this will be
a familiar though not identical
experience the first thing you'll pick
up is that the boxes differ in size and
there's a good reason for that the newer
phone comes with Samsung's desktop
charging cradle in the box and it also
comes packing a spare battery and a data
cable alongside the integrated charger
and earbuds oddly the included cables
aren't USB 3.0 but the sheer volume of
extras means we're not too bent out of
shape about that out of the device
itself despite some lofty expectations
across the web this version of Samsung's
flagship does not feature enhanced fit
and finish or anything of that sort if
you didn't like the build up the galaxy
s5 you're not going to like the lte-a
version but once you get underneath the
screen protector which we might as well
do now silence please and power on the
device you lay eyes on that pixel packed
quad HD display and you start to realize
why some people are miffed at Samsung
for releasing this so soon after the
stock s5 this is a next-generation
display backed up by a more powerful
processor a better graphics processor
more ram than we saw in the US version
and obviously the faster LTE advanced
radio that gives the device its name
even though that ladder bit will only
give it an edge in countries like South
Korea for the moment this is still a
very compelling package to those who
value specs
all whether you call it the s5 lte-a ds5
prime thor you simply refer to it with
an expletive because of the timing of
its release we're going to be taking a
close look at it in the next few days if
you have questions of your own tune into
Thursday's PocketNow weekly podcast and
send them to us we'll answer them live
on the air and leave a comment down
below with specific questions you'd like
us to answer in our s5 vs s 5 prime
comparison and full review coming later
in the week in the meantime refresh your
memory in the stock galaxy s5 see our
full reviews and comparisons here and at
pocketnow.com and once again thanks to
28 mobile for the device loan till next
time this has been michael fisher with
pocket now thanks for tuning in we'll
see you next time all right there's the
waveform this is it shoot it's a device
that has about sixty percent of you it's
vice that has about thirty percent of it

about thirty percent of you grateful you

you or so we've got a device we think
