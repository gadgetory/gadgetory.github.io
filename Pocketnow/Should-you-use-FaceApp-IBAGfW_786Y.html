edu slash pocket now hello everybody and
welcome to the pocket now podcast Tek
Bay joins me on this episode to talk
about face app we actually do a little
bit of a live demo of face app and make
ourselves really really old like
everyone else was on social media as the
app when really viral this past week
after that we get into a couple of
discussions regarding not only the app
but also privacy in general on the
internet during our mid break we talked
about some of your comments from our
previous episode and then later on I
give you a question so you can answer
them in the comment sections down below
make sure you become part of the
discussion so that in our next episode
we can answer some of your comments and
also don't forget to share this episode
to anybody who you think would love to
hear this discussion in the background
all right let's talk about face app and
privacy on the internet here we go face
app we're actually gonna do this live on
the show or on the show yeah this is
gonna be where we're basically we're
reaching our own data right now but
anyway we we thought we would actually
go through this because some of some of
the people out there may not be all up
on the trends or anything like that so
you might be curious as to why
everyone's talking about this app so
we're actually gonna look at it live on
the show right now so let me go ahead
and just open this up so this is so a
user create the create your perfect look
with our full-size filters mm-hmm turn
yourself into a professional photos so
there are filters for like beautifying
you or adding like right there like well
do and not only that you can actually
even add a beard if you don't have one
you can take a picture and add a beard
you know alright so we're gonna we're
gonna get into what our personal
experiences were like with all this
stuff I did play around with that too
when I first got this app cuz okay we're
gonna get into in the lab and have fun
with magic transformations mix and match
styles to find the one so if you hit
start mmm now here's here's the reason
why we wanted to start this out this way
yeah
so after everything that has happened
this past week there is now a warning at
the beginning at the very first open of
the app that says cloud photo processing
each photo you select for editing will
be uploaded to our servers for image
processing and face transformation so
when we were getting ready to do this
show what I wanted to do was install the
app do a live like test of the actual
capabilities of face app but I wanted to
do so in airplane mode so if anything
here let's both try it right now
oh yeah degree I'm gonna hit a green
okay I'm gonna hit agree and then I'm
gonna go into airplane mode and let's
see what happens I'll do the same thing
airplane mode alright voila
we're flying alright so airplane mode I
still say access to photos you still
have to hit allow in that case and it
was a little that that warning that you
just mentioned by the way just in case
you've already had the application
installed it came up after the last sub
day so they just pushed an update yes as
we were starting to get ready and
everything I saw that it needed an
update I clicked it and that warning
came up so that's something that's new
and everybody should see but I am an
airplane mode now and in theory
nothing's gonna be uploaded whatever I
yeah said just did it I just found a
picture that I was into and look at this
is this cat logo right here that says
you're offline so okay this is all this
is all stuff there oh this is all stuff
that everyone's talking about the fact
that this app requires an internet
connection but the thing is that's not
necessarily the whole story here is that
face app is a Russian application and
all of the cultural implications aside
there is this whole idea right now that
if it comes from I hate to play it this
way but if it comes from China or if it
comes from Russia everyone just sort of
gets really it's a security key I mean I
think it's generally just the security
concern especially with the with the
stuff that's been going on with the
election and so on so if people are a
little bit anxious when you when you
hear where the the companies from or
where the servers could be so that's
some of the things that people worry
about yes so this past week when face
app like I wonder it's like I'm willing
to fall on my sword I don't have
anything a high so I'm willing to fall
on my sword and then and I'm gonna undo
airplane mode and I'll show my before
now
after so this is a here's what is
uploading right now dude it got it okay
I'm gonna try to grab a picture from
from yesterday when we were hanging out
so yes de London still offline I
realized that all right well one of the
precautions that I wanted us to do was
to take screenshots of the process
rather than actually like but the thing
is it doesn't matter anymore because the
photo is literally uploaded to Phoebe's
prot yeah it is post part it what it's
process not possible yet so everything
is done so let's go and do here so if
you do aged and I do old even though
there so I went ahead and look at the
picture picture in here how bad did it
go man
it went pretty bad because you know what
I'm wearing all of the same stuff cuz
it's a full body shot and it's it's me
looking all trendy but then my head just
became very wrinkly like so if I'm not
mistaken so the old and young are the
two things that they have that they
allow to use so I have old yeah young
just goes really bad so because of the
beard on me for some reason going old
works great but I'm not necessarily I
look great but you know it's this and
then there's a smile zaps and then it's
still everything is basically for the
most part ease within the Profi pro side
so you have a way of seeing what it kind
of looks like on the free one looked
like the class there's a classic look
the original look either way it's it is
as you said it's uploading your picture
but supposedly only the image you select
not everything in your gallery that's
exactly something we're gonna get into
that a little bit later but I wanted to
like since we're getting into basically
the reason why this app became such a
big deal this past week so okay now that
I've taken the screenshots I'm actually
not going to like save the photo or
anything like that I'm gonna go ahead
and uninstall the app and it's not
because I hate this
that this thing is crazy yeah yeah and
it's not even because I feel all that
unsafe because of this app it's just
that you know the we're trying to
illustrate for you some of the points
that we want to make by the end of this
episode so yeah face app that is exactly
what we're talking about today this past
week you we just went through it right
now so technically we are apart
the hype but this past week around
Tuesday Wednesday when everyone's
Twitter's were all of a sudden like
geriatric people yeah exactly and you
didn't see it coming and you were
sitting here just like and then suddenly
think was it Marquez that I think I
first noticed it with Marquez Marquez
posted a picture and I'm like wow he
looks very different without makeup but
it was just like I started looking at
him like what is and then I started
seeing more stuff on Twitter and not
just Twitter Instagram kind of was
really big on that as well yeah there
were a lot of them did you get into the
hype like like I want to get some quick
reactions to the app itself well yeah we
kind of already did that but did ya did
you do it did you participate in I did I
I did I was very I I was very tempted
just mostly just to see how it looked
because of the fact that you know with a
beard everything it generally face
tuning applications don't do well with
my face because they tend to cut off the
beard and do some weird stuff with it
I did it and and and for the best part
is I think I took a picture of myself in
front Carlos that we were doing a
challenge together and I just aged
myself and I posted it on my Instagram
story and I sent it to Horn Carlos I
said dude I've gotten a lot older since
the last time we hung out together and
then it actually you know overall the
effect was okay did I read the the you
know all the warnings and all that stuff
into it I was familiar with the app from
before is not the first time I was
familiar with it but I just didn't
realize that there was such a
controversy around it so yeah I had to
dabble there was my wife even downloaded
and installed it and she did a whole
bunch of stuff to me that I don't really
appreciate it
yeah and it's it's not phenomenon that
like when something becomes for lack of
a better term viral on social media that
it seems like everybody kind of jumps on
to it and yeah I did the same thing like
my whole thing was when I when I first
saw it happening
it wasn't even because of any one
personality online it was just that I
start to see it on mass and another
thing happened that we're gonna get into
a little bit after my little story here
my law anecdote I installed the
application I took a picture and then I
showed my parents I was like look like
physically with my phone I didn't like
download the photo down and then send it
to them or anything like that which now
live on the show we realize isn't is a
moot point because the photos already
upload it doesn't matter yeah that
downloading it is it
literally more of the Oh here by the way
he's a copy of what we already have
yeah exactly so yeah I sent I showed it
to my parents and they were just like oh
my god we all had a good laugh about it
but that was it that was literally it
and yeah I did not I did not get into
more photos I didn't start to like
because I know some people do that like
I remember when other viral like face
filters were happening like everyone
just started putting in every single
photo that they possibly could they
wanted to see how much they could do it
one of my favorite youtubers Aaron
Hanson of the game grumps he actually
took the photo downloaded it added
another filter downloaded it added
another filter he was blind
yeah he kept reapplying it he was old
six times over and looked it looked
incredibly hideous and oh my god I think
for the daily this past week when Jaime
was talking about on the daily didn't he
and Diego do the same thing I think
Diego did it to him see that thing there
is a big part of the social media where
there weren't even actually asking
people's permission the problem with
this application and work the way it
kind of works you don't need the
official person's permission a picture
of them posted online even if you take a
screenshot of it you're able to post it
in and there was a lot of people posting
it was like famous people and so on but
I think from I remember correctly if I
saw the story on Instagram Diego did it
to Jaime and I was like don't do it
don't do it don't do anything he was a
thumbnail for the day and that became
the thumbnail and that's poetic of
course putting Jaime in there you know
it's like hi this is Jaime Rivera I'm
still here it's got a little bit of a
dribble heroes older for you but he
still were and he is still rocking out
some really good teas you know the one
that I showed earlier is so funny
because I'm wearing what is what
basically equates to a millennial outfit
but then my head is just so yeah it's
like grandpa wants to be the young kid
on that look now that is it it's a it
has it's it's so the other thing also a
lot of people may not realize this um
you don't actually have to login to the
app you don't have to use there's
there's quite a bit of information where
people are like well it has my
information and so on there's like a
Facebook layer yeah yeah there's they're
supposed to be in most I think from what
I understand I think
with everybody that I know not one
person logged in not one person signed
up for the pro version everybody was
just using the free option and it was
just it was comical like I did the exact
same thing you did I showed it to my mom
and she's like yeah you kind of look
like your uncle I'm like yeah then and I
was one thing yeah I look like my uncle
and in that which I thought was really
weird because my uncle it's he's not
blood related to me so that no I but
that part a part of the the processing
and everything is it I always wonder
because in my mind I just the image that
I did now sent and I think I'll send it
to you for later on it literally looks
like the forget the name of the
character from from Tekken the the the
Japanese character with the beard and
the hair standing up like I forget his
name oh yeah yeah yeah I know that was
just literally the way I when I saw I
saw him and like I look badass just
older you know ya know to give all of
our to give all of our viewers and
listeners well by the way welcome to the
this is a slightly different form or not
even slightly this is a very different
format for the pocket nyle weekly where
we're just talking about one topic one
on one conversation one on one on one so
two people one topic that's really weird
to say by anyway face up is not even
that new it's been around for a while
and yeah yeah I think 2017 was when I
first came out and like many beautifying
applications there are a ton of them and
by the way majority of them do come from
places like China and Russia so this is
not the only app that is like that I
mean just think of all of the Chinese
phones that you might have ever used mmm
all of those applications those are all
beautifying modes and whatnot Xiaomi
zone for that how I was I was just about
to say Xiaomi is big and there's a lot
of options in there camera app yep
native then there are just like any of
those applications it starts out it
starts off simply enough you can change
your hair color you can in this case the
beard stuff was one and then changing
your like making you seem younger was
already a thing there the old part was
later was was actually recent that you
can make yourself younger that was one
of the original features and face app
has already been in the news for
controversy because all some of the
links will hopefully be in the
description down below as long as I can
find these articles again but I was
reading up on
this and a year or two ago earlier on in
the lifespan of face app it made it so
that in order for you to look more
beautiful your skin kept getting lighter
so you can just imagine oh that's right
yeah yeah yeah just imagine how people
reacted that to that kind of thing so in
all honesty face app is not without its
controversy to begin with it's just that
now we live in a we live in an age where
so much of our data is out there and
it's just that now we have an
application that literally says in its
terms and conditions that everything
that it uses can be used for future
materials I mean let me let me find a
real quick actually um that terms and
conditions I don't know if here why
don't I copy this over TK I want you to
read this for our for our viewers so
look out into the Skype chat right there
oh wow this is this is actually kind of
not disturbing it is unsettling when you
read this out loud the way the way it
reads okay so you grant face tap a
perpetual in irrevocable irrevocable
non-exclusive royalty-free free
worldwide fully paid transferable sub
license the sub sub licensable
license to use reproduce modify adapt
publish translate create derivative
works from distribute publicly perform
and display your User Content and any
name username or likeness provided in
connection with your User Content in all
media formats now known or later
developed with that later develop that
is messed up okay yeah exactly that
compensation it without compensation to
you so basically what you're telling
face app is I want to use your
application everything that is uploaded
because of it can be used in the future
or and or if you use it in social media
or something like that the face app
company will potentially take those
photos and use it for future marketing
purposes for example accident like even
other apps if they decide to make
another app that does something else
they could use some marketing
information from this one it goes a
little bit away from what they said that
so they're saying somewhere I think they
made a statement that the data is only
there for like 48 hours
between 40 hours supposably but this
this contradicts that that's a little
bit talking out of both sides of your
mouth there exactly so that's the thing
so it's it's one thing for the data to
be in the servers and then to go away
that's what snapchat does snapchat who
already went viral fairly recently
because of their gender bending theater
or people were just swapping genders I
remember everyone was going viral on
that and also that was also another one
um okay I'll get into this topic in the
low and a little bit the whole idea that
people were doing it to you or to me
rather than me actually using it myself
hmm because that happened a lot anyway
snapchat they say that all of the snaps
and all the content that go up on their
servers are deleted once every party
involved looks at but basically once the
snap is viewed it is gone the server and
if it stays on the server because
somebody does not look at it right away
it's up there for up to 30 days and then
it's and then it's deleted because you
know the person that you sent your snap
to you probably ghosted you episode by
the way well yeah we could do a whole
episode on ghosting alone anyway why
she's not responding but yeah but yeah
that's that's the whole idea behind
cloud servers is that they bring it up
they they perfect they perform AI
functionality on uploaded photo and then
download down the result to you what's
different though is that the terms and
conditions do make it seem like they
keep the content so that's the reason
why there's all this controversy going
on right now I don't know how you feel
about all of this like when you read
something like this does it make you not
want to use this app it's so we have to
realize when we when we look at this app
we're okay and we're focusing on on you
know face app specifically but keep in
mind that we normally on a day-to-day
basis used different cloud storage type
of services that use our data it's you
know because we say the word you know
our data is on the cloud but the reality
is our data is on the cloud in multiple
buckets in different areas and maybe you
know not the same people it's not like
one area I mean so the reality is I
really don't have much to hide I mean my
pictures are mostly backed up anyways to
Google photos it's not like I have
anything really running over it again
a little bit later - that's actually
yeah with very salient point that you
just and and and - that's - that later
on but the overall I think my main thing
when I found out about the concerns and
so on the main thing I was like my main
thing that was kind of very worried
because a lot of people were talking
about it so that he was uploading every
photo so I tested that out I went in
there and I selected an image but I only
had one image on that phone and I wanted
to see basically was it trying to look
for more was it trying to do other
things I'm going you know I checked the
piracy site also looked at the
permissions and so on overall you need
to understand there is no such thing as
free it comes down to that there really
the word free app free download is not
true there is some way that the
developers either making money or
something that they're doing to
compensate themselves or you know fund
something is this you know we've seen it
with many apps Instagram we've seen it
with whatsapp you know when Facebook
takes over it has to figure out a way to
monetize but my concern is does it
really affect me if it's taking one
picture that I selected and I personally
chose to send to them I assumed that the
processing wasn't on the on device the
level of processing and how good it came
out I realized that it was not on the
phone because there's just no way and
yeah at the end of the day when I was
done with it I uninstalled it I mean I
reinstalled it today just for us kind of
thing yeah all right so just to kind of
play with it because I yeah when we were
preparing for everything I installed it
and saw the update there so but that all
that that all bears in mind that for
people like us and I'm talking about us
in particular not any like generalized
group I'm talking about me and utk we
actually don't use applications like
this to the extent that I feel like a
lot of people did like no we can't we
come in we have a laugh we put one photo
maybe in Jaime's case he just used it
for a pocket now we clocking out daily
thumbnail yeah but even he said in the
daily that he was a little bit skeevy
sure about it which is why shortly after
he did what he needed to do he
uninstalled it so I feel like that's I
feel like that's a big portion of it and
but but this is the thing do we actually
have that much control over how much of
our likeness or our faces actually go up
in the cloud in this way because to be
honest I'm not calling anybody out I'm
not saying it's a bad thing we
or having a laugh that's that's the one
of the main points I want I want to put
out there is that despite all of these
things happening it's it's really
important for everyone to know that you
know we're still trying to have fun
we're still trying to just enjoy these
things that happen that's what virality
kind of creates is like a fun thing for
that collective consciousness to have
there are some implications behind that
which is what we're gonna talk about
later but it wasn't because I stumbled
upon the app and I did something and
then I'm like oh crap you know this is
really cool it's because other people
people we know started posting our
photos on the internet that were of the
face our of our faces being old which
meant that they went through found other
people's photos uploaded them to face
apps cloud and then did that because you
had original control into what you can
update yeah it exactly exactly so did
that did that happen to you or just in
general now you're not with somebody
online but that's alright before we
started the show we explained that you
know my wife decided to go through all
different filters on this so ya know it
it's easily doable I mean obviously a
she she has access there's no issues
with privacy there but it was more about
the fact that she was able to do so many
different options and send me different
examples of things that I didn't even
try I literally went into the app I
tried the aging one used it and that was
okay thank you that was fun that one
image I processed it on mine and I think
I didn't even really publicly post it I
did another one but the one I did in on
the one with a friend of mine I didn't
really post it online I shared it
directly with that person and I said
look how funny it is and then that was
it but yeah it that that's the part that
bothers me is the fact that you can do
it on other people and you don't
necessarily have to you know should we
ask other people like if I did a picture
of both of us hanging out should I have
to send them this once okay
yeah you know Josh I'm about to aid you
and post this picture I was like we're
about I'm gonna bore you so bad you
think you're gonna age right now by the
end by the end of this conversation
you will be 2 generations older oh yeah
I mean but should we ask I think that
you know social etiquette is another
thing part of that it's you know people
posting things of you and the reality is
that yeah do you own the stuff once it's
posted online once you put it on
Instagram you put it into the Internet's
or the you know the social media
accounts can you really control what
happens with it so with all that in mind
we're going to move from face app into
the
all discussion about privacy and just
how hard it is to be truly private on
the Internet
before we do that I actually wanted to
make sure that we do our recurring
segments this is something that I want
to do more often on our podcast I didn't
put this in the rundown by the way this
is just gonna be us so the question that
I posted last week as Jaime and I were
doing our one-on-one discussion was that
what do you want to see out of the
Samsung Galaxy Note n so I have some top
comments here that I wanted to just sort
of name out I may not name everybody's
name but you know what we're going
through the comments and we want to talk
about it a little bit CB mm a headphone
jack and folds in half perfectly I think
you think of a different phone there bro
oh no we're about it yeah where I was
gonna say we may hear about the said
folding perfectly thing at the same
event but we'll say that is true
but you know what a lot of people were
saying they want the headphone jack to
remain because there are some ID there
are some rumors that the headphone jack
might be going away with that that is
scary stuff it's weird because they've
stuck to it for the longest time and to
do it on the note line it's like oh man
that would be scary because that's you
know it's supposed to be the
productivity King right it's supposed to
be everything the S line is plus
productivity plus the s-pen bigger
display bigger battery it's supposed to
be the bigger and to take something out
when you have so much space oh man okay
yeah we're almost there well we all will
all find that very soon yeah indeed
expandable memory
I mean well expendable storage I feel
like they should say but expensive
storage so we have that as well that one
came from milkman 635 let's see what
else do we have now we had a lot of
people also saying like thank you for
bringing the full podcast back on
YouTube you're welcome we heard you you
know we want to bring back the full long
long-form discussions like like you're
seeing right now we're just focusing on
one topic one general topic and then in
the middle of it we're just going to
respond to a few of the comments from
last week so that's pretty much what
we're gonna be looking for now TK as
Provident out Dell asks we're not really
asks but he says ninety hertz display
how important is it for you to have a
high refresh rate screen as clearly it
is for this person
so a year ago I probably would have said
not so much
mostly because that I had then we only
had really the experience with the razor
phone the first generation raised from
but having had used the wrong phone I
got to pick up the right phones every
once in a while
the one plus seven Pro and having used
the brand new razor phone too as well as
some of the other devices that are
running higher refresh rate you know
it's nice I like it and I appreciate
having it is it important for me as far
as just to be able to use the phone on a
day-to-day probably not I would rather
have the qHD definitely as a base model
there get it in there in because
anything above sixty Hertz right now
we're still having a little bit of a
hard time getting compatibility with
things that work with it right because
games will learn maybe maximum of 60
nothing's really ever going at 190 Hertz
and the very few games are compatible to
go 220 so it's always going to be for me
I think I would say it's nice is it
important not necessarily okay as far as
the display is concerned where is it
here slick cross one word no damn notch
or hole punch you want a full squared
screen first of all a square screen like
a Instagram one by one I don't but I get
what you're trying to say there we
wanted just a full screen the hole punch
apparently now this is something that I
want to ask you as well TK notches or
hole punches do you have an opinion
either way but this particular note 10
apparently is gonna have the hole punch
but it's dead center oh is it well it's
time II didn't think so I thought so I
so yeah the fact that you know with the
S line they went on the whole going to
the right and then of course we had the
honor devices going on the left side
knows that kind of the camp right there
and then he had everybody else doing the
whole pop-up mechanism so everybody's
trying to go around being in the dead
center and Samsung with the note at
least with the renders that we're seeing
we're actually I take that back I think
it's pretty confirmed even with the I
think that little preview image they had
they had it looked like it was kind of
centered I think it's nice I think it's
okay I think we'll all get used to it
it's it's pretty much something you just
have to visually get used to I do have
to say that having the camera sitting on
the left or on the right like the punch
hole cameras that we've had it gets a
little confusing because most people
assume the cameras in this
in the area in the area where the note
10 is keeping it so I think it'll be
okay I don't think it's too weird I
think it's closer to what we had it in
the past but without having the notch
with it so no guys it's good fair enough
I have a couple of things here okay so
the last one that we'll talk about just
for this last minute or so Lane or Ian
Ian Wilkes I feel like this is gonna be
a relic of generations past
simply not gonna get it a medal back
with a removable battery
oh no no yeah no yeah we're don't think
they would take the note ten back to the
note for I bet that would be like a like
yeah yeah a massive reverse in I'll
grade the components of the note for and
we release it exactly well because
that's the last thing yeah right that
was the last one the note five I think
was the first one we got that we start
getting them the glass back and then of
course you know that we don't have a
sixth in thing we went to seven and
seven had the thing and then overall I
think no no I wish I wish we had the
removable battery but I think
realistically yeah we should have
embraced the sandwich and move on yeah
indeed I think so so real quick what is
like the one thing that you want the
note tent to have before we get back to
our topic
so if there's one thing that I would
like to have is you know productivity
specific productivity applications an
update to the decks I want to see decks
be a little bit more desktop centric it
better at as far as having the you know
the desktop experience they did some
teasers talking about connectivity
continuity of connectivity between
different devices I want to be able to
enjoy having one device that I walk into
the house and I can literally jump into
watching something on the TV flip over
go over to the office keep everything
running so connectivity and I know
that's not specific to the note line but
it has to come out with it because
that's the productivity King sure so you
know s-pen optimizations of course
better gestures better functionalities I
was very happy with last year's
Bluetooth long the the connectivity
between the phone and the s-pen to
initiation pictures that was just
phenomenal that was amazing
so there were actually a couple of
comments saying like I want to see an S
Pen
so no dude what's going on like you know
that aspect
so moving away from face app we do have
some other general privacy concerns and
I think the main wave that I want to
jump into this this sort of pivot on the
topic is you you touched upon it a
second ago given all of the different
services that we subscribe to that we
give our information to all the
different social media platforms how
much of how much control do we actually
have over our data you mentioned before
free is not totally free no no and
that's the that's the scary part we
trust that big corporations or big
companies are able to safeguard our data
the right way and we hear about leaks we
hear about breaches we hear about
attacks and the reality of the matter is
it you know and I'm not talking to
certainly just even images and so on
because I think the example I was
referring to there is Stephen basically
you know Google photos I backup pictures
my pictures to Google photos because
I've had I've been I've been hit before
where I had to lost the phone or I
damage the phone where my data was on
it's not like I always felt like the
photos are like the number one thing you
worry about there's those are memories
that you can't recreate right other data
may be duplicated but images are I don't
know I really don't yeah you're right we
don't know how much data mining is being
done on our data how much of that
information is being used to gather and
baby built databases of so on of the
content of information that you may not
necessarily reference us they may not
say you know TK's pictures or josh's
pictures or whatever but it's using
basically you know how many pictures on
an average as a person take of cats how
many pictures a person takes of their
kid or buildings or cars or whatever
that could that's valuable data to a
search engine that we normally would not
necessarily think about can we control
them running that and that type of
analysis and I don't think we can it's
all on their servers its internal they
may not be selling it but they're
gathering data
yeah and re are emails get scanned Dru
true re-mose do a scan I mean if you
look through any Gmail thing it's
scanned your email that way it can give
you smart composed replies exactly yeah
yeah it's so everything is just being
looked at and I wanted to go through a
few different pieces of phenomena that
seemed to happen I mean there's this
past week and I was with some friends
and they were complaining about how they
could talk about anything everyone talks
about this but they can talk about
anything any product any food
and any shoes they got shoes if they
wanted to and then on Instagram the
sponsored post is anything that they
talked about so this happens to you I
actually don't think it happens to me as
much oh my god does it happen and it's
the reason who its freaky is because
it's something that I've talked about
that I didn't even search for mm meaning
I did not ask an assistant for it I did
not the only thing I did was talk about
it it was a weird conversation we were
talking about beach umbrellas we weren't
going to the beach
I wasn't searching for beaches it was a
and suddenly Instagram shows me a great
sponsor post about a beach umbrella and
I was like that's all specific it was
weird I mean obviously I didn't say a
brand or whatever but it was just the
concept of it that beauty that it's
listening
it is listening there is no way for it
to intuitively AI whatever figure out
that at this point in time I would be
interested in looking at beach umbrellas
and so on and if for porn the reference
that you know it's pretty hot lately
we've been doing a lot of swim meets for
my son and we needed some kind of shade
and beach umbrellas are the only thing
you can get that are big enough to cover
you but yeah
Instagram number one culprit there no
other app I've seen that uses that it's
pretty specific as far as the ads
because I'm not in tainted into Facebook
all the time so for me Instagram is the
only app that does that and it's very
consistent your friends I I don't find
that that's actually happening to me
very often especially about things I
talk about things I search for yeah I
think that's sort of a given at this
point that when you act when you put in
any term into any application it's going
to start giving you more of that so if I
click on if I click on let's say a
backpack thing because I love bags it's
kind of a weird obsession but I love
like just fashion-forward things like
that then more of those things will come
up like I have an ad right here for
barefoot shoes like I'm okay cool like I
know that I search for that so I know
that that's going to come up so I get
that that's fine but yeah just things
that you're talking about like I
literally have a Google assistant I'm
enabled device in front of me I use
Google assistant quite often that first
churches they but I use it to like
control the stuff in my in my office and
what are some other ones and yeah you
did bring up Google photos as well and
Google photos I think is one of the main
culprits because not culprits but one of
the main examples because guys we all
have to remember that some of the key
functions of some of the devices that we
use literally need this data y TK Y is
the pixel camera the best cloud
processing my friends and that was
exactly demonstrated on that the fact
that the pixel 3 a does exactly very
similar processing levels to what the
pixel 3 and pixel 3 Excel do it is cloud
processing that's how Google is in the
software and updating process and that's
this yeah no question you know perfect
photos processing backup just even even
just intuitively saying you remember
this day from last year when you happen
to be on vacation last year around the
same time yeah all of those things it
it's all on the cloud which is scary but
that's usually what the main issue that
we have yeah that's that's what it is so
the question there is because Google
tries to make it very clear that they're
not necessarily trying to like keep a
record of who you actually are so it's
not like you're gonna go into a Google
search type in somebody's name and
they're like oh well we have a billion
photos from that person no that's not
really what's happening what's really
happening in Google photos and this is
what they've told us I'm not saying that
this is exactly what the gospel truth is
but what they're what they're trying to
say is that they're just trying to
recognize things and yes you look in the
photo it's like that's a cat I don't
care whose cat it is I don't care what
kind of cat it is I just know it's a cat
and if that's a person that's a person
we know how to outline a person that's
the point so I guess the reason why
people got really skittish about the
face app is because it's actually sort
of taking very specific pieces of data
about your face and then it's able to
change it up with filters and whatnot
because you can only do that when it has
actually scanned your entire face that's
exactly it's that little effective that
happens on Facebook or on snapchat and
again you know this happens everywhere
where if you hold on to the screen to
add like a fun filter you can see it
plotting yeah yeah it's a facial
scanning yet it's like a
it attempts to do that and I think the
other reason at which I I'm not sure how
you feel about the bit specifically deep
fake if you remember like all the whole
publicity that we just went through the
whole deep fake things and picture you
know they think was a keen appeal that
that thing with President Obama there
was the whole they mimic the entire
faced how do you know what's real what's
not it's scary
yes we're getting into a point where a
lot of people are very worried about how
they look and the fact that there's
enough images of us out there that they
can recreate things and they can make
things look like them something else and
I think that's why face app is being
scrutinized a little bit more it's a
free app people have access to it and
people can do things to other people
without even asking about so that's it's
just how easy it is I think that's the
problem because we do fake it requires a
lot more processing and not everybody
knows how to do it but an app it's so so
easy so do you think how do you feel
about this whole idea that we blurred
the lines of privacy and of personal
data for the sake of convenience because
I think that's what we're kind of
touching upon here is I give we're
giving up some of our rights not really
right or we're giving up some of our
personal information for the sake of
having an easier life like where do you
land on that whole phenomena my thought
it's a scary process it's a scary thing
because we do this on a daily basis we
and we do accept it so the fact that you
do accept it starting off even just
using a Google account you gave up some
information you're using a Gmail you're
having to use it it's a Google account I
think the main thing would be is to
exercise caution and to be selective as
to what you put out there mm-hmm
yes why we see some people that you know
are a little bit more protective of
their children when they're younger and
not putting their pictures online not
doing things like that because the
reality of matter is you know the kids
are too young to make a decision for
themselves and their are not able iam
not able even to say sorry I don't want
to they may not or they may that's the
thing they have to decide on but yeah we
don't have a way of controlling it we
accept it and I think we just need to
exercise caution as to what we do post
online you know like if you're posting
an image that is something that is me
more personal between you and your
family and your friends keep it in that
you know transfer it between two people
use what you know more of an encrypted
system don't post it on Instagram to
share it with the rest of the family or
on Facebook because you realize the
moment it goes on
they're the moments on on that service
it's not yours anymore and yeah anybody
in the world can see it unless you set
the privacy but even then they have
access to it so and you susceptible to
any breaches so you have to accept
whatever you put out it's a yeah I think
that I think that's the main takeaway
from this whole week
okay so everyone's question you know how
the media is always all about their
sound bites and whatnot they always say
the exact same thing where do we draw
the line you know and all that and I get
it I get that that's the question but I
think that is really hard to these days
especially in the in the age of social
media like where do you draw the line
when you have so many people who are
just so happy and willing to jump on the
bandwagon those pictures of themselves
and everybody else and get onto this
like fur allottee train that could could
mean bad things down the line you know
we don't realize it in the moment while
we're doing it but by then maybe it's
too late but that's sort of a dystopian
way of looking at the world and I I I
would actually I would actually tell
people don't don't worry about it so
much because even on the local news
they're saying things like if you're a
person at a high level like you're very
important like a high high a person of
high importance mm um it's probably best
to have a phone for your personal stuff
and a phone for your work stuff because
god forbid you have face a butt and it
actually is data mining no one has
proven that yet by God for video face up
on there it is data mining and then you
have it on a phone that has like
sensitive government materials and you
know exactly yeah or yeah because then
even if you're encrypted you it's access
it gives you unencrypted when you when
you unlock and if you install an
application into a secured environment
yeah you pretty much just gave it access
that that is just big yeah no I totally
agree I think of that I think that just
harkens to I think what is the full
general idea behind this past week which
is just be more mindful you just have to
be a lot more mindful about it like just
even earlier I wanted us to be mindful
about I wanted us to illustrate
mindfulness by turning on airplane mode
and by uninstalling the app the moment
we did the one thing we wanted to do in
and then putting it away like and I
think everyone should I think I think
that's what every
one should be doing more often it's just
being more mindful about it and try to
look into permissions Android does a
really good job of telling you what in
applications accessing and what it needs
and it's something that you don't feel
like it's right you have to weigh you
know the pros and cons is it worth
taking that risk you know and
potentially exposing some data that you
don't want to the universe so just I
think the dual phone is an option I mean
we may we may have that luxury area but
not everybody could things that people
should be also aware of is that a lot of
new phones now offer encrypted
environments within their phone like I
think you and I did that when we did the
honor of u-20 a while back where when I
hit when I was at when you're using the
phone I created a separate space for you
and that is it has separate data and
from my environment so there's also
things that you could do there so you
can keep things more you know private
and secure on your phone so look into
all the features so a lot of the new
phones have good good options for
protection yeah for sure
all right well I think we've exhausted
not really exhausted I mean I'm sure
there's so many things that people would
want to know about yeah face happened
about privacy and whatnot that's what
I'm gonna go ahead and pass it off to
all of you viewers and listeners
listeners head over to the youtube
version of the podcast and get to the
comment sections because that's what
we're going to be responding to what we
want to ask you is how did two questions
how did you feel about face app did you
did you use it a lot what was your
experience with it
and after that how much do you actually
think we are in control of our personal
and data and privacy you can give
stories you can give us what your
thoughts are you can give us maybe your
concerns I suppose I mean I know
everyone is concerned about stuff like
this these days and this is just the
latest example of that so get into the
comment sections on the YouTube version
of the podcast to let us know how you
feel and next week in our mid break we
will respond to some of those comments
all right I think that should pretty
much do it so this is the new format of
the PocketNow weekly I'm gonna start
calling at the PocketNow podcast because
honestly if topics like this come up in
the middle of the week I would love to
just get onto the camera get one other
person with me and we have a discussion
about those topics and whenever that
might happen it might be on a different
day so weekly it might be a moot point
at this point it's just gonna be a
discussion TK go ahead and let everybody
know where they can find you well you
know most if you guys don't know me or
by now it's basically TKB on most social
networks TKD sl8 6y5 on twitter and on
instagram and of course on over at
xda-developers
i've been there for a long nine years
there but yeah I'm around and always a
pleasure to hang out with you Josh and
you know have a nice little conversation
over some topics you know popular
tactics for sure these one-on-one
discussions are gonna become more and
more common so it's gonna be somebody
