in the wireless industry and two of
those are HTC and motorola both of which
have new flagships out on the market how
do their flagships compare I'm Taylor
Martin this is pocket now and this is
the motorola droid ultra versus the HTC
one to say Samsung is dominating the
mobile space is well an understatement
as of July it held 30.4 percent of the
global smartphone market share compared
to 13.1 percent by Apple and 5.1 percent
by LG as popular as brands like HTC
maybe many of them are lumped into the
dreaded other category Samsung success
has come at the expense of many of its
competitors market performance which is
forced many of them to hit the drawing
board and start anew two of the most
notable companies to do this this year
our HTC and motorola with their latest
flagships the HTC One and droid ultra
which of the two is the better phone all
around that's what we're here to find
out
site for being the same general size and
shape a rectangular wafer like shaped
like practically every other modern
smartphone the HTC one android ultra
have very little in common in terms of
appearance hardware specs and the like
from a physical standpoint the two are a
stark contrast from one another on one
hand the HTC One is one of the most well
designed well put together beautiful
smart phones we've ever seen period much
less just for Android it's jesse has
made almost entirely of a tough
aluminium never mind the dent on ours it
can be likened to the build quality of
mini apple products it's a highly
regarded phone with spectacular build
quality it's gone toward bag slips
comfortably into the palm of your hand
and it truly feels like a premium device
worthy of a premium price tag on the
other hand the droid ultra is none of
that it's made almost entirely of
plastic more like a Samsung device than
the motorola smartphones we've come to
expect and sometimes love at the very
best it feels like a toy and it's flat
back makes the phone rest on your
fingers and thumb rather than in the
comfort of your palm it's a glossy
fingerprint magnet that tries to look
much more appealing than it truly is the
fake holographic carbon fiber visual
effect isn't fooling anyone strangely
enough the cheap plastics don't give the
ultra any notable advantage and weight
it hits the scales at 137 grams to the
mostly aluminium HTC one's 143 grams we
feel that maybe due to some additional
display real estate but we'll get to
that in a bit the droid ultra has a
marginally larger footprint at 130 7.5
millimeters tall 71.2 millimeters wide
and seven point two millimeters thick
it's a mere 0.1 millimeters taller and
three millimeters wider than the one
however the one is 2.1 millimeters
thicker so long as you only count the
bottom edge the camera hump actually
makes the ultra sit higher off the table
on the top edge than the HTC One some
trickery if you will and the differences
in specs are certainly worth mentioning
the HTC One comes with a 1.7 gigahertz
quad-core krait 300 cpu and adreno 320
GPU 2 gigabytes of ram a 4 megapixel
camera either 16 or 32 gigabytes of
fixed storage infrared and a 2,300
milliamp hour battery our model is the
unlock hspa+ model which works on
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T here in the States but
it's also available in various LTE
worldwide the droid ultra specific to
verizon has a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core
crate cpu with the audrina 320 GPU two
gigabytes of ram a 10 megapixel camera
16 gigabytes of fig storage and a 20 130
million power battery verizon also
offers an upgraded version of the droid
ultra called the droid maxx with 32
gigabytes of storage and a 3,500
milliamp hour battery both come with
Wi-Fi b/g/n AC NFC and Bluetooth 4.0 the
droid ultra does however come with a
slightly larger display it boasts a 5
inch Super AMOLED panel while the HTC
One comes equipped with a 4.7 inch slc
d3 display but the droid ultra display
only offers 720p resolution to the ones
1080p 294 pixels per inch to the ones
staggering 469 PPI and the difference in
clarity is noticeable to a trained eye
that doesn't mean the droid ultra
display is necessarily bad it offers
deeper blacks more vibrant colors if
that's your sort of thing and more
contrast the HTC One S display is more
true to life with milky blacks both
offer wide viewing angles and are quite
bright oh and lest we forget boomsound
the front-facing Beats Audio speakers on
the HTC One which are incredibly loud as
opposed to the backward facing speaker
on the ultra in terms of hardware it's a
landslide victory for the HTC One if
phones were priced solely on look and
feel the one would retail for several
times with the ultra would there's
really no comparison and that's a shame
because the ultras younger cousin the
Moto X is beautifully designed and built
comparing software on these two
smartphones can get a little bit tricky
as previously mentioned the HTC One
comes in a few different models and not
all of them run the same software the
one from HTC or a wireless carrier comes
running since five with Android 422 the
google play edition HTC one comes
pre-installed with android 43 and all of
its goodies and the droid ultra sits
somewhere between those two it's running
a mostly stock version of Android 402
with some minor Motorola customizations
and Verizon bloatware since five on the
HTC One comes with a unique home screen
feature dubbed blinkfeed which is a
social feed reader with integrated news
stories from your favorite websites you
can set another home page as your
default but you cannot disable blinkfeed
it's an integral part of the since five
experience and the app drawer is
different in since five it incorporates
a weather and large clock view at the
top of the app drawer there are no quick
setting toggles in the notification
shade it uses the old method of applying
widgets to the home screens and it's
heavily laden with customizations from
top to bottom change for the sake of
change however it does come with some
useful and awesome features such as Zoe
in the camera application and the custom
gallery application with highlights for
a more streamlined approach there's the
google play edition one which comes with
only two notable changes from HTC beats
audio support for the boomsound speakers
and infrared support other than that
it's almost exactly what you would
expect out of a nexus smartphone which
is great for vanilla junkies and the
droid ultra isn't bad for those seeking
more stock like experience either aside
from the custom icons wallpapers and the
motorola command center widget the
software on ultra is almost stock for to
sure some verizon apps are built in as
is touchless control the ability to
queue Google now searches hands-free and
active notifications the pulsing
notifications on the display in standby
mode and finally there's droid zap the
ability to easily share photos with a
two finger gesture up in the gallery app
so what do we make of all this there are
choices when it comes to software and
that's a great thing if we're talking
about the HTC One but since five we'd
give this all four edge to the ultra but
if we're talking about the google play
edition HTC One the scales would tip the
other way and your opinions may vary
we'll call it a draw in day-to-day
performance both droid ultra and the HTC
One performed quite well and considering
they're both powered by a Krait 300 cpu
clocked at 1.7 gigahertz they're
neck-and-neck that said the two
additional cores do play to the HTC
one's advantage especially in more
intensive work during graphical
benchmarks despite the 1080p resolution
the HTC One maintained higher frame rate
than the ultra and likewise the one
averaged higher scores in various
benchmarks both are still a depth for
gaming and intense multitasking but you
may want to opt for the HTC One if you
plan on pushing the limits of your phone
often our HTC one is hspa+ only model
and we've been using it in Charlotte on
t-mobile the droid ultra on verizon's
LTE network it's clearly capable of
testing higher data speeds than the
t-mobile's hspa+ in the Charlotte metro
area but less we forget the HTC One also
comes in many LTE variants battery life
is a touchy subject with HTC One some
claim to have stellar stamina on the one
while others claim the opposite we're
somewhere in the middle as the 2300
milliamp hour battery can typically last
a full day on moderate usage but also
needs to be plugged in in the late
evening the droid ultra at least so far
seems to be comparable with that and
it's 21 30 million power battery leaves
us wanting more fortunately that's why
the droid Maxx exists finally the
cameras the HTC One S 4 megapixel
ultrapixel camera has been renowned for
showing that megapixels only matters so
much that it's more about what you do
with those megapixels then how many you
have its camera isn't amazing but the
optical image stabilization in HTC
software managed to produce some sailor
shots from time to time other times
images turn out dole noisy and full of
artifacts the 10 megapixel camera on the
ultra works decently well in the right
lighting situations but as soon as light
becomes an issue the clear pixel
technology which is supposed to capture
more light simply doesn't deliver the
HTC One has the upper hand here in both
imaging software and hardware despite
its lower megapixel count it produces
more realistic images and in general is
more balanced the ultra tends to
underexpose more often produce milky
images and create lifeless images
however we do love the ease of use of
the ultras camera interface
of these two we ask you which one you
would pick motorola's droid ultra or the
HTC one the answer is clear for us it's
not that the droid ultra is a bad phone
it isn't it software is quite nice with
some very useful features without being
too bloated and it performs respectively
well but the HTC One is in an entirely
different league the ultras build
quality is admittedly not Motorola's
best work whereas the one is some of
HTC's finest the ones build quality is
unprecedented it comes with two
fantastic software options its
performance is great and it's widely
available for the price the only way we
would recommend the droid over the HTC
One is if you're in need of extra long
battery life in that case we wouldn't
technically recommend the ultra but it's
next of kin the Droid Maxx
