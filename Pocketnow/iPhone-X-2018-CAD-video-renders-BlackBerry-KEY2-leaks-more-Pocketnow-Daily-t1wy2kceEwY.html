iPhones and thank God the notch is
smaller Qualcomm has just announced the
future of Windows 10 pcs with their new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 and more renders
of the BlackBerry key to just emerge and
we can't wait
I'm Jaime Rivera and by the time this
video goes live you might still be able
to participate on the May 10 Pro
giveaway in the link of the description
and yes we are giving away and always
connected PC and HP Envy x2 those
conditions come very soon this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals I still recommend the
Samsung Galaxy s8 and Galaxy s8 plus
these are still great phones and there
are some deals where you can find them
for as low as four hundred twenty bucks
or five hundred and twenty respectively
are they worth it yes they are you can
learn more in the description now let's
talk about the BlackBerry key - we are
two days away from the event and famous
tipster Evan Blass has just provided
renders and I trust those renders
definitely Evan does a great job so far
I have to tell you this much ari used to
be a big blackberry consumer then I saw
the key one and I liked it but it wasn't
perfect but if these renders of the key
two are real I think I'm in love there
is more information on the
specifications as well in the
description I can't wait to see it I'm
gonna be at the event now let's talk
about the iPhone se 2018 WWDC just pass
we saw no phone
we've got conflicting rumors some
companies are claiming that we are going
to continue seeing the same iPhone as
edesign others even case makers and now
even screen protector makers are saying
that we're gonna get a dramatic redesign
and that it's also going to get a little
more expensive whatever the case may be
it's gonna be rather interesting for
Apple to launch for iPhones later this
year but hey I mean it could happen now
let's move the spotlight over to
Qualcomm as the company has taken over
computus right now to announce their new
snapdragon 850 processor for computers
and so bear in mind it's like the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 only it's got
improvements and enhancements that will
allow it to be better for always
connected pcs I have been testing the HP
Envy x2 there's a
video on my experience so far first
impressions are reviews coming very soon
but my impression so far are very
positive let's see how it rounds out
after a week or two of testing and
finally the most interesting news today
have to do with the first CAD renders
that we see in video for the iPhone 10
2018 and whatever other units were
getting interesting we see a smaller
notch but then absolutely everything
else in the design of the iPhone 10 2018
there aren't many changes in the case of
the LCD iPhone that's gonna be the most
affordable one apparently the price tag
is really gonna be around 660 bucks and
we hear that the camera might not be
dual apparently it's just gonna be a
single camera other than that we pretty
much see the same thing so we wonder if
that plus variant of the iPhone 10 is
gonna bring the triple cameras in the
rumors but whatever the case may be let
us know in the comments what do you
think do you like the CAD renders do you
think that Apple should retain the
design and mykc a smaller notch and Wow
Apple could you make a smaller camera
humph that would be awesome
