devices and services group comes under
the ownership of Microsoft but before
that happened Nokia was able to wrap up
a project it had been working on for
quite some time something a lot of
people have been asking for for
literally years an Android phone and
while it wasn't exactly everything
everyone was expecting we're still very
excited to take a look at it and then
give it away but first we've got to
unbox it so let's get to it I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
unboxing of the Nokia X yes you heard us
right folks and yes this video is titled
appropriately we are giving away this
nokia X when our coverage is complete
and if you want to enter for your chance
to win be sure and visit pocketnow.com
on Monday April 28th we will post all
the official rules regulations and so on
we also want to thank Negri electronics
for making this giveaway possible this
device comes from them and if you want a
leg up in the giveaway we'll let you in
on a little secret
follow Negra electronics on Twitter as
that'll be one of the requirements for
winning the giveaway finally if you've
got no time for a contest you just want
to buy a Nokia X right now as soon as
you get done with this unboxing you're
so excited you need to pick one up visit
Negri electronics they're linked in the
description down below so this is the
retail packaging it's a variation on the
packaging we're used to seeing on
Symbian devices and such as you can see
you get a little sneak peek at the UI
here but no Google Play service is
called out obviously because this is an
Android open source project derived
build spectra on the back we took a look
at before but let's just go ahead and
get to the meat of the matter here I
don't want to look at the outside of the
box anymore let's see what this Nokia
Android phone looks like I know
sticklers in the comments will already
be annoyed with me for calling it a
Nokia Android phone it's really no such
thing in spirit but technically speaking
this new OS is based on Android this
phone is built to be affordable as are
its siblings the Nokia X plus and the XL
this is just the standard X here's some
literature what is this oh yeah so we're
just calling out bbm here messaging
services that you can use
with this device little instruction
manual there and bundled in the box a
power adapter headphones which frankly
I'm very surprised to see you don't see
headphones included on many flagship
devices interesting to see them on a
phone built to be affordable and the
battery believe this is 1500 million
powers it is indeed five point five five
watt hours for those of you interested
in that type of measurement now that we
have the packaging out of the way we'll
go ahead and pull the phone from its
protective pouch put that aside along
with the oh I see this is a screen
protector of sorts that looks to have
been removed and then reapplied but
that's okay we'll get the mic in a
position for a nice close-up and then
peel that right off well we've had
smoother oh folks it is our lucky day
that was just a decoy the first ever
pocket now double screen protector peel
you know it's an exciting Friday night
when this ish is happening quiet please
now that's a new phone feel before we
get to the hardware tour I want to call
out the sticker on the back cover that
is calling out the phone's dual-sim
capabilities another indication of just
what type of markets this phone is built
for but always very exciting to try a
phone not built for North America in the
North American market so there's gonna
be a lot of fun and fortunately that
sticker also tells us how to remove the
back cover on this device we're gonna
plant our fingers here just kind of pop
the back cover right off here we went
for the green one I wanted to unbox this
outdoors because you know hey this is a
green pad there's a green phone
obviously we could be making a prettier
video here but sadly the pocket my
weekly podcast took a little long to
edit today and the pocket now a weekly
podcast is also where we will be
announcing the winner of the giveaway
once again that giveaway those details
will be posted on Monday popping this
battery in here once again 1500 milliamp
hours have put this back on tell you the
dimensions of the phone one hundred and
fifteen millimeters tall 63 millimeters
wide ten point four millimeters in
thickness to give you some perspective
and
to inject some added color into the shot
this is the iPhone 5c right next to it
I'm go ahead and pop these down and
directly adjacent to it we'll also throw
the Moto X but it doesn't exactly seem
right to have a size comparison without
a Nokia product so we'll substitute that
iPhone there with the Nokia 929 aka the
Nokia icons you can tell the Lumia icon
as you can tell this device quite small
quite a bit smaller than any flagship
phone just a 4-inch display so this
casing can be nice and manageable let's
see if we can go ahead and power it on
here I've already got this screen all
messed up look at me I'm gross I promise
it's not me it's just just just me being
me just me being a human Moto X get out
of the way this display resolution is
800 by 480 the nokia chime especially
poignant on this day that the transfer
of ownership occurred with the device in
services unit going under Microsoft
pixels on C 233 PPI LCD as we said
before I believe we also said as a
snapdragon s4
1 gigahertz and there we go English yes
go ahead and do that we'll do initial
setup and it is always nice to see a
little tutorial when you have a new user
interface being introduced so swipe from
the left edge or right edge to unlock
the phone thank you for that swipe from
the top to control your connections or
from the bottom 4 options very cool wow
this is gonna be fun I love learning new
interfaces I really do drag down to
start a search very cool as well please
wait and the phone will provision itself
no SIM card in there and there's our
home screen by the way the RAM driving
this experience 512 Meg's four gigs of
on-board storage but there is provision
for an expandable memory card in the
microSD format so that's awesome Wow
this phone loaded with frankly a lot
more I don't wanna say bloat because
this is kind of an entirely different
category but many more pre-installed
apps then I expected unless this is some
kind of thing where you tap and it takes
you to a download link in the store or
something like that
decliner except they're different now it
looks this looks to be yeah no these
have to look to already be installed so
that's very cool obviously there's gonna
be a big learning curve here I can tell
you just straight up there's no
mistaking holding a Nokia phone I mean
these corners are sharp once again we'll
bring the the icon in just to show you
this common design lineage really really
feels interesting and just to show you
how closely this new UI resembles
Windows Phone we showed you this from
MWC or wherever this was so this should
be no surprise to you but still really
nice to get some hands-on time with it
and if I don't stop talking soon this is
gonna be the world's longest unboxing so
I think we're gonna go ahead and cut
this off right now I'm gonna spend the
weekend with this green machine one
