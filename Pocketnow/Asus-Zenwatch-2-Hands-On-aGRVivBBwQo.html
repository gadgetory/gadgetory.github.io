fashion but that doesn't stop a suits
for making a beautiful square one
I'm hiya to Houston for pocket now at
Eva 2015 and this is the asou then watch
to actually these are the Zen watch too
there are two different sizes to choose
from one point four five inches and one
point six three inches and both are
gorgeous Android wear smartwatches with
different bands and color options to
choose from the Sun watch two looks a
lot like the first set watch with the
same rounded square shape but the bezels
have been trimmed down a touch and the
crown button has been more pronounced in
media to press it displays on each or
thankfully AMOLED and high in resolution
and they're some of the best-looking
SmartWatch displays around battery
capacity varies depending on size with
400 million powers going into the larger
watch and 302 the smaller one but
surprisingly the smaller is in watch to
is actually the more expensive one as
suits tells us this is because it's a
more delicate package and the smaller
frame makes it a bit more difficult to
manufacture but even so the Sun watch 2
is one of the cheapest SmartWatch
options from Eva 2015 launching later
this year at 129 for the larger option
and 149 for the smaller model that's
half the cost of even the cheapest 2015
Moto 360 and with the latest version of
Android wear on each it's largely the
same experience to making the Zen watch
to all the more appealing whichever size
you opt for this is looking like one of
the best values coming out of Eva thus
far though of course we'll have to
reserve our final judgement for a more
extensive look for more from Eva 2015 in
Berlin keep it locked to pocket now on
YouTube and stay tuned to pocketnow.com
as well this has been hi out to Houston
thanks for watching we'll see you again
soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
