in the u.s. rumors of apple ditching the
ipod touch for cheaper iphone begin to
make sense and you guessed it iOS 5 beta
already got jailbroken all this and more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
hi everyone and welcome to the pocket
now I review the show we go through all
this week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
my apologies it's currently pouring
outside so sounds not going to be at its
best but let's start off with the cool
apple continues there one device world
domination strategy as they've just
released the GSM flavor iphone 4 as an
unlocked device on the US Apple stores
what this means is that the device will
not be carrier subsidize it will be
completely unlock you can use it on any
gsm carrier in the united states or
worldwide so well sadly that's not
necessarily good news because it's not
going to be on a subsidy it will cost
you six hundred fifty bucks if you want
the 16 gigabyte model and 750 bucks if
you want the 32 gigabyte model you can
both get that in black or white but
again it's a good option for those
people that don't want to be locked into
a contract for two years or that just
need the device to be traveling abroad
and using the same phone just swapping
the SIM cards and not paying those huge
roaming fees so it's a good option again
you're not obligated to pay that much
amount of money just go for the device
subsidized on AT&amp;amp;T or verizon if you
don't want to pay that much amount of
money so kind of cool i'm not even sure
if this fits the rumor category but
people are already assuming that apple
will ditch the ipod touch in this next
September's moosic event for a cheaper
iPhone 4s or five whatever they want to
call it why does it makes sense well
first of all I cloud and I message I
mean what's the point of Apple having
cloud-based services that will not be
available to their devices when their
mobile I mean devices are getting
cheaper manufacturing is getting cheaper
so it does make sense for Apple to try
to figure out how to get a cheaper
device into the market but then it'll be
conflicting with current iPad prices and
current
iPod Touch prices so the smartest thing
is for Apple to figure out how to
converge their product lines and try to
bring just one device that'll be easier
to manufacture if you only have one
device and that device could be as cheap
as to probably offer good options for
people to go for a cheaper device hey
they could probably even figure out how
to bring the ipad 3g data plans to work
on this device and have a data only
iphone sort of device or they could
probably just figure out how to bring
cheaper data plans but again rumors have
it that we won't see an ipod touch and
we will continue talking in the
not-so-cool section of things that are
going on around that makes sense because
not even iOS 5 hints to a next
generation ipod touch it could happen
and while you guess that it only took
the death team a couple of days for them
to get a copy of iowa's 5 beta obviously
they're developers and well they figured
out how to already jailbreak it it's
currently a tethered jailbreak and
obviously it's only available to those
people that have access to the beta
which are only developers currently or
people that have access to the developer
plan because they have a friend that's a
developer and they got it seated but
again it's already jailbroken currently
only tethered not really sure when we're
going to get it untethered nor are we
sure if it's going to be untethered for
iOS 5 I really can answer any questions
right now but we are expecting the
services to work really well for
whenever it's released in the fall so
let's see what happens on a funny note a
Simcoe just brought a study out showing
that Apple currently has so much cash
available they could pretty much by
their whole competition at once they
have 70 billion dollars available in
cash to do whatever they want and we
have competitors like Nokia that cost 22
billion room that costs 13 billion right
now with all their stock drop and we
have HTC that's around 23 billion also
and you know we have samsung and the
others but again that's just to show how
Apple is becoming a success in you know
a lot of people are really skeptical
about why Apple decides to keep all that
cash you not do something about it it
seems that no financially that's not
really a nice idea but again they do
have the money to buy everybody and then
we have Microsoft buying skype for crazy
amounts and not Apple you
that's the kind of weird part well
address it for the cool let's continue
on with it not so cool apple just got a
dose of their own medicine because they
lost the lawsuit against nokia they have
to pay a lot of money to nokia for
certain patterns that apple used on the
iphone now that we're happy about it you
know its first of all why do you guys
see each other but again Apple this is
just a show you should stop suing
everybody I mean these people eventually
will come back to you bite you and win
apples back to school sale is already in
and well it's the lamest one ever in the
past if you bought a mac you got a
discounted price and you also did get a
free ipod touch for a value of two
hundred thirty bucks which is really
good but currently all you get is a
hundred dollar gift card to the App
Store now the question is I mean what's
up with that it's a 232 100 I mean
doesn't really match I mean what's wrong
Apple you're making lots of money and
you're giving people crazy ugly
giveaways I mean now remember that we
talked about the fact that Apple may be
ditching the ipod touch so again
remember that I told you I talked about
that in the not-so-cool section well it
could be that that's the reason why
we're not getting it so let's see what
happens in the fall now apple's WWDC
event was sadly not all about innovation
did any of you know that a developer
called greg hughes at some point
submitted an app called Wi-Fi sync to
enable you to sync wirelessly to itunes
and well the app got rejected now the
weird thing is that apple just released
a service called Wi-Fi sync hmm strong
resemblance and wait it does exactly the
same thing it syncs over Wi-Fi to iTunes
and wait a second apple also use the
same icon that the developer that
submitted the app used and they rejected
his app and they're not paying them any
money I mean what's up with that Apple
that's terrible terrible terrible
anyways that's it for today's show thank
you very much for watching I'm Hyneman
ivetta remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now
hmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
