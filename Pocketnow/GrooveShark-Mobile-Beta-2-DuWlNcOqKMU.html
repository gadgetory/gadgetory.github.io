pocket calm and today i'm going to show
you a neat little program they'll allow
you to stream music directly to your
windows mole device and the program is
actually called a grooveshark mobile and
this is brought to us by xda-developers
so we're actually going to this program
right now and it's pretty cool because
it will stream directly over your data
network so you can either use your cell
phone data network or you can use your
Wi-Fi network whichever is easiest and
most available at the time so so we in
search for pretty much any song or any
artist so I'm just going to search for
the Beatles right now we'll go into that
see here we can either click enter or
you can also click the little search the
magnifying glass and that will also
bring up results and here we have a
result so as you can see we have four
songs that came up of course you can
always specify which song you like if
you type in the name of the song more
results will actually kept well more
specific results will actually come up
for that song so I'm just going to
actually click on this first one and as
you can see it loaded down here and all
we have to do is hit play it will start
streaming directly through either our
cell phone down network or through our
Wi-Fi right now I'm connected to an evdo
network through sprint so as you can
hear it actually works pretty well and
surprisingly quite clear of course we do
have full reception and there is a cell
phone tower right outside my door so
alright I'll just pause it there and as
you can see it does work quite well
going to the about information here and
it's created by niles on at XDA and this
is 2009 so this is the alpha 2 of
grooveshark mobile and i will post a
link impugned out at comments how to get
this in the program is of course is free
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
