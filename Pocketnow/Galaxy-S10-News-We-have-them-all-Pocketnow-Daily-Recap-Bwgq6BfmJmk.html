his Apple pencil and I'm the kind of guy
who's trying to understand this joke
deal gets a 10 out of 10 on his editing
and we clearly know who chose the script
this week if you're reading this have a
great day because you're watching a high
memory about a video my god
thank you guys so much for the support
that's right it's that time of the week
I am Haim editing that out this is
PocketNow and this is the market now
daily recap your comments for last week
so on Monday the topic was a rumor of a
possible Samsung Galaxy 10x which we
heard will have something crazy like 12
gigs of RAM and now we're even hearing
as of this week one terabyte of storage
possibly I asked you how much would you
be willing to pay we had 400 won
comments will never pay $1000 for any
phone even if it had one terabyte of
storage and 30 gigs of RAM just wait a
few months and then it'll be cheaper
apply that to pretty much anything new
in life just wait and buy it cheaper
later
guilty as charged I do that with
Nintendo games I wait it out because
seriously it's just there are certain
things that are just too expensive and I
consider that for phones particularly
but then you've got brands who do not
ever discount their products or will
give you a $50 discount like Apple for
example consumers need to show that
they're fed up and stop paying over
$1000 don't let companies control your
wallet yes Shawn you have got the point
right there I am so happy I have to be
honest I'm happy with what's happening
with the decline in sales from Apple not
because I'm happy that it's happening to
Apple it's just wow $1000 for a phone
people went crazy over the iPhone 10 and
then they bought it and they realized
wow I paid so much money for a phone
that's not worth upgrading the next year
and that's exactly what happened I'm not
in the market for a Samsung phone but
those specs I would pay $800 for the
normal variant I wouldn't pay over 650
phones are not worth the price they're
asking now exactly I feel that $650 was
the sweet spot like $200 was a two-year
contract or 650 that was fine that was
like okay it's not a computer a tablet
obviously doesn't have all the
functionality to find 650 that's okay
but not more than that doesn't matter
how much storage then on Tuesday the
topic was the Infinity Oh display and
some pens that would allow it extra
functionality like that ring
notification light around the camera I
asked you what you thought about that we
had 351 comments notification white
circle is a great idea it would look
cool when you get a halo circle flashing
on the black OLED exactly I feel that
it's a cool idea I hope that it actually
does happen I don't think I need a
notification light I'd rather the hole
to be as small as possible true I just
don't think that that's possible and so
what they're doing is actually just
figuring out a way to do something with
those pixels so I'm glad that they're
coming out with a neat solution if
Samsung has figured out a way to display
icons in the Infinity Oak cutout why not
use that space to fill the screen when
the splaying pictures or video dude
these are pixels they could use whatever
they want those pixels for so don't
think that it's just gonna be for that
then on Wednesday the topic was LG and
rumors well their invitation pretty much
says that they're gonna show us a new
user interface that looks more like air
gestures I asked you what do you think
we had 289 comments maybe LG is bringing
the air gestures like that Iron Man
movie ifs Tony Stark is helping them
whatever man I it's just we've already
seen it it already failed it's pointless
gestures done right by LG would be great
they've done it with audio why not
gestures next I'm game you know what the
problem with LG is things like the
camera for example their cameras were
great for 2014 and then they remain that
way until 2019 so I think that they need
to focus on things that consumers
actually care about LG has always been
the underdog could be interesting to see
some innovation from LG we have seen
innovation from the company starting
with photography and just the flexing
design which would auto heal itself the
company has been in charge of a ton of
things at audio indeed with the quad DAC
etc but there's there are other things
that consumers actually care about do
you even remember manual controls on
photography which way believe was a
first on the g4 a lot of these things
began with LG the problem is the company
doesn't you know take them further
and then Thursday the topic was the
Galaxy S 10 again and a possible price
tag the rumors were around $1,600 I
asked you what you thought we had 495
comments my head snapped back when he
said $1600 anyone have tylenol
extra-strength dude you're gonna need
morphine for that like six No like come
on man like that is the base that's not
even the that's not even the base price
for a macbook pro need to stop buying
expensive phones they eventually will
drop the price exactly I thought that
Apple was gonna do that they didn't I
hope Samsung doesn't continue following
ship it doesn't matter what added
functionality they provide it's still a
phone
Samson should learn from what happened
to Apple you know they should learn from
what happened to them with the Galaxy s5
they've already been through this they
priced that phone a higher just because
it had water resistance and a few other
things air gestures included people did
not care it's old terribly when compared
to the Galaxy s4 so why go back to that
and speaking of gimmicks on Friday the
whole topic was a possible power share
feature that might come to the Galaxy S
10 as in one of the teasers and I asked
you if you'd cared and we had 390
comments I think the reverse wireless
charging feature is okay for SmartWatch
users on the go or even some accessories
but phone to phone charge is slow and
obviously will drain more battery on the
source device not for me oh man exactly
like I do love the Huawei make 20 pro
but that reverse charging is actually
not great and then again I hate carrying
separate chargers for smartwatches so
yeah that's actually a good idea I don't
care if it's a gimmick or not it's still
come in handy in some emergency cases
there's always room for improvement so I
am always open for innovations
the problem is when those
implementations are not done right again
the main 20 Pro came up with the idea
but the implementation is not good in my
opinion these gimmicks are good selling
points but in the end aren't very useful
another example was an emojis by Apple
that's selling feature and fun to mess
around with for the first couple of days
but in the end completely and literally
useless
true that but again it was a problem of
implementation like for example in the
case of an emojis you could only use
them within the messages app and you
could only record a specific amount at
time you had to pre-record and then send
them it's just again the idea wasn't bad
the implementation was a terrible one
and I feel that that's the same case
here that's it for the bargain out daily
