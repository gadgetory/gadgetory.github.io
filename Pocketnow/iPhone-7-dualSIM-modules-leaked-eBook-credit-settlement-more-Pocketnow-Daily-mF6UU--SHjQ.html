a dual-sim version of the iPhone 7
the reason debacle between courts and
ebook publishers seems to finally come
to an end and Monday deals just got
really hot if you're in the market for
smartphone I'm Jaime Rivera and what is
the current temperature where you're at
it's kind of a thirty-five Celsius here
and it's crazy but this is PocketNow
daily
the official news today began with deal
is one of our favorite smartphones even
though not a flagship as the Google
Nexus 5x and if you're in the market for
one of these right now well it seems the
father Day deals haven't ended $269
currently on eBay and you know how those
deals work so don't think about it twice
mix to the description another one of
our favorite smartphones of the year
because of its design and its take on
software is definitely the next bit
Robin if you wanted to get that $299
deal that was only available for the US
and India that currently got extended on
the next bit website for pretty much
every country where the company ships
and there is no date as to when that
will end so if you're in the market for
one of these which I highly recommends
you should follow the link in the
description as well and those of you in
the market for a surface pro clone we
saw the huawei mate book back at MWC
2016 now the company held an event in
New York City showing us the device off
in the United States you can pre-order
it starting today ending on July 11th
and the price tags range between 699
bucks and $1,200 which is not
necessarily bad but we cannot wait to
bring you more information on our review
and if you've bought ebooks between the
year 2010 and 2012 and you can learn
more on the specific dates in the
description well the settlement between
courts and publishers starting with
apples iBooks are actually over
apparently within this week those of you
that bought ebooks during that period
will get up to seven dollars in the case
of those books that were in the New York
Times bestsellers and then in the case
of other books it's up to a dollar fifty
which is not necessarily better you get
credit over all these books that you
purchased it's a four hundred fifty
million dollar settlement for these
companies trying to fix prices back in
the day so lovely to see this can't wait
to hear of those of you that get those
benefits because I don't remember what
books I bought during those times and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with some recent leaks of the iPhone
7 parts apparently we get some
confirmations and some sort of
polarizing others starting with the fact
that the dual camera module is here
great we get to see it in leaked parts
but we also notice that this eye
comes with a headphone jack so it's a
possibility that this is the seven plus
and probably that phone includes a
headphone jack apparently but other very
interesting leaks show us a dual SIM
module a first ever for an Apple product
but it makes a lot of sense Apple wants
to make it a big deal over how important
the Chinese market is and in China dual
SIM is the way to go but it leads me to
the question of today how important is
it for you to buy a dual sim smartphone
do you prefer these or a regular one
because in my case I actually prefer to
carry two phones because I could just
drain the battery on one have another
one available or some other cases but
