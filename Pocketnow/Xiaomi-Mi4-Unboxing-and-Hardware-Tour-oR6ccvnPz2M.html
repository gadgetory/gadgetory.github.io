manufacturer in the world has announced
a new very high-end smartphone than
before I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is our unboxing of
the Xiaomi me--for before we get started
we'd like to thank our friends at 28th
mobile for lending us the Xiaomi me for
for a view if you'd like a me for to
call your own simply click the link in
the description below or go to 28 mobile
comm where you can also find dozens of
other smartphones for purchase so before
a few weeks ago my experience with
Xiaomi was practically nothing
I had read of them and of course heard
of them when Hugo Barra of Google went
to Xiaomi to help expand the company
internationally but the company it's
actually doing some pretty big things
especially of late last week it was
named the fifth largest smartphone
manufacturer in the world which kind of
took me by surprise maybe a lot of other
people but this is the company's brand
new handset the me for so the fourth
generation of its me handsets and this
one in particular has gotten a lot of
flack well the company actually has for
the way it is said to take a lot of
inspiration from Apple but this device
in particular once we get out of the box
you'll see what I mean definitely takes
a lot of inspiration from the design of
the newest iPhone the iPhone 5s or five
but without any delay let's get inside
the box and see what this is about of
course this is the 16 gigabyte version
this comes in two different versions 16
and 64 and eventually it'll come in a
lot of different color options but right
now it's just white so there's that and
also on the inside you're getting a lot
of of the same specifications you're
gonna find on many other flagships this
year inside it has a Snapdragon 801
that's with Krait 400 CPUs clocked at
2.5 gigahertz it also has 3 gigabytes of
RAM which a lot of other phones don't
have now you've got your g3 which does
and a few others that do but like the
One m8 and galaxy s5 do not
this also has a 13 megapixel camera but
we're gonna set it to the side while I
continue to talk about specs it s it has
a 5-inch 1080p display that's IPS LCD so
very similar to what you're going to
find on other high-end flagships of
course in this packaging we have a micro
USB cable of course and this is our
standard power block and it's actually
for the US so I did not expect that and
reading materials and I think that's it
there so no headphones in this which is
pretty standard especially when you get
a phone from Xiaomi because they
actually sell the phones at or near
production cost which is unlike most
others that make their money through
selling applications on that
applications themes and wallpapers and
icon packs and little aftermarket things
like that nothing major in here but you
do get a sim removal tool which is
really nice and I'm gonna take that out
and save it for later but that's it in
the box nothing terribly fancy you get a
very stark packaging very plain things
inside the box but the phone itself
feels really nice it's actually actually
kind of hefty the primary thing that
you're going to notice about its
built-in design is actually that the rim
is stainless steel and actually the
whole core of the phone is a machine
stainless steel still if you go to their
website it shows you the entire process
of how they make this and it feels
really nice and it feels actually kind
of iPhone quality feels a little bit
like an iPhone on the hand - the slick
plastic on the back which is something
I'm not particularly fond of but if we
tear this off its not gonna make any
noise I'm not even gonna try tear this
off and take some plastics off the back
I need to get this IMEI and everything
off so you guys don't see it so if you
do a quick Hardware tour here at the top
we've got the earpiece speaker and of
course some sensors this is your
front-facing camera do not remember the
resolution of this camera of course the
rear one is 13 megapixels and you do
have a tiny little LED flash down here
you have capacitive navigation buttons
which is back home and menu this is your
sim port here along the left edge
nothing else there your machine drilled
holes for your speaker grille micro USB
port power and volume rocker and along
the top you've got a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack as well as an IR blaster
and around back again camera and some
nice shiny me branding other than that
this thing is pretty basic your battery
is a 30 50 million power battery and
again Snapdragon 801 13 megapixel camera
three gigs of RAM and a 5-inch 1080p
display and you'll notice that the
bezels are very very small on this I'm
going to turn on the display here and
while I do I'm gonna pull up the One m8
so you can see just how it compares in
size it's shorter of course because it
doesn't have those front-facing speakers
but it's it's very slim and the bezels
are just tiny and maybe I can get the g3
here I have it as well you can see it's
bezels actually look slimmer than the g3
s which is saying something because
that's a very very minimal bezel phone
and you can see those are very very slim
bezels but this does come with me UI and
actually I'm not sure if it's actually
loaded on here to begin with the newest
me UI which is new UI six I believe it
said to come out the 14th of this month
this one I'm not sure we can actually
jump into settings and see if this is
actually the newest one which new UI
version I can't tell but the display
actually really quickly looks very very
nice it's very vibrant very poppy and so
far this is really nice I like it it's a
very sturdy phone and best of all
because Xiaomi does sell their phones at
or near cost this thing is not gonna
cost a whole lot of money four hundred
and fifty nine dollars so that is
significantly lower than other flagships
stay tuned for more Xiaomi me for
coverage over the next week or two and
until next time
