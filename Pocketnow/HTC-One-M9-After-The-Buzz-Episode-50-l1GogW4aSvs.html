over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it
let's take another look at the phone
that almost killed HTC I'm Michael
Fisher this is the HTC One m9 and this
is episode 50 of after the buzz okay
maybe that's a little hyperbolic but not
by much after the revolutionary design
shift of the original HTC one and it's
excellent sequel to one m8 people were
expecting a lot out of the one m9 and
instead HTC delivered an iterative
sequel with an almost identical design
for the same lofty price just as its
rival Samsung launched the most
appealing Galaxy S in years the result
was a sales slump that lasted until the
release of the radically different one a
nine this fall if you don't like the a9
s derivative design or its thinned-out
spec sheet the one m9 is still for sale
and all its high points remain intact
picking up the phone still feels like
picking up an expensive and exclusive
item like a limited edition handset from
a fashion house or something you'd see
in a very rich person's suit pocket or
handbag other good-looking phones have
debuted since the m9 but the one m9 is
so gorgeous and has such presence in the
hand that you forgive even the drawbacks
that come with that the sharp edges that
chafe against the palm and the grabby
seams that pull on the hair above your
ear in many respects this phone is aged
quite well since March while much of the
competition now offers front firing
speakers none of those funds have the
depth and richness of the m9 s boom
sound drivers quality that makes you
actually want to take calls on the
speakerphone and crank up the volume on
your game
the Snapdragon 810 processor driving
those games runs as well as it ever did
which is to say way better than we
expected given all the sky is falling
coverage on the chips overheating issues
some games trip up at times but HTC's
software seldom if ever stumbles even
though our review unit is still running
Android lollipop and not the forthcoming
marshmallow update
speaking of we'll be covering that
update with another feature as soon as
our m9 receives it blinkfeed is still a
good way to get all your social and news
updates in one place the theme store
still lets you change the look and feel
the software to suit your particular
tastes and the little conveniences that
we've come to appreciate remain like the
location-based mealtime suggestions on
the lockscreen HTC Sense is one of our
favorite Android skins for a reason it
blends the zipi responsiveness of
Google's stock software with imaginative
and smart features like HTC Zoe and dot
view yeah dot view requires an accessory
but it's so cool it's worth it and do I
mind that the display is 1080p and not
quad HD nope not even a little
now where the m9s strengths have been
reinforced over time so to have its
failings been compounded as usual the
more apps you download over time the
bigger the power drain you're going to
see through wakelock issues and so forth
and even with a moderate app load I'm
finding it tough to make it through a
full day of heavy use
judging from the endurance the a nine
manages on a smaller battery pack this
is something Android marshmallow will
likely help a lot with and then of
course there's the big one the camera
has gotten several updates over time but
it remains pretty lackluster it doesn't
mean you can't get good shots out of it
we've pulled our m9 out of mothballs
several times this year and have managed
some really nice photos both in the
conventional sense
and using HTC's very cool filters in
effect but when you put the m9 photos
and video alongside say the Nexus 6p s
you start to see where HTC suffers
particularly in settings with uneven
incident lighting generally it's much
harder to get a good shot from the one
m9 than with other smartphone cameras in
its class and that goes for both
automatic and manual settings on the
front side while the added light
gathering abilities of the ultra pixel
sensor are nice to have the color
reproduction is terrible and sharpness
is too now if 90% of your photos and
video go to social media and you don't
spend a lot of time shooting in
low-light you'll do fine with this
camera after only about two minutes of
playing with filters in Instagram I
ended up with a beautiful shot from the
one m9 and I'm hardly alone in that but
that's a big compromise to ask of a
smartphone that still costs this much in
the end it's cost that will determine
whether you should still think about
buying the one m9 as we close out the
year at its full retail price of $649
it's definitely a no-go you can get a
nexus 6p with a better camera
fingerprint scanner and faster Android
updates for a hundred and fifty dollars
less or HTC's newer one a nine for the
same price or if you're really
penny-pinching you can get a oneplus X
with just as beautiful and industrial
design for just $249 it's that kind of
aggressive
tician that makes it surprising that HTC
continues to charge what it does for
this device but the usual ebay and
amazon routes offer lower prices and if
you do want to get it directly from HTC
comm the company's been running some
incredible sales this season the most
recent one offered 40% off the phone at
389 well the one m9 becomes much more
compelling and one more time it's only
going to get better once the marshmallow
update lands so if you or someone on
your gift list once a smartphone that
places exquisite design above all else
and you can find the m9 on sale it
should definitely be on your shortlist
otherwise you're probably better off
going with an alternative or waiting for
the next HTC flagship to see what we
thought about the HTC One a9 check out

pocketnow.com and if you've had the one
m9 for a while we want to hear about it
