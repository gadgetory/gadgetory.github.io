smartphone for verizon wireless and it's
also the first Samsung built windows
phone 8 device for the United States but
it's not the first at Eve branded device
that honor belongs to the achieve s
which we reviewed last month so let's
see how they stack up I'm Michael Fisher
this is pocket now and this is Samsung
at Eve Odyssey vs samsung at Eve s okay
so in this quick look we're going to
compare these devices in four areas
build specs camera and general
performance will have a full review on
this device shortly so make sure to
subscribe and follow us at the links in
the description so you don't miss it it
will be epic or at least as epic as a
mid-range device review can be that's
right despite its lofty name the odyssey
is a mid-tier device and you can tell
that just by looking at it not that it
looks cheap but it's obviously not
striving to be the thinnest or prettiest
of the bunch at 11.1 millimeters it's
pretty chunky next to the ax t veces
eight point seven millimeters but it's
also 10 grams lighter at 125 grams at
the same time it's got a much smaller
footprint than the achieve s a much more
rounded shape and a much less outspoken
aesthetic design with it's more
understated back cover all this combines
to make the achieve odyssey feel a
little more toilet than its premium
sibling which isn't a surprise
considering its fifty dollar price on
contract the smaller size will appeal to
those tired of jumbo phones though and
that reduced footprint is thanks to a
smaller 4-inch display which brings us
into specs the Super AMOLED display the
odyssey is nothing to get excited about
resolution wise with its 480 x 800
display at 233 ppi and especially
sitting next to the ax t VES is big
beautiful 4.8 inch 720p Super AMOLED at
306 PPI the Odysseys colors pop and the
blacks are deep as you might expect but
the pixels are painfully visible to our
eyes even more so than on other
mid-range devices color is also way off
with crimson appearing much more
magenta on the Odyssey in all the
display is pretty disappointing next to
the achieve ass but this being a Windows
Phone some differences are only skin
deep the processor driving the Odyssey
is the same 1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 plus as in the atty of s
backed up by the same gig of ram
performance benchmarks were similar
using the benchmarking utility WP bench
with the odyssey scoring an average of
two 42 the achieve esas 237 in addition
each device offers microSD expansion up
to 64 gigs and a removable battery
though the onboard memory on the Odyssey
is 8 gigs to the achieve s is 16 and the
battery capacity is 2100 milliamp hours
to the achieve SS 2300 will have full
battery performance figures on our full
review also taking a step down in specs
is the odyssey's camera which comes in
at five megapixels to the ax t veces 8
megapixels the photos look worse on the
odyssey's inferior display but once you
get them off the phone it's remarkable
how similar they are to the achieve esas
results the reduced resolution is
apparent but the color balance and
saturation and temperature are very
close and at first glance these results
look quite nice for stills the odyssey
seems to offer one of the better
mid-range phone cameras we've played
with especially if you don't need the
marginal resolution improvements that
the achieve s is larger sensor provides
video is ok as well see our dedicated
sample video for that but neither of
these devices is going to win any prizes
for audio recording finally if you're
not familiar with Windows Phone you
might not be aware that performance
between different devices running the
platform tends to be very close if not
identical regardless of hardware and
that holds true here with a very fluid
UI experience in the home screen in the
app list and in the multitasking screen
which should be empty because we will
just do a quick app launch comparison on
each device we should be very close to
identical after a fresh boot here one
two three on messaging messaging launch
identical one two three on email
once again the same result and in the
browser were on the same Wi-Fi hotspot
so we're not comparing speed here we are
just comparing rendering speed and
ability and as you can see the page as
some gaps in it as we scroll while the
page is still loading once the loading
process completes that smooths up just a
little bit let's do double tap to zoom
in on a column there that goes once
again I'll to see on the left s on the
right double tap to zoom out double tap
to zoom in and we'll do just a little
pinch test very very similar as far as
rear ndering things get less pixelated
and I've accidentally tapped on a link
difficult to run two phones at the same
time even for Captain two phones and to
close out our app launch comparison
we'll just hop into to third-party apps
for starting with row e Twitter app
loading the timeline there we go the
odyssey beating the ax t vas by a few
seconds there might be a result of data
but nothing that's going to ruin your
productivity workflow all day and the
popular third-party note-taking app
Evernote loading for the first time and
there it is finally let's belabor the
point with a somewhat taxing flight
simulator rise of glory you can see that
with the same CPU and RAM under the hood
the Odyssey delivers very very nice
performance in fact it is identical
performance to every other Windows Phone
device and my performance is identical
as well the ativa Odyssey and the ax t
vas are very different products for very
different kinds of customers in some
ways like the build the display and the
camera resolution that disparity is very
apparent in others like the processor
storage options performance and camera
quality there's really not much
difference at all if you're looking for
a samsung windows phone 8 device right
now your buying decision might
ultimately come down to which device is
available where you live the atif
Odyssey if you're in the United States
and in a verizon wireless coverage area
and the achieve s everywhere else at
least for now
everyone we're gonna have a lot more
coverage on the achieve odyssey
including a full review coming very soon
stay tuned to pocket now for that follow
us in the links at the description throw
us a thumbs up if you liked the video
and thanks for watching we'll see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
