sexualisation for the galaxy note 7 mess
in a few days that quarter confirms it
will continue to make more modern luxury
smartwatches and could be that we
finally get nougat on existing Samsung
Galaxy flagships I'm hi meri behna and
this is a Friday unlike any other so
even more excuse to go get a drink this
is pocket out daily the official is
today begin with deals if you want to
buy yourself a new iphone why not just
get to the Spy has got this really cool
deal where they're offering an iphone s
ii whenever you buy an iphone 7 iphone 7
plus this is only on sprint though and
its wealth applies last so i would
suggest you move quick for those of you
that have had to deal with the no
service sign and the fact that you can't
make your web searches google has come
up with a nifty new solution where if
you've got no signal you will be able to
still make the search and you will get a
response whenever the phone gets
connected again it'll do it
automatically without the need of you
pulling the phone out so this is a
really cool feature that should be
rolling out to android devices over the
next few days some of the spotlight over
the tag heuer the company has made a
really interesting offering for android
where the only problem is it was a
little too late for its time it was
really expensive and it didn't have all
the hardware to support the new android
to auto updates now the company has
confirmed that we will be getting a new
SmartWatch with all the features needed
gps connectivity etc you can learn more
about on oil description we still don't
have any base though i'll talk about
samsung i believe this is the first time
in history that the company has pushed
out an update to existing galaxy black
ships before its next flagship gets
announced as of today the company has
waited official you could get android 70
new good for the galaxy s7 yahtzee s of
an edge and obviously we know that it's
going to take a little time for US
carriers to pick up on that pony but to
finally it seems to the company a year
later has done something right not a
year later we get deployed and quietly
the very hot news did they have to do
with samson again and the galaxy no 7
explosive new should we say the company
has confirmed that it will be
live-streaming the reasons why this
phone exploded it should happen either
on the twenty-third
you're in Asia or the twenty-second of
year and the Americas or part of Europe
the company is going to come clean over
the reasons why the batteries exploded
design etc obviously we can't really
tell what we're getting here what we do
know is the company has an amazing job
at recalling the phone and leaving us
with anything but expectations over the
future of the Galaxy Note lineup but it
leads me to the question of as a what do
you think was the cost of the galaxy
note 7 explosions obviously it will be
announced in a few days officially but
what do you think was the cause in my
case I feel the Samsung rushed that is
my opinion leave us a comment down below
