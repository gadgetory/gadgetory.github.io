won't want to do is break your new
Galaxy S 9 Apple is planning to release
its so-called budget-friendly Mac along
with a new iPad at WWDC or later an
honor is all about u.s. launches with
the new view 10 making an official
appearance I'm Jaime Rivera and in
positive news today only one phone with
a notch will be talked about today this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals if you're not
tired of those can you hear me now guy
ads from Sprint they continue but now
because there is this new unlimited
unlimited or ultimate unlimited plan
from the company and you can learn more
details about all the perks that you're
getting probably one of the most
important ones is the fact that you get
free Hulu which is pretty much eight
bucks in addition to also more hotspot
again learn more in the description
other official news have to do with
honor as we've been really looking
forward to the company's new launches
this year particularly the honor of you
10 which is pretty much the honor
well the huawei made 10 Pro but in
another chassis we've talking the same
care 970 processor Edition cameras and
everything it's pretty much the same
performance but in a budget-friendly
manner
the product goes live in the United
States today and you can expect our
coverage on this phone coming very soon
and as for that only phone that we're
gonna talk about that includes a knotch
it is coming from Oppo the company is
teasing a new Oppo f7 device that
apparently is going to be the selfie
King because of the camera technology
which is what justifies the notch and
addition to other features
specifications are actually not that bad
you can learn more about them in the
description it's been a long time since
we've seen Oppo really change things up
a bit let's see what we get in the end
that was what the spotlight over to
Apple we've been covering some rumors of
the company bringing a budget-friendly
iPad in a budget-friendly MacBook over
the next couple of months we were
talking march/april but now according to
sources it's gonna happen until after
WWDC it seems that the new MacBook is
going to be less than a thousand bucks
bringing a Retina display and all the
bells and whistles of the MacBook just
at a better price tag and then in the
case of the iPad we're still waiting to
see exactly what
is coming here that's new we'll keep you
posted as soon as we learn more and
finally the most interesting news today
I have to do with the samsung galaxy as
nine and two separate reports that have
to do with tear downs and just breaking
that thing apart on one hand we've got
Zack my buddy from Derry wearing
everything he showed us that the
durability on this phone is great and
that's awesome most interesting once he
got his tear down and then another
official tear downs that we've seen we
noticed a couple of things the first one
is that most of the components from the
Galaxy s8 when it comes to for example
like the iris scanner in addition to
other sensors are pretty much the same
in the galaxy as 9 that's one thing the
second thing is you really don't want to
break that phone apparently replacing
that display is going to be insanely
difficult apparently a lot of it has to
do with the new design of the battery
placement etc which is interesting but
it leads me to the question today do you
use your would you use your new Galaxy S
9 without a case is that the way you're
gonna roll with it in my case I've been
using it without a case for a bit I
already dropped it it was bad so protect
your phone leave us a comment down below

gonna do friends again if you want to
get the news early or follow was I'm

daily up here in our view of the samsung
