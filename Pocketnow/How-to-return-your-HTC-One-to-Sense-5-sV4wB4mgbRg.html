software on your HTC one and you're not
completely satisfied I'm Taylor Martin
this is it now and this is how you
return your HTC one back to the stock
software we've talked about the reasons
why you should give the Google Play
edition software it run on your HTC One
and there are some great reasons like
the ability to run pure unadulterated
stock Android on some of the best
hardware Android has ever seen or simply
because you can and it's worth trying
firsthand but say you tried it and you
aren't a fan the stock software does
come at the expense of infrared HTC's
great camera software and many more
features so how do you get those
features back how do you return your one
two cents it's actually very simple if
you had no trouble getting the Google
Play edition ROM on your one you'll have
no trouble going back first and foremost
if you took our advice and created an
Android backup like any responsible
Android mutters should before flashing
the Google Play edition ROM the process
will be seamless and your device can be
returned to the exact state it was in
just days or hours ago when you created
an Android backup what you were doing
was creating an image of the software on
the device at that given time the apps
the app data the home screen
configuration wallpaper etc to return to
that very state reboot the device into
recovery mode this can be done by
plugging your phone into your computer
and opening a terminal window and typing
ADB reboot recovery or powering the
phone down the manual way and holding
the volume down button while you power
it back on use the volume keys to
highlight bootloader and the power
button to select highlight recovery and
select once recovery loads create
another backup if you want a system
image of stock Android else perform a
factory data reset and wipe the cache if
you so wish then highlight and select
backup recovery select recovery and
choose the proper backup image let this
process run its course and when the
phone reboots your phone should look
exactly as it did before you chose to go
to stock Android if however you did not
create a backup you're still in luck the
only problem is that you will have to
manually reinstall and relog into all
applications and set your device up from
scratch head over to the xda-developers
thread and download the flashable rom of
the stock HTC
on firmware linked in the description
below once the download completes move
the file over to your device this can be
done in several ways but the method I
use is through terminal plug the phone
into the computer once again open a
terminal window and type the command adb
push the name of the file forward slash
sdcard forward slash this will take just
over one minute to finish and when it
does type ADB reboot recovery or
manually reboot into recovery one more
time or form a backup of the stock rom
if you so desire perform a factory data
reset wipe the cache partition and
dalvik cache under the advanced sub menu
and select flash zip from sdcard
select choose file from sdcard locate
the zip file and use the power button to
select it confirm the action and let the
flash process run its course when it
completes in the phone reboots
your one should be back to the stocks in
software that's going to do it if you
