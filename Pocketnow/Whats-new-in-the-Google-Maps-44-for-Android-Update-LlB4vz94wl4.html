google just released a new version of
google maps version 4.4 what's in it
what's been updated let's go look ok
Google Maps is the only app that I know
of that has several icons to get into
various different things that it does
you take a look we've got maps which is
just that that's your Maps it's got
latitude that's your social location
sharing part of Google Maps it's got
navigation which you're all familiar
with by now and it's got this new icon
called places also got shortcuts and
I'll show you a little bit about those
in just a minute let's jump into maps
and see what's new force and foremost
let's go into the about screen and
you'll notice here this is version 4.4
but you'll also notice that this is all
on white it's black text on a white
background this is really a change for
Google because they've been doing a lot
of their stuff with white text on a back
a black background the reason for that
they said is to save battery life and
the screens on these devices chew up
more battery than anything else even
Wi-Fi and the cell phone radios screens
take up a lot of power so they're trying
to do what they can to conserve battery
life then again with the new color
scheme it looks like they're going over
to what people like which is the light
themes so let's take a look I've turned
on some labs here so let me turn those
off you can see I've got a whole bunch
of stuff already turned on in my layers
let me show you how to do this so we go
back into more and you can see labs
these labs are the same things that
we're familiar with you've got a scale
bar that you can add on to your screen
just so you can get a rough idea of what
the scale of that map is you know how
close zoomed in you are it's got this
layers button which is quick access to
be able to turn on and off look various
layers it's got traffic with labels this
one's still a little bit buggy but what
it does is it lets you see the label of
the street through
the traffic indicator so here you can
see this is a green street meaning
traffic slowing really well but you can
still see that this is the San Diego
freeway so that's something that I
really like they've got to work a little
bit on the opacity to make sure that the
traffic data is still visible while
making the street name visible to the my
location button just in case you're
scrolling all around the map to see
what's around you if you want to go back
to where you are really quickly tap that
and it'll take you there i'll go ahead
and turn that on because i kind of like
that feature bubble buttons is a little
bit weirdly named in my opinion what
this does is it changes the way that you
click on things then the bubble that
pops up so it's a little bit more
interactive it adds buttons that you can
call and get directions directly to a
search result right there in that that
pop up bubble very nice very convenient
I like it better than without the lab
turned on last but not least is measure
if you want to find out how far it is
between two points you can turn on
measure I've never had a need for that
if I ever do I'll come in and turn it on
manually but let's go back you can see
here on the map this is where i am and
i'm looking at it in let's see what my
layers mode is traffic and terrain mode
so i kind of like satellite so let's
switch over to that and now you can see
satellite all stuff that you're very
familiar with you can see my icon up
here this is being fed from latitude
which brings me to latitude these are
people that I'm friends with that are
not necessarily around me daniel webster
and george anderson for example nowhere
near me but I've got them on there and
if they're ever around I'll be able to
see where they are it's really nice to
see where your friends are where they're
going so if somebody's in your body you
can grab a quick lunch you can get ahold
of them for example if we want to come
in here you can tap and hold on someone
my wife for example and it brings up all
of their contact information so i can
call go right to their contact text
gmail or even google talk with my wife
right there very convenient and then of
course when they're on the map you'll be
able to see them near you I'll see if
I've got any of my friends nearby and I
do I've got a couple people over here
just off the freeway so I could be able
to call them up and say hey let's go out
for breakfast kind of neat kind of cool
you can see right in it in here let me
scroll in a little bit this is what I
was talking about that that transparency
on the traffic data I can see that this
is Veterans Memorial Highway but because
the traffic data is kind of opaque you
can see through it they still have to
work on a little bit it's a lab hey not
a big deal but let's go back over here
navigation you're familiar with
navigation of course again you've got
the black text on a white background so
that's different you've got a quick icon
over here to take you back to maps
you've got a Settings icon looks like
gears and this lets you customize your
route I don't like holes so we're going
to avoid them speak your destination
type it get it from your contact starred
items this is a biggie if you have some
place that you like to go just tap on
start items and if you start it before
it's in there this is favorites taken
across every single thing on the phone
and its really really convenient down at
the bottom of the screen you've got
recent destinations places that you have
searched for recently Maria very easy
come back over here i already showed you
a latitude that's just a quick shortcut
into it and i want to save this place is
just for a minute to show you something
that you probably don't know about and
that's these shortcuts if i want to go
to save the White House I can make a
shortcut to take me to the White House
and this icon I can customize it if you
look down at the bottom it's got a
little bus on the arrow I don't know if
you can see that see if we get up real
close here and see it so there's a
little bus down there that means that
not only have I put in the address for
this location but I've also told it that
I want to go there using
mass transit now that's not going to
help because there's no mass transit
data in my location as you can see here
transit routing is not available but it
brings me right up here and says do you
want to change this to navigate by car
by bicycle or by walking well let's go
ahead and change it to car choose go now
if I'm in a more metropolitan area
specifically the east coast or west
coast where that mass transit data is
readily available I can still use that
shortcut and it will show me how to get
to that location using mass transit so
it's not a bad thing to have on there
that's just your preferred method to get
there you can see here again going to
the white background we can now show
this location on the map navigate and
the directions to get there are down at
the bottom and see here that these are
toll roads that I have to take so let's
go ahead and navigate there it's going
to fire up the navigation part of google
maps again this is all inside the maps
app and it's going to get driving
directions this time it takes a little
while because I'm navigating to the
White House and I am a good 2,000 miles
away come over here and look at the
route info and see exactly where I need
to go if I don't like this row and I
want to go another way just tap on the
routing icon and I can choose from a
couple of other routes that may this one
for examples about 25 miles longer but
it takes the same amount of time so i
can tap on that and go I 82 I 70 or if I
want to take a little bit longer time on
i-64 I can do that as well something I
didn't know is looking at where I am and
washington DC were about the same
latitude they're kind of fun so now what
everybody's been waiting for let me just
get all the way back is this new places
this is something that's been missing
from google maps for a long time and
it's something that layer and other
augmented reality and other mapping
softwares have been a little bit more up
to date on if you tap on places it will
show you a categorical list of things
near you so if i want to find the
nearest gas station I tap on that it
does a quick search for gas stations and
it shows me right here
distance is whether i started or not
maybe even a picture and customer
reviews of that location so that's
really really nice is very helpful if i
want to go down here to 7-eleven I
believe this is even my favorite
7-eleven where I get most of my caffeine
so good plug there yeah that's Colleen I
see her almost every day I can now see
that on a map I can get directions to it
I can call them right from here and I
don't remember what that last one is oh
that's street view I can see what this
looks like as I'm driving down the
street so I know what to look for so
very nice very intuitive this is a huge
update for google maps something i
really really like about google and
their maps product is the updates that
come out to it but this is the first
time that it's been more than just a bug
release or a very minor feature
iteration this is every bit as big as
when they added navigation to to their
map software I really like it one thing
I'd like them to do so if anybody at
Google is listening I want to be able to
customize these yes i can add a custom
search so if i want to look for say
parking lot the parking lot that's
spelled with an O these days and not a
you guys try typing on camera it's not
as easy as you might think so if I want
to look for parking lot I can add that
and now down at the bottom I've got
parking lots and it will do a search for
parking lot it's just a really quick
shortcut to things that you search for
frequently what I don't like is I can't
customize these icons and I can't get
rid of it I don't drink so I really
don't have any use for bars but I would
really love to be able to have something
else on here that would replace it so if
I could be able to tap and hold and
remove and replace it with something
else I think that would be a great thing
so Google there's my tip now the last
thing is I promised I'd show you how to
add one of these shortcuts tap and hold
and go down here to shortcuts and you
can choose directions in navigate
shin and put in either an address or a
person's name and get directions to it
here's the method of travel by car by
mass transit etc and the fact that you
want turn-by-turn navigation by default
you can give it a name and then you've
got all these icons to choose from go
ahead and save that and now you've got a
new icon right there which I've done for
home I've got a shortcut on my home
screen that I can tap that will take me
back to my house so if I've ended up
somewhere where I am or I don't know the
fastest way to get back home one touch
navigate and it shows me the quickest
way to get home good work Google keep
polishing I know that you guys had a lot
more in store for us and I think that's
great you guys out there if you like
