now we're still at Aoife tummy still
behind the camera and we are still
checking out new devices and this device
that i have in my hand is not
necessarily new in the news cycle but it
is new to us we have not yet covered the
Nokia Lumia 625 so we thought we would
take a quick gander at it and show you
what it's all about so the 625 is
another in a series of phones that
manufacturers are building which are
large in screen size but not necessarily
large in this on the spec sheet you can
see windows I mean it's a windows phone
you're not going to be surprised by any
other hardware here the dedicated camera
button power stand by volume rocker the
headphone the 5 megapixel camera with
flash nokia branding but the screen is
the big story on this device and it's
not a resolution hound we were trying to
look at the specs before we didn't get
that clear well throw that down in the
description but this is a 4.7 inch
screen and we have not seen a screen
size that large on windows phone or at
least Windows Phone 8 in a little while
the Samsung ativ s neo is at 4.7 7
inches but with this much real estate
you know it's obviously it's not like
the new phablet or anything like that
but this is pretty large and when you
pair it with hardware it's pretty wide
and which does this nice thing and I'm
not sure if the light is going to let us
show it but the the glass just kind of
curves down into the body of the device
and it is just nice and pillowy and
interesting and they're doing the same
thing they did on the 620 nokia is with
this kind of semi-translucent backplate
really hard to see on camera
particularly in this lighting but here's
my lumia 1020 next to it much more
opaque a much warmer yellow next to this
kind of almost alien like yellow and
this is not the only color you get you
can get in right I believe there are
five different colors actually available
for this so there's not a whole lot of
news here but it is definitely new to us
it's always interesting to see
manufacturers try different form factors
different sizes and the 625 is something
we're going to definitely go out of our
way to try and cover
in the weeks ahead we thought you'd give
you a quick look at it and share some of
our enthusiasm for this kind of
interesting not quite middle of the road
not quite high end not really mid-range
device from the windows phone camp once
again I'm Michael Fisher with pocket now
it's still Tony behind the camera we
still have a whole lot to see and the
conclusion of our first day at Aoife
stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
