familiar design a new version of Android
marshmallow starts arriving with a few
fixes an HTC seems to be doing something
right with its new revenue results I'm
hi Mary Mehta and whoever gets the best
joke for Tuesday in the comments down
below will get a lot of likes this is
marking out daily the official news
today begin with google and the android
6 photos one marshmallow for its Nexus
devices the factory image is out there
so it's pretty much available to almost
any new Nexus out there and that bring
some advantages starting with the fact
that this is not really a simple dot 01
update you get new emojis but even
cooler you get a double tap in the power
button to launch the camera that is a
really cool feature obviously the update
will take some time to reach your
phone's other official news come from
HTC even the company was reporting some
terrible years in the past last few
quarters have been rather good for the
company and they've been aggressive
about it with the 189 and other products
that they've launched and now we learn
that the company is actually showing us
the growth of fifty percent in sales
when compared to last month which is a
big deal for this company let's see what
products we get next year and for those
of you that have been in the market for
the Turing phone that particular device
with a crazy cool design and that is
apparently unhackable according to them
well we were waiting for the product to
be launched on December eighteenth for
those of you that pre-ordered and now we
learned that's not going to be the case
barely customers already being told that
they have to wait for some time with in
q1 2016 so the wait could last up to
three months sad news for you and for
those of you rocking a galaxy note5 like
me and eagerly waiting for Android 6
that'll marshmallow for your phone this
is a very interesting development as
people in Hungary are already reporting
that their Galaxy Note fours are
receiving the update now it's really
hard to confirm this is the deal
obviously we will be checking in on this
but it does seem that too Samsung is
playing some sort of change here and
it's common for companies to choose
countries like Poland and stuff launch
updates their test the water see if
they're good before they launch them on
mass markets like the United States but
yeah galaxy note 4 it seems
finally the hot news that they have to
do with Samsung and the Galaxy s7 as we
find some renders of the device from
case makers you know that those are
pretty much very accurate and we learned
two things number one for those will be
waiting for major design changes that is
not going to be the case according to
these renders but even more interesting
we've been covering the possibility of a
galaxy s7 edge plus but it seems that
that won't be the case apparently there
is a galaxy s seven plus and the the
reason why this phone will be different
to something like the note 5 or the
galaxy s6 edge+ is that apparently it's
going to be huge much larger than the
current phablets meaning this looks more
like galaxy mega territory so it does
lead me to the question of the day do
you think there's room for a phablet of
that size and you know the high-end
market you know galaxy s7 that's a six
or six points something inches in a
display would you buy it in my case no
I'm happy with the galaxy note5 but it
was a comment down below we'd love to
know what you think friends as always
you know the drill if you want to get
littles earlier before this video was
filmed make sure you follow us on poking
out comment subscribe to a channel as
well and follow me on Twitter hi mauja
quarter that are on instagram at high
end up a better please give this video
