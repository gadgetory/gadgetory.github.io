probably is for you too which is why I
was very excited when mailbox was
released for the iPhone hey guys it's
Brandon Minuteman from pocketnow.com
I've been using mailbox for about a week
now and I want to let you know how it's
changed the way I use email on my phone
in this video I'm going to review it so
let's get to it
and while this is iPhone only right now
and you can run it on your iPad of
course the company plans on releasing
multiple apps for all different kinds of
platforms including Android and desktop
in the future which this desperately
needs so number one mailbox is just a
great email app it's extremely fast
everything is cached the application
opens quickly and when you get your
conversation view open like this it's
kind of arranged like an SMS
conversation you can tap on the
different parts of the conversation to
see them it's just super fast super
fluid it's got this kind of white
minimalist design to it and it just
looks really good but that's not where
the magic is the magic is that mailbox
treats your inbox as a task list which
makes a lot of sense so if you use this
app you're gonna want to start off by
archiving all of your messages so you
only have new messages show up in your
inbox and then here's where the magic
comes in you decide how you want to
action on each thing there are four
different things you could do so for
example I've got this email with Jaime
right now and I am done with it so I'm
gonna slide it to the right which means
it's going to be archived and thus is
going to show up over here in my
archived list but I can do other things
for example let's say I want to be
reminded about this Mumford &amp;amp; Sons email
later this is really the most important
part I slide over until it becomes
yellow then I get this pop up that says
when do you want to be reminded of this
message and what's going to happen if I
choose tomorrow it will literally leave
my inbox on my phone here and all of my
other devices and then it will be pushed
back into my inbox and go to the top of
my inbox when I set the time for so it's
set for tomorrow and the way the app
works is that you can actually configure
when these things come back so for
example if you go to snoozes I've got
start my day at 8 a.m. so tomorrow at 8
a.m. that email
we'll go back into my inbox really
brilliant idea great way to sort of
arbitrage your email another thing you
can do there are two other actions you
can slide all the way to the left and
you can apply a label and you can set up
these labels in Gmail just a super fast
way to apply labels and one other thing
you can do if you slide to the to the
right and then all the way to the right
it will permanently delete the message
or put it into your trash in your Gmail
so what you get here is your always
arbitrage in your email you're deciding
what should I do with this message what
should I do with this message and so
that the goal at the end of the day is
to have inbox zero so all of your tasks
are complete or they're deferred until
the future in fact if you go if you go
over to mailbox here and you click on
the deferred column here this shows you
the the emails that are going to pop up
in your inbox in the future so what do I
think about mailbox I really like it and
I'm going to stick with it I like that
it's super minimal super fast I like it
better than the Gmail app or the stock
iOS app and I can't wait for it to come
to other platforms I also like this idea
of treating your inbox like a to-do list
you probably do it anyway and I do it
but with mailbox a tick this takes it to
the next level to allow you to defer
messages to a future date so you're
constantly striving for inbox zero where
all of your different items in your task
list essentially are taken care of now
the biggest downside to mailbox is that
number one you have to wait in line
right now you have to wait about a
800,000 person line which might be a few
weeks as they work out server issues to
make sure that it's a smooth experience
and number two it's not available for
any other platform which is a huge shame
for example I use mailbox on my iPhone
and then I use Gmail on my desktop
behind me here and while it works with
Gmail so that the messages do show up in
my inbox later
I cannot defer a message from my gmail
so that it shows up some other time you
can only do it from the phone so it's
this kind of weird experience but I'm
sure in the near future
mailbox will be available on multiple
platforms so that will not be
anyway it's always cool to see
innovations in things that we use a lot
and mailboxes certainly one of them so
you should give it a try if you have an
iPhone or an iPad or wait until the
Android version comes out and hopefully
a Windows Phone version will not be too
