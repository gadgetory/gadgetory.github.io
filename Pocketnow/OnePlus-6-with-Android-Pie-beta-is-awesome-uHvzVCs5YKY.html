phones of the year in fact it might be
my favorite phone ever and I've used
every phone that matters over the last
10 years now oneplus has released open
beta one with Android 9pi for the 1 plus
6 so it makes a great phone even better
in this video I'm gonna show you how to
install it and what it's like to run the
newest version of Android on the 1 plus
6 so let's get to it
oneplus has done some amazing work at
getting speedy about software updates
with the release of Android 9 PI 1 plus
was among the small number of
manufacturers to do a Developer Preview
I used to develop a preview for several
weeks and it was very stable and it had
great performance just to be clear the
open beta is intended for a wider array
of people whereas the Developer Preview
is intended for enthusiasts and
developers that are okay with having
bugs and other problems but like I said
I found the Developer Preview to be
super stable and the open beta is even
better the first thing you have to do is
download the correct file in the
description you'll find links in the
case of this one plus 6 which is running
stock firmware I'm going to download the
rom that goes from stable to open beta
if you're running the Developer Preview
and you want to jump to the open beta
there's a separate file to do that again
links will be in the description next
plugging your phone to your computer
making sure to select file transfer from
the drop-down notification shade on your
phone make sure you have the oneplus
drivers installed link will be in the
description and you can now go to your
pcs Explorer program to access the file
system on the 1 plus 6 transfer the ROM
to the root directory meaning don't put
it in any folder and go as high as you
can in the file structure after that
it's super simple to install the update
go to settings software update then hit
the cog in the upper right corner and
select apply local update you'll see the
file in there let it install and you're
done
oneplus recommends that you factory
reset your oneplus 6 after you install
the update or you wipe it through
the recovery but I actually didn't do
that because I'm stubborn I didn't want
to have to add all my data and apps back
on the phone and you know it worked out
pretty well because none of my data or
apps were deleted your mileage might
vary you might find yourself needing to
do a factory reset to get the phone to
work properly but in my case I didn't
need to everything was there perfectly I
installed the update and then all of my
apps and data were there intact
nice one thing I really like about the
open beta PI update for the one plus six
is that one plus gives you three
navigation options from which to choose
the first one is full screen gestures
which I personally like because it lets
you take advantage of the entire screen
once you learn a few gestures I think
it's very natural very fast and I love
it
the second navigation option is you get
the pixel like pill on the bottom of the
screen which you can tap to go home or
swipe up to access your recent and then
there's a back button on the left and
the third navigation option is for
people that like it old-school and
classic you get the back home and recent
button along the bottom so the choice is
yours
besides that it's pi you get the new
notification shade with the rounded
notifications and quick toggles you get
better organization of the settings and
new smoother animations there's no
digital well-being yet since this is not
a pixel device on top of that you get
the typical oxygen OS stuff like dark
and light themed accent colors
notification slider controls and more
new in the open beta is gaming mode 3.0
which gives you new ways to gain better
also in this build it's scheduled
do-not-disturb which one plus bones have
left for a while but it's good to have
your phone automatically going to do not
disturb when you go to sleep at night
some bugs have been reported such as
Google Play services not working but I
haven't experienced any bugs for me it's
been smooth and stable Google Play
services work perfectly again your
mileage might vary but in my case it
works great so far even with the bugs I
have to praise oneplus for their work
their take on Android pipe is great and
important features like battery life
don't seem affected so far just keep in
mind this is a beta and you're helping
them to improve the product and it might
not be perfect if you have a one plus
six I highly recommend you check out the
open beta it's easy to install and from
my experience it's fast and it's stable
let us know in the comments if you're
going to try
the open beta or if you've already tried
it let us know what you think about it
