of the iphone 6 a google glass teardown
reveals at the fifteen hundred dollar
price tag is kind of crazy and it seems
that you'll be able to get an HTC One m8
in various colors soon I'm hi Mary that
I and hopefully by the time you watch
this video I will be celebrating friday
more than you will this is barking out
daily let's begin today with the
official news as we talked yesterday
about the fact that we have new google
now updates and enhancements but the
company is geared towards allowing you
to do more with google now and it's kind
of complicated currently if you give it
a command like for example turn on Wi-Fi
or turn on bluetooth the phone can but
you still have to interact with the
phone and apparently next frontier for
google now that we should be expecting
very soon as that you will now be able
to do everything voice based but having
to touch the phone but obviously it'll
take some time there are various OEMs
various drivers and i'm sure that it
takes a while for google to figure this
out but it is compelling stay tuned as
we've been able to do this with iOS for
the longest time sorry about HTC as we
get rumors that the company is
considering new colors for their One m8
probably the one I made is probably one
of the most popular phones when it comes
to the design and definitely it has
great numbers when it comes to reviews
but you only get it in three colors and
apparently the company is considering
new colors starting the blue red
difficult ones we've had before but
apparently this time we'll be getting it
in pink for those of you that are
interested in the pink color the phone
should be available in the next couple
of months probably etha as it was last
year which is in September stay tuned
for that that's all about Samsung as if
you thought that HTC was the only
company that was working on a mini
smartphone the company is already
working on their galaxy s5 mini it's
hard to tell exactly what we're getting
with this phone is apparently it will be
a down size 4.5 inch Galaxy s5 but only
in design as the specifications
apparently won't be as good and one of
the biggest questions is will this film
be waterproof just like the galaxy s5
apparently the company is gearing
towards a launch Linux couple of weeks
we don't know any specifics we'll keep
you posted as a the mini has never been
a hot phone anyways now it's all about
apple and specifically the iphone 6 says
there is this video on youtube that
shows you a full dummy built from a 3d
printer showing you exactly what to
expect from the iphone 6 and yes we do
see the side buttons we do see this
phone being pretty
an iphone 5c only bigger and the
interesting thing here is that this is
not the 5.5 inch model this is the 4.7
inch model based on the league
schematics so apparently this design
will be the same for both phones or at
least it seems apparent but then again
one of the biggest concerns is the fact
that there is still a mono speaker and
there are still important design yet so
let's see what we get and finally for
the very revealing news of the day have
you ever asked yourself exactly how much
does it cost to make Google glass as
recent analytics have just predicted
that the company doesn't spend more than
eighty dollars to build it and they're
charging you fifteen hundred dollars to
buy it so yeah there are patents there
are designs there is Rd there is so much
that happened here but apparently google
is only spending any dollars aren't
building google glass which doesn't
really make it compelling in a lot of
people are still questioning if this
product is useful so that leaves you to
the question of the day what do you
think about paying $1,500 for google
glass now links in the description full
details on the cost break up apparently
this even includes assembly in my
particular case I don't plan to spend
fifteen hundred dollars even if the
little spent fifteen hundred dollars to
build it I just don't find it useful
enough but it was a comment down below
what do you think and friends you know
