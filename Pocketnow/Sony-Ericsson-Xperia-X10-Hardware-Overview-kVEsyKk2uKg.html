now calm and you've seen us on boxee x10
you've seen us give you a softer
overview well now it's time to take a
look at the hardware we're gonna go
ahead and take a look at what's on the
outside as well as what's on the inside
and makes it tick let's begin alright
and we're back with the hardware of the
sony ericsson xperia x10 and getting
started on this device as you can see it
is a typical bar style phone with the
4-inch capacitive touchscreen larger
screens are becoming very popular right
now with devices measuring 4 inches and
larger such as the Samsung Galaxy S
model of smartphones as well as the evo
4g in the droid x which both come in at
4.3 inches overall the device weighs
four point eight seven ounces to be
exact and it feels pretty solid in the
hand it's very similar to the sony
xperia x10 mini because that of course
is a mini version of this device as you
see here so let's go ahead and jump
right into the actual hardware of this
device as you can see here we have three
buttons down at the bottom now these
buttons are your typical menu buttons
that you would see on an android device
which once again is very similar to the
xperia x10 mini however these buttons
are actually physical buttons that you
actually push in you'll get these the
feedback from pushing an actual button
as you see here much different than they
capacitive buttons that many of the
android devices are currently utilizing
on their bodies moving over to the right
side of the device we have a dedicated
camera button as you can see here that
always goes a long way having a
dedicated camera button makes snapping a
picture on the go snapping a picture
just in general that much easier to do
moving up a little more forward we have
the volume up and the volume down which
also doubles as a zoom in and zoom out
while using the web browser
functionality so it is a dual purpose
volume rockers you see here typical up
and down the top of the device is going
to have our headphone jack as well as
the power button and then you're going
to have your micro USB port which is
right beneath the actual removable
button here these have a button to
become somewhat phased out as of late
devices like the Samsung Galaxy S
actually employ a slider
mechanism and other devices like the evo
for example do not have a cover here
whatsoever there's have the port open
for easier access the fact that this
does use the micro USB vote does go a
long ways that is becoming Lee standard
for many of the devices especially in
the Android world moving over to the
left side we have a smooth finish here
now the back has a soft touch paint feel
to it which is very nice added someone
grip and some texture while you're
holding the device and of course you're
going to have a camera this camera does
employ an LED flash which does help to
take pictures in low-light environments
although it's not a miracle worker the
camera is an 8.1 megapixel to be exact
it takes very good quality pictures and
that is to be expected with a sony
ericsson device so the camera quality is
typically better than normal as you will
see in our final review and shifting
focus to the bottom of the device you're
actually going to have a little bit of a
treat here it's a lanyard loop as you'll
see there they really haven't been used
as of late but the lanyards were
something that maybe perhaps is still
being used over in Europe other parts of
the world so that people could hold it
on their wrist but this is available to
you if you decide you want to use that
sort of thing now you can actually pop
open the battery cover by using your
nail right in this little lip here and
that will give you access to the back of
the device now as you can see here the
battery is a 1,500 milliamp hour battery
sony does claim an eight-hour talk time
with this fifteen hundred million power
battery on the right side you'll have
your micro SD card slot here the device
will come with a 2 gigabyte card however
it's compatible up to 32 gigabytes the
4-inch capacitive screen of the xperia
x10 utilizes a resolution of 480 x 854
pixels so it does claim at this screen
is scratch resistant a very popular
question to ask about today's devices
are what exactly powers it and makes it
tick in terms of a processor the sony
ericsson xperia x10 uses a snapdragon
one gigahertz processor which is very
run-of-the-mill with current devices
however it does run android 1.6
currently which is somewhat of an
unfortunate slack building on that one
gigahertz processor the Xperia x10 also
has
a total of three hundred and eighty four
megabytes of RAM available to it for
multitasking and running applications
etc lastly all the norms are here you'll
get the assisted GPS or the a GPS
functionality as well as the Bluetooth
Bluetooth 2.0 now the frequency is that
the Xperia x10 will utilize and be able
to run on specifically in America this
is the 18 tiver j'en the device are
going to be 850 and 1900 that's going to
wrap up our coverage of the hardware of
the sony ericsson xperia x10 android
device make sure you stay tuned for our
next video which will be part 2 of our
software overview will actually compare
the sony UI that is utilized here versus
TouchWiz only samsung galaxy s and as
always make sure you stay tuned for our
final review where will actually show
you how we really feel about the device
and show you some examples of the
picture quality that this can take
please leave us a thumbs up and thank
you very much for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
