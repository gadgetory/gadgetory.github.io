and this is our hardware tour of the 18
to fuse from HTC now the front of it
looks a lot like diamond GG family now
we have some very flat buttons here you
can see some icons there a circular
action button each corner leaves is a
button but it's very flattened into cook
feel with your fingers if you're not
looking at the top we have the power
button plasticky and it has an icon on
it on the right side there's pretty much
nothing so for a stylist this is a
magnetic stylist
then right
bhana must be extended HTC USB port mini
USB key that will function as both
charging sync port and audio al as well
as TV out in this case there's your
microphone over here we have some volume
buttons and a push to talk button that's
new on the fuse this is the touch pro
does not have this push to talk button
and it's actually a different material
kind of a rubbery plastic groceries are
shiny plastic on the back we have our
faceted nice looking diamond ish back
gloss black so we get fingerprints all
over it and here's our camera with a LED
flash which is not too great and there's
a speaker grill very tiny HTC logo
and there's your land yard hole and over
the back here's your sim card slot and a
large battery that's great and there's a
microSD card slot over here and we can
fly it open for a keyboard we have a LED
lights there to indicate caps or
function buttons being odds if I turn
function it turns the light on I do
shift it does caps and something you'll
notice that's different from the touch
pro on the fuses keyboard layout we
still have five rows of keys but instead
the numbers being up here all in one row
we have them here in a number pad
fashion now you have to press the
function button to get to the numbers
but it's actually i think a lot easier
to type numbers this way because they're
all in one place i can do everything
with my thumb was up here i would have
to go two thumbs and i'd have to travel
long distance to do these different
numbers
so for me I think that's a better layout
for the numbers and where else is good
from the touch pro better than the touch
pro is we have a start menu we can open
right away I can press keyboard
shortcuts and navigate it that way and
there's also an ok button down here
which means I can close my very easily
without having to touch screen what else
is missing is soft keys I have to go all
the way up here with my thumb to press
that soft key and I have to look at the
screen to do it this one's not so bad
so let's look at how this compares to
some of the other devices out here first
the one that it replaces the tilt also
known as the Kaiser or the time to you
can see it's a little bit shorter
a little bit narrower slightly and just
about the same thickness so slightly
smaller not at but we're missing some
things that we would like to see in the
Kaiser that haven't made it to the tues
we'll talk about those things later
here's the g one g it's a lot shorter
about a little little bit thicker if you
don't count the chin
and a little bit narrower on the width
we have the treo 800w fuse is slightly
shorter Venera the fuse is almost the
same thickness
ok
and then it's
close relative the diamond practically
the same size with the height wise that
is we look at the thickness that fuses
almost twice
almost doubled thickens that's pretty
big
so there's our hardware to refuse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
