48 megapixel camera and be priced
aggressively one more time richer you
said we should expect Huawei's foldable
smartphones to get cheaper in the near
future and we have new patents for
another out fold foldable device from
Samsung I'm Jaime Rivera and you know
Monday's are not necessarily my
favorites but we get a longer day to day
thanks to daylight saving time
this is firing out daily the official
news today begin with deals and records
let's talk about the Galaxy S 10 s 10 e
and s 10 plus you currently have a deal
where you can get up to six months of
spotify premium for free of you buy a
new galaxy there's a catch you have to
not be a Spotify Premium subscriber to
be able to get the deal in other news we
also hear that Samsung broke records in
the United States for pre-orders out of
which 57% of those pre-orders were the
galaxy s 10 plus that was the most
popular device and right it should be
it's a great phone even though I like
the S 10 a lot as well now speaking of
deals those of you in the market for an
iPhone that don't want to pay much it
seems that Apple continues to come up
with iPhone se stock just to be able to
compensate for their lack of sales and
you can clearly get that phone for two
hundred forty nine bucks an apples
clearance website I do like the iPhone
se I just I think that it's kind of
dated right now but still I mean 249
bucks for phone is crazy
now let's talk about Samsung as we've
got some pent information that shows us
what to expect for another galaxy fold I
mean we talked about two other devices
last week but now we finally get images
of what it looks like and the rumors
claims this will most likely be like a
sort of a clamshell phone that flips out
sort of like the mate X even though
samsung criticized this product then
again yes that is a possibility we're
not exactly sure when it'll happen but
again I would love if somebody come up
comes up with a concept that's more
phone and not something that extends
into a tablet and speaking of foldables
Richard you'll always head of mobile was
recently on record and being asked you
know why is the made X so expensive and
what's his forecast for the future and
according to you
the technology is so new and because of
all the hurdles that had to be meant to
be able to achieve the design of the
made X which I actually praise bees like
the price is justified currently the
plan is for Huawei to actually drop this
price even as low as five hundred and
fifty euros there is no timeline but
according to you
he's definitely working on getting that
done before Apple's foldable which might
make it in 2021 thanks for the insight
mr. Yu and finally the hottest Nicias
did i have to do once again with the 1
plus 7 we've seen so many leaks and
renders and these continue to extend
specifications are pretty much what
we've heard before Qualcomm Snapdragon
855 8 or 10 gigs of ram in addition to
good storage of 4 thousand milliamp hour
battery the interesting part is that
we've got some polarizing rumors
claiming that there will be a knotch
even if there is a retractable camera so
it's hard to tell if there will be a
retractable camera or not but even more
interesting as two things one the price
tag 569 bucks for the a gigabyte model
according to rumors and to the fact that
the primary camera will be that 48
megapixel sensor from Sony so think
about this great specifications a 48
megapixel camera and 569 bucks what do
you think about the 1 + 7 if these
conditions are met do you like this
phone or not because my god if they
could finally figure out how to get that
camera to be the best and they've got
the technology with the ISP on the 855
plus the sensor I would say yes but
believe is a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
