to expect for the Samsung Galaxy s8 and
HTC executive puts all the company's
SmartWatch plans to perspective and TCL
begins to tease that the BlackBerry that
we like that CES is coming soon I'm
Jaime Matta Ravenna and call me
nostalgic but I'm actually happy that
blackberry is making that type of a
comeback this is parking out daily the
official news today finally began again
with deals if you are in the market for
the Galaxy s7 or Galaxy s7 edge
obviously we know that the s8 is coming
but this is the time to buy if you want
to go cheap right now at Best Buy you
can get either of these phones with a 32
inch Samsung Smart TV I would not even
weight the galaxy s7 is probably when
our favorite phones of the year so yeah
go for it right over to Google the
company has just teased its Google i/o
event with a crossword puzzle that's
actually not a crossword puzzle but it
was an anagram or a word of grammar you
tell me whatever that thing is in the
comments down below and a couple of
developers actually solved that we
should expect Google i/o on May 17 so
that is when the next version of Android
is coming even if the current
smartphones are barely running it and
how about that if we talked about HTC
and all the rumors of the company's
future Android SmartWatch it turns out
that the company has a just confirmed
that it's actually going to wait it out
we do know that Android wear is not
performing great and even the Apple
watch is not performing on a rise so it
makes all the sense in the world for HTC
not to do its own Android wear
SmartWatch though we do know that it
could be that we might get the Under
Armor watch we will keep you posted as
soon as we learn more and for those of
you diehard blackberry fans all five of
you I am Number six by the way set your
calendars for February 26 s TCL has just
confirmed that we should expect the
company's next BlackBerry to be
announced now bear in mind the company
confirmed that it's not going to be
called the blackberry mercury or at
least that was not the plan but if they
end up calling it the mercury I would be
okay with that li was a comment whatever
name he would
like and we would probably share the
word and finally the very hot news that
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
s8 as we've got very interesting
information on what to expect
number one it seems that there is no
flat variant we've got two sizes ranging
from five to six inches and apparently
both will be a curved infinity display
no bezels or very limited once the
fingerprint scanners actually going to
be at the back and in addition to that
we've got some monster specifications
probably Snapdragon 835 in addition to
whatever gigs of RAM those weren't
mentioned but 64 gigs of expandable
storage as well and if this phone is
actually anything close to what we saw
in the leaks that thing is going to be
gorgeous but it leads me to the question
of the day do you think that this is
what Samsung needs to bring to the
market this fully functional curved
smartphone that's actually going to defy
those of us that don't like curved
displays in my case let's go for it
hopefully they figured out finger palm
rejection or whatever it was a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion branchy to the Wiggles if you
