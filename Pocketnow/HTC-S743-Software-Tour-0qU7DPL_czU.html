pocket now calm and this is the software
tour of the htcs 743 now because the 743
doesn't have a touchscreen HTC couldn't
use touchflo 3d which it's pretty much
including on all of its newer devices
these days so instead the s7 43 has a
modified version of the sliding panel
interface that we saw on non-touchscreen
windows mobile devices so we take
something like the blackjack two here
probably looks familiar to you go down
through the sliding panels you can see
your next appointment you can make a new
appointment if you go down further you
can set up email you can play music
right from your home screen go through
pictures things like that it's a really
fantastic interface but HTC has actually
made it a little bit better with their
own additions and let me show you that
now okay here we are and before I get
started I want you to take note to
something around the d-pad there is a
swirl of light this is actually the
system indicator light as you find on
the touch diamond and a touch pro so if
I have a new message it swirls around in
a circle kind of blinks like it is now
if you're charging it you've just
plugged it in it will feed white from
bottom to the top if you have a full
charge after you plugged it in it will
remain steady so kind of a cool way to
show off various various system
notifications okay so let's get closer
and on the screen and take a look at
these sliding panels so the first one is
the one that we've seen already and the
one that's on all of the phones is the
time now if we go down to the next panel
we can flip to the right and we can see
our upcoming appointments if we go to
the next one this is the standard too we
see no no miss calls no new voicemail
and then if we go down one here's
something that's kind of new and unique
we can see our text messages right on
the screen so i have three text messages
and i can flip back and forth from them
if we go down one here's something
that's all so new we can see the emails
that have fallen into the inbox and you
can read a preview of them right on the
screen and then you can tap on the d-pad
and open it up right on the screen so if
we go down to where we left off here we
have weather and unfortunately we don't
get the weather animations that you get
on touchflo 3d but it is nice to have it
on the home screen and if we tap on the
d-pad it will take us to a five-day
forecast although it's not a very
detailed five-day forecast I must say if
we go down here something that's also
unique you get your internet explorer
favorites right on the home screen which
is kind of cool because if you just want
to really quickly check a website you
can just you know go down to that panel
tap over and check out what's going on
at pocketnow.com mobile all right and
let's go back down and then we've
weather excuse me we have a internet
explorer then we have playoff songs
which is you know if you put in a media
card you can actually play songs right
from your home screen but that's not
anything that is unique and of course we
can change our profile and go to go to
the communications manager and
everything like that so that is the home
screen and something interesting happens
when you open up the keyboard all that's
not terribly interesting you get this
little launcher and the purpose of this
is to allow you to do things that are
related to typing on a keyboard so email
messenger SMS MMS it's kind of silly and
you can turn this off so that you just
see the standard home screen when you
slide out the keyboard okay now I'm just
going to go through a few things that I
wanted to show you that that makes this
device kind of unique so I'm going to go
into the start menu and I'm going to
click all programs and what you'll
notice if you go into all programs is
that there's no scroll bar on the side
so the only way to get to the next panel
or the next pain of programs is to press
more this is not that big of a deal but
I think it's going to confuse some
people that are new to windows mobile
and are wondering are there only nine
programs and know there are a lot more
than nine programs which is kind of
silly but anyway so we have a few
folders here if we go into multimedia we
have the camera album and this may look
familiar if you have an HTC touch pro or
touch diamond this is a really
nice-looking
gallery for non-touchscreen windows
mobile devices it's very similar to that
of their higher end devices and if we
tap on a picture we get it on the screen
if we tap on the d-pad it will go to the
next picture we can zoom in that way and
zoom out it's a very very smooth
implementation of the photo gallery and
I like it a lot I'm going to cover it
fully in the review we've the camera
application which is a for the 3.1
megapixel camera of course we have the
video recorder there so let's go back
and let's go to the next go to
accessories and nothing terribly
interesting here we've connections set
up which will automatically configure
your device whether you're on AT&amp;amp;T or
tmobile or any other GSM carrier it will
choose that for you I didn't really have
to use that it just worked when I put in
my sim card let's go to the next task
manager voice recorder internet sharing
which is cool in case you want to use
the internet connection from your device
on your laptop alright let's go to the
next thing alright and we have an RSS
program and going to the right way voice
commander which is kind of like
Microsoft voice command it's not as good
but allows you to talk to your device
without having to train at first which
is good and i just put skyfire on there
because really it comes with pocket
internet explorer which isn't that good
of a browser so you're gonna wanna get
skyfire or opera mini or something like
that to get a good web browsing
experience now there are a few
interesting things that come over from
from the other HTC devices like the
system volume this is totally new for
the non-touch screen version of windows
mobile this looks just like it does on
the touch diamond and touch pro
something else that looks like it does
on a touch a diamond and touch pro is
the communications managers let me go
down to that here it is really
nice-looking communications managers
that let you quickly turn it off on and
off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and all those
sort of things what I want to cover now
is the phone experience because some
things have changed like the caller ID
picture is bigger when someone calls and
it's really easy to turn on speakerphone
and things like that so let me call my
phone here and show you what it looks
like when somebody
makes a call to your device okay so me
getting us all right now and the picture
is much larger than just usually find an
image mobile devices someone answer them
and what I what I really like about this
is that you can turn on the d-pad add a
call mute the call or look at the
contact by using the d-pad which is kind
of cool it's a good use of the d-pad and
other windows mobile standard devices
you have to dig through the menu to
actually do any of these things but in
this case I can just press up to turn on
the speaker phone so that's it for the
software tour of the htcs 743 there's a
lot that I didn't cover that I'm going
to cover in the full review coming up on
pocketnow.com very soon so be sure to
check that out we're going to talk about
battery life performance and pretty much
everything else you need to know about
this device so that's it for the s7 43</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
