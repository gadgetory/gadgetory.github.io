paco medicom and if you've ever lost
your phone you know how annoying it can
be especially if it's on silent you try
to call it and of course it doesn't rain
so today i'm gonna show you a program
called where's my droid and this is a
free application that you can find on
the android market okay so this is where
you instead of my attention word to text
message my phone it will actually
activate my ringer when the phone is
even on silent so i have it set to
where's my phone i mean it ok and set
the attention word for gps gps my phone
so that will give the exact location of
my android device i'm going to ok so
here I'm instead up the rain when lost
so this will turn on the ringer even if
the phone is on silent and I could have
it play for 30 60 or up to 5 minutes I
can also reset the volume to go back to
silent after I found the phone so if you
see up here my phone is on silent so all
I have to do is text message my phone
and it will start ringing ok so in the
messaging program all i have to do is
type where's my phone and the phone will
begin to ring even though it's on silent
and send and now you can hear the
ringtone so as you see the volume is
actually all the way up so i have to do
is hit calm phone and under one of the
settings it can go all the way back down
ok and to get the exact location of my
phone all i have to do is say gps my
phone and hit send and it will activate
the onboard gps and will give me the
exact coordinates and i'll show you that
in just a second ok so here are the
exact coordinates to my device and all i
have to do is click on here to activate
google maps and i'm just going to select
default program now will search for the
exact GPS coordinates and as you can see
i can zoom in and find out where my
phone is so this is another Android
Market pick and the poem is called
where's my droid and the application is
free on android market thanks for
watching and if you want to download
this program directly to your device
