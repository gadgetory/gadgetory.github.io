pacquiao calm and if you are like me you
appreciate games that do not take too
much time to either win or lose
particularly puzzle games today I'm
going to show you a new game for windows
mobile with a VGA screen and the game is
called I grek way hangman and it's a
simple hangman game can be somewhat
customized to incorporate your own
dictionary hints and also gives you the
choice of different backgrounds so I'll
go into that so the first button you see
here this actually changes the word so
you can pick a different word and it
will rearrange the the spaces so that
you can change it the second one will
give you hints so this particular word
says latency implication and metaphor so
close that the second one is actually
your settings and this is where you can
draw the gallows which is of course the
hangman picture you can change your
language so we have choice of English or
Russian I'm you can show the first and
last letter which will give you a little
bit of a hint you can activate the
sounds and you can use the default
dictionary or you can select your own
dictionary so if you go in here you can
actually select your dictionary but that
will be a dot DIC file association
you'll have to download one of those on
your own from internet so just cancel
that hey okay this little button right
here will give you information about the
game its version 1.2 and close that you
can also change the backgrounds so you
can pick any one of these backgrounds
I'll pick this one because it's easier
to read as you can see and you can also
exit the program so we'll just play this
real fast of course we want to select
the vowels first so try that oh not
doing too well let's try a t sr remember
we also had this hint here so we can go
back and it says age hmm what could it
be
well I'm not doing too well let's say
here so after you've won it's as you win
and it gives you the word and just say
okay so this is I Greco a hangman and
i'll post a link in paki no comments how
to get this it's a free game and it's
pretty neat because it will definitely
teach you more vocabulary words thanks
