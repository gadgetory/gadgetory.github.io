pebble is now available we spent over 21
days using testing and probing pebble
steel and now it's time to give you our
thoughts on the device I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow
and this is our 4 view of pebble steel
hardware was commonly accepted as the
lowest point of the original pebble its
casing was made entirely of
polycarbonate a matte finish on the
underbelly and a shiny smooth finish
which was susceptible to serious
scratching on the topside and even
though you could swap the van with any
22 millimeter band there was no getting
around how cheap the original pebble
looked and felt fixing the aesthetics of
pebble was the company's sole mission
with pebble steel mission accomplished
the casing a pebble steel as the name
suggests is made almost entirely of a
high-quality machined marine grade
stainless steel it comes in two finishes
a bear brushed steel or a matte black
PVD coating and every model comes with
two straps out-of-the-box a genuine
leather strap or a steel band with a
button clasp both feel very high-quality
and luxurious like something you
wouldn't mind wearing every day with
casual or dressy attire that said it's
important to note pebble steel will not
work with just any standard watch band
like its predecessor due to the unique
design of the band attachment for the
foreseeable future owners will be
limited to the two standard straps a
small price to pay for a much better
looking and feeling watch the physical
size of pebble steel is smaller than
before in all dimensions it's 46
millimeters tall 34 millimeters wide and
ten point five millimeters thick this is
especially helpful for those with
smaller wrists though we feel it looks
just fine on our thicker wrists and due
to its metal chassis it weighs a good
bit more 56 grams with the length of
strap or 99 grams with the steel band
pebble steel also uses the same button
configuration as before one back button
on the left edge and up and down buttons
flanking a select button on the right
edge these buttons unlike before are
very easy to press and offer a nice
tactile feedback upon pressing them this
has significantly improved the usability
we found it far easier to use and
navigate menus and settings on pebble
steel compared to its predecessor pebble
has also changed the charging port it's
now smaller and
unfortunately for existing owners this
means you will not be able to use your
spare charging cables to charge pebble
steel for what it's worth the magnetic
connection seems stronger so accidental
unplugs a common problem with magnetic
style chargers happen less frequently
and there is an RGB notification LED
which currently only works for charging
status Orange for charging green for
fully charged
outside the vast visual differences the
company hasn't touched much on the
inside virtually all the specs are the
same as before it has the same battery
ePaper display CPU and RAM it also has
the same waterproof rating 5 atmospheres
it does hold twice the storage inside
though that extra storage is not
available to the user we aren't sure if
that extra storage is future proofing
for future software updates or if it
will be unlocked in the future for
additional watch face and AB storage one
of the more important upgrades on pebble
steel is the introduction of Gorilla
Glass this is meant to help prevent
scratching and shattering of the face
and so far it's proven to hold up well
against the frequent bumps and dings on
walls door frames and table corners we
can see no signs of wear on the glass at
all but there are a few tiny Nick's on
the metal chassis there is another
benefit to the Gorilla Glass though and
that's the appearance of the display
while the display has not been
physically upgraded it appears clearer
than before without any of the visible
distortion light refraction or
discoloration from before
frankly we're pleased with all aspects
of the pebble Steel's hardware it's
easily the best-looking SmartWatch on
the market and everything about it is
more solid from the finish of the design
the tactility of the buttons or the
tightness and strength of the vibrate
motor the software side of things are
exactly the same
it runs pebble OS version 2 and any
differences will be indistinguishable to
the end user however we must say we
quite enjoy the upgrades brought to the
smartphone side of the pebble equation
pebble app store currently only
officially available on iOS and a better
watch app management system within the
latest version of the pebble app for iOS
comes what pebble calls blocker a sort
of keepsake area for storing your
favorite watch apps on your phone you
can see and manage the apps installed on
your pebble this feature makes being
limited to just eight watch apps much
easier to cope with by offering a quick
way to swap out your favorite
applications when your watch is full
the App Store has breathed new life into
what was once a very limited product we
can now keep up with our favorite sports
teams check into locations using
Foursquare and grab weather updates all
from pebble and if you want more
frustration in your life just install a
tiny bird on your pebble a flappy bird
knockoff we're still unimpressed by how
pebble notifications are handled when
using iOS unlocking your iPhone after
several hours of inactivity will release
a barrage of notifications you've likely
already received this can be managed
within Notification Center settings but
the setup is not exactly user-friendly
it's especially not any fun for someone
with lots of applications installed on
their iPhone on a lighter note battery
life has been great since pebble steel
arrived on the 11th of February we've
gone through three full battery charge
cycles that's an average of almost
charging every seven days every six days
or so we'd receive a notification for
pebble only having 20% charge remaining
in our experience with the original
pebble this is comparable in all pebble
steel is a truly impressive product and
marvel in design $250 price tag will be
difficult for some to swallow but after
having used the original pebble in
pebble steel extensively the $100
difference in price is easily justified
it wasn't until after we use pebble
steel that we understood this it fixes
all of the problems we have with the
original pebble which all mainly stemmed
from the design build quality and
aesthetics unlike before it looks great
with any attire and hides the nerdiness
of a SmartWatch under the perfect guys
