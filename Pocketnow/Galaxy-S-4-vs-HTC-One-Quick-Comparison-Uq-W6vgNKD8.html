HTC one is HTC sweating do they have a
reason to be nervous well we're going to
compare them right now let's take a look
the big difference between these two
devices is choice of materials we've got
metal on the HTC one we've got plastic
on the galaxy s4 the galaxy s4
definitely feels thinner in the hand
although what HTC does is kind of a
trick here we've got a thinner edge
which is thinner than this edge then
it's a little bit thicker as it goes
back but it feels very thin when you
pick up the HTC One it's cold in your
hand it's that metal construction that
feels very unique and on the galaxy s4
it's kind of what you would expect with
a galaxy s3 so it's really up to you to
determine do you want a metal phone do
you want a plastic phone once definitely
lighter than the other with the galaxy
s4 being lighter now we've got a larger
screen here five inches on the galaxy s4
4.7 inches on the HTC One what I like
about the galaxy s4 here so the bezels
are just so thin we kind of have an
Xperia ZL kind of big screen to facade
ratio if that's an official term inside
the galaxy s4 this version unconfirmed
but what we think is the an octa-core
processor with two gigabytes of RAM on
the HTC One we've got the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 quad-core with two
gigabytes of RAM let's turn these
puppies on and see which looks better
they are both at maximum screen
brightness we give that character is
characteristic that were really dark
black here on the galaxy s4 but to be
honest HTC one's keeping up really good
really well that's not right keeping up
very well with its LCD technology over
the a moet something that the galaxy s4
has with the HTC does not have is a
dynamic feature that allows the screen
to adjust contrast in color based on
what ever after in
of course one of the big things that
make these devices different is the
camera we've got a 4 megapixel ultra
pixel camera on the HTC One which claims
to take in a lot for life interestingly
Samsung didn't talk that much about the
camera itself the 13 megapixel shooter
on the galaxy s4 they were emphasizing
or so all of the camera features all the
ways that you can do things that kind of
the HTC one introduced like a Zoe like
feature that adds a little bit of sound
too to a video and some other ways to
capture images quickly just realize me
power save on on the HTC One which dim
the screen so now that we have it at
true maximum screen brightness let's go
into an application where there is white
space so we can kind of take a look at
the difference LCD gives you a brighter
white but AMOLED gives you a darker
black so it all kind of matters on what
you're looking for in terms of screen
quality and Samsung has that is a lot of
auxiliary features like a smart stay
variant called what's it called autos
super smart stay super smart spec on
something auto scroll something that
will follow your eyes as you move down
the page HTC one just doesn't do that so
overall I think these devices are really
going to go ahead and I think a lot of
people were scared I think HTC was
scared the galaxy s4 would blow it out
of the water with the galaxy s4 but you
know these are going to be very very
strong contenders they're very different
phones and I think that's why people
will have a tough time deciding between
them we're going to have a much more
deeper comparison than this quick video
coming up in the weeks ahead at pocket
now just a look at the galaxy s4 vs the
HTC One</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
