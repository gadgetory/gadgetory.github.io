pocket now's de-facto windows mobile guy
at MWC 2016 i really wanted to go
hands-on with the most metal of all
windows phones the vo biz well it turns
out the only way i could do that was to
put up with a big honkin security device
so i guess you will too but this is the
only chance we're gonna get for a sneak
peek outside of japan so let's take a
look and a quick hands-on I ran into the
VAIO biz at the Qualcomm booth where I
learned that it's packin a Snapdragon
617 processor now that's not the highest
end SOC there is but given how well it
ran Android on HTC One a9 and the fact
that Windows 10 mobile just doesn't need
that much power to run well I'm not too
worried about performance on the biz the
display is full HD at 5.5 inches and I
thought it looked contrast II and
saturated enough to be an OLED panel but
the specs I'm seeing here say it's IPs
no other details will be a surprise
three gigs of ram microsd 13 megapixel
camera you get the picture the real
story here that's with all windows
mobile devices since the 950 series
launched is that it's not plastic but
metal a nice bead blasted aluminum
casing and 167 gram mass makes for a
very solid feel in hand it compared to
most modern Lumias still I can almost
live with the fact that this phone isn't
destined for any non-japanese markets
for one thing the power buttons and are
really out-of-the-way spot up in the
corner above the volume rocker also the
speaker is rear firing which is
something I'd hoped we'd left behind in
2015 and while the industrial design of
the biz is fantastic I'm still bewitched
by yesterday's encounter with the far
more respect out HP Elite x3 I'm going
to say further impressions until I can
import one of these suckers and use it
on the go and on continuum for a few
days in the meantime I think the
takeaway here is that it's just cool to
see the VAIO name on a smart phone and
it's cool to see a Windows powered
smartphone with a modicum of style again
for more on the BIOS Windows cousins
including the Lumia 650 and that beefy
elite x3 check out our other MWC 2016
