all right mr. Jules Wong it seems that
we were finally able to fit on the frame
yeah two of us in one vision also the
recording setup here is just amazing
I could have risked damage to our Airbnb
this is our Airbnb in Barcelona boots on
the ground and we've started with a
couple of the shoes mr. Wong's bag got
stolen got stolen don't remind me to
have us like we've already went shopping
got him some clothes and there is a lot
of content coming from him to be seized
so I'm high metal Ravana I'm Jules Wong
with pocket now and this is what we're
looking forward to in Barcelona
brought to you by invisible I guess the
most important theme of this show is
definitely gonna be 5g we've seen
Qualcomm teasing everything the company
has done we have a standard we've got
carriers we've got cell phone OEMs
already committing the only problem is
that even though we've got carriers like
AT&amp;amp;T already announcing cities where 5g
is going to launch by the end of the
year we actually don't have smartphones
that are ready and we're not expecting
these smartphones to be announced at MWC
we're expecting that to happen later
this year but at least we will be
covering what 5g will be capable of
whenever the spectrum and everything
else is ready so in terms of wearables
if there's anything the reports will
give it to you unfortunately we haven't
heard anything in terms of rumors for
this show but for huawei they have a
couple of tablets or laptops coming in
the media pad series that they've been
working on for quite a few years now has
been pretty excellent and as well we
also got teased something with the ex
could be another mate book X they had
one last year we'll have to see if this
year brings an interaction on that
definitely sony is one of those
companies where I personally have been
wanting them
make a comeback we've seen them make
their lukewarm appearances in the past
couple of events but MWC is apparently
going to change everything we saw their
new experience at CES those were the
premium mid-range offerings now we have
rumors of the xperia x z2 and eggsy to
compact the fact that the company is not
going to back down when it comes to
design but we're also seeing some chubby
leaks of bones and I am the first one
that says I would rather get a chubby
phone with good battery life and I'm
hoping that's where Sony is taking
things obviously the most important
thing is what will Shoni bring that's
different not just the typical slab and
that's really what we can't wait to
answer in part of our coverage so in
terms of other phone manufacturers well
we do have plenty of meetings to get to
and we'll wait to tell you what these
entail but look forward to announcements
from Alcatel blackberry ZTE Asus and
Lenovo in the coming week definitely the
most important topic for MWC and
Barcelona is the Samsung Galaxy S 9 we
are happy that it's making a return to
Barcelona in the past we know what
happened after the note 7 and then the
launch of the s8 that happened late this
year
yes we're expecting beautiful design
you're expecting Samsung to do something
about its software most important what
can the company do for battery life is
one of the most intriguing things that I
can't wait to see from them you see in
addition to that obviously that variable
aperture and the camera definitely
something that no other company is doing
and this is actually not the first time
that Samsung is bringing this technology
so let's see how it stacks up on the s9
with F 1.5 aperture moving all the way
to F 2.4 that's pretty much the way
regular cameras work so that would be
great to see and we can't wait to test
it but in today's question out of all
the products and everything that we've
been talking about what are you most
excited about are you most excited about
sony lenovo samsung let us know in the
comments and also let us know what you
