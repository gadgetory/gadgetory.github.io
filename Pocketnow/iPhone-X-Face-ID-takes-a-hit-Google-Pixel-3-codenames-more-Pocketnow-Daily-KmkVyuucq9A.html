reportedly fixed but by offering lesser
quality face ID detection Google code
names for its next batch of pixel
devices of just the merge believe it or
not and the HTC u xi + r e emerges as a
possible candidate to be announced very
soon I'm Jaime Rivera and I saw
something today that I can't tell you
about I will very soon and Wow
it's really cool I can't wait to tell
you this is pocket out daily
the official ders today begin with
unbelievable deals if you're in the
market for the iPhone 10 believe it or
not Xfinity Mobile is going to be
offering a $500 gift card if you buy the
iPhone 10 with them but you have to be
an X 1 Triple Play customer and there
are a couple of other conditions that
are still worth it's worth it to go for
those and not pay those 500 bucks you
can learn more in the description and
for those of you living in New York City
or visiting you will know how archaic it
is to refill the MetroCard but not
anymore according to the MTA this is
going to change from here on out up
until 2023 I believe where the metro
card will be phased out and the solution
will be Apple pay Android pay and
Samsung pay how will that work we will
have 15 stops that will be supporting
NFC over the next couple of weeks and
then this is going to start expanding in
a very crazy plan that will even include
all the buses up until 2020 I believe
you can learn more about the plan on the
link in the description I can't wait for
that shift now let's talk about the HTC
you have 11 plus there has been
speculation that the event on November
2nd will only be about the probable HTC
u 11 life which is a mid-range err
apparently and it turns out that the
plus might still be making the cut
though the only thing we have is really
a teaser that says that you will be
seeing it all at the event so I don't
think that all will apply to just the
premium mid-range err or a mid-range err
for that matter it has to be more than
one product so let's see what we get
believe it or not the Google pixel 2 in
pixel 2 XL were just recently launched
and now we get to hear the code names
for the successors we're hearing up to 3
products in some cases for like for
example code names like albacore blue
line cross hatch and now we're also
hearing the case of wahoo and depending
on what source you look at there are
different cases you're not exactly sure
which of these products are which or
what they will bring the thing is the
code names are out let's see what we end
up getting though that will probably
take more than a year from you and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with the iPhone 10 and something
that's rather disappointing for those of
you wondering how Apple
ten managed to fix all of its
manufacturing issues with face ID it
turns out that what Apple had to end up
doing is pretty much dropped the quality
and the accuracy of face ID if you
remember one of apple's major selling
points her face ID at the event was that
touch ID is currently 50,000 to one when
it comes to accuracy and then in the
case of face idea was 1 million to 1 or
1 to 1 million apparently now it's only
going to be one to 500,000 which is
apparently better than touch ID but not
as good as the company was touting at
its event whatever the case may be it
leads me to the question today would you
trust face ID if you notice that Apple
is dropping the quality of the product
because in my case I wouldn't I don't
think that face ID can be better than
touch ID but hey I'm not the engineer
that designed it so hey leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
