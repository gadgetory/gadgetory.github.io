smartphone with a Motorola logo and a
pretty competitive price point know the
way they both are both of the phones I'm
talking about
they are both that so which one is right
for you it's a tough question but we're
used to those i'm michael fisher with
pocket now and this is Moto X pure
edition versus Nexus 6
motorola took fundamentally different
approaches to the big Android phone
concept with these two well the Nexus 6
display is less than 1/2 inch larger and
it's only 5 grams more massive the Nexus
6 feels huge in the hand thanks to its
wider construction the Moto X pure
edition is by no means a small phone
it's even a millimeter thicker than the
Nexus but in every sense it feels like
the more petite device here it's also
much more customizable there are
literally hundreds of configurations
available for the Moto X with custom
materials ranging from silicone rubber
to wood to leather and everything from
accent color to software greeting to
casing engraving customizable through
moto maker it's no exaggeration to say
that the Moto X pure Edition is the most
customizable Android phone on the market
meanwhile the Nexus 6 is available in
blue and white and that's it
stacking these devices in the hand and
taking a look around
it's striking how many design elements
Motorola retained even to a layman size
it's obvious that these phones are very
close cousins if not outright siblings
but if you could peel away the back
cover which you can't you'd see the
differences start to stack up from its
architecture to the number of cores the
Snapdragon 808 in the Moto X is an
entirely different beast than the older
805 in the Nexus the Moto X also adds a
16 gig option to the 32 and 64 gig tears
that they share and it packs a nice
treat for those in need of even more
storage a SIM tray that doubles as a
micro SD card slot it once you fill up
the Nexus you need to start moving stuff
into the cloud and speaking of filling
up the Nexus 6 brings a 7% larger
battery and it also offers wireless
charging where the Moto X does not on
the flipside the Moto X comes with a
beefier 25 watt charger in the box it
doesn't let you swap the cable like the
older turbo charger but it does charge
the Moto X almost twice as fast which is
super handy if you're often on the go
which of these displays you like better
will depend as always on your personal
preferences the IPS display on the Moto
X is probably the better screen on the
whole
with a slightly higher pixel density and
much cleaner whites and more authentic
color reproduction and it's also though
better screen if you spend a lot of time
outdoors because it can get far brighter
than the AMOLED panel on the Nexus if
you're more interested in impressing
others or yourself with colors that pop
the Nexus 6 is your way to go that
AMOLED panel is an excellent showcase
for the Nexus 6 is ambient display which
tosses up waiting notifications briefly
when the phone is moved or pulled from a
pocket but when we compared the Nexus 6
with last year's Moto X we said this was
a feature better realized on the latter
with Motorola's active display and
nothing's changed this year you don't
even need to touch the Moto X to get it
to show the time and you're waiting
notifications pick it up and you can
launch the camera just by twisting it
twice or fire up the spotlight by
chopping wood the Moto X will also
automatically detect when you're driving
and if you want it'll read your text
messages aloud to you and let you
dictate replies entirely hands-free if
you're behind the wheel a lot that's a
big deal and if you're not the Moto X
can be set to do this when you're at
home it can also silence your ringer
automatically when you're in a meeting
or asleep and if you want to use it
without touching it just say its name
and it'll be there okay Jarvis play
Mariah Carey on Spotify
to be fair you can do that last trick on
the Nexus 6 as well but you can't use a
custom key phrase and you can't do as
much with it those individual features
might not sound like much but taken
together they make the experience of
using the Moto X more personal than the
conventional Nexus 6 if you don't care
about any of that and decide to run each
phone bone-stock well that's no problem
each runs the most current version of
Android and Motorola's record of timely
updates to the Moto X line is pretty
good of course nothing beats a nexus 4
update speed but I'd be surprised if
there was a truly significant difference
here motorola has upgraded the camera in
the new Moto X to Sony's AMX 230 sensor
a big step up from the I MX 214 in the
Nexus well there's no optical image
stabilization on the Moto X the new
digital stabilization more than makes up
for it and the newer sensor also brings
almost double the resolution as well as
phase detection autofocus which makes
for easier macro shots and less
wandering focus problems then on the
Nexus 6 is contrast detection autofocus
setup HDR video recording is also
supported on the Moto X and the flash
has been upgraded as well there's a
color corrected dual LED on the back and
even a flash on the Moto X is selfie cam
at which by the way is a higher
resolution than the Nexus component by
now you've probably spotted the trend
pretty much everything is better on the
Moto X cameras and that's mostly borne
out by the samples I'll shut up for a
minute so you can see for yourself
remember when we called out how striking
the physical similarities are here well
that carries over to general performance
as well you'll find the pure speakers
nearly as loud if not exactly as loud as
the booming Nexus 6
now our Nexus sample unit is locked to
AT&amp;amp;T while we've primarily tested our
Moto X pure Edition on t-mobile but
that's no problem
it's called the pure edition for a
reason all you need to do is pop in an
AT&amp;amp;T SIM and presto the Moto X might as
well have a Death Star tattoo too you
don't even have to reboot it it just
registers on the new network like
nothing happened
just keep in mind if you're buying one
of these to work in a specific US
carrier there are differences in which
bands are supported with band 12 a
particular sticking point for now see
our full review at pocket now available
September 18th for more on this you'll
want to check that review for specific
Moto X battery life figures as well
as we've used these phones on separate
networks for our test period then one of
them is almost a year old while the
other is fresh out of the box our data
is not the most reliable on the whole
though the Nexus 6 does better usually
delivering between 4 &amp;amp; 5 hours of screen
on time with moderate use the Moto X in
my testing has yet to hit the 4 hour
mark and screen on time your mileage
will of course vary as always choosing
between these two phones demands that
you consider exactly what you're
shopping for but while the Nexus 6 is
still a pretty good buy on the whole
it's tough to recommend it over the Moto
X the newer phone brings better cameras
a brighter display more useful software
more current hardware and deeper
customization than any other Android and
if you just look at official prices at
press time it's also cheaper than the
Nexus 6 while offering microSD expansion
to boot if your needs are very specific
and you really need something from the
Nexus family or you really refuse to
give up an AMOLED display you'll
probably be plenty happy with the Nexus
4 pretty much everyone else
we recommend heading over to moto maker
and building your Moto X pure edition
if you want to see what unboxing your
very own Moto X pure edition feels like
check out our first impressions video
and see what we had to say to viewers
questions about the phone in the latest
episode of the pocket now we play
podcast stick around for a full review
coming September 18th and it most
importantly thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
