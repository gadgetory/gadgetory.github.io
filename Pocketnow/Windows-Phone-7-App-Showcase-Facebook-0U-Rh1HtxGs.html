com we've gotten some requests looking
for now what the real Facebook looks
like on windows phone 7 so we've got it
loaded and let's check it out so here it
is launching I'm gonna do a little bit
of loading here we go and here we are
you also see some little dots up there
still loading a little bit of more
information there's my profile picture
and we have a menu comes up right away
and these are your options and we can
swipe can get to the top news ok lots of
cool stuff there and you can add
comments or like certain posts up here
you can add a post and there's only one
extra button there for adding a picture
so you can add a picture that you've
already taken and this button will love
let us open the camera to take a picture
in order to add it to Facebook let's go
back
unfortunately that's the only thing you
can add really pictures you can't paste
a hyperlink you can't upload a video but
there's other cool things here here's
our photos you got some recent pictures
from your friends got pictures that
people tagged of me that's more over
there and then we're at events so this
is good to have it's not really it's not
integrated with the native windows phone
seven calendar and we can go to one of
these events and get some more info on
that and down here we can say we're
attending or maybe or no not go to that
so there's a concert there's no way to
add this to your calendar here's the
wall for that event who else is going
anyway that's that so you got Vince and
you've got birthdays all right there
then we've got notifications so you can
tap on that to see what they're talking
about sometimes it doesn't work there we
go
you can see the little dots that slogan
picture and I give it a minute there we
go so there's a picture of somebody
tagged and down here you got some
options you can comment you can like it
going to go to the previous or next you
can show tags let's hide those so you
can comment I'm not going to load these
comments I don't know what those are
going to be let's get back out of there
and then we're back to the beginning and
you can go to your inbox you can see
your messages there's your events and
your friends here's your profile you can
see requests friends friend requests
some notes and settings let's look at
the settings automatic refresh you can
set that to whatever you want you can
confirm exit and you can enable shake to
refresh so you just shake it to get some
more info update your timeline and under
friends I was wondering where the search
is so and here it is that little button
at the bottom ok maybe if I can type
so you can search for friends and you
can search for everyone alright that's
weird but it doesn't show groups or
lakes maybe if we do it this way
you notice there's there's no auto
correcting in this keyboard while I'm in
this app for some reason
okay give it a second there we go
there's the pocket now Facebook page and
there it is and you can see the wall
pretty good you can comment Oh get some
photos
loading loading
so your little dots are loading okay I'm
tired of that and we can back out at any
point
so that's pretty much it for the
facebook app then I'm really missing is
the video upload which you know first
appeared on Windows Mobile actually as a
mobile facebook app but we're missing it
in Windows Phone 7 however this is a
really cool facebook you have a really
nice interface looks really good so it
might be useful for how many of you and
we that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
