with another speed face off this time
it's 1 gigahertz vs 1 gigahertz so
what's faster the HTC Desire HD or the
t-mobile mytouch 4G let's go take a look
ok guys so here we go we've got a
quadrant standard running on both
devices and I'm going to try and start
them both at the same time they both
have been recently factory reset so I
don't have too much stuff loading up and
causing problems now I do have gmail
which is pulling in stuff I am connected
to Wi-Fi on both of them but I've got as
clean a boot as i can get at this point
and we'll see which one's faster so
let's go ahead and start them now again
these are both running 1 gigahertz
processors of course the desire HD has a
much larger screen which generally means
that the graphics processing in this
device has to run all that much harder
because it's got to output a lot more
pixels than does the mytouch 4G so we
should see the 4g running a little bit
faster because it's a lot it's got less
graphical data that it has to process
and push out to the screen now that's
just my initial impression and it sounds
logical but we'll see once the results
come in which one of these two is really
the faster device over here we getting
57 58 frames per second versus 59 over
here so a little bit better graphics 18
19 verses 19 20 so a little bit higher
resolution on this side as well they
both finish about the same time the
mytouch 4G coming in at 1720 but
overhear the desire HD coming in at 18
18 so even though you've got more
graphics pumping out to this screen this
device comes in just a little bit faster
now of course we don't want to run it
just one time we want to run through a
second time so I'm going to go ahead and
do that and we'll see what the results
are I'll do that off camera so you don't
have to watch because the tests are the
same but will come
right after the break and see exactly
which one is faster all right now this
time they both ran through a little bit
quicker over here on the mytouch 4G the
score is 1968 whereas the desire HD is
2025 both very respectable speeds but
it's very obvious just by running these
tests back to back why you want to make
sure that you went through a few tests
so that tells me that even though it's
got a bigger screen the desire HD is a
little bit faster device fast enough for
you to notice probably not now i do want
to mention that this is running the
latest over-the-air update that came out
today the desire HD is the mytouch 4G
hasn't gotten an update since i've
received it but this one just did
receive one today so i don't know if
that's going to make any difference or
not but both very respectable devices
now the next test that we want to run of
course is networking how fast can this
communicate across a network
unfortunately the desire HD is only
going to get edge speeds so we're not
going to test that instead what we're
going to do is test the Wi-Fi connection
speeds to see which one is better there
and we're going to do it at the same
time which may impact our results just a
little bit will use speedtest net which
is a free app available in the market
and let's go ahead and set that up ok so
again both of these are running
speedtest.net the same version they're
both wired up to the same 802 11 and
wireless access point and they are both
set to return results in kilobits per
second and let's show you on this one as
well they're set to get the the test
from the same server in Salt Lake City
Utah so tried to equalize this as much
as I can let's go ahead in full
disclosure this one is about that far
not that much closer to the wireless
antenna then is the desire HD but that
shouldn't have that big a difference so
let's go ahead and run the test and see
how they do now that the internet
connection here is over comcast net
cable modem the ping rate is 47 on this
one 61 on that one which should be about
the same download speed is 10.8 megabits
per second versus 6,400 kilobits per
second up
what speeds are about the same let's go
ahead and test it again again we want to
make sure that we in fact let's move the
positions just in case that couple
inches makes a big difference go ahead
and test these again I tap the desire HD
a little bit afterwards so it'll be a
little bit behind pings a little bit
higher over here just shy of 300
milliseconds versus 47 sometimes that
will happen with network congestion and
whatnot but we've got 4.3 megabits per
second over here and 10.7 over here so
very obviously some differences let's
run the third time independent and i'll
leave the results up on the screen for
comparison ping time at 60 milliseconds
which is very respectable download speed
looks like it's going to come in
somewhere around eight megabits per
second upload speed right around four
megabits per second so very respectable
over Wi-Fi go ahead and test this one
ping rates a little bit higher again 319
download speed is 7.6 megabit per second
which is just about the same as the
eight megabit that we got on the other
one and upload speed just shy of four
megabits so show those to you again ping
rates a little bit higher on the mytouch
4G for some reason that's probably just
I don't know a little bit coincidental
line ping rates can vary for many many
reasons but overall the speeds are about
the same on both devices again over
Wi-Fi again why am I not showing you
over wireless well if I switch off my
Wi-Fi on this phone fact let me go ahead
and do that so we'll go back home and we
will not into the apt we're into
settings and I'll just toggle Wi-Fi go
back over here and let's go ahead and
launch speed test again and we'll do the
same thing on this side go home go to
menu go to settings wireless turn off
Wi-Fi you'll back home well first of all
it's not going to work because I don't
have a sim in this device I'll go
fix that but I've got HSPA over here all
right so I took my other sim and I
popped it inside the desire HD and you
notice up here I'm on an edge connection
versus an HSPA connection so there's
very obviously going to be a difference
in speeds how much let's go ahead and
take a look begin the test ping over
here is 277 milliseconds which is a
little on the high side but still not
terrible over on the mytouch 4G it's
having a little bit of a hard time doing
this we'll go ahead and run a test after
the fact download speeds 147 kilobits
per second upload speed over here is
going to be a bit better than that I
hope find out 71 kilobits now this is
why i'm reporting speeds in kilobits so
you can very obviously see the
difference in speed now over on the
mytouch 4G I'm getting 2129 kilobits per
second down my ping rate ended up being
one hundred three milliseconds and my
upload speed at 1239 so very obviously a
difference now is that a big deal well
if you're in the United States
absolutely that's a big deal that HTC
Desire HD is in the European phone and
it will also work really well in not in
and around Asia if you're going to be
doing a lot of data you probably don't
want this phone in the United States
with tmobile which both of these are
using the t-mobile network with t-mobile
you're only going to get edge data
connections over in fact I've seen it
fall down to GPRS a few times using AT&amp;amp;T
because of the bands in the phone you're
also limited to edge and GPRS so not
that great for data then again if you're
in a place where you're covered by Wi-Fi
quite a bit you're probably going to be
just fine email and and web surfing are
okay over edge I mean not long ago
that's all that we had and it'll do
it'll get you by but very obviously
there's a big difference in speed
between 3g and edge now this is i
mentioned 3g this phone is capable of
what t-mobile is calling for g their
hspa+ network you can see right there we
almost doubled our speed up to 3904
whereas we're still over here at 149
kilobits per second
a big difference in an overall backbone
and speed now it's it's interesting to
see that these are both the same carrier
so we're seeing you know pretty much the
same results when we have when we have a
4g to a 4g phone like the g2 but when we
come back here to edge you know we're
still getting some respectable speeds
again if you're in the US and you need
high-speed wireless you probably aren't
going to go with the desire HD if you
are in Asia or if you are in anywhere in
Europe this is probably the phone that
you are going to love in addition to the
large screen compared to some of the
other devices you should just have a
beautiful form factor neither one of
these have hardware keyboards they're
both just you know just regular devices
small slate in this case but very very
nice phones so there's our speed test
one thing that I'd like to say before I
do away with the desire HD this has been
one of the funnest phones that I have
ever tested the screen is huge on Wi-Fi
the performance is astounding you guys
over in Asia and Europe are going to
love the 3g speeds whereas guys over in
the US not so much it'll get you by
it'll do what you need to do but I want
to give a big shout out to clove dot u K
or excuse me clove technologies and
their website again is clove co uk
obviously out of the united kingdom they
are the ones that provided us with this
demo unit and a very big thank you goes
out to them if you are interested in
getting unlocked phones make sure you
take a look at them if you are over
there across the pond look at these guys
they've been very helpful and very
patient in our review of the unit so
again showing off the speeds of the
mytouch 4G upside down or right side up
and the HTC Desire HD I'm Joe for
