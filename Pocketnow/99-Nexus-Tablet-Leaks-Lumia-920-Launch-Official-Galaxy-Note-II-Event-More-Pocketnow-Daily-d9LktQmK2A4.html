nexus tablet nokia finally confirms
availability for their Lumia 920 in
Europe and Samsung sent out invites for
their galaxy note 2 event in the United
States I'm hi Mary Vera wondering of
that galaxy note 2 will be my first ever
phablet and this is parking out daily
that's right Samsung is just an out
invites title the next big thing is
coming and you have an S Pen at the top
so this is really big the Galaxy Note 2
is most probably being announced in this
october twenty fourth event in new york
city and we might expect to get pricing
carrier availability and everything
probably my only gripe here is having to
wait till october 24th to get an
announcement together the vice released
a little later but still it's better
than nothing so hold your horses and
speaking of announcements it seems like
if somebody at no get caught our last
episode of hell daily where we
were complaining of the Lumia 920 not
having pricing or availability nokia has
just announced that it will be available
in part of europe starting november the
Lumia 920 priced at six hundred fifty
euros and the 820 priced at five hundred
the problem is that it doesn't include
the UK and also November has 30 days all
they said was november no can't cut me
some slack i'm trying to be nice here
why are you specific and the HTC One x+
makes the news again this time we've got
retail photos from o2 UK mentioning
specs first of all we've got 64
gigabytes of storage we've also got a
faster processor an Android 4.1 jelly
bean being sold out of the box we've got
the same camera which is good not
necessarily great but still good and
even though it doesn't mention any dates
it says coming soon coming soon can come
soon enough though now one of the things
we like the most about the iphone 5 was
how fast the device was just how fast
well the guys at geekbench recently
updated their application and they
figured out that it overclocks to one
point three gigahertz whenever you need
speed and then an under clock so 550
megahertz whenever you don't it's also
got three GPU so whenever somebody asks
you the thing is fast yes it is fast and
finally for some more interesting news
we've got this time sir
that Gulen issues are both working on
building another nexus tablet now what
makes this tablet special is that
apparently google is going to figure out
how to sell that thing for a hundred
bucks I'm not kidding here 100 bucks
cheaper than almost the cheapest mp3
player in the market and it just makes
me wonder how Google plans to pay for
the cost of that thing to a sous and
that leads me to the question of the day
what tablet are you using or what taba
do you want to get this holiday season I
have a third-generation iPad from
verizon but to be honest with you the
Nexus 7 is my baby leave us a comment
down below now if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow us on pocketnow.com

you liked what you saw I'm high never
leave ever thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
