but how does it compare to the original
one of the most popular Android tablets
ever I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is the old Nexus 7 versus the
new Nexus 7 last year Google and Asus
wild the world with the tablet that not
only came with decent specifications but
also featured a nice design fit in one
hand easily and was affordable while
most other tablets in the same category
were pushing $400 the Nexus 7 was only
$1.99 an impact just as much of a punch
if not a larger wallet but make no
mistake the Nexus 7 wasn't perfect its
display left much to be desired it
originally only came in 8 or 16 gigabyte
models and over time it suffered from an
increasing amount of lag and performance
issues the second generation Nexus 7 has
easily been one of the most highly
anticipated tablets of the year but how
does it stack up is it worth the upgrade
and does it live up to the hype that's
what we're here to find out we had very
few complaints about the hardware for
the original Nexus 7 Asuna only makes
high quality hardware and the Nexus 7
despite its price tag was no exception
yes it was a little heavy on the bezel
and it was a bit chunky but when you
consider the fact that Google is selling
the tablet around cost those minut
details begin to slip into the
background and you enjoy the tablet for
what it is a high-caliber tablet that
won't empty your wallet externally a lot
has changed yet at the same time none of
the changes are very drastic all of the
differences between last year's Nexus 7
and this year's are fine tunings and
improvements on the few shortcomings of
the original tablets hardware from the
front the two tablets are quite similar
but a soos definitely paid attention to
existing nexus of an owner's complaints
it reduced the bezel on the sides of the
display by nearly 6 millimetres total
however the top and bottom bezels are
marginally thicker than before the new
Nexus 7 is also 1.8 millimeters thinner
and 50 grams lighter than the old model
both of which are quite noticeable the
newer Nexus 7 is easier to hold
one-handed and actually fits in our jean
pockets with a little wiggle room
whereas the old Nexus 7 didn't really
fit at all they feature the same button
and port placement with the exception of
the headphone jack which has jumped from
the bottom edge to the
the biggest difference though is the
backside the overall shape is the same
they have wide radius curved backs to
give the illusion of being thinner and
the trim around the front is chamfered
but the material is different the
dimpled soft touch plastic on the
original felt like a perforated leather
glove there are no real issues with the
retail black model but the Google IO
Edition tablets which came in a pearl
white were subject to absorbing diet
from various cases as you can see our
model turned pink from being used in a
red case for a matter of days without
reducing the quality of the backside as
soos moved away from the dimpled pattern
it's not a terrible move but we
certainly miss how unique the material
was and the feeling it put off no less
we're still impressed with the back side
of the new model as it doesn't seem to
be a fingerprint magnet
unlike most other soft touch plastics
you may also notice one other major
difference on these tablets back sides
the new model has a camera sensor in the
upper left corner but the old model has
none internally these two tablets are
quite different the old model came with
only one gigabyte of RAM a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core Tegra 3 chip 8 16 or 32
gigabytes of fixed storage a 4325
milliamp hour battery and a 1.2
megapixel front camera the new model
offers two gigabytes of RAM a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
chip 16 or 32 gigabytes of fixed storage
a 3950 milliamp hour battery a 5
megapixel rear camera and a 1.2
megapixel front camera both offer NFC
Wi-Fi b/g/n and cellular connectivity
both of our units are Wi-Fi only models
but the old Nexus 7 came in an HSPA+ and
3g model while the new one comes in an
LTE variant compatible with AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile and Verizon LTE networks under
a single SKU as you can imagine the
biggest contrast between these two slabs
is the displays at 1280 by 800 pixels on
an IPS LCD panel the 216 PPI display on
the original Nexus 7 left much to be
desired in terms of quality and density
the new Nexus 7 offers over double the
resolution on the same sized LCD panel
for a total density of 323 pixels per
inch the new display isn't as colorful
as we were hoping but it's definitely
more vibrant than last year's model the
new panel is brighter noticeably more
crisp offers wider viewing angles
improved contrast to black levels and
simply looks better
from top to bottom the new Nexus 7's
hardware is much better the display was
definitely the biggest disadvantage
before and we probably would have been
happy at the soos and Google only
swapped out the old display and chipset
with newer components but they updated
and improved the hardware all around
where there is virtually no discrepancy
between these two tablets is software
the original may have shipped with
Android 4.1 but both tablets are now
officially running the latest strain of
jellybean version 4.3 they both feature
the same hybrid homescreen interface it
looks like the normal home screen on an
Android phone and portrait when you
rotate to landscape the app door and
shortcut dock cling to the right edge
they both have lock screen widgets
daydream mode multi-user support with
restricted profiles Bluetooth smart
ready and all the other jellybean
improvements the only differences
between the software on these two
sibling tablets are the number of
wallpapers included out of the box no
big deal and performance and that brings
us right into our test notes day to day
performance is quite noticeably
different the new Nexus 7
although powered by Qualcomm's Oder
Snapdragon s4 pro chipset is extra
snappy and everything it does it's a
split second faster than the original
Nexus 7 while you may be thinking that
split second difference isn't all that
noticeable or important and for what
it's worth it may not be to you the
original Nexus 7 no longer feels snappy
nor does it provide smooth polished
performance it stutters all over the
place and is played by sudden
hesitations and hiccups the new model
has yet to give us any real trouble
since freezing and rebooting during the
initial setup process even in synthetic
benchmarks the two tablets are scored
appropriately in the antutu test the new
Nexus 7 consistently scored just shy of
20,000 while the old model struggled to
surpass 12,000 it's the same story with
other benchmarks and in the SunSpider
JavaScript test the original Nexus 7
didn't have a terrible speaker in fact
at the time meaning before the HTC One
and boomsound
it was decent it wasn't easy to cover up
and it had a little bass to it the new
Nexus 7 features dual speakers grills on
both the bottom and top it offers very
little bass so the sound is extra tinny
but it's noticeably louder and just as
difficult to completely cover up it's
quite simple to compare the cameras on
two tablets the original doesn't have a
rear camera and the new one does that
said the new Nexus 7's camera isn't
going to blow anyone away it's a lowly 5
megapixel camera that will work well for
document scanning and other odds and
ends other than that the images will
light proper color reproduction contrast
and detail on paper the original Nexus 7
offers the larger battery a 4325 million
power battery to the 3950 million power
battery with the new Nexus no less
stamina seems to be comparable with what
we remember from our time using the
Nexus 7 extensively the new Nexus 7
stamina especially in standby is
impressive at the time of this recording
our Nexus 7 has 46 percent battery left
after two days and six and a half hours
with nearly 2 hours of screen on time
that includes downloading nearly 2 dozen
applications emailing watching videos
connecting and streaming through
chromecast
browsing the web and posting to Twitter
and Google+ for a more extensive look at
the battery life at the new Nexus 7 keep
your eyes peeled for our full review
towards the end of the week with all the
upgrades of suzhen Google made to this
year's Nexus 7 they managed to keep the
price very close to the original only
$30 more for $199 the original Nexus 7
was a steal and for 229 dollars the new
Nexus 7 is an even better bargain if you
currently own a Nexus 7 and have no
complaints stick with it if you're
having some issues try selling your old
Nexus and upgrading and if you're in the
market for a budget tablet the new Nexus
7 is definitely the best deal around
even if you see remaining stock of the
old models for slash prices we recommend
shelling out the additional cash to get
the latest model if possible both are
great tablets but plain and simple the
newer model is a better tablet in almost
every way that's going to do it for this
