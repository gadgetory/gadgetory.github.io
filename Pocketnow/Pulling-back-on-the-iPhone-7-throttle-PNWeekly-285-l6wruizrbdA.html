your old iPhones and offers up cheaper
battery replacements is this an adequate
response in light of the lack of
disclosure and we're also going to crack
open the pocket now mailbag and answer
your top questions we've got a lot to
talk about it's a comfy pre New Year's
broadcast so make sure you're charged
and ready for episode two eight five of
the pocket now weekly recorded December
29th at noon pacific time this weekly
podcast is where we dissect and discuss
those gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and by this point in your
holiday vacation you were starting to
realize just how much time you had
wasted lounging around i'm juan carlos
back now senior editor at pocketnow.com
joined as always by plucky podcast
producer mr. jules Wong on the east
coast has gone buddy boy well I just got
back from a huge high school reunion
five years so if you're talking about
how old you are right now yeah to flu
definitely feeling all those ears just
rack up you guys you guys did a
five-year high school reunion that's
very ambitious and well I mean we have a
pretty ambitious class leader because
she went to Harvard she basically just
gathered all the people up and said hey
that's the Paulding in this function
room and serve the exact same kind of
food that we had during prom I'm not
sure if it's like the standard fare or
to have you know penny with the marinara
sauce and chicken tenders for prom and
these oh that's terrible we didn't know
our prom was like just basically the
same as homecoming you went and ate at a
restaurant and then came to dance I mean
this time around we had an open bar
that's that's improvement yeah that's
definitely that's definitely progress he
fir for us my graduating class was so
not on the ball that we missed our
10-year reunion and did an eleven year
reunion that's how
not paying attention to anything and how
not ambitious my graduating class was
perfect that's fine with me and just
avoid all the people you really didn't
talk to at high school that's and then
you'll see see them for like five
seconds and then it's like hey and then
I saw the photos of everyone who was
there and like you know what none of my
friends from high school would have been
there I would have been like the
ostracized kid again his own table to
sort of looking at everyone else it
would have been really sad believe it or
not the popular kids are like you know
the people who found their their circles
they they sort of felt the same about
this whole thing then peeps just somehow
managed to cobble together 50 people to
get into that function room so it's
really well done five year five year
high school reunion not just relying on
the Facebook's and the Twitter's to keep
track of people I'm kids every year and
we just got that news report that like
thousands of pounds of avocado just like
got torched in some truck accidents so I
don't know what you mean eating with the
price of our guy rocketing so the other
half of it is gonna be goat cheese so
that's there though that we're doing to
know another reason to be mad at Texas
yeah it's 40,000 pounds of avocado you
know what we're not going to be talking
about for the rest of this podcast is
wacky news about food I think we've got
some technicals all right well if that's
the case then you want to just dig into
our big story I mean we had a light week
at pocket now and just you know trying
to take the holidays for as they are
just being cool and chill and all that
but apparently Apple could keep its cool
with this whole debacle
it's not any new good controversy any
meaty controversy that you should have
in this space you have to have it with
Apple and it's talking about batteries
it's talking about processors it's
talking about these issues where
our people have been finding their
iphone slowing down there the app
lunchtimes not coming up as they used to
be especially when we get on the year
mark two years and it was only last week
that Apple admitted to slowing down the
top processing speeds for its older
iPhones so that would be the iPhone 6s
six there plus models and the iPhone se
I think first wave back in February with
iOS 10 point 2.1 and more recently with
eleven point two we included the iPhone
7 devices with that so all that
happening and they're saying they're
finally saying sorry is what I do with
my Canadian accent sorry sorry we
apologize to any Canadians who may or
may not be listening I stole a Canadian
yeah
and the did it yesterday with this whole
convoluted message
I guess because there was the way that
they termed their apology
we know that feel disappointed from what
we did and newly apologize so I mean you
should apologize that you should have
not been transparent about this practice
in the first place but I mean that's a
that's enough story that we can dig into
later on the share in any case they're
offering free but not free battery place
ins but whatever yeah that was another
thing that got people lit up is that
they're not offering free battery
replacements $79 to $29 and this will
only start from late January and last
through the year of 2018 so I mean there
was talk if I remember correctly
back when the iOS Templar 2 thing was
happening
there was a there was this whole thing
about ambient air getting into the
manufacturing process which was causing
that rates to not properly deliver and
take charge and that caused a sudden
shutdowns and there were rumors back
then that Apple would be doing a free
battery replacement program and then so
it was just that little update that
never mentioned anything about battery
like processor throttling or anything
like that and there was this little arc
this little this little drama I guess
you could say mmm the the whole
disclosed pure process because as far as
we know Apple has only told us about the
their policy this week and Renee Richie
from I more you know through a whole
bunch of dissecting on Twitter with you
know fans talking about this issue when
it first popped up a couple weeks ago he
said that Apple did in depth briefings
on it almost a year ago explaining how
battery age including prematurely which
was being done to prevent spikes and
shutdowns etc tech press knew that's the
insinuation that he's putting out there
and as far as my research goes and as
far as anyone elses does it's the Apple
statement on the issue was that II it
was only the
supposed to stop these random shutdowns
from happening it didn't mention
anything about performing and it didn't
mention anything people like mark Berman
of Bloomberg said you know hey where are
these briefings like were we invited to
them and we had a whole bunch of people
mobile syrup SlashGear wired Wall Street
Journal Washington Post all say about
these briefings so and we you know later
on you know it turns out that I think
Seth Weintraub of nine to five I was
like said that though they were actually
internal briefings too so well and also
it's it's if I really feel cuz anything
Apple does makes news and it's talked
about and is rumored and speculated and
leaked and pushed and pumped that if the
the tone of those conversations and of
those media briefs were of the same
level that we're seeing today I think we
would have seen more traction on those
news pieces back then I doubt very much
that the tone of those conversations was
in illustrating the same type of
situation that we're talking about today
it reeks a lot you remember when we were
going through and tenha gate on the
iPhone 4 and Apple put out those really
helpful videos to show how all phones
can face antenna degradation depending
on how you're holding it sort of
reinforcing the well don't hold your
phone that way if you feel there's a
problem with the antenna and I just
remember I think it was a Motorola or
maybe it was a Nexus and the video they
show has this guy with like the biggest
gorilla hands I had ever seen like like
wrapping all the way around the top of a
phone and to show that the little
antenna bars would go down if if you
just walk around holding your phone like
this you can have the same kind of
antenna degradation as if you just
lightly tap an iPhone 4 right so I think
that they had their points covered and
that that issue was addressed properly
across across the industry all phones
slow down so at Apple we make sure all
phones slowed
so I mean so there's that part of it and
which is just you know the scale of you
know the the ways that they distort
things just to you know have this
narrative of yeah everybody does it and
apples no different and also we're
exceptional in how we manage our phones
across the lifespan of the product so
the response here one I I don't know
about you but did you feel that the the
explanation in the article actually
helped this problem because I feel a big
problem is a problem of disclosure do
you think that their explanation
actually served to educate the public or
do you think that that was more if we
throw a whole bunch of information out
there about how chemical batteries
degrade over time that that will help
obfuscate our actions or our lack of or
our inaction improperly disclosing this
to our customers I mean there will be
the people that accept this and then
there will always be the people that
tear these things apart and they might
have grounds here Apple has been sitting
on this information for a long time is
not directly related the all this
information to the problem at hand which
is slower there's slowdowns and whatnot
for the past however long it was and you
know not letting those consumers know
that they were taking these actions too
you know fraud alone I feel like like
this explanation of how batteries
degrade makes sense as a blog post in
sort of a general discussion forum I
don't feel it was adequate to properly
describe the actions that Apple was
taking on your phone that they were
purposely engaging in a throttling
maneuver like I lack the words I'm it's
a holiday brain a bite yeah but but that
this was inadequate
what it was that Apple was really doing
to your phone how the consumer was not
being properly notified that this is
what they were doing and that these
actions seemed to come at those yearly
intervals where consumers were likely
starting to shop a new phone anyway and
had there been properly proper
disclosure I feel that there would have
been a not insignificant number of
consumers who would have opted for the
ninety dollar battery replacement over
buying a whole new phone and that's been
one of the common threads on the the
replies that I've been getting
personally on Twitter people who are
also upset like I've got an iPhone 5s
why isn't my phone on the list of
devices for a less expensive battery
replacement just goes one of the
passages here first and foremost we have
never and would never do anything to
intentionally show in the life of any
Apple product or degrade the user
experience to drive customer upgrades
like you know the fancy term for planned
obsolescence and we've seen these
reports of you know these benchmarks
being run on iPhone you know v 5s not
been here the fours and what not about
you know the same behavior going on the
same kind of deterioration that has been
fest up to that and as far as you know
Apple's concerned at this point they
already have enough of a brouhaha to
handle and I think their wording there
is very telling we are not purposely
degrading in an effort to encourage new
sales because they are purposely
degrading and it just so happens that
these life cycles of products on their
own come at these yearly intervals it's
me it's it makes me cynical because I
don't believe that everyone at Apple is
working in lockstep is some kind of
grand conspiracy to mess up your phone
and get you to buy the new one mustache
twirl muhahaha
but look at look at their behavior on
things like the iPhone 5 the iPhone 5
had documents
battery problems Apple did not address
the battery problems on the iPhone 5
until just weeks before the launch of
the iPhone 6 well where's your don't
with the iPhone 6 back then reality of
the the circumstance of you know the
product cycle and what is being you know
the intentions and oh I should probably
just get a new iPhone instead I mean the
new ones already out in exactly because
you know right at that time someone was
likely already shopping a new phone so
why would I spend this time to deal with
a warranty issue and go into an Apple
store and swap this phone out and back
up my dad I could just get a new phone
and it's gonna be on contract cuz that's
when we were still doing two-year
contracts so because of actions like
that in the past and where every major
generation of iPhone has had some kind
of issue that the S version fixes it
does make me more cynical as to Apple's
reply here and especially in light of
well it's a cheaper battery replacement
I understand you couldn't do this for
free
probably but I also want to say a
sophomore he wants we enable a toggle
that allows people to use the full power
of their phone again even if it means a
detriment to battery life now that's
where we'll see does Apple actually keep
such a small battery on the smaller
iPhone with like practically no buffer
that it will become a problem because
the the chipsets and Apple phones are
very powerful they're usually a whole
generation ahead of Qualcomm hardware
those a-series processors are great but
on the smaller iPhone they have such
tiny batteries is there no buffer for
that known expected degradation where
the power draw from the CPU can actually
cause the phone to shut off and that's
what I'm curious to see can they
actually enable the full power of this
phone or is this gimped by design
because of the size that they want the
iPhone to come at and then also the idea
of planned obsolescence the timeframe
for which they want you to upgrade to a
newer
phone I suppose was that they do have
the ability to enable full-powered you
know override because they have this
smart intelligent battery technology
just like any other oh yeah should have
that Liana says hey you know let's read
the age of the battery oh it's this game
but but I want to see you know because
we know that the the amount of juice
that you can pump out of a two-year old
battery does degrade over time too
and we know that on the smaller iPhone
Apple puts in the bare minimum battery
capacity to help you make it through a
day and so after say two years of that
battery starting to wear down you're
having to charge it every day you're
maybe down to like 80% of its original
capacity is it still we're talking about
monthly probably drive the the CPU
because it's not round the battery
you'll see that often reboot yeah every
you know it's those freak you know
there's peak events where sometimes they
need that like the flash on a camera
that typically needs a reservoir power
or a sudden burst of power and that may
you know trigger where those events I'm
just saying for example but in terms of
being modeling specs around capacity of
a battery
I mean Apple continues Ezra wanted to
continue to be doing this with rumored
true depth camera face ID and such
permits going on into the 2019 phone
iPhones and they're planning on
extending their battery cell technology
to a to cell unit there's a whole bunch
of complicating factors as we go into
the future to see what kind of you know
processing that they do and whether or
not people tell you know Apple tells
people about them about that because if
there's a way that one cell could be
used instead of the other and like you
won't have to deal with having to
replace batteries all the time and
I mean there is a chance for Apple to
come out of this with you know a better
you know a clean slate or a better sleep
than they had before just from you know
actually innovating yeah I this this is
this is where I think the smartphone
industry in general is facing some
growing pains
you use a phrase I'm just picking on
this phrase specifically because of my
idea on smartphones plateauing but
actually innovating you know I think
we're in a very iterative climate for
all smartphone manufacturers where we're
seeing some cool design changes we're
seeing things like different aspect
ratio screens marginal bumps to camera
quality you know some nice bumps to
processing power but I'm not seeing that
kind of revolutionary exciting evolution
of these products it's usually like
little touches here little touches there
and refinement and I think that's kind
of where we're at and Apple Apple stands
to be hurt by this most of all if if
they can't keep convincing consumers
emotionally that jumping on to the
newest iPhone is is the lifestyle
upgrade that they need and it's things
like this you know when it comes out
that they're degrading performance over
time right around the time that you'd be
upgrading your phone trying to push that
upgrade it's sort of a double whammy to
the emotional identity the lifestyle
identity of a brand like Apple well so
I'm wondering why now why do I might
choose now to have all this put out and
why do I even respond to it when this
has been an ongoing controversy for
years when this could have been stemmed
off this could have been you know this
controversy could have been prevented by
just explicitly stating that's you know
you're slowing it down for this benefit
of pain that we could have bypassed here
and I'm not sure where Apple finds the a
way out of this
just biting it in late December 2017
well I you know it's it just takes a
while for any idea I mean if we're
talking about like viral videos and
memes this is what's happening with
Apple right now it takes it takes time
for that critical mass to hit and so
anecdotally there's always been that
idea new software slows down your older
phone your battery degrades over time
your phone just wears out heat kills
electronics especially if your phone's
like being used for a lot of gaming it's
running it really hot and so we have all
of this fog of conversation that's very
anecdotal very colloquial very
conversational and it took just a couple
key elements cuz who was it that put out
the article initially about actually
testing the performance of iPhones over
time it wasn't be G give me a second
here I think that was was Geekbench but
private labs yeah but but when we
actually saw some kind of procedural
method for testing this claim and so it
took a while even from then for that
conversation to reach some sort of
jumping-off point and because of that
whole fog that actually served as
kindling you know all of these people
that had these sort of notions about
their phone slowing down are gonna be
attuned to someone making a claim about
actual interference on their device and
it's coming at the perfect time just in
general with stories about people who
are concerned about apps using the
microphone on your phone to listen in on
your conversations companies that are
intercepting web traffic at the ISP
level to feed you ads and try and get
you to upgrade your modem this is all in
the zeitgeist right now so a major
manufacturer interfering with your
device without disclosing what they're
doing that's a trigger point right now
so you add that to the general
perception of your phone slowing down
how expensive these phones are getting
you know thousand-dollar smartphones
were in that
now you mash all of that together give
it just a little time to kind of smolder
and then it sets off ablaze and that's
where we're seeing I think the response
right now I think now was the time
because of all of those factors coming
together like they did well I mean other
factors for sure definitely
you know cling on and add weight to the
situation but I've seen many different a
you know in an empirical not empirical
but you know statistical you know
breakdowns of this whole thing over and
over again and along with you know the
reddit threads and the Twitter outrage
and it's like I mean d2l did all those
other things really took things over
just that just by being themselves
no not not just by being themselves but
what I what I mean is I think it's just
the combination of a series of events
that leads to Apple being in the wrong
place at the wrong time for this to be a
story they could control and thought
that there were 20 possible conspiracies
yeah well and we're ready for it
you know like politics is crazy right
now science discussion is kind of crazy
right now
consumer electronics chat is kind of
crazy right now and now is the right
time for this kindling to actually
ignite and this is the wrong time for
Apple to think that they could control
that part of the narrative a year ago
apparently they were able to now now
this story has gotten out of their
control and we can always see how
companies do a terrible job of replying
to these types of issues again if they
have just disclosed this property to
consumers and given them some stupid
toggle switch you know a what do you
call a placebo button varied in their
settings the FCC daren't leave the
Pacific open because that itself would
be dissected over and over again well
but that's just it is like again the
disclosure on this is what kills
companies this this is when they when
they put mechanics like this operating
in the background and then those
mechanics are discovered it looks 10
times worse than if they had just told
you up front and you could have been
annoyed about it but look at how many
times especially for iPhone users
they're annoyed by something but yeah
they'll still buy the next one winner
yeah I don't think that would have been
a sales depressant as opposed to taking
your chance in court for 999 billion
dollars whatever there's in class
actions are going for these days
so yeah it's so I guess at this point
there's nothing we can do but look
forward batter paid replacements have
free is the data spate like I always ten
point two point one they promised that
there would be a little indicator that
said that the battery started would need
replacing in which case I mean what if
there was that indicator why didn't that
show up or why well like wasn't more
reporting being done on that kind of
thing where and where does that lie in
conjunction with the throttling
practices here well I mean that's that's
kind of its kind of difficult to unpack
until we see what Apple sets the
thresholds at you know if a phone is six
months old and then it starts to show
battery degradation and the phone is
egging you on to go and get your battery
replaced that's gonna be a very
frustrating situation for people who
have thousand-dollar phones so so it I
don't know that we'll be able to comment
on that until we see what their actual
solution resembles in real-world views
but you know I'm already planning some
probably by the end of 2018 I'll throw
my iphone se out and get the batteries
swapped out because I love that little
phone I'll be curious to see if a future
iOS update starts telling me oh hey dude
your tiny little phone needs a new
battery what's that what what that's
going to resemble is is gonna make a
huge difference to me in whether or not
it's a useful feature or if it's another
annoying cynical thing that Apple can
try and convince us to spend yet even
more money on their products
yeah so so there's that they're gonna
introduce a new interface a new and
improved interface for battery health as
well and other than the the replace do
you think the timeframe of the
replacement program any bit wrong here
or like is God in any aspect I mean not
not on its face I I just would have
preferred something that was a more
open-ended policy given the nature of
their transgression III really feel for
people because I know there is a not in
second insignificant number of people
still on the iPhone 5 and 5s and leaving
them out was to me kind of a kind of a
crappy thing to do alright so there's
all that um I'm wondering at this point
how much pain loss of war like useful
worth in an iPhone and loss of
productivity as a result these defend
these plaintiffs claim and you know if a
judge will be swayed by this I mean
what's your take on the legal argument
here oh I think there is there is a
significant legal argument to be made
again all they needed to do was say that
this was a mechanic that operated on
your phone and they wouldn't have had
any problems I don't think there would
have been any grounds for legal action
the fact that this was excluded excuse
me from any kind of TOS I think now you
do have an argument to be made it's just
whether or not you can face down Apple's
lawyers or you can convince them that
enough people are pissed off that
they'll just settle to get it out of the
news cycle as quickly as possible that
we're I don't think they can do that
though our when we start looking at the
differences in trade and regulation
especially throughout Europe it's the
the French the the lawsuit that's going
on in France right now that I think is
very compelling as to how this is going
to be treated throughout the EU and
right now Apple isn't a very popular
company in the EU B
of things like tax dodging so any
opportunity that those regulators have
in sticking it to Apple I think they're
gonna take those opportunities and run
with them as hard as they can which is
going to tie up Apple's legal team for a
significant amount of time as they sort
of have to deal out different penalties
and different solutions for different
markets your if they have two different
two different Devils here it's tax
evasion and privacy which splits Apple
between the rest of the company is
because if you can't have one you have
to have another we're not a little port
with using the PN weekly hash tag
besides having bigger batteries Android
phones are using higher core count big
little configuration since forever if
your cores running at medium are more
energy efficient than one or two turbo
power the Apple a series is starting to
do this they I don't think they used to
prior to like the a seven or eight now
they're they have more cores and they're
splitting it between I think it's a two
and four kind of performance and of
medium thing going on there but in any
case I just wanted as a policy within
itself of just being able to limit the
processing power if you know if need be
policy for Android Oh Ian's that to
maybe a dot or something like that or at
least provide the option to you I mean
and I try the logistics on be for that
it was it was in um it was an Android
land because you know this is something
that Google only recently started
tackling to I would say with with nuga
some of the advanced power management
settings but manufacturers would put on
their own low-power modes
you know extended runtime modes and then
ultra-low power I mean Samsung really
made a lot of noise about their
two-stage you know you could kind of
reduce stuff and keep things from
running in the background and then if
you were down to like your last 10
percent will shut everything off on this
phone and try to keep your battery lat
lasting as long as possible
and we uh yeah but that's not a
practical way to use
phone on a daily basis if you're using
what there was there especially like
galaxy s2 and galaxy s3 era where
anything that you would do to kind of
restrict the functionality of the device
we would customize and do it ourselves
and so especially getting into like the
s4 era I used to run my phone in
low-power mode for most of the day just
because you know LTE was such a new tech
and if you caught you were you were
stuck between different towers or you're
cycling and switching from 3G to 4G now
your battery would just get wrecked and
so you know there were times where I
would manually activate that just to
make sure that my phone would last the
day and I would use it that way
throughout the day so there are have
already been ideas of this kind of user
management I mean not exactly the same
I'm using this as an analogy to what
we're expecting Apple to do in terms of
just reactivating full performance on an
iPhone but it's not something that's a
totally alien or a totally foreign
concept to the smartphone market it's
just something that Apple used to
convince their customers you didn't have
to worry about we managed the
performance of your phone so you can
just touch square get app now I think
iOS users are confronted with the notion
of some kind of oil change like
maintenance as their phones age and this
is something that they've been sold on
that they didn't have to do but if you
want the to really maximize the
investment of an iPhone it's something
you now need to pay attention to yeah
PN weekly from Andrew Wallace with
Apple's recent battery throttling issues
I hope that OMS more early and start
offering battery replacements for older
devices for feed to some extent
third-party services may be able to do
that your local repair shop for example
Peter Hayden in response to that it
would look great to offer this service
by guess Oh Liam's probably don't like
the supercycle they don't like super
size and I therefore like a weather
front so if they were to just put out
something like this it would cause like
a peak
of that service and therefore I guess
they will come here find some new rather
than repair all their phones I think
again the novelty may be produced with
the new product I mean because like you
and we've seen the shattered glass
replacement yeah so I mean something
like that I think will actually be taken
advantage of very very little because
you think about for the generations you
know add a fan of the show Kyle Ruggles
photographer up in North he you know he
was actually tweeting with me about just
you know hey remember the v20 had a
removable battery was like the last
premium phone of its era that still had
that ability and you know I doubt very
many people really took advantage of
features like that so if a company were
to come out and say hey we're doing a
low-cost battery replacement program for
older phones there could be a noticeable
effect on sales of newer phones but I
seriously doubt it will actually tank
you know a company's forecast and if
anything else will just serve to
reinforce why a customer should do
business with that company and then
they'll just go off and buy the new
phone instead of getting the battery
replacement anyway I mean right now no
again makes a good point
how many two-year old phones still get
updates on Android and they and as far
as we know Motorola and HTC don't
explicitly put down their processors so
yeah they both publicly display claims
they do not engage in throttling and and
of course the reply to that is just well
in Android land how about we focus on
instead of thumb you know beating our
chests and patting ourselves on the back
for not throttling phones maybe we
should be a bit more attentive to things
like updating older phones so they can
remain competitive at a time where
privacy and security issues are key
among a lot a lot of consumers you know
even just getting bug fixes and security
patches
how many two-year old phones still get
updates on Android
how many 18-month old phones are still
getting you no actual software attention
so I mean I wouldn't be for users are
you happy well and and again that moto
was acting like they were being so
magnanimous yeah it's our mistake so
we're gonna do the Moto G for plus
because we said so and it was like yeah
because we said so if we don't do it now
we'll get sued but that's not like
that's not holding your own company to
any kind of standard that's just cya man
because I don't even expect a two year
old Android phone to keep getting major
operating system updates but but how
many security threats there are out
there to not be delivering security
patches and bugs it's anything they
don't make enough clear you know a clear
guideline for that because again
bringing up Motorola they say that the
mid-range err phones are only guaranteed
a one year window for OS updates and
that was something that was new to us so
is the public perception this is a from
and Rousseff slack using the PN weekly
hash tag people need to hold Apple
accountable if Samsung or HTC did this
everyone would be flipping out we can't
keep letting Apple get free passes to do
whatever they want and and this is this
is the thing I'll be curious to see
we're in the era of the thousand dollar
phone I do get some people grumbling
about some of the the issues and bugs on
the iPhone 10 that iOS 11 still hasn't
been completely cleaned out of some
issues regarding the performance of that
phone and now we get this type of
disclosure from Apple that they engaged
in a non disclosed throttling program
supposedly for consumer benefit is this
something that will resonate enough that
someone who was planning on buying an
iPhone decides that they're not gonna
buy a new iPhone and I doubt that that's
the case there is no competition for the
iPhone if I'm if I'm mad at Sony I can
go and buy a ZTE or Huawei or a Samsung
or an HTC or any other number of device
if I'm if I'm mad at one Android
manufacturer I can go spend my money
somewhere else I can vote with my wallet
and not have to leave my ecosystem if
I'm mad at Apple I'm kind of stuck
that's it no I don't expect that a lot
of people are gonna switch ecosystems
just because there was a problem and
we've seen this consistently iPhone 4
antenna gate iPhone 5 battery problems
iPhone 6 bendgate and sales have still
been growing sales have still been
climbing and Apple has probably the top
of customer retention of any
manufacturer out there yeah I mean
they're still raising up those
conversion rates from Android so that's
uh you know if anything the competition
right there was gonna be a little bit
too Apple sided but in a few moments we
will be talking about potential changes
in competition on the tail end of this
whole net neutrality repeal what the FCC
did we're gonna rehash this thing one
more time for 2017 but not before we
give a little shout-out to our sponsor
yes and this week's episode of the
PocketNow weekly is brought to you by
oopsy this sponsor could not have picked
a better time to sponsor this podcast
that was up C up C I've been saying
oopsie I apologize tremendously if I've
been saying this wrong but up C actually
makes sense to I say oopsy though
because this year is the first year in
working tech in many years that I've
actually damaged the review devices did
you know that many retailers mark up
warranties on the items they sell B to
anyway we're gonna take that all over
again did you know that many retailers
mark up warranties on the items you buy
anywhere from one to five hundred
percent in fact most people don't
realize it's where most big-box
retailers make a majority of their
profits meanwhile you have no idea
what's covered by your warranty and you
know that receipt is going to wind up in
a shoe box in your closet never to be
again thankfully there's a better way
started by a guy who learned the ins and
outs of the warranty industry and was
tired of consumers getting screwed at
the register oopsey sells you up to 70%
on what oopsy saves you up to 70% on
warranties versus traditional retailers
so you know exactly what's covered
before you buy better yet oopsey will
save all your warranties and receipts in
one convenient place you can even use
oopsy to protect the items you buy
including holiday gifts weeks after you
buy them now that's actually a pretty
big deal because my wife was actually
considering holding on to the pixel too
until a bunch of other things went wrong
with that phone but one of the things
that turned her off was we couldn't
transfer the phone and reappear warranty
the only solution Google had was to
return the phone wait for the refund
which took weeks and then rebuy the
phone
adding the warranty at the time of
purchase and so she instead went with a
huawei p10 head on over to poopsie calm
that's ups.com and use the promo code
pocket now for 10% off your first
purchase
that's oopsy calm promo code pocket now
and with the free oopsy app you can
purchase coverage access your account
information and start the claims process
all with the push of a button from your
phone oopsie comm pocket now promo code
10% off your first purchase and we thank
them for supporting the pocket now
weekly we do indeed and with that out of
the way I think it's time that we get
into our monthly mailbag summit at
segments monthly a mailbag segment and
as always you can yeah you
can send your email send your questions
that we'll get to you at the end of the
month using the email address I was
about to say hashtag gain weekly but
that's not what we do we do have a
couple tweets using the PM weekly
hashtag and I'm gonna throw into the
mailbag - yeah indeed
so podcast at pocketnow.com we would
love to see an old fashioned few
paragraphs about what gets your gears
grinding and what not so definitely send
this send a thought or two you along to
us we'll definitely read it and we start
off this episode with a little thing
about snitch parody in competition from
Kristen Lindsey hi guys do you think the
repeal of net neutrality will resolve we
take that from the top again
just like you hi guys do you think the
repeal of net neutrality will result in
more competition for ISPs and that the
consumer might actually benefit from it
it seems logical that some providers
might want to offer better packages at
lower rates to increase their business
Thanks so what do you think Jules do you
think there's the potential for
increased competition that's the
groundwork of things but when we get
into what these ISPs they're actually
doing they're gobbling up lots of media
companies and they're bundling backs
into what they're offering because if
they can be the producer as well as the
distributor and they already have the
infrastructure for that that's amazing
and they can you know they can kind of
get synergies from that so I in terms of
offering just basic service I don't you
know they will have less of a motivation
to do that just from the fact that they
can always you know build upon it and
bring these packages and get margins so
there's always that but but it's not
just because you know you can't just say
more competition results in you know
lower prices always because we're seeing
this right now in the cellular industry
in the US with Sprint and t-mobile
walking away from
merger and we would have seen a vastly
better Network on both ends where both
have generally been disparaged by many
tests across several years and this
would have put them in line with its 18
teams risin this would have put them in
line in terms of subscriber numbers as
well and instead well
Softbank decided to walk away and keep
ownership of Sprint and now what they're
trying to do at Sprint's is just cut
back on the promos and start investing
in their network again and they're
facing plenty of challenges in that
process they have bond maturities that
they need need to pay up soon and 5g is
going to take at least a couple of years
to you know trickle down and get to the
towers and already 18t Verizon and
t-mobile have plans for next year so
yeah it's it's a they're facing a
challenge and they're keeping prices
there they're playing on keeping prices
up Sprint has been the cut-rate
provider for cellular for a long time
they've been you know pushing it down
$85 for unlimited 7060 at one point
fifty and now they're kind of going I
got the bit and that has always allowed
carriers to play around in lower Rangers
than they usually have you know if you
know $100 a service bundle package maybe
we can drop that down to 90 or 80
Verizon did that with its unlimited plan
they had they started out with an $80
plan just after the vitriol of t-mobile
of John Ledyard you know just you know
calling them out they finally caved
which is a good which was a good thing
and now we're also seeing t-mobile which
has all started to compete in prices
they've started you know bundling up
these services from third parties like
Netflix and and Google Wi-Fi they didn't
efflux and then sprinted Hulu was that
the partnership that they did yes sprit
did Hulu because
who need their I mean they're trying so
their sprint is like their tagline
should be well bless them they're trying
their hearts as they say in the south so
I mean getting like they're keeping the
line on prices because at the you know
at some point they have to start
reinvesting in their network yeah where
are their analysts are saying that's T&amp;amp;T
and Verizon might you know just start a
you know going back up as well so where
especially as we show the fact this is
going to be a tough one
yeah so Krista the the reason why I'm
skeptical that we'll see an increasing
competition we did not have net
neutrality as an actual regulatory as
regulatory leverage until 2015 I feel
that we can look to the wire the the ISP
and wireless industry prior to 2015 so
I'm from 2004 to 2014 and see if we can
detect any trends and the trends that I
think a lot of us would see would be
instead of trying to actually compete
for customer dollars most Internet
service providers engaged in policy that
allowed them to either merge acquire or
to cordon off neighborhoods to prevent
competition
I think the LA market is an excellent
example of that where we're served by
several large ISPs but none of them
compete directly so if you're in an 18 t
u-verse area you cannot get Time Warner
Cable or now its spectrum they I live in
it's been able to the zip code yeah well
and it's very much like germ
gerrymandering a district politically
you just carve up these areas and that
will prevent you from actually needing
to compete on service instead you have a
de facto monopoly over that area and
that's the practice that we saw these
companies in gay
net neutrality really won't address
competition on the ground directly like
that if the Internet is regulated like a
service or like electricity or like
water like a resource like that
eventually we could make the argument
that you know if it's a utility then we
can loosen up on some of the
restrictions for things like telephone
pole access or how we dig trenches to
run fibre to home things like that but
that's not really the first wave of what
net neutrality is going to address title
2 regulation really I don't think we'll
have a near term effect on that kind of
policy ultimately I would prefer a free
market solution but deregulating at the
top right now with the way that the
United States has carved up into
different media districts and very few
areas have any kind of real competition
I think it's something like 18 percent
of the country is still unserved by any
solution and 20 percent of the market is
served by only one cable or Internet
solution so almost 40% of the United
States has zero or one company that they
can do business with to get on to the
Internet
and so ultimately what what I'm looking
at for competition if we really want to
improve competition I actually do very
much agree with the libertarian idea
that there is too much regulation net
neutrality isn't the regulation we
should be afraid of um if you know title
2 regulation is what gave us competition
in the telephone space and was you know
how we leveraged divestiture breaking up
mom paw Bell if you if you're on Sprint
t-mobile or Verizon they wouldn't exist
if we hadn't broken up 18 T and that was
through government regulation and so
ultimately the regulations that we need
to start chipping away at are the state
and city regulations that prevent
competition I think Colorado is an
excellent example of of communities
banned
together banding together to start
trying to offer municipal
taxpayer-funded God banned because major
corporations weren't getting it done it
you need to start lobbying to let Google
Fiber into your neighborhoods because
the only time we've seen cable companies
and AT&amp;amp;T
really start fighting and competing on
service and price are in areas where
another outlet is already offering fiber
and so if we start from the bottom up
eventually we'll get to a point where we
won't be as afraid of net neutrality
style violations but if we just
deregulate the industry from the top
down then the major players in this
market who are already winners in this
market will have free reign to craft
whatever policy they want and they're
not accountable to the people they're
only accountable to their shareholders
because if anything private and people
in general just resent publicly owned
stuff and would never want to use it but
they end up using anyway some benefit
benefiting it off of it sort of like how
China knew somehow was able to get a
fiber network laid out just because so
if you're a patriot you should care
about this the Chattanooga story is
amazing because one of the things that
helped get their municipal broadband
initiative off the ground was a great
apartment of energy it was Tom Brady at
arm on Tom Brady he's just slinging
fiber all over all over Chattanooga know
the thing that's exciting about
Chattanooga was part of the grant that
helped build that network was was footed
by the Department of Energy because they
were looking at fibre broadband networks
being the backbone of a new power grid
for the United States the United States
energy grid is so old and is so decrepit
that if a foreign interest were to knock
out I think something like six or seven
processing nodes that that sort of join
parts of the network together you could
leave half of the country
without power for weeks that's how
precarious the situation has become and
the main tool at our disposal is fibre
to home where we would be able to
intelligently control the
of power at a granular level from home
to to power node and and that to me is
really the exciting part of trying to
move forward with municipal funded
broadband is because through the power
company now we have this as a legit
resource as as a legit utility for
something that we all depend on and then
I feel companies can compete on top of
that if a company can compete better
than your power company do business with
them but I think the bare minimum
standard should be broadband delivered
through the same resource that power
comes from so that way we can actually
improve on our aging infrastructure yeah
and if you want to learn more about this
a further reading I would suggest Ted
couples that lights out good book on
that topic so you have one tweet from
Joel GJ just asking a question that I
think is worth following up on a hashtag
P and weekly then there's the factor of
the power of the FTC to go against these
bad business practices and the reason
why I feel the FTC is inadequate is
because the FTC can't set policy like
the FCC can and as long as a company
discloses its business practices the FTC
can't go after them for violating so as
long as it's only real and as long as
the company discloses we will throttle
Netflix and they put that in the Terms
of Service the FTC has no regulatory
power that business is doing business by
the terms of the service agreement
whereas the FCC actually will have
regulatory power over the industry to
craft policy and look at what potential
consumer abuses can come that aren't
just disclosures in your Terms of
Service
the FTC isn't necessarily a bad play but
it's woefully inadequate to address the
actual regulatory abuses that we see
today and we've seen since 2004 so there
you go
I understand that you also have a couple
of other tweets that the hashtag and so
one of the things I want to expand on a
little bit
last week we talked about potential
YouTube competitors and Andrew Wallace I
think we mentioned it during the
broadcast but I saved it because I
wanted to see if we could expand on the
conversation a little bit more
hashtag peon weekly how could Amazon
have a different monetization strategy
from YouTube and be successful in
serving smaller content creator V videos
aka the million dollar question had he
make money with these videos on the
internet and do battle against an entity
like like YouTube mmm I would say
subsidize it I think it's one of the
things that you have to eat you have to
be willing to make profits elsewhere
just to support something that has that
improves your position as you know were
these good person companies that stands
up for consumers when you know what
consumers want and their rights and just
you know it's sort of like how a lot of
TV networks used to you know news was a
loss making for them and they subsidize
that with successful ratings and dramas
and other primetime programming so yes I
think for maybe the first time in in our
history as being co-producers on this
podcast I am completely in agreement
with you like literally 100% my answer
to that was don't worry about trying to
make an Amazon tube successful and
monetized as its own separate entity but
tie that into the affiliates program
that Amazon already offers and use that
as a loss leader so that people can go
consume video on Amazon they'll still
get ad revenue from whatever they put on
those videos but then it becomes a
secondary benefit where people are
giving Amazon information their viewing
habits and Amazon can target those
people with better products and services
on the back end I mean I know you're not
503 see a 503 seed company but it's like
you you have the
if you have the Board of Directors
support and you have the mission for it
then go do it and somewhere along the
while lying you'll be able to justify
that in the bounce books so oh really so
uh this this one comes from I'm so gonna
butcher this lag Nate this last name
from Diego a bus by Li III was just sort
of posting some random news on my
personal Twitter account and one of the
stories that I found very disappointing
over this last week was a LastPass
the Android LastPass Authenticator app
apparently has this hugely open security
flaw that is easily replicatable where
if even if you don't put in your
password you can kind of get around it
just by pushing settings and then push
more information and then you can get
through on the backend and apparently
this this was a situation that had been
going on for some time the person who
discovered the flaw reached out to
LastPass directly didn't hear anything
from them and I think after a week with
no action taken published his own blog
post on a hacker site hacker noon
dot-com and so Diego dropped us the
comment upset that only after threats of
disclosure did LastPass decide to take
action on this again disclosure seems to
be the big problem with a lot of
companies I don't know about you Jules
but if you had a security app on your
phone and they got out ahead of a
security threat notified you told you
what the threat was don't you think you
would have more faith in that app would
you want to do the disclosing yeah
exactly
or do you want this discovered by
someone who's not gonna disclose the
security threat and just exploit the
security threat on device yeah so and
the story becomes 50 million accounts
have been compromised because of this
data breach that that's a way worse
story then the headline LastPass
discovers security flaw in Authenticator
app
yeah very disappointed and and you know
we were just seeing progress Android Oh
opening up support for these types of
security apps and password managers and
stuff and like this is a bad look for a
company in my opinion where they're not
getting ahead of their own problems and
ahead of their own PR for something
I mean we've regarded these sorts of
security authentication programs is like
it like a next frontier that we're not
you know we don't have to remember
passwords anymore and that this would be
the ultimate security safeguard looking
to be this way because it falls down to
every you know the least common
denominator which is not fixing things
constantly total cos that if you're not
looking for a problem someone else will
yeah well I not not to plug my other
podcast but the book that we read this
month was little brother by Cory
Doctorow he's I think he's an editor
over at Boeing Boeing still but he
writes a lot about these types of issues
like security and privacy and copyright
and in that book there's this this line
like the best security of security out
in the open if you think you can hide
how your security works then all
someone's gonna do is break it keep it
quiet and then exploit the flaw in your
security the best thing is you know sort
of sunlight is the best disinfectant and
so hopefully LastPass gets their acting
gear there cuz they're a pretty well
respected name for this type of solution
they better well alright so so I got a
tweet here from Russell Santos what do
you think about how we're doing segments
I we've kind of backed off real audio
reviews real camera reviews but this
comes from at Rachel's dad since we are
living amidst a dongle Revolution house
here's an idea for a new video how about
you use one phone and compare different
universal dongles Google has well an
essential has one razor and then you can
also compare them against no-name
dongles like this and he he links like
another five dollar
USB see audio dongle what do you think
tolls
is that something that people are really
clamoring for is more others a man at
least one video on this and I'm not you
know a little glib there but I'm not
joking because Google has always made
the case for us BC spec adherence and
hey you know it's been the thing I'm
doing that it has a dongle that can work
with any USB C port and frankly speaking
if everyone just followed a damn spec
and you know not you know customize
their ports to be you know I I don't
even think Thunderbolt 3 should be a
thing if anything that should be the
standard USB C spec I know it there
would be more cost to it but you know if
if we're talking about a universal
standard why not just making Thunderbolt
3 by any case cuz you know I want that I
want that bad but I wonder is there a
way to do or mobile Thunderbolt I always
kind of felt like you needed that full
front-end pci bus infrastructure to have
like full support for thunderbolt like
that's why you SBC USB 3 I should say is
is easier to implement in mobile devices
yeah I should be clear USB you know I'm
wondering at the 3.1 spec is now then
well there's a whole bunch of yeah that
that complicates things but in general
we're in the aching growing pain stage I
think this is a series that would be
good for at least a few videos I I'll
have to see what we confront because
buying them shouldn't be a problem I
think we're talking about like $50 worth
of pretty much so I'll take that first
pin I'll see if I can pull that out and
um the the last tweet that I want to
want to get you with the PN weekly hash
tag this this is a I'm gonna put you on
the spot here Jules 2017 pretty good
year for phones we're getting excited
for next year's phone
this is coming from Alberto 9 3 2 4
quick question if you had to use a phone
from 2016 as your daily driver which one
and then I have a follow-up question
right after that what for well for if we
were to set this for the next year I
would say the HTC 10 and what phone from
2015 would you use I I was I was about
to swear here and I would bet I'll tell
you to flip off let's see freak freak
cuz that's that's the Snapdragon 810
year and I just don't wanted that and
what was that that was the iPhone 6s it
was it was a better year for the iPhone
6s than for Android so I guess I would
go with an iPhone 6s okay so my answers
last year 2016 phone I would use the LG
v20 I just go back to my LG v20 which
got a lot of use last year already and
my answer for 2015 would be to skip all
of them and go back to a Galaxy Note 4
ooh back to a 2014 phone instead of
using any phones from 2015 that would be
my answer I mean you're you're kind of
cheating but I mean that is I guess
that's still an acceptable answer that
it'd be I'd accepted and then just to
wrap us all up on this mailbag and I
want to thank everyone who submitted
questions and tweeted us with the p-n
weekly hash tag this is from at fat
produce friend of the show Andrew
Wallace end of the year exclamation
point
what are your dream phones for the end
of 2017
well Renato Renato writes the Nokia 3310
coordinate orgy so that's his dream
phone what what what a you're on a pixel
two-man isn't that your dream phone for
2017
I'm on a canal - and where the Freak is
my essential phone there it is why
wouldn't you pick up the essential I saw
you I saw you uh posted a photo of that
uh was it last week yeah I think it was
last week up in New Hampshire and I
wanted to take advantage of Sprint's
$145 thing going on but it was just such
a hard time to get it through I sprint
said it would ship by December 20 and
then they pushed me back to January 3rd
and I was like nope so I bought it I
bought for Best mobile for $480 and now
I am paint and when that well now I have
this on the credit card and also the
rest of the v20 that I still have
technically on the line for Sprint so
yeah hurry for me
hooray for you I don't know I'm I'm kind
of torn this was this was a good year
for phones but I still kind of feel like
no one has made the perfect one phone
the LGV 30 gets stupid close I still
very much enjoy the combination of V 30
and huawei mate just like last year it
was V 20 and mate 9 this year the two
phones I kind of pick up the most or the
V 30 and the the May 10 but there's
still these little things like when we
flew to Albuquerque for Thanksgiving it
was all about my where is it it's over
here is all about my little xperia I
loved traveling with this phone when I
was out at a Eva was all about my
blackberry keen one just knowing I would
have you know crazy long battery life
ai ai ai I kind of want to mash up look
like I need to smush all these phones
into one that's the advantage well
because you're using it for different
you know purposes they're traveling with
them or whatnot and then you you have
the data count one for your you know
photoshoots so I think that's uh you
know it's one of the advantages of being
in the position that you are just really
you know text
I think and also totally acknowledging
my use is completely atypical how people
normally use their phones for what you
have and maybe just maybe we'll be able
to get our hands on that main 10 Pro at
CES in more than a week away yeah that's
uh maybe just maybe those fingers close
paper crossed well folks I think we're
gonna put a pin in it this episode of
