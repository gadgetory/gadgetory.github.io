of all shapes and sizes but Apple of
course does something different I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is the unboxing and first look at the
Apple watch I know we've been dropping a
lot of unboxings on you recently folks
but not to worry a review just landed
for the idol 3 our review process is
still underway for the Huawei p8 and
we're about to show you a first look at
the LG g4 but the Apple watch is the
most important wearable to hit the scene
in 2015 so let's see what it's like when
you actually get hold of one to begin
with the box is absurdly long and unlike
most Apple products the watch doesn't
appear front and center when you pop the
lid off instead you get a long white
plastic capsule and once you peel away
the plastic film on the outside it calls
to mind the container that Apple ships
its ear pods in it seems kind of cheap
to ship such an expensive accessory in a
plastic box but then again this is the
comparatively low-end
Apple watch sport beneath the capsule is
a cardboard carrier containing an
additional watch band for small and
medium sizes a brief instructional
pamphlet and the usual warranty info all
of it done up in this long stretched
format which if nothing else fits in
with everything else finally there's the
magnetic inductive charger and
thankfully a wall adapter this isn't a
watch that makes you plug into your
computer or use your smart phone adapter
popping open the box itself we get our
first look at the Apple watch sport
complete with its white floral elastomer
band it's a fancy word and all but
honestly I've seen the watch with other
bands affixed and I think the band is
probably gonna be the first thing I
change out so taking it out of the box
you notice it's not the chintzy rubber
found on say a low-end Timex or
something but something a bit more
substantial and substantial is a good
word for the mass as well this doesn't
feel like a toy even with the
entry-level band on it you get some
instructions for how to a fix the watch
to your wrist right on the back of the
protective film and having taken that
advice in we'll go ahead and remove that
now quiet please for the deal AM cam
the watch hardware is surprising the
sport versions aluminium casing has a
powder coated looking finish and the 42
millimeter version we have here is
portly without seeming ungainly the
sensor window on the back protrudes from
the casing as does the display cover
glass up front and everything on it
bears apples trademark attention to
detail from the precision cut notches on
the knurled digital crown to the subtle
soiree on the peg clasp all this keen
observation nearly made me forget the
instructions on how the band works but
fortunately it's a simple enough watch
to strap on and again that fluoro
elastomer band surprises me with its
smooth feel the excess slides easily
underneath itself and it seems I won't
need to break out the smaller band
included in the Box this is a good fit
for my average-sized wrist if you don't
like to bother with instructions
powering on the watch is a simple matter
of picking one of the two buttons on the
side
protip it's not the digital crown but
the other one and after a lengthy first
boot you're prompted to start the Apple
watch app on your iPhone to kick off the
pairing process unlike most bluetooth
pairing approaches which can be kind of
a headache
this one prompts you to take a picture
of the Apple watch with the watch app
which sounds weird but it pairs the two
devices in seconds it's really cool
then you're taken through the expected
setup steps enter your Apple ID agree to
the phone books worth of terms and
conditions authorize Siri and location
that a passcode all that stuff then
you're asked if you want to install all
apps this is another convenience the
iPhone will search every app you have
installed on the phone and if there's a
watch compatible version it'll ship it
over to the watch right away this sync
process happens in the background and
when it's done you get a little tap on
the wrist letting you know much like the
tap that gets your attention when you've
got a notification waiting and like
everyone says it's not a vibration but a
tiny almost playful little flick
there are a ton of differences between
the Apple watch and it's wearable
competition and not a few similarities
to but those observations will have to
wait for our full review which will
include everything from force touch to
sending heartbeats for now it just feels
nice to have the world's fastest selling
wearable on our wrists and you can bet
we'll be taking a lot of notes in the
days ahead to bring that experience to
you oh and one last thing if you're like
me this will be important to you yes you
can delete the Mickey Mouse watch face
call me a killjoy but that felt pretty
good if you want to know something
specific about the Apple watch hit us up
in the comments below but if you're just
there to start a platformer war consider
this your warning will ban you faster
than the 18th amendment banned booze
that's a joke about the US Constitution
