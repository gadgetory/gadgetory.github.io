now calm and this is the final part of
the video review of the tablet kiosk
sahara slight bc i for 40 d today we're
going to check out the pcmcia slot audio
quality and a couple of the included
utilities let's take a look at the
pcmcia slot it resides on the top of the
unit here and it includes a little blank
which keeps the design flush when the
blank is in and you don't have a pc a
mcia card also presents dust and stuff
from getting into the slot which is nice
and it's in a great location for cards
like the verizon air card because then
you can handle the tablet with the air
card at the top which is a great antenna
location let's talk a little bit about
the audio quality in the bluetooth stack
especially with the a2dp profile which
provides a stereo output to your
bluetooth so i'm actually very impressed
with the quality of the two speakers one
here and here it's great to have to
touch my capability and the speakers are
are not real loud but they're loud
enough to be comfortable with bluetooth
if you want to use headphones I've got
my pair of Motorola HTA 20s which work
great with the unit and these can
actually be connected as a bluetooth
stereo headset or as a bluetooth headset
so you can use programs like skype and
messenger to make internet-based calls
so this is very handy to have the slate
pc comes with this manual which has been
quite handy it deprived ides
instructions on all the included
utilities
in the hardware and both explains the XP
operation and Vista operation and you
can see their screen prints it's a very
nice manual it's also available in PDF
format we're going to look at two
utilities the first utilities is you can
actually assign programs to these three
buttons the fourth one you want to I
would think you would want to keep on
digitizer and touch mode that enables
you to switch between the two and to
bring up a little touch utility use this
icon here and it allows you to program
each button so the second button is a
program to Internet Explorer file
explorer and mail and you can open up
and choose whatever program you'd like
to use another very nice utility is a
password management utility that allows
you to use your fingerprints instead of
passwords with application in web pages
so let's see how that works so we'll use
the saw the keys here on the side to
bring up Internet Explorer and then I'll
go to my hotmail account and go ahead
and sign in bring up the
so put in my password which
I made temporarily for this little demo
and right away the vitac e utility comes
up and asked me do I want to save this
user ID and password combination and I
can put in a name so I'll say hotmail
insert it save it and now i'm logging
into my hotmail account if i log off so
we'll say sign out and the next time i
log back in asked to login the vitae key
utility comes up and i can either use my
one of two fingers that i enroll the
other day so let's see this is a little
strange at this angle but let's see how
well it does need to there we go
and unlock back in automatically so yeah
other than the angle of the fingerprint
reader it works quite well this is a
very useful feature so that's about it
on my video review of the tablet kiosk
Sahara slate pc I for 40 D and I'll be
back later on this week with what I love
and what I hate about this tablet pc
