event for the new Galaxy Note 9 has
already been teased this year's iPhones
might get cheaper than we expected but
they're still expensive and if you're in
the United States it seems you can still
get the Oppo find 10 I'm high memory
that up I always wanted to see Germany
play a game in the World Cup in Germany
yesterday was sad but Frankfurt has been
great this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with Sony for
those of you that are in the market for
a Sony Xperia well you know that the egg
z2 premium was just very silently
announced brings dual cameras in
addition to a 4k display and pretty much
all the bells and whistles of a typical
premium flagship as we've seen in the
past yeah it's gonna be in Best Buy very
soon but the most interesting part is
the price tag one thousand dollars at a
time when Sony has actually even pulling
out of certain markets I'm not exactly
sure this is a good product to consider
but obviously whenever we get a device
for review we'll let you know
other interesting news have to do with
Oppo as the company T's that we were
gonna see the finds X being launched in
North America no specifics in Europe and
now we've got sources claiming that it's
not gonna launch in the United States
apparently the company is not ready to
deal with the market and we get it you
know it's it's it's even taking oneplus
a while for that to happen so for those
of you that want to get your hands on
that phone I am one of them apparently
eBay is going to be your choice you can
learn more about it in the description
now let's talk about Nokia as for those
of you that have been wondering when
we're getting that flagship Nokia 9
that's been rumored it seems that it
will be launched at 'if upset your
calendars it's happening late August
early September Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
in addition to all the bells and
whistles the only interesting part is
that well in addition to an end display
fingerprint scanner apparently the OLED
brought by this phone is going to be
made by LG
so that could probably bring some
concerns now let's talk about iPhones as
we've talked about price tags yesterday
for the iPhone 10 now we've got Morgan
Stanley chiming in and it seems that
there will be changes apparently
the iPhone 10 regular size which is the
one that we currently have the 2018
version is gonna be $100 cheaper $8.99
it seems that the + variant is the gonna
be the device that is now going to be
costing $9.99 and that LCD iPhone
according to them is going to oscillate
between 660 and 700 bucks but then we've
also got Meng chic quote separately
reconfirming that the device is going to
be less expensive than $600 which is
crazy for iPhones particularly so stay
tuned as rumors available and finally
the hottest news today have to do with
Samsung the fact that we've already got
a teaser the unpacked event for the what
we assumed to be Galaxy Note 9 is going
to happen on August 9th we have been
covering so many rumors of the Galaxy
Note 9 we've seen renders in 3d where
apparently the camera is going to
continue being horizontal where we get
to the fingerprint scanner where it's
supposed to be and it follows a lot of
the design language of the galaxy s 9
but after that there is really no other
difference with the Galaxy Note 9 with
the addition of the s-pen the fact that
it probably brings a you know larger
battery if that's gonna happen whatever
the case may be I mean we've seen so
many great phones this year let us know
in the comments what you think about the
Galaxy Note 9 are you looking forward to
this unpacked event we will definitely
be participating at the event in New
York City we will be covering it live
