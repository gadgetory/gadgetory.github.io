year it's a lot like the old iPhone that
means it's a solid smartphone simple yet
capable it's the phone you recommend to
your friends who can't be bothered with
optimizations to parents who want
something that just works - henry david
thoreau fans but with a new operating
system and the biggest interface upgrade
in apple's history if this year's iPhone
isn't as simple as its forerunners I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow let's find
out what that added complexity brings
for better and for worse in our iPhone
6s plus review
almost nothing about the design has
changed since last year the new 7000
series aluminum is more resistant to
bending and it's got a slightly rougher
texture but it's still fairly slippery
compared to most phones it's also still
got last year's wide radius corners
pronounced antenna channels and bezels
that look a little chubby next to some
of the latest Android phones
so while comfortable to hold even at
this larger size it's not likely to win
any beauty contests that's objective of
course as is whether you'll be able to
tell that the five and a half inch
display is only full HD hope you heard
those air quotes because for us 401
pixels per inch is still plenty dense
for a smart phone more pixels would
certainly be nice yes but we've spent
the majority of this year testing phones
with super high res displays and big
batteries and then being disappointed in
their endurance the iPhone 6 plus is the
opposite it packs a smaller power pack
than most but it's really good at making
the most of it we've got the details in
our full review at pocket now but this
phone lasted seven hours of grueling
heavy use before giving up the ghost the
same kind of usage that torpedoed the
Moto X pure edition in just five hours
in more typical conditions and with the
help of power saving mode the 6s plus
got us through almost two days of
moderate use without charging for a
phone this size that's really solid
endurance and it helps make up for the
fact that the iPhone has no wireless or
super fast charging options like some of
its competitors that's not to say the
new iPhone is without its toys the new
touch ID fingerprint scanner is so fast
it's too fast we almost never see our
lockscreen notifications and the camera
shortcut is useless so all you need to
do is graze the home button to unlock
the thing the notification switch is
nothing new but it's so great to be able
to silence the entire device with one
click and when you do apples taptic
engine delivers a much more subtle
vibration impulse
the taptic engine also makes its
presence known every time you use the
new iPhones most famous feature 3d touch
is well remember the blackberry storm
and it's awful
clicking touchscreen 3d touches like
that if it worked the way it was
supposed to you press a little harder on
the clock for example you can jump right
into the stopwatch do it on the Evernote
elephant and you can start a new note
see how many messages are waiting from
your VIP contacts instantly start Shazam
in a song see what your next calendar
appointment is this is the kind of stuff
you don't immediately get and it's easy
to forget the function is there unless
you're constantly using it but the first
time you peek into an email and then pop
into the full version or do the same
with a link in the browser or reposition
your cursor in a text field you get it
it's not mind-blowing or anything but it
is of very clever means of extracting
more usefulness from a touchscreen and
it's only gonna get better as more
developers start embracing it for their
applications the rest of Apple's new OS
is a largely positive experience with
some new and old frustrations mixed in
iOS 9 brings a new multitasking screen
that makes it easy to shuffle between
apps and even with only 2 gigs of RAM we
didn't often find ourselves waiting for
apps to reload from idle the reach
ability is still here to make stretching
to the top of the screen a little easier
if you're trying to use this big phone
one-handed and spotlight search is the
easiest way to find or do basically
everything on the phone the new
proactive panel on the leftmost home
screen is pretty good at delivering
contextually relevant shortcuts and
information and it's strange that Apple
is the only big software maker to
embrace a swipe up from the bottom
control panel it's so convenient that
every large phone should include it but
it doesn't include notifications for
those you need to head up at the top of
the screen which is just as annoying
here as on every other large smartphone
reach ability or no Notification Center
is much improved these days but alerts
are duplicated via badges on the
Immortals springboard so if you have a
lot of spam sitting unread and some of
your email folders get ready to see this
all the time unless you want to manually
tell iOS which apps do and don't get
badges
as for the springboard itself that grid
of icons and folders is just as
inflexible as it's been for nearly a
decade you can change your wallpaper and
move stuff around and that's about it
voice dictation works really wonderfully
until it stops working for no good
reason
Safari is pretty quick at loading pages
but it's got some really confusing
interface quirks that make it
frustrating to use the list goes on iOS
9 is really cool there's much more than
we can cover in this video but like many
new releases it needs some refinement
the iPhone has made a name for itself in
photography mainly thanks to a
combination of solid optics and dead
simple software this phone is no
different in that regard the most
attention by far has gone to live photos
which are basically other short videos
but Apple would prefer you didn't call
them that they add a little life to the
gallery you can animate them with a 3d
touch or even set one as your wallpaper
which is very cool is it worth the slew
of video files and your photo exports
and the storage penalty yeah probably
unless you get that 16 gig iPhone which
you shouldn't more conventional photos
look quite nice courtesy of the new 12
megapixel camera hardware and the
combination of digital and optical
stabilization on the 6s plus makes for
smooth video even when on walkabout a
video which you can then edit right on
the phone in iMovie the stills seem a
bit underexposed on the whole but
low-light photos are actually pretty
good with or without the color
correcting dual LED flash the selfie
shooter got the more significant update
by far it's now 5 megapixels and it's
augmented by a clever display based
flash that adjusts its color temperature
based on the ambient lighting of a scene
that's cool but it's a shame Apple once
again failed to include a wide-angle
lens as good as the iPhone is its
competitors have really stepped up their
output quality this year with contenders
from Samsung and LG in particular
sometimes taking better photos than the
iPhone so it'll be interesting to see
what Apple brings to the table next year
for now the iPhone 6s plus camera
experience is pretty tight Apple just
needs to come up with a different way to
launch it faster thanks to that to quick
fingerprint sensor maybe we suggest a
double click of the home button oh right
no we can't that shortcut has already
claimed by multitasking when the phones
awake and Apple pay when it's asleep
that's part of the added complexity we
mentioned in the opening it's tough to
get used to a shortcut when it's not
consistent but you know what it's so
worth it because Apple pay is so fast
and its ubiquity at least in cities like
Boston is a striking reminder that
ecosystem is about more than apps and
when you buy into Apple you buy into a
big ecosystem that's ahead of the pack
in some ways in others Apple's just now
catching up the new motion coprocessor
gives the phone more contextual
awareness letting you do things like
summon Siri hands-free using just your
voice but there's no automatic
activation of the display when you take
the phone from a pocket nor any of the
more advanced stuff Motorola has been
doing for years the reception doesn't
seem as good as some of the devices in
our inventory either and finally there
are precious few large screen
optimizations here there's none of the
split-screen multitasking as we see on
the Galaxy Note or the iPad
there's not even a persistent number Rho
and the default keyboard as on so many
other phones Apple relies on a dual pane
interface in some apps to maximize
screen real estate and that's fine iOS
shouldn't be like other platforms it
should do its own thing but Apple's
conservative evolution of features on
its plus sized iPhone and continues to
make it feel to us like little more than
a scaled up version of the original we
think there's some unused potential here
and yet a scaled up version of something
great is still great and as it enters
its ninth generation the iPhone remains
a great smartphone its challenges a
steeper learning curve less elegant
software and a year old hardware design
are counterbalanced by great battery
life a deep ecosystem of apps and
services 3d touch and a solid camera the
iPhone 6s plus isn't the most exciting
smartphone of 2015 not by a longshot but
it wasn't meant to be either it was
meant to be the best oversized iPhone
yet and this phone delivers there's much
