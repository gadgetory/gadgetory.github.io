region welcome to pocket now live this
is episode number nine I am Anton denied
managing editor of pocketnow.com and i'm
joined today by Joe Levi the android guy
senior editor with us I do hey are you
doing everything is awesome good to have
you here and also by Steven shank chief
news editor how is the news today so far
so good and how are you today I'm doing
well thank you not necessarily in this
order everybody I have a very very very
short story to tell you I was at the gym
like every every week I go to the gym
four times a week and I was doing some
crunches and I was trying to get my
breath because I completely ran out of
it and there's this new guy who walks up
to me and he's like he'll dude you're
the bucket now live guy and I'm is he
like well I'm gonna try to come online
today and tell everybody how out of
breath you were and I mackay and by the
time I thought my breath he was out so
if you guys see a weird guy coming and
telling you how out of breath I was you
should be in form and with this let's
start the additional pocket on my pan
out I'm gonna hand it over to the jail
please Joe choose somebody well my
friend was here a little bit earlier but
I'm not seeing him with us so i guess he
dropped out I'll catch him if he comes
back in the meantime mr. Superman that's
a modest veal day how are you today what
device are you using what part of the
world are you hailing from ready can I
talk a little bit louder we will okay
I'm sorry I'm sorry ah practically first
of all hi to everyone I'm a first time
here and I'm really excited to be here
and the thing is I first of all I want
to start off by saying hello from Latvia
hey let's see I Baltic countries yes the
Baltics yes that's obviously us yeah and
and I don't want to just say first of
all I want to say thank you for letting
me in the end why
something that I searched for so long
what am I talking about I'm talking
about that I searched for so long time a
tech review company if you will that
gives me the news in such manner than
nobody else can and that and I searched
fought so long and what i find was one
tech reviewer company that actually did
the news like you can ask a hipster on
the street what he thinks about certain
kind of devices and always and always to
same reply a difference same thing is
yeah it's not but it makes me feel like
the iphone is better that is one company
i think you all know what I'm talking
about and and and other companies that
one vid you were just talks every time
in such a high pitched voice that is
really starting to get on my nerves but
about you guys you guys make the news
actually very fun to watch and I commend
you to make an applause for yourself or
something i'm really happy to thank you
and your mother stuff that applause goes
to Steven because he's amazing he's guy
oh ok leavin that little shoe Edwards
much appreciated yeah and I'm using the
Samsung Galaxy S to the you know I i
bought it first day it came out in our
country that was the maid of 26 and and
and i think that this is the only phone
if you can say that it was the top of
the line phone for a whole year nobody
no one surpass this phone for whole year
and that is what you don't see for a
long time and and what i would like to
use i see that the theme is perfect
phone I think you will agree that that
the perfect phone would be a galaxy note
3 with a unibody polycarbonate shell
just like only HTC One X either you know
yeah it will be so awesome Jessa spin
just as likely to hold and you feel
substantial when you hold
your hand and and and but so you don't
compromise you wouldn't switch out the
battery because let's face it nobody
ever do does that practically a one
percenter for all the people don't do
that I be friends I agree with you yeah
thank you but but you have a little slot
for the micro SD card up to 64 gigabytes
just like you have on the experience
they eat but I'm not on their flat just
like you can push it in and that's it
and and and if you think about it
wouldn't it be nice to finally integrate
new technology about if we talking about
battery life because if you count you to
change the battery that means that that
you're stuck with it and that's it right
and I think it would be nicer to say
they finally integrated them it's it's
called the spiderweb mesh battery where
you don't get individual cells but you
get like a cell of buttery and you can
make the same size of a normal battery
but your capacity is like like tenfold
if i'm not mistaken i will step I was so
step on Jost earth right now because
he's the one super who's supposed to
talk to you but I just have one question
would it run stock Android or what it
run okay go on till yeah yeah is it
gonna run TouchWiz or is it gonna run
stock here that you see if I would like
to have stuck oh yeah talking about that
I have a custom rom I have a custom rom
on my phone and it it is basically it
looks like a AOSP rom with no
modifications but it has the
functionality of a samsung rom you can
connect it to your HDTV via MHL what you
don't talk about at all and your
hangouts yes I i I'm from the very
beginning and nobody talks about the
functionality of older phones MHL
actually I would prefer to have stock
Android but with connectivity options so
to see and that's it android rules
is this there's nothing better than you
can get this rock on droid i would love
to have a spare phone with windows 8 and
windows 9 when it comes out show again
Joe now the cameras on you there's my
MHL adapter right there I got that I did
a review on that with a really funky
monitor not long ago and wow that was
that was super super fun and exciting
and crazy all at the same time but what
do you think do you think MHL is going
to stick around all that much or do you
think we're going to see miracast
takeover which is built into the newer
version of androids I think that every
child practically is not around even now
as we speak because when we see new
phones like a blackberry z10 or so right
they don't use this MHL technology
technology they just use practically
micro and HTML or something like that
not practically I've seen only if i'm
not mistaken eight new phones and use
that but in in two addition to that they
provide you with micro HDMI too so I
don't know and I've always wondered will
be around I've always wondered why you
have devices that put both a micro HDMI
and you know micro USB port you can do
the same thing with just a little
adapter which you're going to have to
have a special cable anyway if you're
going to have micro HDMI nobody else has
that just laying around so it charges
your own and it charges to your phone at
the same time exactly yeah that's well
thank you very much for your comments we
appreciate them I think it's Stevens
turn to pick somebody knew from the
group Tony's gonna jump in and say no I
thank you and I will just say one thing
that we have a new rule you guys weren't
online with the occasion of the last
episode we were we
will publicize everybody's Twitter
account who wants to publicize it so
please tell everybody where they can
find you on twitter i'm sorry i don't
use to that i actually hate twitter okay
answer that okay not about that no but
very very big things no Papa having me
I'm really excited to be here and I hope
to be here sometime else too all right
thank you very much for joining us
alright Steven back to you okay why
don't we talk to mr. Guillermo Vega come
on down hello can you guys hear me hey
yeah we can hear are you just hire okay
well so you have anything in mind you
want to talk to us about today or just
shoot the breeze well I mean I was
thinking about the topic you know what's
a perfect own yeah and I don't think
that there is a perfect phone for every
single person i think in it varies so i
thank you that but you're all for me
yeah well you know I i had the galaxy
note 2 and I should switch to the nexus
4 it's a big change it's actually hard
to get used to the two to this this
criticize solar screen size if I yeah
like Jack's entry is more difficult does
it a smaller screen the first couple of
days yet so I'm gonna I'm that kind of
person that changes phones like every
3-4 months that's all good for you hey
on the note to all had it that long I
said I wanted you know i like you i mean
i've had the galaxy s2 the galaxy s3
they got like see note 1 like galaxy
note 2 sam sup and I'm taking it yeah
and I actually first started with with
the iphone and you know I kind of got
bored with I mean I had I had the beat
the 3gs I moved to the four and then I
kind of attire and I saw that on the
Android side there was
there was more you know more options of
different things you can do with it so
once I moved to Android I pretty much
stay there that what would so this is
iOS have to do different to draw you
back what is it missing that you think a
droid delivers and it does well I think
so far wise i think is still better than
the nandroid as far as the house luid it
is but i think that form for for me is
like the screen size even are four
inches is still too small you know and
this isn't for I mean disap 4.7 and I
still find it tomorrow so Apple would
have to get seriously bigger for you to
pay it any textured again but I even
have a the ipad 3 and you even though
the user interface you know it is kind
of the same i mean that's fine I mean it
was good for me but for for the for the
phone itself it's just too small now
what do you think about this like the
new Galaxy Note 8.0 people using these
tablets as jumbo sized about um well I
think it depends in the country because
I think in the u.s. is probably not
feasible since most carriers don't let
let you use your tablet as a cell phone
but by here for example in Costa Rica
it's all open so I can just like for for
example the that the tablets that they
bring here their day international
models so you can choose put in your sim
card and it works as a phone I mean it
depends here is probably dangerous
because of the type of country that we
have here that there's lots of theft so
you have to be careful I mean if you're
gonna be always like in a car in an old
fishing in your house I'd say it
actually works works good because you
could just put it on speaker use your
ear your headset and that's fine but for
going outside you probably need like a
like a smaller phone he don't want to be
carrying around this like giant tab
yeah but yeah good point yeah or a
bluetooth headset and then nobody has to
see your tablet that defeats the point
of holding the Galaxy Note 8 to your
head I guess I can't you see the image
of it it's just perfect yeah well I
think I think hold holding the powder to
your head that's kind of seal it no it's
not come on we got somebody here on the
team who dies to hold a seven or eight
inch tablet to his head I actually had
the first Galaxy Tab the seven-point oh
and then that came with the phone
feature and like if I was in my house I
mean that was perfect i'll just put it
on speaker and just use it but as far as
putting it to my head I don't know come
on just what let me get b11 the main
reason why I like this because I feel
many people think that it is silly I am
usually carrying around a phone and a
tablet when I'm going mobile to do some
office work outside now this 8.0 note
from Samsung or any other tablet which
has a ear piece or phone functionality
would allow me to leave one device at
home the phone so I would have a tablet
which acts as a phone and I can also use
it as a tablet so not two devices one
device this is my main reason why I
would love this yep I went when you when
you will use it which would you put it
to your hair or will you put in a
speaker no absolutely I would put it to
my head because I hate Bluetooth pets
and I hate everybody overhearing my
conversations well yeah that's for you
just hate people thinking that you're
talking to them Tony that's what you
hate ok ok ok I Guillermo thank you very
much for talking with us but we've got a
lot of people waiting here so let's show
let's move on to somebody else and
please come back again ok thank you Tony
ok yeah let us pick somebody who is
close to me both geographically and
through our history Andrea Franchitti
unmute your microphone
can you hear me yes we can hey good
evening to you how are you how are you
fine thanks you I am awesome tell me
what do you want to talk about or what
do we talk about depends on what you
want to talk about that was a dumb
seconds it wasn't even a sentence right
I read about the perfect phone so we can
talk about it okay what's the perfect
phone for you now I have the desire s
that I rooted and put a 4.1 sense rom
mm-hmm and I really like it but it's
pretty old with a little straight screen
and so and it's bit slow so I think I
think about the HTC One but in wide HTC
one why because I love sense I really
really love sense I I tried android
without skins but it's not for me IE i
really i miss the with sense widgets so
that's the point i love sense andraia
let me let me ask you something if all
the people in this hangout would be
representative from from an oem so we'd
have samsung HTC nokia and all the
others here and everybody would listen
to what you have to say what do you
think they would have to produce in
order to produce the perfect phone for
you something that it's fast something
that it's pretty to use it spread to
hinder in the hand okay describe it is
it metal is it plastic is it round
corner is it thick is it thin how how is
the perfect phone this is what I'm
trying to find out what is the phone for
you if you close how big is the battery
exam the battery
be at least two days with high use so
ambitious yeah I know that's not as
vicious actually let me show you guys
let me show you something right now
actually we did this and people were
like asking am I saying the demon just
check this out Stephen in let me see if
ok so there's thirty eight percent and
I'm not sure if you can see the uptime I
can't well oh yeah this is one day and
four hours 40 minutes and 49 seconds
thirty percent on the HTC One so if the
HTC one can do it but it's relatively
small battery I'm sure that with larger
battery bones it would be possible I see
I think a 3000 or maybe four thousand
million pair will be pretty nice so but
for now I think two thousand maybe a bit
too too low how big is the screen on
your perfect phone I think for and off
because I have very small hands and for
me 4.7 inch screen is a really big but i
really like big screens so it's like 4.5
or five it depends on the basil on the
on the usability well you describe it is
your perfect phone so you want a 5-inch
mode with no bezels that's it rights to
tweeze Lee when I drop it so and what's
the resolution on that 54.5 5-inch
screen is it 720p is it full HD or it
may be 4k well for k will be I was
awesome but I think it's pretty
impossible but 720p will be perfect
because
I think we don't need full HD
interestingly that's what I thought too
when I was strongly advocating why do
you need full HD on your screens because
it's just a salt meaning if you look at
a 4h if you look at a full HD screen
whether if it's the HTC One the droid
DNA or the others out there and you can
pair it with a foam which is 720p you
can really see the difference it's much
clearer sharper and you can read the
text even in a position but allah as i
said as i guess so resolution will is a
bit low in in that in that phone and I
think 720p will be great but if the
market brings 720p and full HD phones at
the same price I I choose a full HD
because it's obvious and there is one
final question for you okay in your
perfect phone which is the number one
killer feature so i really love music I
have a guitar so I don't need the very
good photos but photo would be photos
will be I think I love but for me music
is the greatest thing so bluetooth
pairing with lossless audio will be out
awesome and Winston portable Bluetooth
headsets if possible I quality love i
love boom sound because i usually listen
to the music or to podcasts in with the
phone and i really love it and i love to
the microphones how HTC out the HTC One
made it because with the two membranes I
can wear
called some concerts um and AH reality
without distortion yeah because I I play
bass and drums and so I can record
myself while playing and I think will be
great awesome Andrea Grazia piacere I
will take the camera on you so that
people know exactly where to follow you
on twitter that's your pro handle right
yes awesome thank you very much for
joining us and come back whenever you
have time ya hear bye bye y'all Joe back
to you we just got a tour of Andrew been
nurse place so I think we should switch
over to him Andrew what what device do
you have now and what would it be to be
your perfect device all right oh okay
yeah yeah yeah all right I have the
nexus 4 right now so what is it you're
perfect phone what do they need to do
for you to get the nexus 5 for example
or some other device I think one of the
biggest things holding it back
especially something okay some people
might think it's too big like that one
guy did but i think the batter is a
little small and something like this
like it just doesn't last me as long as
I'd like it too seriously Lawrence
minutes and i'm at eighty-eight percent
yeah that's what I'm talking about like
I'll just leave it in my pocket at work
and it'll drown like ten percent of the
battery life just sitting there
ridiculous so how big of a battery do
you think we need to have if if we had
exactly the same phone same spec same
everything how big in milliamp hours
would we need to have for it to be your
perfect device I think even if we could
push it up to like 26 or 27 then like
the Nexus 5 like the same size same
basic dimensions just slightly larger
battery will be great and not so much
glass next time oh dude don't don't even
get me started I don't know why they did
that so are you one of the guys that has
the the new Nexus 4 that has the special
nubs on the back so that the glass
doesn't sit down
on the on the table or you like me where
it's just a flat slate on the back just
a flat slave just own the bumper cases
for out on no no no but you guys I gotta
show you this cuz I'm not happy if
anyone from google is watching maybe I
through work that way they're always
watching so this is my bumper okay it
looks just like everybody else's bumper
except I don't know if this will focus
in see that right there what yeah like
two weeks it broke right in the middle
and then this bottom part isn't it's not
solid it doesn't hold onto the device
anymore there's a gap it was letting
gunk in there and I was starting to get
scratches on and off all the time how
that happened well I take it off
whenever I do a video so that's like
yeah times a week I said they don't they
don't expect that we're gonna be
removing it quite so often I don't know
so then I got a new case I got this
thing right here hold on let you see
that you lock it on you okay so it's got
this nice little cover you'll hate but
you hate that as much as I hated all the
samsung covers you know I loved it for
the first two days and then yeah I hated
it I hated you the reason I hated it
wasn't for any other reason or two
reasons one you get gunk in around the
edges and that's just not good you know
I'm gonna scratch my screen and then
it's gonna break easier but to that flap
opens the wrong way it needs to flip up
over the top can you see that that's my
job town so that I can just flip it open
like a notepad otherwise I'm trying to
hold it and this thing is pushing it out
of my hand and I'm gonna drop it more
yeah have a Joey if that thing flipped
over the top then you would have been
able to use the phone with one hand now
this way it totally kills one-handed
usability I can still do it but yeah
it's you gotta flip it and then
yeah pain in the neck well why would
they think to add a magnet with you like
doesn't that make sense I see the the
accessory covers that they have on you
know the ipad mini's is that what they
call him I don't even know anymore it's
fruity devices smart about those things
but I see those not it's brilliant it
attaches it doesn't have to have any
mechanic mechanical connections so you
don't have to have anything special
built-in that's going to be a hinge the
brakes if your cover gets dirty or you
don't like the color whatever just take
it off and there you go why not why not
well I think maybe it's a challenge to
put the magnets in something small or
too because you know the ipad is really
nice and stretched out whereas a nexus 4
is just mommy it's not like that's not
small but it's smaller yeah it's really
compact so fitting everything in there
is a challenge already i'm sure but i
don't know i don't want to have third
party stuff that i have to put on my
device it should be pretty enough and
not slip out of my hand and jump onto
the garage floor just by itself that's
not all me holding is my the end shaking
it around like that I've gotten visit on
their residential don't play with our
hearts see I know it's good i got grip
on it now it's not the slippery thing
can you even see that it's invisible see
yes I can see that it's not can you can
you see the invisishield on there yes
barely yep yeah that's not that adds
just enough tack just enough grip that I
don't I'm not worried about any more I
just put up my shirt pocket so I just
don't wash my hands it's problem solved
we knew there was something about you
finally figured it out alright so sort
of wrap it up your next perfect
smartphone is still going to be powered
by Android it's gonna have a bigger
battery in it the form factor is about
right you were saying for what we have
in the current nexus 4 yeah but I'd like
to be like more polycarbonate like
something that's not slippery because I
don't think you know they could have
just gone with something like pie
and avoided the whole issues absolutely
I absolutely agree whether it's
polycarbonate or whether it's aluminum
or whether it's whatever glass on the
front glass on the back that needs to
stop at just not so there's not a good
idea just plain and simple oh we always
have the option for hyper blaze you shut
your mouth Tony they have never been to
Romania but every time you mentioned
hyper glaze you give me reason to come
over there and beat you up come on
everybody thinks I'm a samsung cater i'm
not i'm advocating for hyper glaze no no
no i'm not a samsung hater i'm a hyper
glaze hater i'd give me anything but
hydrolase well as glass so all right
thank you very much for being part of
the show today Andrew I just wanted ask
one more question i'll click antilles
yes he said you live in Romania right
yes that is correct have you ever been
on what's the highway code I'm gonna
pronounce this wrong and I better sound
like an idiot the transfer garish and
highlight sounds Transpo garish on
actually it's the air we which goes over
the garage mountains and no I have never
been there in my entire life because
it's so frightening that if you can get
a flat tire and you don't have a spare
or your spare gets a flat tire you can
have any help whatsoever is this some
one of those like world's deadliest
roads yes was actually okay so
advertisement for my country Top Gear
said it's it's the most beautiful Road
in the opposite list well I guess it
could be on both pretty but but once i
will maybe accumulate enough balls i
will probably go there and some pictures
with your HTC one's for megapixel camera
or ultrapixels ultrapixel sorry
ultrapixels Andrew tell everybody where
they can find you on Twitter um I don't
use my Twitter so okay only know Twitter
guys today which makes our job even
easier so yes from here on if you've got
a website if you get Google+ or Facebook
just let us know where people can get a
hold of you if you want them to
and if not you know if you want to be a
recluse that's cool too I result if you
don't want them to know a can find you
just been bout my Twitter account okay
or my google plus page that works too
sure go on tell everybody where they can
find you on my Google+ page which is
every better which is Andrew better yeah
awesome thank you very much for joining
us and with this I'm gonna hand it over
to Steven thank you know let's see how
about Vlad Vlad how you doing hi can you
hear me we can we can yeah so what do
you think about this whole talk about
perfect phones here you have any ideas
in mind I've pre-ordered HTC One so it
already exists of March and I'm still
waiting for it there was a few delays on
the fifteenth and on the 20 knife and
now I'm gonna have it on the 3rd ODI
because I know you're just from the same
country as I and did you preorder it
from within Romania or from the outside
within the EU somewhere i forwarded it
from clove from clothes i'm from the UK
you ever shout out clove are good guys
are friends I know I know if I've
listened to blend the minimum a few
years ago and all the HTC products we're
from clove and not only does and not
only does but yeah that's why I called
it from there and the perfect phone I
think it would have the hardware of the
HTC One but with the better camera maybe
eight culture pixels something like that
yeah they talk about so many pixels so
they talk about alter pixels being this
great image sensing technology that will
make peanut supposed to look better than
a normal for megapixel but why not make
it an 8 megapixel so it's both competing
number 13 y0 team I can answer life if
you'd like I can answer to this well
besides of course not being able to
produce them in appreciable numbers I
think I think that so the the the
thing behind the ultra pixel sensor is
that say if if this is the normal 8
megapixel sensor HTC is using the same
size physical size but the size of the
pixels are larger so if we would talk
about a 8 or 13 ultra pixel sensor that
will have to be much much much larger
physically than the normal 30 megapixel
sensor so basically this very thin HTC
One phone will probably be this thick I
mean that's always a standard way to
increase image quality making the actual
some of the pixels bigger I thought that
the ultrapixel was like a stacked array
where the light gets scanned by multiple
color sensors I maybe gets
misinterpreting this entire oh it's just
it's just that on the sink I think I
explain this the following way think
about two cities which are exactly with
the same area and same dimension but one
is with the population of New York as in
density and one is with the population
of oradea my home city which is 20
220,000 people so the pixel or Syracuse
has like a hundred so the pixels are
larger and I'm sorry to hijack this
vector V so the technologies and there
to make it thinner that's why they
couldn't fit an eight altra pixel camera
in the beautiful HTC One that's my guess
at least now but if they did we could
have a bigger battery and then it would
last all week and it would just be a
little bit thicker with a better camera
too but you know I'm just I'm crazy over
here why can't you just make batteries
that take pictures any problems all like
I know we have batteries but I see why
don't do camera exactly yeah and some
way you can upgrade your phone's camera
and battery at the same time it's
already on the back there just got a
little window for I think I'm gonna
patent this thing do you have to HTC
one's you have the white one in the
black the silver one in the black
I had them for four days and I have sent
a black one back because to HTC one's is
a lot of fun but the thing is that I
usually carry two phones and if I can
choose those two phones are on different
platforms so that I can get the best of
both worlds are using the iphone 5
actually i'm using the HTC One and the
iphone 5 right now at time but the
iPhone 5 is in and out it's the galaxy
note 2 also is in and depending on
whether I go downtown to shoot some
pictures this the 808 PureView which is
my first and only love tony is Captain
for phones yeah occasionally yes
especially when i'm doing camera
comparisons and people know crane gonna
get you like holsters for them all okay
thank you guys thank you very much for
talking to Ozzie fun yeah where can we
find you on twitter google+ facebook or
on your blog on Twitter yes i will write
to tone the chat no you have to spell it
out because the chat is not public and
yet being the entire idea is for this
thing to get public and for you to get
much more flowers Ethan behind cumin is
too hard for me to pronounce it because
it's my name and everything so if it's
your name it's VL ad yeah it's vm and
then the last name mi h eh l eight
awesome everybody you can follow him
right there thank you very much please
everyone heaven eyes bye bye and I will
I know exactly who I want to talk to how
was the bowling session Madeline unmute
first yeah it's great I want you want
yeah what did you mean nothing the Onyx
goner what what what if you could have
win the perfect phone what would that be
Lumia 920 oh that's all right on the
market
yeah so but now i'm still waiting for
the US the Phantom so then you're into
cameras that's the big deal yeah and I'm
also into nokia and windows 8 with the
soul mate so you're saying that if the
Lumia 920 and the 808 PureView could
have a baby that baby would yeah I'll
adopt it right away and what what other
features will there be maybe a 1080p
screen maybe 64 gigs of internal storage
what is what is the feature which you'd
be most interested in aside from the
huge camera actually if boomsound would
be great and pick some sinneth brain is
that important because I have glasses
and it doesn't help that much I have a
pony I site so i won't even tell if a
tvs or full HD or not so about about
boomsound before I got the HTC One the
best sounding quality on the phone I
have ever listened to you was the
speaker on the 808 PureView because of
its thickness nokia managed to put i'm
not sure if it shows there on the top
that entire thing is a speaker there's
no that was a very good audio quality
what else well yes storage I think 16
would be enough for me because I have a
drop box connected to my phone so excuse
right away so you are basically
streaming and uploading and everything
you are using you're using from the
cloud just like I do yeah so and a
really thing is funny because I'm the
podcast I listened to it yesterday and
it was funny you talked about topic I
wanted to talk about it was their
viewing angles I don't know why you
always say it's a big deal because I
don't want people to you up on the bus
this is the eternal debate now I don't
want people to see what
I'm looking at on my screen except for
the rare occasions when I do when I'm at
a party or at a bar or at the gym and I
snap a picture and I want to show it off
to two or three people behind me and if
I keep it straight on and the viewing
angles are not yet the people on the two
sides will not really see anything so
that's about the only main thing I would
like for a phone to have a large wide
viewing angle well you can also just
crammed together and hold it real far
away yes that is also true at or we can
use a projector phone already has yeah
we saw how popular those were too yes
things off the shot scenes before their
time will come around decade or so yeah
and I think after the last to hang out I
wanted to talk about the Microsoft the
surface pro because that's the one I
want to get because I ever since this
they announced the RT and the pro I
always knew I wanted to get the pro so I
just wanted to know how good it was
drawn but I got that answered villa yeah
there's a timed Adam the full review
yeah Adam had a great exhaustive review
of the surface pro ii had much check
that one out I'm not necessarily talking
to you everybody go on to pocket now and
read that lots of pictures and lots of
videos I have one last question for you
regarding the perfect phone the baby of
the 808 mu a 920 what materials would
not key i use for that phone would it be
polycarbonate as the 920 would be okay
what did the helicopter and matt left it
in that that was my follow-up question
the shiny one or the mad one i would get
the matte black it's i had to choose but
if if any colors i would pick their
people i love purple I so nokia if
you're looking at this diva kneel up I
know you're watching we want a Nokia EOS
which would be purple with matte plastic
and a huge awesome camera with booms out
I really don't matter if the phone is
heavier Oh opaque because my oh my
current phone is so heavy so I can't
really notice the difference and
incisive I think between four and 4.5
would be great actually have her they
can so it doesn't matter I have big
hands too even though I find it to be a
pain in the a if you use the neck of the
note 2 for instance even now i have to
admit the iphone 5 is small yeah and i
think it's funny that people complain
that it's so heavy that 920 and I've was
weighing it in my hand or she's my new
it my phone right now it's like what you
see it's not heavy yeah Michael Fisher
has a great saying you go out workout at
the gym and there becomes a point when
phones are just too light when they're
not heavy enough and they feel cheap
yeah I gotta have some heft to it yeah I
like to have feminism of a phone that
you can feel is there so yeah Madeline
do you have any final closing thoughts
we have to move on no not really again
I'm empty okay I'm gonna lock my camera
on you because you have your Twitter
handle right there so everybody go
follow her she's a Windows Phone fan and
a nokia fan and a PureView fan so that's
free and one Madeline thank you very
much for joining us and please do come
back when you have time hello take care
bye bye and Joe back to you so I one of
the guys it's been here since the
beginning of the show is sabari sh I
probably butchered your name I'm sorry
about that what country do you hail from
what device you have now and what is
your perfect phone um I'm from India I
have galaxy s2 um I would say my perfect
phone would be like a TV screen but a
very high ppi mode on the 441 i think it
is up to 500 I know it's not necessary
but still you know I use my phone a lot
i use it for everything gaming music
email pictures editing
even sometimes I make short films and I
sometimes shoot some scenes in my phone
so even a good camera so let me say say
like a 13 megapixel camera or an
ultrapixel camera if it's good enough
and I would like to have a good build
which has a removable back because you
know from a back out because i have put
down my galaxy s2 a lot of times and
every time it falls the battery pops
often the cover bowl like lobby now
crashed it's like it is fun from my you
know this height I'm six foot tall and
it is never broken the screen never got
broken because I know maybe because of
another theno material I recently split
up HTC One and the iphone phi i was
really a little upset that you know the
HTC One God laughs which the iphone
didn't and that was like oh my god why
why did that happen they follow the same
design and I go with code displace I
mean I go code edges I feel it more
comfortable and I prefer the screen size
of 4.7 more than that is really annoying
very good I you just described most of
my favorite things but I had one point
that I was a little confused on do you
like having the removable back or is
that something that you would like to
not have in your perfect phone no I
would like to how because I think that
you know that is once one maybe not a
real thing but I feel when the phone
drops off the the battery cover just
pops away I think that that takes in all
the you know force that you know impacts
the phone yeah I hadn't even considered
that but the times that I've had a phone
that have had a removable back even if
it's you know one of these really really
old ones oh you've got stuff falling
down behind me even if it's like that
one that has a removable back cover when
it falls you do right the battery cover
pops off the battery falls out and I
wonder if that's relieving some of the
internal stresses yet where if you've
got an internal integrated battery that
you can't take out those stresses have
to go somewhere in it right yeah you
you see the bumps of the HTC one right
it was like really I was feeling bad
people throw in some no money into it
and you don't it just stands like an
oval so banged up but rather you have a
removable back cover comes off that you
can you know even change it with you
know gets broken so you can change the
cover if it gets broken you can change
the cover if it gets scratched or even
if you just want to change the color you
can swap out the back cover and the
battery if you want to have a bigger
battery and it can provide an extra
level of protection against breakage
because it's relieving that pressure
yeah I think that's made the perfect
argument for why every smartphone should
have some kind of removable back and not
a solid unremovable one candy and yeah
about the phone my super phone or the
perfect phone I always go or rely on
performance a lot because as I told you
I do everything on my phone so I would
always like to have the you know latest
and the greatest on the hardware and I
liked about the motorola x phones rumors
you know you can customize i know the
phone what kind of volume that was quite
good i would recommend that like you
know Dell offers that for your laptop's
like what configuration you want that
would be a good move and my perfect
phone I would ask for more RAM because I
use a lot of applications especially
games you know and a 128 gigabyte of
storage yes that would work that's all I
how many of you think 4 gigabytes yeah
full hope you guys that would reboot
ambitious so I'm thinking internal
storage I might pay the extra money to
get 16 gig in my nexus 4 and I don't
have enough room in there to keep a
whole bunch of songs I don't have a lot
of room in there to keep in one or two
movies and I'm full I've got copilot
live so maps of North America are one
and a half gig that's just not nothing I
can't expand it except through the cloud
and what happens as soon as I go out of
coverage from the cloud I don't have any
of that stuff
that storage space anymore and even
still if I don't have an unlimited data
plan you know t-mobile's new unlimited
plan the throttles you back to edge
speeds once you get to 500 megabit so or
megabytes I whatever it is that I don't
think they understand the difference
between the two but you know we've got
to have I think 16 is the new minimum
level 32 64 should be the new
configuration and then for power phones
yeah 64 128 absolutely especially if
you're not going to give me an external
storage slot to expand exactly because
you know right the games are getting
heavier and applications are getting
heavier and the story just like
shrinking down you know it's like dude I
want this on my phone I have so many
applications which are heavy for example
you know my phone has a 16 gigabyte
storage okay and I I install asphalt 7
and I installs Batman what he called me
when the Dark Knight rights and I was
literally ran out of storage I couldn't
keep my songs I had to buy another eight
and eight gigabyte of God you know to
move my no personal music Canora photo
files are not into it and you know then
we run a game that was ridiculous right
and especially small same reason
especially if you're talking about using
your phone for for taking pictures I
mean we've already been talking about
how image sizes are getting bigger
because the camera sensors are getting
bigger or better and how you look at it
and when you include in their video as
well I might go I don't know a month
between when I clean out all of the the
video and pictures on my on my phone and
if I've got 56 minutes 10 minutes of HD
video on my phone that's an awful lot of
space that's being eaten up so I hear
you and I I think we're there with
bigger storage and removable storage on
our perfect devices anything you will
wrap up with and sorry I couldn't hear
you all right do you have any last
thoughts that you want to wrap up with
before we move on to our next person
yeah I have this one question like a no
for all the android android fanboys are
you know anybody who's developing it's
like you know um let it
you know let it be the root thing and
all rooting the phone all these things
away putting these things away why are
the updates so slow you know every time
an android version comes you have to
wait for months and months I know
because it's completely detached like
you know the you know the manufacturer
has to get the source from Google's page
and then they start working on it why
custom skins you know TouchWiz the
latest i fashioned in s4 is close to you
know Google stock water so you know why
you don't put a layer over it you know
you just use the google stock when
inputting your features anyway all are
just the gimmicks we saw on the galaxy
s4 they can easily be pulled into the
you know that obvious rather than you
know building a whole new set of you
know theming called the TouchWiz why do
I do that okay so that's a really
in-depth question and I really really
like it so Tony don't yell at me for
doing a little bit long on this response
but I think it warrants a little bit of
time esri knock at XDA developer TV did
a very adrian aakesh an explanation
about this and he explained it really
well most of us think that you know
TouchWiz or since or any of the other
stuff is a skin that sits on top of
Android and that's really not the case
instead android is it's it's own thing
it's not linux it's based on linux but
it's it's own thing so when there's a
new version of linux that comes out that
doesn't mean you can just import the
core and you're done you've got a new
version of android it has to be retweet
has to be press them crafted
everything's got to be built in android
now is the AOSP is the core and then
other OEMs take that and they modify it
releasing their own separate distinct
versions of android so it's not android
with sense it's not android with
TouchWiz it is sense and it is TouchWiz
and we just differentiate them by saying
well lets android with a skin it's not
it's integral it's it's all-encompassing
and its built-in so when a new version
of Android comes out they have to merge
that code in with theirs and run through
their entire compatibility testing and
fix anything that the operating system
broke in that custom skin that's not
really a custom skin and then they also
have to do that for every single app
that they have built in and customize
that only runs on their custom version
of Android it's very time intensive it's
very labor-intensive for them to do and
they have to take their developers off
of whatever the next project is the next
phone for example and put them back on
this old project that maybe a year or
two old they're not making any more
money from that because it's not selling
any more product so it's it's an
expensive thing to do and it gets very
very low priority that's the first half
the second half is all of those changes
when eventually they come through have
to be certified and okayed by the
individual carriers at least here in the
US to be approved to run on their
network which is just another way for
the carrier to exert their control over
what devices run on their network which
is why things like the nexus 4 scares
carriers to death I'm circumventing that
all together I can run Google Wallet on
any character than any carrier that I
want they don't have any say they don't
have any control so two main reasons why
it takes so long once you understand
what's going on behind the scenes it
kind of makes sense it it's not right
it's not cool but it makes sense and
that's another reason not only to go
unlocked but to go Nexus I think that's
yeah what yeah what you know you don't
mean months that Nexus has been released
officially it's still not landed in
India and many other countries and you
know right mixes is not up to the mark
now it's already pretty old compared to
devices you see the benchmark process it
lasts only about four thousand which is
not good enough for now hitting 12,000
in quadrant and excluding storage you
are judging your phone by the quadrant
benchmark you are making a mistake
because I'm
sure that the nexus 4 can handle any
modern games which are available out
there and once you're starting launching
your favorite applications or browsing
the internet you will not see any
difference the difference is there
analytically in the benchmarks but just
to be on the fair side I think I i I'm
right what do you think Joe because you
were more into this than I am yeah in
fact the articles that we've written
over talking I'll calm in the last even
week we can have kind of underscore this
there's only so much you can do with a
device to make it faster before you stop
noticing any difference in the speed
games are going to push that they always
have and they always will something
might look better load faster run a
little bit smoother on a higher platform
than than on a lower one a new process
or more RAM better video whatever the
case may be but for the vast majority of
people those specs are just that their
specifications made to push phones
everybody it following the 8020 rule
eighty percent of the stuff that you
that you do on your phone is going to
run exactly the same on any modern
generation phone as it does on any other
modern generation phone regardless of
how high the specifications are so
especially talking about the HTC One
they're doing that to sell product I
don't blame them I don't fault them but
I'm still going to take my Nexus 4 over
the HTC One for example because of all
of the benefits and advantages that I
have by having a Nexus device now that's
my decision that's my choice that's my
opinion yours may be different for other
reasons and my opinion is no more valid
or less valid than yours is if you want
to go that route you have a trade off
and with with slower updates and whatnot
but you've got a faster device with
higher specs I've got a trade off I get
updates faster and straight from google
and i don't have the higher specs so i'm
willing to live with my trade off if
you're willing to live with yours
everybody's happy we're all good let's
wrap it up guys yeah I'm good that's why
it's i bought the time
alright so how can we get a hold of you
if people want to say hi and agree with
your opinion or offer their own separate
one do you have twitter google+ facebook
how do you want them to talk back to you
yeah in furious book I'm sorry sh-shit
chowdhury you know i'm lame economy
that's gonna be difficult you guys held
up yeah but i hope they find me because
this is a different name and uh in
twitter i'm a little bona 20 aalst RS
that's easier very good well thank you
very much for being part of the show
today whose turn is it next to pick
somebody i forgot already Stephen oh gee
let's see uh it looks like hi Otto and
Devin have been getting antsy they're
switching seats so why don't we talk to
they finally got their tags right close
that is the reason for the true no they
have no no no they haven't got it you
gotta switch bad guys okay yeah I'm
cleaning things are whole plate written
things there we go resolved all right
how's it going that's different are you
well so far so good we're talking about
dream phones here what do you two think
um you know I would love to see Nokia
Megan Nexus I I know it wouldn't happen
but i would i would love to see that
specifically index it's not just in
android he want them to be the android
yeah yeah I I love the hardware of the
Lumia 920 I'm just not a windows phone
guy so I'd love to get my hands on
something like the 920 with uh with with
Android but what if someone else today
you know a polycarbonate super nice
camera Nexus I'm here honey HTC could do
it or nose yeah I'm pretty slow I'd be
up for that
was that a call for skepticism yes yes
making sure well I I would I challenge
anyone who has an HTC whatever the Colin
at the the windows phone 8 8 X and a
nokia 920 put them side by side and and
look at them same color tell me if you
can find out just by glancing which one
is which which one's nokia which one's
HTC yes there are differences but at
first blush yeah you're gonna
potentially confuse the two of them
right I can see that so maybe HTC could
do is take its Windows Phone design and
ported over the Android yes yes praise
the things although despite what dismiss
might would we talked about with Anton
last week I would like I would like to
see a pure view like lens on on whatever
this phone maybe oh yeah you're talking
to the 41-megapixel PureView not be
another you liked the event was great
shots since we're talking about dream
phones why don't the two peer reviews
make a baby I mean rush for you imagine
the low-light sensitivity of the 920 and
the over sampling on the purview of the
808 that will be the killer camera yeah
I would imagine that the 808 already has
pretty good light sensitivity just by
the sheer number of excellence yes it
has but you have to have a tripod handy
because once you go manual and start the
exposure times and the all the level
tweaks there's no way on earth you can
hold it steady for for I think 3.2
seconds is the maximum time which it
exposes that so that's so we'll throw in
some optical stabilization problems up
with a slightly even thicker
ridiculously thick photo well but
correct me if I'm wrong I've always
imagined or always pictured the image
stabilization just meant that you had
say a 13 megapixel camera and it threw
away all the pixels on the outside so it
just showed you it was in the middle so
now you
a 10 megapixel camera at software
stabilization up that is audition has
like a floating lens that it can you
know it's a little electromagnetic
signals to have it shake around and keep
them nice and crisp that's the new thing
very cool all right back to you guys
yeah um uh yeah bathing yeah it was
really having a dream phone would be
weird because I've never had a big phone
doesn't have to be big I've had this and
before this I had this ok and after the
green one which will be your dream phone
I mean it can be whatever you want it to
be and we discussed it i'm not a big
power user so for me a big battery
wouldn't be something I needed and I
don't generally go bigger than I
wouldn't go bigger than four inches or
4.3 cuz I have small hands so even like
I was excited to get 3.7 hold on to that
because the way the the technology and
the industry is moving forward that's
gonna be a rare thing yeah Lori is what
about like something weird like support
for interchangeable lenses I saw your
playing around with a Wednesday yeah I'm
cleaning a tease show tonight yeah what
if you could just screw a different lens
on we doing macro with your phone or on
the phone is there any lenses you can
put on the iPhones they make right ready
for patents and I think that looks
really fun okay so what if there was a
galaxy camera with all of the phone
stuff built in and SL are
interchangeable lens systems I don't
know I'm not a camera guy so application
so glad ya like a twelve thousand
million batteries oh I wasn't fond of
the galaxy camera or I know you love I
am absolutely beyond the galaxy camera
produces the same output image wise than
the galaxy s3 so it's basically the same
sensor the same camera but with the
added
optical zoom yeah the telephoto yeah
which optical zoom is that's the way to
go imagine this guy's this just came to
me how about somebody did a phone like
say we had the galaxy camera you power
it on and the lens extent how about
somebody I don't know HTC whenever you
start the camera application then the
camera lens extends out I don't know for
one centimeter for a couple of
millimeters I don't know and you can
have optical zoom and not this I don't
know which kind of zoom they bundled the
digital one which should be forbidden by
law the energies give me get broken now
how cool would that be you know as long
as it doesn't make it any thicker I'd be
into that it was absolutely make it
thicker you know it it would extend from
from say thickness 02 thickness deep
thickness T plus i don't know one
centimeter and then retread back so it
will be basically the same the only
issue you're going to have with that is
now you've just introduced this very
sensitive mechanical component to an
otherwise non-mechanical device and the
more mechanics you put into something
the greater likelihood is of breakage
the concept I think that's awesome you
get something that's nice and flat and
it'll stack out four or five nested
spheres so you've got a nice big lens
sticking out maybe even a half inch or
so and that'd be awesome I mean it look
crazy and you'd have warranty problems
out the wazoo but it would look the
pictures would be great and it has to be
waterproof yes leave the 5am oh yeah I'd
love to see something like what we
talked about with with Michael the other
in the week like the port list phone ya
know which turned into an editorial you
gave me one of those I want one of those
on the other i remember a full-sized USB
port on it yeah yeah well you read them
oh we don't mind a barrel of 42 for the
printers i wouldnt rs-232 so you can do
anything oh god ethernet jack
a little pop out phone jack so you can
hook it up and make modem calls on it it
could it could be useful I don't know
there's all the cell towers collapse and
you have a landline nearby sure well
when I went to to Singapore years and
years back I took my apple newton
message pad with me and i think that was
the message pad two thousand i might
just been the 130 at the time but while
I was over there I didn't obviously
didn't have any internet connection in
the hotel they didn't have Wi-Fi all
over the place like I am now and even so
I wouldn't have had that on my Newton as
well it was a Newton been in the you
know the 90s but I did have my motorola
x jack so i guess it had to have been my
my my message at 2000 and i took that
thing and just poked a little a little
port and out came my little phone jack
and i took the the cord from the hotel
because the the the hotel had a phone
that had a data port in the back of it
so i could just plug that in and I made
a long-distance call from Singapore out
through the hotel's lines into the
United States to get my email past me
like 20 bucks but I got off my email
from Singapore up for that yo we have
this new thing now they call it Wi-Fi
now now we do yes but I'm just imagining
what we could do with that port today 20
okay guys do you have any closing
thoughts anything camera is locked on
you while you're thinking of your
closing thoughts that's where you can
follow everybody droid age and vivi
doodle did I say that right close enough
yeah its lucky it's written there so any
closing thoughts guys uh yeah nothin I'd
like to say that those that follow me I
don't just tweet about technology like a
lot of you do for tweet towards other
tech reviewers I tweet about a lot of
real
random things so if you decide to follow
me you're gonna get a lot of really
weird stuff problem so follow our
discretion on behind I think we're
trying to sell yourself is simple just
brought you 50 more followers I just
want you to follow me and all the sudden
it's about the weird things I work out
with like I love to do that or my hair
like I do like I'm Leah he actually
complimented my hair through Twitter he
couldn't do it live no those having a
good hair day yesterday and he commented
on it awesome guys thank you very much
for joining us again and week after week
and we are trying to talk to you every
week because we love the recurring fans
as much as we love the new ones so
thanks again and have a great weekend
and Tony before we go on to our next
people I have a request coming in from
someone who's been trying to get into
the show if we have already talked to
you live if we could have you step out
of the the Hangout you can still watch
the show live but we want to make room
for other people who are trying to get
in yeah and the links are publicized on
bucket not weights that witches bucket
now a twitter account now and whoa we
got some flood here regardless it's my
time to choose and I will talk to me
lush Jaime lush let me slide your from
Syria you're close to me so good evening
to you all can you just speak a little
bit louder a little bit louder okay no
problem you know we can hear you
perfectly tell me what do you want to
talk about or whether you have a perfect
phone which is either on the market for
nobody thought of it oh well I fit I
think I got a 19 yet it know what one
does today I think well it would
probably be a phone that cares a back
cover much the back cover is not of
aluminum okay hold on let me just mute
John trevett junk tea
steffes for a second okay I did mute him
so back to you can you please repeat
your your your last sentence I couldn't
hear it well that's okay I think that no
one currently does a smartphone with
aluminum back cover so with a removable
back cover which is made of out of
aluminum ya know she does something like
that with their e72 or e52 phones that
only I can have actually it's I'm not
sure if it's aluminum or not you know
what I'll be right metal nobody take it
over I'm gonna go to the kitchen and
grab a phone I have to show this to you
so you stop ID or aluminum sounds kind
of risky broom hello let's check this
out metal I mean we talked about it cuz
it's it's strong it's gonna be sturdy
but it's not a scratch like nobody's
business oh yeah you can change it yeah
that's right if it's ray this is my HTC
g2 okay so here you go HTC g2 it's an
old old phone it's got this aluminum
back cover and it scratches but they
covered that on the top of this back
plate you can't see that there they
clear coated it so it's metal but it had
a nice varnish on it that I scratched
off because I hated it but they can do
stuff like that they can they can coat
the aluminum they can anodized the
aluminum to make it a little bit
stronger and i'm back on that exact no
that's anybody recognize this film let
me lock the camera on me let's go
landscape looks like an LG it's the LG
optimus 7 which was in the wave wave one
of windows phones and this my friends
right here is a I'm not sure if it's
aluminum or stainless steel back cover
let me just give you an idea cover your
ears this is Madeline look it's a nice
kiss perjury yeah that's um Kelly battle
really but I mean something something
like that would be cool in hand and can
be changeable and she goes with almost
anything
I agree with you but I'm not sure if I
would like that I mean the entire
purpose of going aluminum is to have a
unibody design and to eliminate as much
as possible the moving parts it's okay
with plastic I mean I think you could
get away with aluminum back covers too
but I'm not sure if it's something I
personally would prefer but again you
have a counterpoint so it's 11 user-
here and one user plus with in your case
well you know what be hot is um remember
the old IBM thinkpad the magnesium alloy
outer coating is going home yet I mean
that kind of smudge is up a little but
it's sturdy is all hacking it looks nice
from a distance at least it might be
very expensive that I'm not sure mee-mah
should what what platform would it run
or what would be its top two features
well for my favorite poem would be
probably android cousin to enter it and
actually actually enjoys has the most
customization things that you would it
be would it be stock Android or voted
Bronx Zoo have a I don't know custom
overlay on top of Android or baked in as
joe explained to achieve well I'm offers
just right but I don't know we
have like hundreds of skins you can use
on top of itself where everyone's flavor
that's that just tell me about the
processor memory internal storage camera
battery okay sceptile processors and
everything go go with time so as time
goes by it just bring back their frog ah
better processors that have a better
power consumption and everything so I
wouldn't talk about that so as
technology will bring anything but every
month or so but I would go with the big
screen so I'm like for another 4.3
inches to 4.5 inches so that's not
that's not a big screen anymore
that's that that's what I'm saying so I
wouldn't go for a big screen but a
smaller screen with oh you wouldn't i
miss our nation you wouldn't go okay
okay yeah so it would leave like 720p
because nothing there love us a lot less
batteries I mean that would be just
defective and different camp info with
decent sized battery that lasts you
throughout the day without any problems
so that would be so perfect ok and then
how about is how does the camera shoot
camera I don't use camera camera so much
so I'm okay with anything like it like a
pixel is just for me personally because
I shall I have my Nexus here so I Kevin
nexus 4 and I thought how did you get a
nexus or in Serbia ah now you your this
is a funny story I got it I know person
cuz I'm here 200 kilometers for us I got
I got it as a present from my operator
my mobile operator well I have to move
there and sign a contract and sign up
for an operator listen listen to this I
can't I got it on the phone shack that's
25 bucks I got a 16gb white Nexus that
is not not terrible no not to share yeah
so just normal nexus and i got it for
free wow so they're just that is just
the best thing and bus on the contract i
got unlimited calls I'm limited decibels
unlimited data and what's wrong engines
so people you make a note there are
carriers like this somewhere around the
world yeah move to Serbia losa serviette
why not everything's just as it is
except except when we won't forget
something something new and you can like
well but but then your carrier just
gives you one yeah something ugh
okay Miller's do you have any final
thoughts final thoughts I don't know
final thoughts or questions to anybody
on the team I want to ask him something
real quick go on and uh not carrying
that much about a camera could you live
with a phone with no camera at all if
that meant having the Excite Lee bigger
battery or something or Harvard you'd
like to have it just in case I I
personally I personally could without
without the camera because as I said I
got three images in two months with my
Nexus so that's like stupid and I got my
back and I got the nexus 4 with no
camera and I'd tear it a lot and I don't
know just I don't care about the camera
me rest early nuts so again and so it's
took it with me yeah I don't know small
front-facing camera would will Jake her
something like skype talking or or
joining the pocket now hang out that
exactly something like that awesome tell
everybody where they can't find you on
twitter if I got a Twitter but I don't
use it you don't use it if you want to
publicize any other link which is
related to you facebook google+ I don't
know your blog not nothing more needs to
call me and they can call me at as my
name is displayed on facebook and one
more thing I guess I got what you to get
on a hangout today and at what i can to
do something with my birthday PP o--
have a very very happy birthday and
since we're talking about birthdays you
are not the only birthday boy our own
michael fisher is also having a birthday
today so everybody who has a birthday
today including you two guys have a very
happy birthday Michael's turning 21 I
think he wishes he wishes me gosh thank
you very much for joining us today and
please do come back next week if you
have time yeah thank you but take care
bye bye and with this are gonna hand it
up to joy and Joe and then to Stephen
and I think after that we'll have to
wrap it up alright so I've got
a friend of mine who's been trying to
get in for a long time so was all up
laughing sorry he's a pocket now friend
okay so i'll go ahead and introduce
yourself to everybody i know you who you
are but they don't what device do you
carry where are you from I'm and what
would be your perfect phone i love it i
geti only have two galaxies white and i
am from india and i think so this year's
perfect porn is samsung galaxy s4 just
because it's cool just because it's cool
what makes it cool and if you could
improve upon it what would you do to
make it even better see ya a what is it
he's a get out of jail he air you if you
don't be this friend that's really cool
and that the smart seasons videos and a
little bit of connection problems and he
dropped out so okay just a pick up where
he left off then um having a nice
package and he was lucky to get back he
got back sorry my internet connection so
much snow so I so you were saying about
how you like the the samsung apps that
are coming built in with the galaxy s4
and that makes that makes the device
cooler because of smart stay in the s
pen and other stuff like that yes but
why did not recycle cake because it
simply do a stupid video I don't know
why Sam since adding these things so is
the the battery that's coming in the the
galaxy s4 is that big enough for you for
your perfect phone or which you go with
a bigger battery with a little bit
longer life well I miss school because i
connect it up Oh a night and keep it
overnight and then get up in the morning
and you knew it and you said you've got
the galaxy y right now does it give you
enough battery life to make it through
the whole day so you just charge it a
night know if there is only for someone
in house
I wish itachi the innocent problem with
this one so you have to charge in the
middle of the day to be able to get
through whole day yes I've got being
music playing games and feeding you you
need to touch it I think I agree in fact
I've just I've come back to my phone now
my nexus 4 again and i found that i'm
using it more and more for facebook
unfortunately but also for reading
ebooks I've got a couple ebo an e book
series that I'm reading right now so I
have the screen on for a long time and
battery sizes one of the things that's
really hurting me because that you know
it's not an e-ink display it's not a
paper so it still uses a lot of energy
just to to display the text on the
screen and there's something about
reading reading a book with white text
on a black background that I just can't
get used to so I can't even save power
that way and how is the advantage we get
to sit I mean it to school on my Nexus 4
I have a ducted I don't know what you
call the orb that you put it on so i
charged it all day while i'm at work and
i don't have a problem with it but
before i have that i'd have to charge it
up overnight and then i'd have to charge
it up again at least once through the
day just to be able to make it to the
end of the day so it's it's not big
enough in my opinion but as long as
you're near a charger or sit at a desk
like i do it you know it works for me we
are still broadcasting just in that way
yeah we hung up for a permit it looks
like ok a lot thank you for joining us
tell us how people can get a hold of you
if they want to say hello and if you've
got any last questions or a thought that
you want to wrap up on you are muted
well make sure to come get your
microphone ok again we get soft it up
it's a scary movie can you get software
updates after routing so I assume the
question is if you've got a stock rom
that you have rooted and you want to get
a stock software update
the answer to that is probably yes
depending on how you rooted it if you
routed by replacing your recovery image
with a like clockwork mod or TW RP then
know you're probably not going to be
able to unless you go back and put the
the stock recovery image back on the
device that just is because of the way
that those stock images over the error
distributed they have a digital
signature to them and you've got to have
that stock image to be able to to work
with them it's it's how they kind of
keep them from being hacked which never
works anymore but also how they make
sure that the the update was accurate
that it was downloaded completely and
not corrupt one thing to keep in mind is
you are probably going to lose your
route when you update in fact that's one
of the main reasons why people like to
update why carriers and whatnot like to
update is so they can close the the loop
so that people can't root their device
o'rear ooting may be difficult after you
update and I think he for the first time
tonight got unlucky because he got
disconnected and somebody else too cuz
his place yes so he's messaging me right
now which is coming through to my pebble
smartwatch I i I'm says he don't work he
says he's having internet connections
and he wants to say goodbye to everyone
and thank you for having him on the air
so thank you a lot for being here with
us we appreciate it he says his Twitter
account is on he sent them too fast so I
can't read that one and have to get hot
so when pebble is not perfect I did an
article telling how the pebble is not
perfect but he says his Twitter account
is at a lop underscore s which is alaap
underscore and the letter s so thank you
for being part of the show today and
with that we'll send it over to Steven
okay I think we have time for one more
guest to talk to hear how about Andre
Andre how are you doing going unmute
your mic there then I'm i have a samsung
galaxy ace 2 years and
I kinda like it my doubt is a I don't
know if I the right choice is HTC One or
galaxy s4 that's the eternal question
and because I'm i really like the trees
and I don't like this talk and write um
and I don't like since 52 but i really
like HTC one's design like the hardware
guess which the software was a little
more there's an antigen mod for that
yeah but that goes back to the the stock
rom experience so the AOSP experience so
what he may need to do is wait for a
touch with style launcher to come out to
to apply off the top of it and so my
perfect phone would be a phone with dead
trees and minion any body I think that
it's my perfect phone so you're saying
if the HTC One had a baby with the s4
yes I got a thing on me heavy every
screen too and I think far ultrapixel
camera was the wrong wrong choice to HTC
you'd rather have the 13-megapixel
Samsung accessory yes ok or 8 megapixel
for me to place selecting a talk more
it's always good and that's that is
going to in Oh another thing that I
would like to say is it Johnny life of
evil wherever his name's said that is
working on a flat design for iOS 7 and I
think the iOS iOS problem is not the
design because I think the current the
iOS design is good but it's more about
software I think they
he because iOS is simple but not that
simple and for example when we connect
iOS device to our PC or Mac when we want
to synchronize itunes for example when
we want to put new photos he will delete
all the old photos and upload any words
no that is not correct it will it will
basically copy all the images to your
phone images which are in your photo
library either an iphoto or aperture so
if you're syncing up a phone with an
iTunes which doesn't know that phone
then you will delete all the pictures
and the videos and that they will be
replaced by the ones which are in your
iTunes library but if you're using the
same phone with the same library that's
not happening okay it's I said this
because some friends of mine and di di
phone and they they have that problem i
have two ipads and I don't put photos or
anything I just use the apps I don't I
just synchronize the synchronize them
one time and I don't need to lighten so
that I just use I chose to listen to
music Oh another thing about HTC
boomsound is that when I want to listen
music in my phone or see videos I always
use my my headphones so I don't need
boom sound okay Steven um anything else
you want to add here we're running low
on time any final thoughts yeah okay
great well thank you for stopping by and
talking with us come back next time
hopefully ways it off you're right thank
you okay and i think that with that we
will
have to wrap this episode up not before
