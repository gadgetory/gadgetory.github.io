resolution of the possible google pixel
excel to Samad new renders claimed to
belong to the Galaxy Note 8 though we
doubt it and Apple will soon make it
easier for you to replace the broken
display on your iPhone I'm high memory
that I end up yeah I know it's Saturday
but how do we do the Friday video this
is fog it out daily the official news
today has to do with oboe and its launch
of the are eleven are eleven plus are on
Hwan bag now is currently in Chan Jen at
the event and he had the opportunity to
see the are eleven everything he could
do it's got the latest and greatest
Snapdragon mid-range chipset and this is
one thing that makes Oppo famous the
fact that the company is able to do the
best with it their smartphones do look a
lot like iPhones but this one supports a
dual camera module that also follows on
the seven plus but the idea that you
don't really need the large one to get
this dual camera capability let's see
what we get whenever our review data
riots and speaking of dual cameras the
honor nine is right around the corner
and we've got some China Mobile leaks
that show us for example the fact that
it brings the Kara 960 chipset the fact
that it brings six gigabytes of RAM
which I think would be a first for this
profile of honor smartphones and then
again seems that it brings some sort of
a 3d type of glass that we can't wait to
confirm other than that this claims to
be pretty much a great successor to the
honor rate let's see what we get now
let's talk about Apple as the company is
working on making the need for you to
replace your broken display easier as of
the end of this year the company is
going to be deploying four hundred of
its horizon machines to different retail
stores in 25 countries with the idea
that you don't longer have to go into an
Apple store to get your screen replace
this is all great as there is this new
legislation that's forcing companies to
give consumers the right to repair and
as it stands even though the iPhone
screen replacement is easy how about a
Samsung fellowship for my broken Galaxy
s8 and speaking of Samsung some recent
renders emerge at the possible Galaxy
Note 8 and the only reason we're
featuring them is because they look a
lot like some previous dummy devices
that have
urghhh where the dual cameras are
vertical on the possible Galaxy Note 8
we don't think it's real it looks really
really shady
we can't even confirm the source but
regardless if this design were real I
would really like it I don't know about
you guys let us know in the comments and
finally the very hot news did they have
to do with some recent benchmarks that
have emerged of the possible Google
pixel Excel - the reason why they're hot
is not necessarily because of the
snapdragon 835 to the 4 gigs of ram but
because if you do the math under display
resolution apparently this is a 17 point
5 by 9 display and this is something
that is great why because there weren't
worse bezels and 2016 than the Google
pixel and pixel excel the fact that the
company wants to work on bringing the
taller aspect ratio could be great
mainly because the pixel excel wasn't a
small phone but it leads me to the
question of the day do you think if the
Google pixel should make the move to you
know 17.5 by a 9 or whatever in my case
I think that if I had to choose between
that and the bezels I would go for that
but leave us a comment down below let us
know what you think
