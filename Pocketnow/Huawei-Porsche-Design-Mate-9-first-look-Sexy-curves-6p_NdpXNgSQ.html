has a nice little surprise for us a
high-fashion companion to the mate nein
what's styling by Porsche design this
phone diverges from the regular mate
nine and a couple key areas first the
screen shrinks to a 5.5 inch display and
the resolution bumps up to a proper quad
HD 2560 by 1440 the screen features a
curve which the rear of the phone
matches a symmetry bringing the edges of
this phone to three millimeters of
thickness a design trick we've seen
before but one which will hopefully last
a bit longer on store shelves the
fingerprint sensor also migrates from
the rear of the phone to under the
display where this mate inherits the
gestures found on Huawei's recent tablet
offerings and the headphone jack jumps
from the top of the phone to the bottom
occupying the spot where we would
normally have a second empty vent
opposite the main phone speaker
otherwise we have a very similar
experience to that found on the standard
version of the phone
ciar√°n 960 chipset like a dual camera
system a large 4000 milliamp hour
battery with crazy fast charging specs
and 64 gigabytes of storage with the
option for dual SIM support in certain
regions with this move though Huawei is
trying to address some of the lifestyle
issues found in building a phone fan
following the emotional side of owning a
gadget does it fit your fashion does it
look good
Huawei executives hope this is the
magical combo of high-tech components
and emotional touches to design details
that will convince consumers to pony up
the cash for premium pricing that
premium landing at 1359 euro does the
Porsche designed mate 9 light your fire

some sales in the luxury crowd drop us
