calm and in this video we're going to
compare the Nokia Lumia 900 with the HTC
Titan to let's check them out okay we
just finished a benchmark for speed
tests between the HTC Titan 2 and the
nokia lumia 900 let me add got at 85
overall score while the time to got a 98
overall scores you can see the results
here overall we see a much faster speed
over here so for the data area anyway
let's go and do some screen tests so
hopefully we'll be able to see
difference here there's your color ramp
let's look at the blacks so you need
quite a difference in the blacks much
more of a black black here we see barely
a difference in the bezel or is this is
a much greater black now let's look at
the whites both of these are on maximum
brightness by the way we see much better
whites over here on the Titan to these
whites are very gray so there's a
difference there let's look at the
spectrum looks pretty smooth I kind of
see a little bit of a line on the Lumia
900 so I think the smoother gradients
are over here pretty good better whites
over here and let's do the color angle
so yeah that changes
some of that was reflection so there's
your screen differences better blacks
over here but it waits over here bigger
size over here so there's some
differences there now let's go into
let's see the web browser
alright we're going to do some html5
tests of course fish IE both these are
on Wi-Fi as well so it's fair now we can
see a little bit of a difference in the
frames per second we're actually getting
a little bit faster on the Titan 247
over here 52 over here so we've got a
little bit better html5 rendering let's
see how quickly it renders the desktop
version of pocket now those pretty close
and we're both doing pretty quickly not
a huge difference
our next up let's try a game let's see
if there's any difference here launching
Angry Birds
both are doing very well pretty close
let's see if we can get this synced up
again same same same
and that's exactly the same
no difference in speed noticeable there
let's see about launching the camera
ready very very close all right so
performance-wise we're looking very
close even though technically tighten to
is faster now what about the hardware I
mean the feel of it this is a very
unique feel on Louie 900 this
polycarbonate body or is this time too
it's a kind of plastic gates soft touch
soft touch up there it's not a terribly
unique design in terms of HTC's other
phones it was pretty nice we got the
curve here let's see what sound they
make when we drop them Titan two bounces
a little and a camera button I'm going
to give the winner to the Titan tube
because it feels different there's
actually little texture there whereas
this feels the same as everything else
and we have a nice half press feel and a
full press feel or is this one is much
more subtle and you have pressing
now let's look at the differences in the
camera settings so right here we see
some differences you have panorama shot
burst shots and we also have a little
indicator here of your automatic scene
so it's choosing a nice scene right
there and you see the little icon person
that doesn't do anything it actually
thanks for pressing the viewfinder and
we'll take a picture we have scenes
intelligent auto which seems to work
pretty well they have lots of seeing
options here whereas over here we have
just automatic scenes and not so many
options we have effects to choose from
all sorts of vintage filters
overexposing lots of different things
there we have smile capturing turn that
on we have resolution of 16 megapixels
and lots of different options there
where's over here we just have white
balance exposure value there are some
effects though just a few
contrast saturation let's move the log
here face detection we have there's our
white balance brightness contrast
saturation sharpness auto ISO and we
have resolution a mega pixels for your
choice and a couple other choices there
on the nokia but we still have more on
the HTC red eye reduction and turn that
on image stabilization it's not optimal
but that's okay metering mode further
adjustments so we have a lot more
options in the HTC Titan to camera next
let's look at what kind of value added
apps each of these phones comes with or
you can download free first off they're
both from 18 to so you both get all the
same ATT apps so these are all the same
we have some of them are already bundled
with the phone when you buy it but
here's our difference we have no key
collection and we have HTC apps so this
is going to be a decided point over on
nokia we have acc sports in division CNN
ESPN Elmo creative studio which gives
you all sorts of filters you can do
panoramic photo combinations so kind of
where we have built into the camera here
we have a little app that we can make
panoramas with it also includes all
sorts of alteration filters cropping
exposure levels so that's a really good
at we also have the app highlights which
is kind of comparable to the HTC hub
except doesn't have whether it just kind
of suggests some apps nokia drive is
kind of comparable to locations on HTC
no Kate drive includes free downloads
for all sorts of map data around the
world however locations give you a 30
day trial of all those maps around the
world but after that you're going to
have to pay a fee to either use them
forever or use them by the month you
know whichever one you choose this is a
DLNA app so you can stream media from
other DLNA devices we do not have one of
those on nokia tango anybody can
download dock mode photo enhancers more
of filters there's a unit converter a
list notes flashlight which will turn on
your flashes on back of the device
compass calculator so we got a lot of
apps over here over here we have milky
mass which is kind of a different
version of local scalp where you can
find locations nokia transit is really
nice out for getting directions using
public transportation contacts transfer
will transfer contacts over bluetooth so
both of these devices have a lot of
extra free apps from HTC and from nokia
the and there's quite a difference in
your selection so both these phones have
ATT LTE high-speed data so you're going
to get really fast from the axis there's
a difference in the cameras Titan to has
it 16 megapixel camera or as the Lumia
900 has it only an 8 megapixel camera
will show you some tests those later on
so check that out now the only other
thing that we need to compare between
these two is the price tag titan 2 is
going to be 199 with a two-year contract
whereas the Lumia 900
it's only ninety nine dollars with a
two-year contract so the differences are
better White's bigger screen more
megapixels in the camera versus a
cheaper price better blacks on the
screen smaller screen kind of a better
material so there's your comparison
between the Nokia Lumia 900 and the HTC
Titan to give us a thumbs up if you
liked this video and that's it for now
