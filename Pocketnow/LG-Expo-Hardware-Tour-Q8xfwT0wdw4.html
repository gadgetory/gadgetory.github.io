calm and we're going to look at the
hardware tour for the LG expo on ATT
first of all this has a snapdragon
processor it's kind of 3.2 inch 480 x
800 wvga screen with 16 million colors
Wi-Fi of course all the usual suspects
bluetooth 2.1 micro SD art and tribe and
3g and quad band gsm of course let's
look a little closer up here as our
speaker and a little LED light and if
you can see in there there's some
sensors their proximity sensor and
ambient light sensors and at the bottom
we have our ATT logo and this is a
fingerprint scanner where i can swipe
like that and it'll login or i can press
it down to you know action button and I
can also go at this to scroll or up and
down which is pretty nice works as an
optical joystick as well we have a call
send an end button and a back bend no
windows key on this so
that's kind of odd since Microsoft is
really recommending to have that and we
at the bottom you got the microphone
over here we have a camera button we
still have tape all over this they
really taped it up nice for protective
at anyway that is your camera button and
this is a customizable fun it launches
the task manager which is really nice to
have that under this flap you got your
micro SD card slot the top with a power
/ suspend button right there and then we
have another flap which is your micro
USB port which also works as headset and
we have a lanyard hole volume up and
down buttons those are like right in the
middle it's a good placement
okay I'm back we have a five megapixel
camera still taped up another microfiber
and a LED flash LG logo and this is
really nice we have a little latch
really nice way to get the batter your
cover off and if you see right there are
little pins for you to attach other
accessories like the mobile projector
that is not yet available you'll also
have a reset button under there that
right there in the middle ok this is a
fifteen hundred million per hour battery
pretty good and I don't slide out and
you have your keyboard buttons pretty
flat they're large kind of hard to feel
but if you look at them you can feel the
difference between them a little bit
it's not as good as touch pro2 which has
a lot of space between the keys and
their large keys expo has almost same
size keys but they're closer together so
they're harder to feel
but look what else we have a start
button and a home button and ok button
and look at all this function gets you
the blue calendar get see the email get
you internet explorer and another
messaging I cannot figure out which one
that was text messaging maybe but all of
these function keys are also
customizable in the buttons control
panel which means you can reprogram them
and that's really nice having a start
menu here is great for being able to
access men using navigation you have
four-way arrow keys so you can use those
to navigate on latest HTC devices they
removed start button and ok button from
the keyboard which is real pain because
they have to go up your old in like this
you have to touch the screen and do
stuff like you got to take your hand off
the keyboard I want to do this and I
want to do that much easier anyway I
believe that's it for the hardware tour
stay tuned for more on the software</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
