Roberto Amelia's get resistance at least
a head Nintendo consoles back in your
days wow I didn't know that Nintendo was
that old and ha ha ha it's the haircut
and glad you like it I like it too
that's right it's that time of the week
I am high memory that I this is pocket
now and this is the bargain out daily
recap for last week brought to you by
Linda calm so I Monday ask you of
everything that you've seen would make
you want to buy an Apple watch as a
survey say that millions of people want
to buy one we have thirteen hundred and
seventy-five comments thanks a lot guys
out of which setting of Alaska says
where the LG G watch are at the moment
no way I'm switching to an overpriced
piece of garbage from apple and in your
case you'd have to switch the phone as
well so but you've made the good choice
same here ramdev says not only does
Apple watch not look good which is the
biggest reason why I'm not buying it but
I don't own an iphone so I have no use
for it and yeah that's gonna be the case
for many neurons says less than a day of
battery life wait too many gimmicks jack
the price this release isn't as amazing
as the iphones released in 2007 that
pedo actually made me want to buy an
iphone no not so for this one sorry
Apple and that's going to be the case
for a lot of people a lot of people
don't trust that when they're first
generation products and we will see
eventually then on Tuesday ask you what
particular games would you want from
Nintendo as the company has finally
smelled the coffee and they will bring
Nintendo games to the masses on
smartphones we have nine hundred twenty
three carbons out of which one of them
says I think Nintendo should make all
the titles available on Android and iOS
I should like to pay for the exact
titles that I want and that would be the
smart strategy but very hard to assume
if that will happen in hunter says it's
about time in Tendo opens up they
finally admitted no one wants to buy the
wii u to buy a game I'll take one order
of Mario Kart please and add me to that
list please as well and Seth says
unfortunately DNA stated that it will
focus on new titles with Nintendo
branding so hyman probably won't see
smash brothers anytime soon for mobile
Nintendo still doesn't understand what
fan
want the only reason in Tendo has fans
is purely for nostalgia and they don't
seem to understand it as well as expect
that and the great comment that is
exactly true that is the point Nintendo
seriously doesn't get it yet hopefully
they do eventually and when they ask you
if you would pay five thousand dollars
for attack your SmartWatch as the
company's teaming up with Google to
bring us some Android wear love an
expensive watch band we have 30 and 39
comments out of which grammar nazi says
I'm getting the 18 carat gold Apple
watch so no I'm not interested in a tag
heuer model carrot dude aren't you
supposed to be the grammar nazi then
King says 5k for an Apple watch that's
basically like throwing your money in
the yard and selling a match for it if I
ok protect your SmartWatch since it
would be like an investment that would
retain the majority of its value
absolutely that all depends dude this is
still a gadget meaning Android well or
will eventually die on this thing or
whatever so it's not really the case at
eriko says ok for a watch that will last
forever or 5k for a SmartWatch that will
last until they stop the software
updates I think I've already decided of
course I could not afford fat k watch
right that's the first point but the
you've got a good point as well who
would pay so much money for a product
that would be obsolete a year from now
but on Thursday ask you if you would go
to an apple store to give an Apple watch
a try as a Apple is going to give you 15
minutes of a demo of what it's like and
then try to sell it to you we have 441
comments out of which Williams says I
would go try the Apple watch but won't
buy one and I think that's the smartest
thing just go to an apple store give it
a try and see how that goes and Nick
guest says I trust Apple so I'm going to
preorder without trying I've seen enough
from the videos to know how to use it
and what finnish band the color options
i want if i don't like it i can always
return it no harm done pretty sure i
won't though and that's the advantage
you guys have in the US and other
countries you can just return a product
that doesn't happen in every other
country so yeah you could always just
give it a try and return it that's the
cool thing you've got the option go
ahead comptons soldier JC says the
15-minute walk through is more than
enough to
tell users that either they are that not
that bright or they just have too much
time to waste it's a watch on like a
smartphone which is a full-blown device
that would make sense to have a walk
through and this is not like every other
smart watch so I do believe that the
walkthrough is in order mainly because I
feel that this is probably the most
convoluted you why that Apple has ever
done and I would need some explaining
here so I'm sure everybody else will as
well and then finally on Friday I asked
you if you were looking out for the
second generation moto 360 as a lenovo
CEO showed off the next generation moto
360 and the sad news for me for example
we have 327 comments out of which one of
them says I like the look of the Moto
360 but the software just isn't there
yet that is the only reading that's
holding me back from a purchase and to
be honest with the only reason why i
bought the moto 360 is because i like
the way it looks so much that i really
don't care about the software it's
useful but it looks so good as a watch
that i really don't care about the
software again which is mainly the
reason you would buy any typical watch
there is no software you just care about
the way it looks and sugar-free target
says i'm still having a hard time
understanding why anyone would buy a
SmartWatch other than just having the
latest piece of technology well it's not
the latest piece of technology in my
opinion it's like a couple of years ago
technology sadly i feel that smart
watches are not there yet again the only
reason why i like the Moto 360 is
because i like the way it looks as a
watch particularly the more shawn says
there's no doubt that the next
generation moto 360 will have to have a
better OS but the million-dollar
question is whether it will also come
with improve battery life if moto could
pull out a week's battery life the Apple
watch would be doomed and dude you have
a point right there battery life is
really the biggest problem with
smartwatches except the pebbles so
whichever company figures that one out
will have the market but then pebble did
and they still don't and folks if you've
ever wanted to become a pro in web
design learn how to build a cupcake or
even build a cool video like this one
