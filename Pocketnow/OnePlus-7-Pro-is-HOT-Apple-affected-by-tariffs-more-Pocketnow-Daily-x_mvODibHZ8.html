far hotter than we expected Apple took a
big hit yesterday after Trump's tariffs
got in effect for products shipped from
China and if you have one of these
whatsapp versions you should consider
uninstalling or upgrading the app I'm
hyeme ever Iveta live from the 1 plus 7
pro event it was really hot our video is
already live and we've got more coverage
coming soon
this is pocket out daily man this whole
Amazon becoming a retailer for Apple
products is really making them enticing
currently $70 off every single variant
of the Apple watch series 4 is the one
that I recommend the most definitely I
hope that this whole deal between Apple
and Amazon continues as it's only making
everything a lot more compelling some
prices are just the way they should be
now let's talk about Lenovo the company
just launched a foldable laptop
yesterday or should I say they showcase
the product that they have no name for
that is going to be launched in 2020 and
yet regardless of how ridiculous it is
to announce something so vaguely the
product is actually really cool the
whole concept of actually having a
laptop that becomes more of a notepad
whenever you want it to or becomes more
of a book whenever you want it to and
there's even an optional keyboard again
2020 we're gonna have to wait but to be
honest with you it looks really cool now
let's talk about whatsapp as well we've
got a new vulnerability that just came
out follow the link of the description
for the versions that are being affected
as well this vulnerability allows
anybody to install malware on your phone
through a phone call even if you don't
answer it
so definitely an upgrade is important
apparently the only a certain small
amount of phones have been affected
promise small amounts for the amount of
whatsapp install ability is huge so yeah
I thought that these were secure man but
apparently it's not as well the
spotlight over to Apple particularly one
more time because well their stocks are
down 6% but honestly all the stock
market is after the whole Trump tariffs
there are higher price tags on
accessories like 25% taxes and certain
accessories
have also become more expensive but
according to analyst prices are not
necessarily going to grow on all Apple
products immediately they will over time
and yeah that's making it really really
scary as apparently there are more
tariffs coming eventually and finally
the hottest news today is definitely the
1 plus 7 Pro which we have here our
hands-on video is already live we've got
more videos coming very soon
our impressions of the 1 plus 7 Pro are
definitely very positive this is a new
strategy for oneplus in the past the
whole competition was of a price tag
device that also had good specs now it's
actually gotten more things going for it
than just the specifications obviously
we've got comparisons coming up we've
got a full review let us know in the
comments down below what specific
coverage would you like from the oneplus
7 pro definitely the comparison that I'm
looking forward to most is with the
Galaxy S 10 plus particularly because of
this display compared to that one and
other things that will keep you posted
coming very soon leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know what you want to
see friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on pocketnow.com
and also subscribe on social media as
most of our extended coverage of this
event and everything is happening there
you'd also follow me on Twitter Jaime
underscoring that aren't it's the
grandma time every letter please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw
I'm Jaime metric that I thank so much
for watching I'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
