seven syllables though it only has six
so you really need to learn how to count
I'm a you say Monday and here it's
Tuesday in India you can always move
over here dude you were literate and I
know I struggled reading your comments
seriously that's right it's that time of
the week I am high metal you later this
is pocket now and this is the parking
out daily recap for last week so on
Monday ask you what do you think about
apples rumored strategy to sell you the
Apple watch as rumors claim that the
company is going to hire special
employees to give you a more fashionable
experience we have 500 5 comments out of
which leo says oh and the only employees
that could get me to buy the Apple watch
a naked scarlett johansson with nothing
but an apple logo covering her lower
lady bits oh and she has to sell it to
me for like 300 to 350 dollars tops and
yeah and pumpkin potete says Apple is
trying to make the apple watch a
luxurious accessory instead of a piece
of technology not sure if the strategy
will work but I don't see the apple
watch replacing an actual watch anytime
soon it can replace it in the fact that
it gives you the time but obviously to
make it a luxurious watch in everything
that a luxury watch has like a Rolex is
a different story half that is right and
trai says I am an apple hater but credit
were due Apple is by far the best
company regarding marketing strategies
if someone can pull off this item it's
them uh well Apple has had a couple of
bucks then on Tuesday I asked you what
Google need to do to have you buy an
android wear smart watch as the rumours
back then wear that Google was going to
launch lollipop the next day which it
did we'll talk about that a little later
we have 132 comments out of which aaron
says better integration with Google Maps
I want to explore the city with my watch
instead of holding my phone all the time
when I am traveling sometimes I have to
hold luggage with both hands this is the
scenario where Google Maps on watches
comes very handy you have a very
interesting point we do a lot of
traveling here and mainly the reason why
we like smartwatches indeed and then we
don't like the battery life because
obviously while we're traveling for
hours it becomes a problem so yes there
is a lot of use that a SmartWatch could
bring like for example maps and
navigation true but again it is still
undercooked so I do agree with your
point and jumping
now says Google needs to give me a
cheaper option I'm not going to invest
two hundred three hundred dollars for a
product that's going to have a successor
in a couple of months a hundred dollars
I can live with that and then Google
could say that yes you buy smart watches
every year every two years and they
charge a lot more money for them the
price point is a good point for some but
I would rather they charge me the same
amount of money and gave me a better
product but that's my two cents and
Vince Oh says a week of battery life
less than hundred fifty dollars for good
not an LG G watch hardware and spec
device good looks and hit moto 360 and
basically that's what it's about you
have a very interesting point here and
it's the reason why even though I use a
gear live right now my favorite
SmartWatch is still the pebble it looks
good it gives you a week of battery life
and it is extremely useful but again
there are things that I wish the pebble
did that Android where does and there's
just so much there where we wish
somebody would find the formula but on
Wednesday ask you of you are now
interested in an Android wear SmartWatch
as Google had just launched Android 5.0
lollipop for Android wear with some very
interesting enhancements and we have 266
comments out of which one of them says
improve battery life I'll take it yes
battery life has improved not
significantly but it has improved
Redmond bandy says in my humble opinion
smart watches are still gimmicks until
manufacturers decide to give them
features that will make them useful for
the average person i will be happy with
my regular watch we have very different
opinions for example in my case i would
rather buy a SmartWatch and have some
functionality then pay a lot of money or
the same amount of money for a watch
that just looks good and has no
functionality in additions just giving
me the time which a smartphone can do so
that's the reason why I invest into
smartwatches but you do have a point
that many people around in the world
probably most are following Andruw Swan
says I'm interested in the Moto 360 but
I'm holding back because it's still a
first generation device and you had so
many good comments in the week we did
mention you last week but this was so
good I just had to mention it again up
yes I think that the biggest problem
with Android wear is that it's a first
generation product you have a very good
point I think we should wait especially
for the amount of money definitely a
good point
but on Thursday I asked you if you
aren't interested in a galaxy s6 edge as
sources were clashing over its
possibility but do rumors claim that
apparently it will happen we have 315
comments out of which 8-bit says if flag
in one screen wasn't enough the six edge
is the phone for you more the screen
more the legs TouchWiz s lies away uh
back yeah good point hopefully lollipop
fixes things for samsung or else I wish
they would just adopt you know stock
Android and jonathan says I don't think
it's necessary to make a galaxy s6 edge
you have the note edge already just be
satisfied with that and yeah I mean if
they haven't sold many note edges than
what would be the point agreed and
what's up 4488 says the galaxy s6 edge
sure would be an interesting phone but
in comparison to other phones it's not
interesting enough for me to get it if
they keep on having things like TouchWiz
without a change uh true the problem is
this without TouchWiz it's not like of
stock android supports you know touch
you know the the edge display and
everything TouchWiz has to exist they
just have to fix it and finally on
Friday I asked you if you like being
forced to purchase a phablet if you want
a nexus as the news are that the nexus 5
production assaulted and once those uh
stocks run out that's all you got we
have 735 comments out of which sunny
says Nexus 5 already had good
specifications and was plenty powerful
for the price it should have kept it as
an alternative to the gigantic Nexus 6
just like Apple kept the iphone 5s as an
alternative to the newer 6 and 6s bad
move google and i think all of us agree
with that i mean why just ditch the
nexus 5 but then again I think the phone
didn't sell really well and that had a
lot to do with it but it wasn't the
markets fault they had so much trouble
putting it in the market that that's the
reason why people just forgot about that
an aerodynamic says I think the fact
that Google stop production of the Nexus
5 pretty much confirms that Google will
launch is accessible than 2015 not
necessarily we know Google and Google
doesn't really do that then Bruno gonna
says in my opinion the nexus 6 destroy
the Nexus concept Nexus 5 was the
flagship killer the pure smooth stock
Android experience the good price the
Nexus 6 is just your typical flagship
very disappoint
not necessarily I covered time the nexus
one that was my first android phone and
back then obviously in very different
dimensions Google followed the same
strategy and then find success they've
done it with every single Nexus product
later no success I think that Google is
not really out there to make money and
what they wanted to show people what
Android can do hence the reason why we
need a flagship but I do agree that they
should have kept things with a nexus 5
or at least launches accessor or a
revamp like the iphone 5c but then Apple
you know they didn't have success with
that so there's just so much on the
table and we have a company doesn't
really care and that's really the
problem that's it for a parking out
daily recap thank you very much for
