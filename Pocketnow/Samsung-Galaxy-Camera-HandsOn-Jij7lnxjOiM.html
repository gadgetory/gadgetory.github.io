pocketnow.com here at Aoife in Berlin in
the Samsung section 2012 has been a very
interesting year for cameras and mobile
phone manufacturers in particular nokia
with the peer view 808 earlier this year
released a amazing camera that you can
make phone calls on this year excuse me
later this year at Eva here Samsung is
releasing a device that is just as
amazing as a camera but with no phone
but with the full version of Android in
fact the newest version of Android
running it this is the Samsung Galaxy
camera our version is magenta here
because that is the color that we like I
will show you what it's running this is
running Android jellybean 4.1 I believe
dot one yes 4.1.1
with full accelerometer support is just
like a phone you can run it in portrait
or landscape it has the full suite of
apps and it's not just Wi-Fi it's on
Wi-Fi at the moment this device also has
HSPA radio for 3g and 4g connectivity as
well as Wi-Fi and direct Wi-Fi direct
support as well so you can send pictures
to compatible devices that way no matter
which home screen you are on you have a
camera shortcut down here in the corner
is tap it the lens extends mechanically
just like on a similar samsung camera
such as the WB 850 what happened to
viewfinder mode there and we have a new
settings menu automatic mode obviously
for we're all shooting modes this is
probably going to be the mode that most
users spend most of their time in but if
you hop into smart throw this is
actually quite a lot of fun there are a
lot of shooting modes and automatic
settings for exposure time and to
optimize various scenarios all of which
are helpfully labeled on this giant
display here which measures 4.8 inches
by the way it's HD super clear touch is
what Samsung is calling up we hop on out
of this go to expert mode we have manual
control over the f-stop of the aperture
white balance here and the ISO is ISO
settings over here really really cool a
lot of customization as you might expect
from a device like this
do that even hopping into casual you get
some of the modes that we're familiar
with from like the galaxy s3 and the new
galaxy note once again optimized for
different scenes but there's the fun
stuff with group pose which we showed
you on the note 2 waiting for somebody
to make the right kind of face over a 5
photo burst shot as far as the hardware
goes it feels very very nice in the hand
it is obviously not a small unit once
again will bring up the pure view so you
can see compared to that it is a big
camera that you're going to carry around
when you're serious about taking shots
and you want and you wanted the Android
integration to help you share in a
social sense because once again you take
a photo it's just like taking a photo on
a phone except you're taking it with
superior optics and you can share that
photo immediately to Instagram Facebook
Twitter social networks and basically
anything you can do on a smartphone it's
just better
once again this has been michael fisher
with pocketnow.com with the Samsung
Galaxy camera here at Eva if we have
some time we're going to spend some more
time with this device because this is a
very very interesting thing we didn't
think we were going to be into but which
is a lot cooler and then we might have
expected so once again Michael Fisher
pocket now that's Tony behind the camera
stay tuned for more videos from Eva and
thanks for watching this one we'll see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
