calm and yesterday we went over the
unboxing video of the g1 and today we're
going to turn on and look at some of the
basic features as well show you how to
do some simple things that you're
probably going to want to do like turn
on the GPS and the Wi-Fi okay so let's
get started here it is the g1 nice and
shiny it's got a really responsive
screen and it does have three home
screens that you can slide through they
are entirely customizable and there's
actually tactile feedback so if you
press and hold on something the phone
actually vibrates a little bit and you
can move whatever it is that you're
trying to move you move it around or you
can actually drag it down to the trash
can on the bottom and throw it away the
trash can only shows up when you
actually have an item selected on the
screen so you can actually drag it there
and throw it away if you want to bring
something back you can press and hold on
the screen you add an application
shortcut widget or wallpaper so let's
just add the clock back and and is good
to go so on another screen i have google
search so what I've done is this is
basic stuff that i use on an every or
pretty much every time i open up the
phone i have some search related to our
cuts on the third screen and on the
second screen i have browser and email
and i guess over time I'll customize
that now up top if you drag that down as
the notifications pain and basically up
here it'll show you text messages emails
or any messages that you have that might
be waiting for you now some people might
notice that every so often there's a
little bit of a problem with
responsiveness of the screen what I
suggest is removing this small tiny
plastic cover that actually covers the
screen so you pull that off and we'll
have much more responsive screen so all
right let's take a look at what we have
under the menu here um actually gone
into the android marketplace and added a
lot of applications and one of the more
interesting apps is tunewiki and splash
play as well shopsavvy and we can show
you about those later so that's
basically where your menus your programs
are now two things that you're probably
going to want to do is turn on your
Wi-Fi and your GPS from the home screen
press menu settings and then under
wireless controls
select that and select the first option
Wi-Fi to turn that on and it will say
turning on and then you can adjust your
Wi-Fi settings if you have some other
networks to add and it should
automatically add network that scans and
it will find a bunch and set those in
there now we'll go back and go down to
security and location will select that
and use wireless networks to set
location and right now it's set to
location determined by Wi-Fi or other
mobile networks and we can turn on the
GPS by enable gps satellites that's
useful for a lot of the applications
that come in the android marketplace ok
one thing about most phones today is
like their calculator sucks and every
time you need a good calculator it just
sucks and that's what I initially
thought about the androids calculator I
open that up and I was like are you
kidding me is that it I press a little
menu button and you get a clear history
and an advanced panel and push the
advanced panel oh there's the stuff that
I like to use except the problem with it
is is that I thought that if you just
press you have to press menu to switch
back and forth between the two but when
it actually you can just flick between
them wait a few people that wanted to
see the dialer and had a question about
whether or not you have to open up the
cap the keyboard to actually dial phone
number well you actually don't you can
use the keyboard if you want or you can
just use the dialer that's on screen so
you can dial numbers unlike the shadow
it actually has the alphanumeric codes
on the keys so it's actually easier for
you to dial those 1 800 goog 411 numbers
and that's the dialer you can also pull
up a cow call log contacts and add
people as favorites can pull up call log
count X or add people as favorites to
make your dialing easier yes the browser
a lot of people are interested in the
browser it's really a decent browser
there's lots of reviews about the
browser on the web it's fairly quick one
thing that it lacks is the ability to
switch between pulling up the the mobile
view or the full desktop view of a
screen so if you go to Twitter it pulls
up the mobile view if you go to Facebook
it pulls
the full screen the full desktop screen
and if you go to all shadow com it pulls
up the full desktop screen so and
depending on what you like there is no
option that I could find a switch
between any of them but it is pretty
much a full-featured browser you can
actually go to new windows and open up
plenty of Windows for you to get things
done when you get your gphone be sure to
get a google account you might want to
actually go out and a sign up for a
google gmail account right now with the
name that you want before they're all
taken basically sign in and it works
pretty well with the google calendar and
gmail on the gphone everything goes in
there the way it's supposed to so that's
it for now and until next time I'm Mike
Benton for all shadow com
