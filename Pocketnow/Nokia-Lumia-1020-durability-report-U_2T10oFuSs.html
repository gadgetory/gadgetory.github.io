flagship I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and this is our durability report of the
Nokia Lumia 1020 the Nokia Lumia 1020
launched here in the US on ATT towards
the end of July and ever since I've been
carrying the 1020 as one of my personal
devices nearly every day like several of
my colleagues here at pocket now I'm
also not a fan of cases all my phones
they come at the expense of beauty
thinness and detract from how the
engineers and designers intended for the
phone to look and feel in the hand I've
treated the 1020 just as I treat any
other phone a review loaner or a phone
that I shall out my hard-earned cash for
generally this means I'm pretty gentle
and don't toss or drop phones on tables
instead I've gently placed phones on
surfaces as to not unnecessarily scratch
or scuffed them but I don't go out of my
way or do anything special to make sure
they don't get damaged the Lumia 1020
has been dropped in my pant pockets with
keys and I put it in a work bag with
other tablets phones cables and other
miscellaneous items that could very well
damage it almost every day so let's take
a look at how the Lumia 1020 has held up
for me in the last two months I want to
start by saying that I installed a
screen protector on my lumia 1020 a few
weeks back this is something I don't
normally do I've carried dozens of
phones for months on end without too
much trouble with scratches on the
display however the Lumia 1020 which
comes with the extremely durable Gorilla
Glass 3 scratched on day one in fact
between buying the phone at AT&amp;amp;T and
shooting the new Nexus 7 unboxing and my
office the glass on the front had half a
dozen micro scratches on it from that
point until I installed the screen
protector I didn't notice a single
additional scratch on the glass figure
that one out but the condition of the
screen particular before I took it off
today should be telling of our lack of
caution with this device as the
protector itself has taken quite the
beating in just a few weeks ironically
enough the glass wasn't what we were
most concerned with when buying this
phone we figured the giant abscess
around back would be an issue like most
middle phones before it we imagined it
would become scuffed and reveal
unpainted metallic silver beneath
especially since the back of the phone
rests on the corner of the camera hump
and doesn't even rest flat on any
surface but we're happy to report that
the camera hub is almost as good as new
there are small signs of wear wear the
very cool
the hump appears smoother than the rest
as if it's been polished but there are
no noticeable blemishes whatsoever and
the rest of the body is much of the same
story
it's practically blemish free there are
only four points that show any sign of
wear and tear and they're so small we
nearly overlooked them all when
searching for damage
three of the four points are tiny dings
all along corners likely from hitting a
tabletop too hard one is almost exactly
in the middle of the top edge on the
backside another is on the top-right
corner and is a very tiny indentation
and the final ding is on the bottom left
corner on the back side they're all so
small you have to be looking for them
and nearly have to squint to see them
the fourth blemish is where on the
bottom corner of the volume rocker where
the bare metal is beginning to show
again it's so small it's barely
discernible being a matte finish plastic
the tough plastic which has proven
itself durable and resilient time and
time again we'd never worried too much
about how this phone would stand the
test of time but we were surprised at
how easily the glass scratched like
Michael noted in his durability report
for the 9:20 these are likely scratches
on the oleophobic coating instead of the
actual glass either way we're pleasantly
surprised with the resilience of the
1020 and how well it's held up over the
last two months that's all we have time
