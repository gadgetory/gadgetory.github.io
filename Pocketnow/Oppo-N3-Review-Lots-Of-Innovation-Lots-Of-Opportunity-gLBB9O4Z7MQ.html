smartphones look and feel the same our
inner geek is always in need of
something new something we could
seriously call cool I was one of the few
companies that has realized this with
its offerings and today we get a chance
to review its most unique offering yet
I'm high memory but I would pocket now
here with our full review of the Oppo
and three I know I know we're very late
to this review folks but this is one of
those devices we were simply not going
to leave without a full pocket now
treatment the best way to describe the
oppo n3 in a word is calling it unique
at a time when smartphone designs are
just flat slabs with very predictable
specifications in characteristics the
oppo n3 is anything but conventional no
matter where I go people are always
asking me what is it and every time that
I show them what it can do I only get
more questions actually for starters
this is a very commanding device at 162
millimeters in height 77 millimeters in
width and eight point seven millimeters
in thickness
it's 192 grams and weight are clearly
noticeable whether you're trying to fit
it in your pocket or holding it for
everyday use still it's white
polycarbonate finish and aircraft
quality aluminum alloy frame give it a
very substantial and premium feel under
the hood we have a 2.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon 801 processor backed by an
Adreno 330 GPU 2 gigs of ram and 32 gigs
of storage with microSD expansion up to
128 gigs one of the coolest tricks of
this phone is that that microSD slot
also doubles as another SIM tray
if you'd rather carry one phone instead
of two another cool addition to this
phone is that even though it's 3000
milliamp hour battery is not removable
oboes vu grab a charger will get you
from 0 to 75% in a cool 30 minutes
something we've actually proven to be
reliable by the way
laying on top of all these internals is
a 5.5 inch 1080p IPS LCD with around 403
pixels per inch protected by Gorilla
Glass 3 the display is fully accessible
to the user thanks to the capacitive
hardware buttons at the bottom that
light up when in use the color
reproduction of this display is on par
with most IPS panels with bright colors
and great viewing angles but after using
the AMOLED panel of the Oppo r5 I must
say I would have preferred the hardware
selection to be AMOLED for its deep
contrast other nice tricks like the
touch base fingerprint scanner at the
back also makes some nice additions the
button doubles as a power button when
needed and it even serves as a slider
control for the rotating camera that
will talk about an event match this with
a skyline notification light at the
bottom and the very loud speaker placed
below and there's just no way to claim
that this is an average phone now a
device this cool require is a cool
software packages power it and that's
probably where we're mixed with the oppo
n3 device runs color OS 2.0 point 1 eye
on top of Android 4.4.4 kitkat where
you'll notice that the app tray
disappears in favor of endless home
screens for absent widgets the UI is
probably a little too skeuomorphic for a
device with such a futuristic appeal
externally but the bevy of software
options for theme enhancements
transition changes and dedicated home
screen options help compensate for that
OPO also includes a bevy of its own
applications for things like the
calendar sound recording and even
software backup which that proved to be
quite useful and not added bloat the
company's proprietary font and icon
packs give most of the user interface a
very elegant touch as well but I'm sure
most of you would have preferred this
device or a device with this design to
be running stock Android sadly our
biggest complaints with the software
have a lot to do with the user
experience take the camera for example
on the positive front the biggest
selling point for this device was its 16
megapixel smart motorized camera and
hardware wise it delivered for the most
part we have a Schneider Kreuznach lens
with F 2.2 aperture over the 16
megapixel sensor and Oppo even goes to
great lengths and bundling the O click
remote control to help you rotate the
camera take photos from a distance or
even track your device when needed this
is seriously the perfect selfie camera
if you think of it and it's also a cool
candid camera since you don't really
have to point the device to where you're
pointing the lens something that's
really cool you could even take
panoramas without moving your hands
since the motor does the work for you
sadly even though opera does bundle one
of the most complete lists of shooting
modes we've ever seen on a smartphone
the resulting photos are just ok I
noticed that normal mode did a better
job with color and contrast when
compared to HDR which would overexpose
shots every single time now my biggest
disappointment was using this as a
selfie camera since even though it does
use the same camera the software
switches everything to selfie mode and
strips all the back camera modes off of
it
you can't take selfies with HDR for
example the beautifying modes are
overbearing and the backdrops were
always overexposed so you can really see
them again all things that I feel could
be fixed with better software
my experience recording video in 1080p
was actually better than my experience
taking photos but I feel the software
should take more advantage of the smart
motorized lens since it doesn't seem to
rotate with the buttons or with the o
click and you just had to do it manually
other than that using this phone was
great for everything else phone calls
were good over the earpiece or speaker
and data speeds were also awesome even
when using this device with two SIM
cards since this device supports Wi-Fi
802 and Bluetooth 4.0 it also did a good
job of retaining connectivity as well
playing games with this device was also
great the processor handles graphics
well and the placement of the speaker
allows sound to not be muffled no matter
how you're holding it in my experience
gameplay didn't really affect the
battery life in my test nor in day to
day use but if your mileage does vary
there's always the boot rapid charger to
fix that overall I'm just as satisfied
as I am disappointed with the oppo n3 I
really want to love this phone because
when it comes to hardware it's
everything that I want I really wanted
to make this my daily driver we've got a
very elegant and innovative design match
with unique tricks that you simply won't
find in any other smartphone I just wish
that the software was on par with the
rest of the user experience this phone
is seriously one of the best ideas that
I've seen in years
and if Oppo would make its lollipop a
great deal with the opportunities that
aren't addressed with the software I
would highly recommend anybody to buy
this device
