i have three jellybean quick tips just
for you quick tip number one let's say
you have an app that you don't want
anymore you want to uninstall it how do
you do that in the past there have been
two different methods you can open up
the Play Store find the app that you
downloaded wait for it to load and
uninstall it there the other option is
to hunt it down in settings and go into
manage apps and remove it that way not
very easy here's the super easy and fast
way that the stock version of jelly bean
lets you do open up your app drawer find
the app let's say that's flixster that i
want to remove tap and hold and up here
you can uninstall just like that the app
is gone quick tips number two and three
are very closely related but you get to
them in different ways let's say I want
to find out some information about
beautiful widgets tap and hold drag up
here and I can go to app info that very
quickly and easily opens up this
applications info where I can force stop
uninstall clear data clear cache get a
whole bunch of information about this
app right there without having to open
up settings and navigate to it and
manually find it really fast and easy
way to get to that information quick tip
number three up here in your status bar
you know you've got all of these
notifications sometimes they pop up and
you don't know what app is sending them
now this was particularly interesting
with airplay and you know where you get
ads up in here and you wouldn't know
what app you installed that was putting
ads up here in your notification bar
that may be less of an issue these days
but if you want to find out where that
alert is coming from not a problem tap
and hold choose app info and there you
go that's the app that launched that
alert you can even now quick tip bonus
number four tell it not to show
notifications right there of course I
want Google search to show me
notifications up there but if you don't
want those notifications to show up
uncheck that box they won't show up
again until you check that box so there
you go three quick tips and a bonus from
pocketnow.com did you like this if so

quick tips you'd like to share with the
