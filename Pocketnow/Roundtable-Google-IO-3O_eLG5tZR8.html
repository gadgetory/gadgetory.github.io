live we're live all right sorry
everybody for the failed attempts Google
live hangouts have not been nice to us
lately and that's our thang lately so
we're not getting along too well but
anyway this is a special edition of
pocket now live it's a roundtable
discussion we've got Anton here and hi
Mei and Michael and Taylor a lot has
happened today at Google i/o 2013 a lot
of announcements we're a little
disappointed but there's a lot of cool
stuff to talk about and so we're just
going to kind of chill and hang out for
the next 45 minutes or so and talk about
what happened today real quick let's
talk about what didn't happen today no
new version of Android no 4.3 no
five-point oh no key lime pie which
actually kind of gives me some
confidence that the next version of
android is going to be 5 point 0 is
going to be substantial and big and
worthy of its own event you know compare
what a lot of thought to talk about and
they could have overshadowed five point
0 if it were already um you know with
with announcements of key lime hi that
was a confusing statement not nice to us
alone whoa somebody from us is watching
us live one viewer yes it's so so so no
sono key lime pie no new version of
Android
very good we have no new hardware Tony's
going to bitch about that in a second
but we actually have something that is
new and it's kind of weird Google is
doing a galaxy s4 on july 26th that
comes with stock android for certain way
fine well sort of finally at six it's
650 bucks it's unlocked it gets t-mobile
and AT&amp;amp;T LTE but like anyone that has a
galaxy s4 that got it on contract can
just go to a development site route
their phone and do the exact same thing
what do you what is your guys take on
this unlocked galaxy s4 what's not not
necessarily I mean if the bootloaders
lock you're not going to be able to do
that just very easily yeah it wasn't way
around it there is but the problem is
have you ever had a phone with a
bootloader that's been locked like a
droid x or the the Thunderbolt all these
devices I've had so many of them and
when you have a locked bootloader it
just ruins it if you want development at
all um there are ways around it but
everything you have to do takes two
three four or five extra steps and and
if you screw up if you if you flash
something and it just doesn't work just
right you might have to start all over
from scratch or it might throw a boot
loop and it's just so so so let's let
this in worst case it takes you three
hours of your life to save like 450
bucks why don't you why don't you do it
well it's not really that you're saving
450 bucks you can't get a galaxy s4
without a contract currently unless you
go for an unlocked version and you still
have to pay like seven hundred dollars
for an unlocked galaxy s4 so in my in my
case you get the choice of 650 bucks for
stock Android or seven hundred dollars
for an unlock galaxy s4 on a carrier
anyways so I would prefer honestly I
love the fact that you get the choice i
think that the price point is was
extremely steep i do not agree on the
price but i do love the fact that you
get the option now I've always been
forward for a signature Google mentality
like signature windows where you can buy
a specific laptop and ask for stock
windows on the no bloatware so I love
the option even though I do consider the
price point to be too steep I would love
for that phone to be 650 bucks and then
get the option to get touch was in the
you as a software update or something
but that's just me it should be an
option on every device I've said this
since yeah that I was I don't know since
my first android phone since you could
disable TouchWiz and since I don't know
if you could disable touch with but you
could definitely disabled since it was
nothing more than a launcher but it's
something I've said since the beginning
that on your first boot like if you just
if you use the phone for six months and
then you decide hey I want to you know
reset my device you can choose between
loading stock Android or TouchWiz there
it's just like a technology technology
is absolutely there to do that but
Samsung doesn't really want you to use
stock Android unless you're a special
kind of user they want to show you s
voice and s this and s that and it's
it's part of their it's part of their
business right and that's the question
right because when you're buying the
galaxy s4 as it currently stands the
current additionally galaxy s4 you're
not really getting an android phone
we've said this before to you're getting
a samsung phone you're getting the
experiences that they want you to have
on it it is going to be a completely
different experience with the galaxy s4
what are they calling it the galaxy s4
Google edition I mean they're not
calling it a nexus whatever they're
calling it he has the google edition it
is right so you know it's going to be an
entirely different different different
thing and i was very excited to see it
revealed and i'm still quite excited i
would like to i would really like to get
my hands on one but i'm not entirely
sure that yeah i'll be relieved to be
rid of some of those qmix i don't care
about but I'm not entirely certain that
I will miss I will not miss elements of
TouchWiz like some of that stuff is
useful what some well let's talk about
what you get if you get stock Android
it's going to be faster and it's going
to be better with battery life well
Michael what things would you miss from
TouchWiz if you got this version of the
galaxy s4 I like those i mean i like the
notification toggle implementation in
touch wiz better I like I like TouchWiz
his approach to you know some of the
some of the home screen design is you
know I don't think I liked it I liked
lock screens that Sampson brings its
little UI stuff that I feel like Samsung
has actually succeeded in improving on
the stock Android experience android is
bad but it sure so ons Tony question a
Tony and no new hardware no new next 27
no new Nexus phone what what
it's coming on bro I am extremely
disappointed and its head I'm usually
the black sheep you see this tablet here
this tablet was introduced one year ago
at the google i/o and usually new
hardware comes you platforms new
versions of Android so it was just
logical that this year in May or
beginning of June but it happened today
who would unveil a new version of angry
but if it was 4.3 or five point oh it
should have landed together with a nexus
7 refresh a nexus phone refresh is only
used somewhere in september-october or
november so from this perspective I I
have a couple of questions regarding
today's event is it not ready are there
prepared are they preparing something
huge to arrive later or what's this no
Android no device only talking Google+
and match thing well they're all very
substantial updates via the maps and
then the music service and those are
just applications and service updates
there's no platform update as they
usually unveil one every year like iOS
has a refresh every year android up
until this year had a refresh major or
minor every year windows phone has won
every year and now Google will have one
every 16 months I know that's discussed
right to tell you and welcome well you
know it's it's not necessarily true
because Google has actually always stuck
to kind of a later in the year like a
sep tember fall OS update last year was
an anomaly and android 4.2 is what we
got remember there was there was no
event because of because the you know it
was closed due to the hurricane yeah we
are you know but but other than you know
we actually got the present bites and
everything I couldn't go because of the
problem from last summer we got android
for that one but the less the winter
before that we got a droid for that oh I
got ice cream sandwich so they were
pushing it along faster yeah the winter
before you're right that's right it was
with the Galaxy Nexus during the winter
that's right yum companies do this right
they stagger the change change up their
schedules and that's fine and you know
it keeps us on our toes and that's nice
but a lot of pee
one person on twitter has been saying
that they're okay without the point
increase in android at this year's i/o
because it allowed Tony those features
you were talking about two to two mature
like we see enhancements in google voice
search we see the google music and we're
probably gonna talk about in a second we
see all these things that are that are
now catching up to where maybe they
should have been before and that's good
so now android has a stronger platform
with from which to jump to 4.3 and and
beyond yeah here's a quick conspiracy
theory do you guys think that Google
might be holding on to seeing what Apple
might prepare for WWDC I had that's
that's what i was thinking i believe
there even if they're not doing that is
on purpose i mean it's it's it just so
happens that that's going to work there
to their advantage i think they want to
remove the spotlight from iOS 7 if it
gets announced at WWDC i mean right now
the thing is their own events and
obviously Google i/o you know let's be
honest Google i/o is a developer
conference it is you know if we think
about it back when was it for the iphone
for that one was the iphone 4s launch in
2011 october yes okay it but yeah but
that WWDC steep was the last event that
Steve Jobs was still alive and he was
like we're gonna keep this a software
event and they prevent everything um
which was iOS 5 and everything but they
did not bring new hardware so I believe
that Google will take the approach of
waiting to see what Apple has obviously
they have a new boss in town two new
bosses for software in iOS 7 so go ahead
iOS 7 is is such a big opportunity for
Apple and it's kind of a do-or-die kind
of thing and and people still have
confidence in apple and they want to see
what's going to happen and it's very
much to Google's advantage to wait and
see what iOS 7 brings I want to jump
around to a couple of other or some of
the next things on the list google music
is now really really really competing
with Spotify and Pandora and Pandora
audio and arguing music it's it's really
doing everything you
the same price point of Spotify 999
although if you sign up now you get a
cheaper price at eight bucks a month
it's got a web browser component it's
got a mobile component which you can get
right now and it's got offline playlists
it's got what I think is a much nicer
interface I I am kind of obsessed with
music I listen to it all the time and so
music is very important to me and I can
already start to see some ways that
google music all access is better than
Spotify most notably in Spotify if
you've got your like 20 artists that you
like and you've got the 10 albums that
you're listening to at the time you're
the only way to kind of keep that store
is to add them as playlist so what you
get is and Spotify are these huge list
of playlists which you can group into
folders which is fine but it's not
really organized ok Google music all
access allows you to add an artist and
album or a song as if you owned it to
your library so then your library view
is nicely segregated between artists
album songs hi and playlists yeah take
that one of my biggest problems with
Spotify is that there's no way to just
listen to one artist unless you listen
to like their radio station which rex is
my world yeah I'm locked on like 10 or
if you um create a playlist of just that
artist from mobile it's just not
possible you can only do it from the
desktop I know that's just yeah Mike
Michael I don't think that's coming
through i should tell us what you're
showing I'm overexposed no is it how's
that I'm Laura and if I got a tough time
guys there's just way too much white so
that the interfaces is like this
sherbert and and white and it just blows
out this crappy webcam but yeah i mean i
agree brandon that's something i didn't
really notice in our quick look at the
interface yeah it really is nice I mean
I'm sorry it's going to overexpose here
but it just organizes all the all the
artists into their own kind of it's like
this duel column scrollable view and it
is like your the collection that you own
rather than than than like the spa
defies endless playlist I mean that is
one improvement in you I it's actually
quite nice it is quite nice it has the
card you I from from the google play
store it's clean when you listen to
music
through google music it starts to learn
what you like and the cool thing is that
you start seeing it show up in other
Google products like Google now now has
the ability to show you my understanding
is new music releases that you might
like and it just links right to the
Google so everything's really integrated
yeah really nicely and and as mentioned
one of my biggest worries was that you
couldn't you couldn't save offline
playlists because you know streaming
that stuff just kills your data connect
kills your battery but you can you can
download offline playlist I don't know
what the limit is Spotify it's like
3,000 tracks yeah which is planning for
anyone um yeah all night 200,000 well
here's the deal the problem is that this
is pretty much a you as exclusive and it
will be for a long time because at the
moment i live in on ludus and i cannot
buy a song even without the google
all-access music yes Tony you're there
you're having the same issue my big
advantage what Spotify is that all i
have to do is get a fake VPN i could
actually get a trial for 4 30 minutes
that they could give you for free and i
could activate a spotify account and
loaded with my honduran credit card and
keep it that way permanently and that's
the way i have spotify right and the
problem with Google products it's not
really a problem I just why is Google
what is a problem why does google have
to be so good about their drm protection
because they did say wait a second they
lock everything to the sim card meaning
if I want to get google music I have to
use an AT&amp;amp;T sim cards obviously it
renders my phone useless so sadly it's
not a perfect service it's not it's not
only tied to your SIM card because right
now I was in London I just landed a
couple of hours ago and I had my
Romanian sim card within my gs4 and the
google play store in in the UK finally
showed me books and movies and
everything and once i landed back in
hungary and then here in Romania all
that disappeared so I think it's a
combination of your SIM card as well as
Wi-Fi ideas that maybe your GPS location
and that that just the combination sucks
for Google's music offering because it
is
limited to a market which is huge but
still spotify is available in many many
many more countries right buddy has the
advanced also available on
cross-platform right I OS Windows Phone
Google you know for people like us who
switch platforms a lot and I think
that's a category that might actually be
growing in the future here as people
start to establish preferences for what
they like on a tablet what they like on
a device but they like on a desktop you
know cross-platform compatibility is
gonna be important and I don't think
there's any plans for an iOS or other
platform ATS right I don't know last
year Google i/o last year said that they
were going to release a Google Music app
for iOS and that never happened yeah you
imagine that was probably not goals
policies yeah they'll probably ask
policies and then now something like
this probably not i'm not gonna allow it
because apple apple has to do an itune
subscription service now they're exactly
my point if that's the case then we'll
definitely see something coming out of
Apple and the vein of Google Music
Alexis Wow so I want to I want to finish
up here with Google Music guys I
remember a time just a little tangent
here about the in the 90s when there was
Napster right and we all did it we
downloaded music it was the most amazing
we were young and stupid right and and
then and then iTunes came along right
and and you could you could rip your cds
you could download music for a
relatively expensive fee and then the
subscription services started to come
along and then these cross-platform
music subscriptions came along and they
were cheap ten dollars less than a cost
of one CD you can have all you can eat
music you can even download it to your
device and now we're seeing one of the
biggest technology companies get in on
this its just oh this is an awesome time
for music lovers yeah it is yeah um so
anyway with that heart throbbing comment
some updates to Google now finally
reaching a little bit of parity with
with Siri in terms of some of the on
device things that it does for example
now you can say you know remind me to
get milk at 3pm and it will send you a
notification you can say remind me to
take out the trash when I get home it
will set up a geofence and you
a notification um and a lot of other
enhancements to Google now I do you guys
do you guys use the one out pretty often
I really every day every day do you guys
do you guys just work with Barcelona
that's what I use it for teach exports
course I use it yeah uh I use it to
track packages and find local events
because i'm a homebody and I stay at
home a lot and that tells me what's
going on around me and I I've gone to
several shows concerts and all kinds of
other things events just based on google
now and I use it for okay I admit I'm
the only one who doesn't find it helpful
at all and I have probably used it like
two or three minutes aggregated in my
entire life I think it's the smartest
invention to come to smartphones that's
what a blessing it doesn't help me it
doesn't help me be more productive that
video Tony you spend a large amount of
your time not using Android devices I
mean you use an iPhone a lot of the time
I know use the one more recently but you
haven't been for a while so I think
Google now is specifically tailored at
people who usually don't get me wrong I
don't even use Siri I mean aside from
dictation which is part of Siri but it's
not part of Google now I can't find it
helpful I mean I don't fly that often
whenever I do searches I i can easily
type those two three keywords in Google
and that's just about it I don't need
whether I get windows so you guys want
to you guys want a fun fact I was
emailing Michael about this earlier so
so so Google's releasing some
enhancements to the web browser so that
all you have to do is say the word the
words ok Google and it starts listening
for what you're going to say that
functionality already exists if you go
into the Google now or the Google Search
app on your phone I'm just like Google
you snow you say ok Google right ok just
Google that's okay we don't have
happened oh ok you just say Google uh so
Google which is which is really cool if
you're like you know in the car at a
stoplight never use your phone in the
car Google yeah tada all right there's
no magic tricks yes that didn't exist in
the browser before now it's kanika now
and that's the big update as it works
the big up
right yeah that's the only like
worthwhile thing about this because I
was saying this in our stream like yeah
that's cool I can tap the Google search
bar go into google search and then say
google and it'll start listening awesome
well right from my home screen i can tap
that little microphone and skip a step
and you know it'll start listening
without me having to say anything in the
first place so until we have an
intelligence always on listening service
built into a smartphone you don't have
to like jump into s voice you don't have
to jump into the Google search bar I
think it's gonna be less more of it more
of a gimmick than anything else but in
the browser it's awesome and on the desk
yeah like if your if your phone had
really good ears and your phone is
across the room and you're getting
dressed and you were like good Google
what's the weather gonna be today it
just starts talking to you that would be
amazing and tell me how much you how
much better would you give up for that I
don't none that's why I said when you
know technology gets to a point where I
would give up as much battery for that
as I would for Bluetooth now like I
would I would give up a five percent an
hour out of Jack to have my phone always
listening for to hear same good then
that exists in Windows Mobile a long
time ago you could set up voice command
to be permanently on I think you're
right on that actually you could set up
voice command that it was permanently on
I thought I'll a new that stuff like
yeah yeah you can do that with um like a
TouchWiz device though if it's off can't
you say hi galaxy no yeah well yeah yeah
you could set up the wake up to voice
command yep there right it does do to
turn it I mean it's not on all the time
when the device is on but it's on what
the device is this stand by but it works
uh poorly it doesn't work well like yeah
yeah like yeah what's the story of
Galaxy devices yet know it's there
doesn't work too well but if they're
kind of kind of like the air gesture
like the quick peek or whatever it's
called yeah and that is so mad like my
friend we were sitting at a table
together and he reaches over to grab
something in my phone turns on and he
reaches back and it turns back on I'm
like you turned my phone on man like
stop and he's like move your phone I'm
deciding like this is uh I don't know I
think that this google i/o event was a
syndicate i would say as software event
as it was the browser enhancements are
cool
without any hardware man I'm extremely
disappointed I couldn't be more
disappointed I'm actually I'm not
disappointed I'm disappointed there's no
Nexus 7 with a 1080p display it's going
to be better than about it comes out
it's gonna be yeah 1920 x 1200 and
that's coming soon so so let's let's
jump to the next thing the thing called
hangouts not babble which was rumored to
be Taylor and Jaime hot really enthused
about this Taylor what the heck is it
and I'm a what do you think about it
it's actually not exactly what we
thought it was gonna be so it's not a
unified total unified google chat
service so not yet not yet so I still
get my google voice text messages you
know on my computer on my phones on my
tablets and they don't show up and hang
out or hangouts so there's that but
google talk now is hangouts so if you
send a google talk to someone in the
browser it's going to pop up in the
hangouts app on your mobile device and
this right here what we're in now this
hangout is a chat so once we in this
video call we can chat using the same
hang out right now and that's what you
sow I like the guys cross platform and
yes honestly I love the enhancement I
mean yes you do have whatsapp which is
cross-platform yes there are other so
was like like Facebook messaging but i
love i love the fact that we could have
a group chat for example and we could
activate an immediate hang out and not
have to pay a penny like we do on skype
yeah because if we want a group call on
skype a group video call we need to pay
for it that's the problem with skype and
I guess this is a big stabbed from
google towards the Microsoft where
you're not gonna have to pay for the
feature on your phone using the service
Oh everything sounds awesome and I'm
into this but I have two things first I
wish Google will fix hangouts like
yesterday and second I wish I pray for
more than vga resolution oh yeah well I
TP authority peanuts we're talking about
different hangout so you're talking
about video hangout specifically we're
talking about that the the umbrella
hangout service yeah which is I'm cold
and this port oh yeah well I mean I
agree it's it's bad and um but somebody
is jay gallon 14
twitter said it would have been better
if it had it would replace the stock SMS
service so integrate SMS I guess yeah
I'm and chat heads that would have been
it would have been perfect perfect
agreed agreed well it's tough it's
little work in progress this is not a
Babel Bob ale or whatever the code name
was and if it is i guess it's again it's
a work in progress all right so let's
move on from there we've got a lot of
live viewers and thanks everyone for for
joining us we're just hanging out
talking about what happened at Google
i/o no no new version of Android but we
think that's coming later but a lot of
updates to a lot of their products
google maps on android is getting an
update really to look like the iOS app
but but there's been this new renewed
focus on making Google Maps about a
discovery tool and you can kind of get a
flavor for that if you go into the
browser right now I checked a few
minutes ago wasn't there for me but the
guy on stage said it's there now anyone
anyone check out the new google maps on
browser yep no you have to go to a
certain link that will let you sign up
for a preview so you have to be invited
to a preview which I signed up for
before the keynote was over but I
haven't gotten anything so so I guess
this is pretty much like a new type of
yelp well we're at Foursquare or four
square it's like all this stuff well
into my I guess they're trying to make
people like Google+ as much as they can
they're adding and adding more features
to google plus just to make it
compelling I guess it's a plus features
as a maps feature well if you want if
you want to make it work like Foursquare
you need to be in Google+ that's the
right yeah they're aggressively pushing
plus here exactly thank you speaking of
google plus they announce some pretty
bad ass photo editing automation
goodness awesome the name is so bad who
watch TV who wants to explain what this
is and and and stuff ok so easy ok go on
theater well I was going to say
basically you upload pictures and it
automatically makes them better upload
pictures taller auto beautification it's
gotta be Google+ so it's not Facebook or
Twitter Instagram or drop
sir box net it's google plus you get it
right you've got easier with us yeah so
you can upload your pictures in forests
you have 15 gigabytes for that or you
can upload to Google Plus with like a
standard size which is like a maximum of
two thousand pixels wide but what it
does is when you upload them they little
basically auto enhance them if you've
overexposed or underexposed basically it
applies like an HDR filter and kind of
balances everything out but it's using a
lot of intelligence it's more than just
the auto enhance in iOS was the best
face it implies a skin softening yeah
you can beautify yourself I really
brought probably one of the coolest
things that I saw at that keynote and I
think it's the guy said it perfectly
he's like I just came back from my
vacation and I took all these photos and
I want to organize them but the problem
is I'm no longer on vacation and it's
true I go out with my DSLR and I take a
million pics and then I never organized
them I take seven photos of the same dog
or whatever yeah and so it's it's really
cool that the service will intelligently
pick out the best photos and you'll keep
everything but your album will be
compiled you know specifically with the
top photos that Google determines that
you would think we're the best and then
the others will still be there and so
you know go ahead so it's looking
through what you're describing is you're
looking through like six hundred photos
and it's trying to pick out the best one
so it removes duplicates it removes ones
that are blurring it removed and one of
the coolest things and I don't know what
the heck this is what's happening in the
back end here but they can identify
pictures that people like us just think
look good like oh this is a nice pic
like they've been able to I always
quantify or machine fi the idea of
beauty in a picture and not only that
let's say it takes let's say you take
three different photos of the same place
or the same shot and one of them not
everybody's smiling and then the other
one other people are smiling they're
taking a Schelotto approach to stitching
the photo together in order to make
everybody smile on the photo if possible
that's another thing they'll be able to
do I am also they also make gifts so if
you upload like a motion like a burst
shot so if I'm doing this in a picture
it'll create a gif of me waving
basically
it automatically by a cat that'd be
great Tony what were you gonna say I am
NOT a professional photographer but I am
a photo aficionado and the the photos
which i upload usually define my style
my views my subjects my lighting what
I'm trying to emphasize here is that
once I upload a picture to this new
google plus service those are no longer
my pictures that's no longer my face no
longer my skin no longer my lighting so
I i will probably not take advantage of
the service because i really want to be
in control of what I show off from my
experiences from my day-to-day life and
shooting experiences to the people who
follow me and I'm with your 808 PureView
with my 808 PureView yeah I think you're
a little bit more advanced Tony than the
average person who just wants to take
some pics and and make it look good but
but I still don't understand it like on
the iphone I take pictures it goes to
iCloud it's on my iPad on the on an
android phone I take pictures it goes to
dropbox it's on stole my ipad and
everything if i want to do this service
thing and i wanted to like go through my
pictures and make make me look a lot
better than I do I gotta gotta hook my
google account to my google pleasant and
then turn on like auto uploads at
outwards yeah yeah you know to be honest
with you with all the enhancements that
are coming to google plus i would say
that i would rather use Google+ than
Dropbox um because first of all I get 15
gigabytes as a repository or unlimited
if I choose for them to specify their
own break and other than that you know I
can keep everything that I one google
plus I get an automatic backup and it's
better presented on google plus I could
share it immediately if I want and if
not that I could just use Instagram as I
usually do no I I have two or three like
redundant backups for pictures so yeah
there is like i'm looking at my google+
app right now on the HTC One and it's
the updated one and it is gorgeous it's
a beautifully built I was about to say
they finally figured out that this
really have made it very very pretty
yeah but you know when Google+ started
all of my normal friends my friends
outside of tech circles
uh were actually you know kind of
Luddites they all still join google+
because google made such a stink about
it everyone's like our Facebook killer
I'll do in it um so let me tell you what
my Google+ feed is now despite the fact
that all my normal friends have joined
it and are on it my entire Google+ feed
is nerds talking about Google i/o and
not regular people talking about Google
i/o this is just like out professional
press outlets people like you like
pocket now people like us and that's it
I mean like plus is not being embraced
by the by the comedy fest but unless is
the facebook for geeks it means really
it's and I think I think most of our
most of our viewers right now use
google+ it's the tech savvy people that
care a lot about technology and like
Google products but it's just such a
barrier I mean all of my stuff and all
my friends are the non-technical friends
are on Facebook my mother is on faith
and I don't wanna I up you know I
committed to facebook I committed to
Twitter I couldn't do Instagram I
couldn't get into it I this this google+
thing keeps me up at night because I
want to be in on it but I just can't me
too I'm loving it okay so like so the
only one on I kind of honey breathe the
only reason why i don't use google
classes because the UI on the phone was
terrible it was just for one it was just
so big it do is just so bloated you can
really enjoy ever anything and i guess
with you what the software update that
just came i think it does look a lot
better result the desktop is what looked
bad for so long the the mobile platforms
have looked great for about six months
well admire them the third of the longer
yeah I like it but um I started using it
probably three months ago I just fool on
just just dedicated myself to Google+
and I'm loving it um you're saying that
yeah I've I'm actually getting followers
on Google+ a lot faster than on any
other network ever probably about double
the rate of Twitter that's just
incredible to content it's really high
quality stuff all the time don't hate me
because I'm gonna say this but somebody
has to say to us do you guys realize and
see what we're doing now we are on a
Google i/o round table and we are
talking about in softening we are
talking about Google Maps we're talking
about Google+
I mean come on that's what i was talking
about android nexus what happens we are
working on things which are either x or
adjacent services but Tony you can't
consider like that Hardware in a vacuum
you can't say that I want to only hear
about nexus devices and I don't want to
hear about anything that Android can do
because it really the utility of this
depends on what matters yeah if the
google maps announcement or the Google+
announcement or anything else goes out
just as a PR without the google i/o and
the keynote nobody gives a damn but it's
too easy to forget that Google is a
software company they only recently got
into the hardware last year they get out
of an x SQ yeah and they got out and
then now you have glass but those are
really only two pieces of hardware that
Google's ever really made and the mace
author of Google is Android maybe out as
far as we are concerned yeah but for us
yeah I think they're blurring the line
between Android and their desktop arm
and that's why we get like all this kind
of stuff from there they're telling us
the Google story they're not telling us
the Nexus story of the Android through
the problems yes I still agree with the
conspiracies here at Theory where
they're waiting for iOS 7 and they're
gonna have their standalone event to
launch the next version of android and
their products if they're sure that what
they're gonna offer is going to be good
enough compared to whatever apple
launches it on jun 10 I think honestly
think I think Google is to the point
where Apple is where where Apple was
about two or three years ago where they
don't really care what the competition
is doing anymore because they've
progressed and and they're they're
moving so fast and I gotta say it's
kinda silly for us to think that Google
would watch the WWDC keynote in June and
in just like three or four months or
less change their entire trajectory for
Android to get everyone involved in
their room and say guys were they did on
this we're gonna go and do this I mean
there's not enough time to do that but
but just think about it I mean when was
the last time that Apple had such a
shake of such a corporate shake up where
we're actually going to expect
differences to come in the next version
of iOS this the first time ever I mean
expecting it and it's just not happened
it's just not happen because the same
heads were there so I do believe
even that it's a smart move for Google
to wait that's just me I I wanted key
lime pie don't get me wrong I wanted 4.3
yes of course I did of course I wanted a
newer version of the nexus 7 but i do
want them to be better than whatever
Apple does in June so in my two cents
are I don't mind them waiting another
month to see what they're going to bring
out and i agree with you time it and i
don't want to be overly harsh or overly
critical Isetta less you guys do or not
going to be as forgiving with Google as
you guys are no I want what Google does
and what they do best and I want it now
what is the time for it see I think what
it's not is literally difference is
fundamental I think Tony I think we
think we just spent four hours getting
shown that and you don't think so like I
that's what I think but but they said we
want to we want to keep a eye nothing
that interests me google said several
years ago I think it was Andy Rubin who
said we want to keep a one-year product
cycle and last year was an anomaly it
last year in the middle of the year was
not when Google really initially started
launching new Android versions that's
not one that days came out they came out
in the fall so because the nexus s was
launched that at i/o that previous year
yeah so it has been go ahead I don't
mean er I want to move on because I know
we have a hard stop in just about 10
minutes our view count continues to go
up again thanks guys for joining us I
know this is a closed hang out right now
but on Friday at 2pm come and hang out
with us at the real pocket now live yeah
Tony will be dancing Michael would be
singing taylor okay
Oh Microsoft tada sound no it's not
that's not it and noticeable notice my
face that's a little throaty so the last
thing I can think of that happened that
relates to these smallish announcement
is is google play games is anyone
excited about this well because it's
cross-platform I do you can make it up
cricket's it's cross-platform no its
cross-platform gaming which means what
it means that you can play a game say
angry birds and get to level 70 or
whatever level on your android tablet or
your android phone you pick up at the
other device and you could start 71 so
you finish that which is an iOS iOS uses
a u.s. uses game saying center that's
something that I really want to see work
before I consider it a success on so
have it so how is that so so we'll angry
birds on iOS work with both game center
and play games not i don't know i don't
think so i don't think so either and
that's the real tragedy because i've
been i've just i've said this what it
says several times like I always get up
to like to third through Angry Birds
three stars on all the levels and then I
change phones and it's like yeah but I
don't know how that'll work but that's
what they were saying is that it's cross
platform and that you pick up you know
Angry Birds on iOS and it picks up where
you left off on Android I don't know how
that works they would have to read from
some game center API or something but um
the thing i'm warden like most excited
about is the smallest thing is the cloud
the cloud messaging I guess it is google
cloud messaging that syncs your
notifications across all your android
devices yeah so i just miss a
notification on my HTC One and it's gone
on my Nexus 7 mi Nexus 10 and what is
that bit is that is that an Android what
what allows that to happen to the nap
google cloud messaging that's like
that's a service from google that's for
developers and they can enable this
really small line of code to sync across
multiple devices so for example if you
got a if you had swype on your tab not
swipes skype on your tablet and you had
skype on your phone and you got a miss
call from Michael Fisher and you swept
it away on your phone you go to
tablet and it's not there right as long
as you pull out the nexus 7 from the
drawer yes as long as you use an iPad so
i don't know i think that eighty percent
of the public uses an iPad and an
android phone I think that's just the
way the public is you see it all the
time here at least here so that is a
very cool feature I just don't see a lot
of benefited in the usual the
demographic ya know it in the
demographic as it stands but I think
they're they're projecting toward the
future and they're saying we want a
world where people have android phone
android tablet chrome on the desktop
birds now one thing that i did--like is
i don't know if you guys notice whenever
they came up with all the with all this
code on the screen and the guy was
showing you know this virtual way for
developers to see how the application
will will scale from a phone to a 10
inch tablet to assess tablet but i found
that to be awesome I mean yeah you know
everybody was like cheering everybody
was going like crazy like Google finally
you guys complain that we don't build
any anytime any applications for tablets
and now you're finally giving us the
tools and that's math nerds yes that
conference was or two thirds that
keynote was Google saying please tablet
apps make them now please please PLEASE
tablet apps and I do believe that the
tools are gonna be there now so that's
something else we didn't talk about it's
very technical but Android change to
their development tool set to something
that is much better I just want to
happen it's one app before I think was a
series of tools right oh I think wasn't
it there's an IDE which is that we just
gotta induce is something develop me
tomorrow I was a high I don't know
interstellar development interstitial
development whatever uh interface
development I can't remember what it
means point is goo is really trying too
hard to push tab of apps in fact the new
version of google play which i still
haven't gotten slightly new has a better
section 44 tablet apps so that you can
say oh what looks awesome I've been
wonderful if it once before I made that
video yes search for days
Taylor what's up all night trying to
find beautiful android apps and then the
next day google made it like one click
kind of easy it's google is you know how
it goes so so guys we want to wrap up
here a lot of cool stuff happened some
stuff to be excited about with updates
to Google now I mean this is obviously
all for android users and maybe a little
bit for iOS users if you're using uh you
know uh you know games and stuff and
hangouts on iOS now right I mean yeah
I'm gonna ask you a small question you
know part of the conspiracy theory you
know the hottest two phones that are
going to push Android this year are out
right now which is the HTC one in the
galaxy s4 do you guys wonder if if
Google held that held back there next
version of android to allow these phones
to mature a little bit because we do
know and we always complain about the
fact that you know you know we get the
newer version of Android and then our
phones are pretty much already you know
obsolete so could it be that the OEMs
talk to Google they were like come on
man just give us the new version of
Android before you announce it let us
play with it first we're going to port
it on time for everybody launch it with
the hottest phones and your new version
of and it's a it's a win-win-win for for
Google to to delay the next version of
android to get more time to develop but
they get to see iOS 7 they they allow
the HTC one in the galaxy s4 to mature
and seem a little bit old and they get
more time to work on hardware that's
going to crush the galaxy s4 and the HTC
One and maybe the motorola x phone is
going to be the key liya hai come on
forget about the motor relax phone that
thing does not exist there are pictures
and FCC filings yeah yeah and it looks
like and it looks like the HTC first
that's just about to be recalled you
know on AT&amp;amp;T seriously you know
everybody everybody's been asking me on
parking out daily in the comments water
what do you head of what have you
learned about the motor electron like
nothing nobody's seen that that you know
you've got one photo but there's no
confirmation that phone actually exists
it's tougher the FCC filing and and and
only no time
just about ideas about every other
motorola planning the razor that phone
is going to be another piece to the s
that's what it's gonna be I point in in
Google holding off I don't think they
really net technically held off mainly
because I think they just wanted to
release the next version of android with
a foam because they released jelly bean
with a tablet and tablets for Android
still aren't really a major driving
force and they've never really launched
a phone in the middle of the year except
for the Nexus S which was also a weird
anomaly um and I guess they I don't
remember when the nexus one was
announced I think was announced in the
fall like our winner out on it was
winter but I think it launched and like
februari but anyway that doesn't matter
um I think they're just they're not
holding off necessarily they just want
to release the next version of android
with a phone because that's that's their
main that's this or bed and butter bang
ya with an HTC One you know it's funny
Oh a lot I was like oh yeah I have you
know these new cool phones the HTC one
in the galaxy s4 but then he only
launches the Android version the Google
version of the galaxy s4 no HTC One
Google version yeah that was an
interesting move i was i was curious
about that and I wondered if I watched
the kind of Twitter rumors fly around
and they were like yeah you know some
some HTC employee was like oh we're
thinking about that and then it seems
someone really high up an HTC I forgot
it was like no we're not shut up all
right guys I'm pulling the plug here I'm
pulling the plug on this hangout thank
you everyone for joining us we have got
a little PSA the podcast tomorrow and
the day after that we've got pocket now
live where you guys can come and hang
out with us and ask ask us your
questions and we can talk with you but
until then leave us a comment on this
video or on the post on pocket now and
let us know what you liked about Google
i/o and what you're excited about but
for now we're we're going to hit the end
of broadcast button and call it a day
happy I o day everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
