to do recovery based things like
flashing and backing up with a recovery
image called clockworkmod recovery
there's a new player on the block it's
actually been around for a while we just
haven't shown it to you yet called team
win recovery from the team win recovery
project what's it all about does it
stack up what's cool and what's not I'm
Joe Levi this is PocketNow let's go take
a look so here we've got the nexus 4 I
am booted up now into fastboot and mode
and I have just flashed team win
recovery and I'm ready now to reboot
into recovery mode so let's go ahead and
do that you can see that first boot it
looks just like everything else at this
point and then we get a nice splash
screen something that's not all that
common with recovery images from here
you'll notice nice big buttons we've got
a time we've got a battery indicator
we've got the version of the recovery
image that we're running all kinds of
neat stuff so let's go ahead and look at
what we've got we can install wipe
backup restore mount go into settings
advanced and reboot well let's go ahead
and flash a rom shall we let's install
something from I believe I put it in
downloads no I didn't so let's go up a
level you'll notice this is all very
touch centric and works really well we
can scroll up and down do what we need
to this is alphabetized the way you'd
expect it to be alphabetized not the way
Linux alphabetizes things where
uppercase and lowercase are different
letters go into clockworkmod in to
download and I believe I downloaded two
right over here the most up-to-date
version is 14 6 16 and let's go ahead
and flash this so the first thing we're
met with now is kind of a disclaimer
along with some extra checkboxes to look
for a zip file signature verification
and that md5 sum checks which are very
good things by the way we need to
install one more thing
let's add more zips we can install a
maximum of 10 I'm going to go up a level
up another level up another level up
another level and we're gonna come over
here to this and gaps and we're going to
install that version now from here we're
good to go all we got to do is swipe to
confirm flash or if you screwed
something up you can clear the zip queue
so let's go ahead and swipe just like
that
have a nice little textual box like we
normally have showing us what's going on
but we also have this status indicator
well let this go ahead and run and be
back as soon as it's done flashing at
this point we're met with a message that
says flashing was successful and we can
now either wipe the cache reboot the
system would go back home we're going to
go back home for now because we want to
look at a couple other things
wiping always a good thing to wipe try
and teach my kids that every day so
inside here we can wipe any of the
things that we want to we can go back
next let's look at some of our settings
we can turn on zip signature
verification all the time force md5
checks on all zips that doesn't mean
that you need the md5 file to check
against I don't put those on there I
probably should but don't check that
unless you have the md5 files also an
option to use RM dash RF instead of
formatting skip md5 generation during
backup don't do that enable md5
verification of backup files yes do that
ignore image size errors during backup
don't do that and simulate actions for
theme testing yes this is Thema Balu can
also set our timezone in here so kind of
cool look at a little bit more stuff
advanced we can copy logs to our SD fix
permissions this is something that you
should do any time you flash and you're
running into errors just weird things
that are happening force closes fix
permissions it usually will go in and
resolve a lot of your headaches for you
we have a file manager a terminal
command window which terminal from right
here in recovery that's awesome you have
no idea a DB side load which we saw just
recently on how to install some of the
the more updated jelly bean roms and
whatnot through ADB side load rather
than
other methods and then we can go in and
reload themes so really really cool I
like this quite a bit we can go ahead
and reboot its team win recovery it's a
lot more user friendly then clockworkmod
recovery is if you haven't flashed
anything yet as far as a recovery ROM
this is probably the one I would
recommend you may want to stay away from
theming it because any time they do
major updates to it you need to turn off
your theme before you install the update
just a little caveat there that I've
seen in some of the discussion forums
that having them in said it's very nice
one other caveat this probably isn't
gonna work with ROM managers so if you
use rom manager to install all of your
nightly builds of your favorite custom
rom you're probably gonna have to flash
those manually rather than going through
and doing it automatically like you
would with clockworkmod recovery overall
really cool thanks for the suggestion
guys we really appreciate it
if you like what you saw here give the
video a thumbs up if you're watching it
on youtube if you have any questions or
comments head over to pocketnow.com of
course we'll have links to all of this
stuff so you can go out and download and
get it all for yourself try it out and
use it on your own device they do
support a wide variety of devices over
there again
that's over a pocketnow.com I'll have a
link to that down to the bottom of the
YouTube video if you're watching this on
YouTube for pocket now I'm Joe Levi
thanks very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
