smartphone a decade ago was the fact
that these were communicators it was
really the first time that the internet
walked with you 24/7 and at the top of
the food chain was blackberry this alone
became so viral that we even had names
for people that became addicted to their
BlackBerry's it's the main reason why
I've carried two phones ever since even
if the BlackBerry copper plates shortly
after blackberry 10 that it's damaged
what's funny is that today we don't
communicate any less as smartphones have
become more essential and yet using them
for communication has become more
cumbersome the larger they become for
the sake of content consumption so guess
who wants to change that one more time
you guessed it I'm highlighting that
with pocket now and this is our review
of the BlackBerry key one so what things
are essential for a communicator first
it has to be easy to handle since you
will be handling it a lot and second it
has to last all day no matter what the
BlackBerry key one is actually both even
if taking a step away from your standard
Android smartphone it's built of a
sturdy aluminum that's met with grippy
texture at the back and a mix of curves
and flat finishes at the top and bottom
at a glance it is definitely unlike any
smartphone in the market today and it
doesn't feel like any smart phone in the
market either 149 millimeters in height
72 and width 9 and 1/2 in thickness and
180 grams in weight the key one isn't
out to win any thin enlight contest on
the contrary the grippy texture at the
back ends to a device meant to achieve
its first goal as it is definitely quite
comfortable in the hand
to achieve the second goal the key one
pulls on some inspiration from its
legacy the added thickness is most
likely to house its large 3505 milliamp
hour battery the source of internals are
also more in line with that of a premium
mid ranger given the added power
efficiency of the snapdragon 65
processor since again this device values
endurance more than content consumption
its display is actually just the hair
smaller than your standard iPhone 7 at
4.5 inches and brings the same IPS LCD
technology at 3 by 2 aspect ratio color
accuracy is great with decent blacks and
it's also efficient enough to bring an
ambient display with your notifications
below it we also have the famous
blackberry curity keyboard from the
fingerprint scanner on the space bar to
the capacitive navigation gestures
provided by the keyboard the visual
combination of everything is quite
striking and elegant from a distance
bottom line as for the second goal my
week of testing has proven the battery
to be quite epic my first couple of
tests allowed me to go for two days
without a charge and bear in mind my job
is to use a phone pretty much all day
one of the key ingredients to achieve
this great endurance is the inclusion of
android 7.1.1 as close to stock as
possible and i say it's close to stock
because visually it is but it is very
loaded with a ton of tools to help you
communicate more efficiently for
starters the launcher allows widgets but
you kind of don't need them you see
three dots at the bottom of any app icon
swipe it up or down to reveal the
applications widget and you can actually
switch it depending on how many are
available and if you still want regular
widgets you can find these in the app
tray in addition to a third tab for
programmable shortcuts and speaking of
shortcuts you can either press or long
press any keyboard element to launch an
extra one for a total of 56 shortcuts
though these four
reason only seemed to work on the home
screen at least for now the only one
that really works all the time at least
at the time of this review is the one
you set at the convenience key which is
at the right
I've actually disabled the short press
shortcuts since I find it more
convenient to just start typing and have
the key one perform a device search even
if it's quite laggy right now the
BlackBerry hub continues to play a major
role on this phone as the one place
you've come to receive all your
communication instead of needing to
fumble from one app to the next this is
definitely my favorite feature as you
can be selective of which accounts fall
on the hub I just wish that Gmail
integration was better at least then
figuring out ways to archive email by
simply swiping and not requiring an
extra action to select the folder and
then to complement the hub the
productivity tab at the right allows you
to view your day from any screen and act
on specifics within it I'm sad to report
though that bbm is dead like seriously
the last time that any of my old
contacts was seen online was two years
ago it's really sad to see this great
platform just died and then there is
everything else which pretty much looks
like stock Android and where the pixel
is mimicked in most things like for
example how notifications are portrayed
on the ambient display and the launch of
the Google system by pressing and
holding the home button missing though
are essentials like the blue light
filter which are not found at least on
this version that I'm currently using
now all this very of custom software
doesn't seem to like the limited spec
sheet
I wouldn't call performance sluggish but
there is the occasional stutter when
launching applications or navigating
within them and then ideas like typing a
search from the home screen are great
selling points for a persistent keyboard
but as I mentioned earlier the lack can
really hinder the experience as you
can't really tell what the phone is
doing whenever you start typing and then
you have to wait for your response and
ask for that persistent keyboard there
are elements to love and a sort of a
wish list on my behalf
all right find the genius to be able to
use it for navigation between screens
and for this fingerprint scanner to be
as fast as it is I also love the swiping
action for predictions since these are
on spot most of the time and then my
favorite which would be the fact that
it's multilingual without the need of me
to switch languages what I don't like is
more personal thing as I can't feel kind
of crammed compared to even legacy
blackberries it is also quite mushy when
pressing it compared to older units as
well in my time testing it I have
started to get used to it
but I do hope the key to will take over
the rest of the chin and provide us with
a larger keyboard and blackberry since
the technology is already capacitive how
about having it detect typing without
the need to press the keys as regaining
muscle memory has been my largest
learning curve the camera is one of
those stories I am glad to report on the
key one sports the same IMX 3 7 8 sensor
that we find on the Google pixel and
that is actually awesome there isn't the
background work that the pixel is able
to achieve with HDR plus but this device
is actually a worthy contender for
daylight photography in almost every
scenario the one point 5 5 microns on
the sensor even allow this camera to
perform abruptly in low-light though
focus can be a challenge there's a
setting to force the camera to not take
the shot until focus is acquired so you
can pick your poison if you'd prefer it
to take its time
pro tip disable HDR at night and watch
ones real camera review for more details
another thing that's shocking is how
well this camera stabilizes video even
without the inclusion of OIS something
which again is another very neat trick
from the pixel that's also mimicked here
and yes this phone takes decent selfie
photos even though again we're not
really fans of these to conclude I think
it's important that we remember the main
purpose of a communicator
ergonomics and endurance are essential
for someone that doesn't want to be
carrying a battery pack around after a
long day in the city and in that respect
the BlackBerry key one nails everything
there is a lot of genius behind the
hardware and a lot more behind the
software that powers at all now those of
you who need a phone focused on content
consumption and not really communication
I can totally understand that you feel
this device is not for you because
you're probably right
it's not and if you still do want the
software but on more powerful hardware
there is the BlackBerry detects 60 the
BlackBerry key one is designed for the
rest of us who did feel nostalgic the
moment we saw it for the first time the
die-hard professional in need of a work
tool that's quick to react and that can
last a full day and then some so then I
say the BlackBerry key one is a great
device for the things that matter the
fact that this phone is already running
the latest version of Android is a good
indication that my complaints about
software will be ironed out soon because
and absolutely everything else this is
going to be one phone I will have a hard
time putting away and while that happens
