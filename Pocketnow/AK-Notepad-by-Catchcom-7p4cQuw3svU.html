one of our last videos was about
Evernote which is a note-taking app for
almost every platform desktop and mobile
that synchronizes your notes to the
cloud it's available in both free and
premium versions so they call it
freemium but it does cost money to do
some of the cooler things well luckily
one of you guys took me up on my
challenge and told me what you use
rather than Evernote to take notes in
this case it's a keynote by capcom but
I've also got a little bonus for you
let's go take a look okay are you
familiar with UNIX in UNIX they have one
overriding philosophy do one thing and
do it very very well so you don't have
applications just coming out the wazoo
in a UNIX environment that do one and
only one thing well over in Android we
have a lot of stuff that does a lot of
things in fact when you saw my Evernote
video Evernote takes notes but it also
syncs to the cloud and it has notebooks
and it has tagging and it has OCR and it
has just tons of stuff well this is a
Kay notepad you can find it in the
market it is free it's by capcom as you
can tell and it's very very basic you
can come in and add a note and what this
does is it brings up a very simple legal
style notebook then you just tap in here
and you write a note or you use your
voice to dictate a note that's it
pretty simple isn't it now once you set
this up and it's a very easy setup
procedure it's going to synchronize your
notes with your catch comma count and
you can see a nice little animation
there and you can see I've got these two
quick notes in here in fact this is the
default one that says welcome to catch
calm so let me just open that up and
again something's wrong with my left
hand I think it it doesn't tap very well
but coming in here you can see first of
all there's a hyperlink hyperlinks and
email addresses
automatically get well hyperlinked they
get link to do whatever they're supposed
to do so as you type them in it will
automatically grab that for you next is
if you want to provide a tag remember in
Evernote there was tagging well there is
over here too just put a hash symbol in
front of your word and that makes it a
searchable tag and it's kind of a way to
loosely categorize things so very very
cool there now one bad thing is if you
take a look there's no way to put in a
photo note there's no way to put in a
voice note nothing like that but you'll
notice this is quick photo note so let's
open that up and it just this quick
photo no there's nothing in there so
let's go see how I did that and that's
right back here so here's a K notepad
and the icon is very similar to what
you'd expect it to be and you know nice
notepad here's it's big brother it's big
brother is called catch and catch has
this cool little icon it has a shortcut
so if you want to add a shortcut to a
new note just tap on shortcuts and
scroll down here and choose a new note
of course we've already done that you
can do that as well with Evernote which
is something I didn't show you in that
video or you can just come in here and
open up the app add a quick note or even
add a quick photo note right there so
let's go ahead and open up and just open
up catch using the icon there now very
very clean interface I'm really
impressed with how this looks it's got
not only your notes but also your tags
so if we go into tags you can see all of
the notes that we have provided a hash
tag for I like this a lot better than I
like the Evernote version of doing the
same because your tags can be inside of
inside of your text you don't have to
supply them after the fact and possibly
forget to insert them at all which helps
with searchability notes are just like
that in this case it's a little bit
nicer view with a little bit of a
tutorial down at the bottom so here's my
welcome to catch like we saw in the
other one so it has a little bit
different view there we can add an
attachment if we want or go in and edit
the note if we want go back here and
here is my quick note and you notice
this little GPS icon a little place
indicator that says that this has
been tagged or geotagged and I just
pulled a a note out of my or an image
rather out of my my gallery couldn't
think of what it was called there we can
add textual notes and then of course
we've got that now this is Jack spear
Coe from the survival podcast which I
really like there's even a survival app
that I'll have to show you one of these
times kind of cool teaches you how to
plant gardens and do all kinds of other
stuff but before we get too far off
topic very easy very simple very good
way and they didn't even shows the
hyperlink location of where that picture
was taken so still very very cool going
back here you can see that we've done
everything here in text notes we can add
a gallery note which is exactly what I
did there with my with my image I just
tapped on that picked a photo at random
for my gallery and it put it right into
my notebook so very cool there put in a
reminder note now that's just like it
says you're setting a reminder for it so
this is kind of crossing the line
between just a notebook and more into a
to-do list with alarms and whatnot so
getting pretty close there we can also
go into a voice note which I like that's
basically just voice not dictation but
voice recording so you can record what
you want if you have to record a note
really really fast put that up there
into the cloud save it for later and
you've got it so you can look at it
later and then of course a camera note
so that you can very quickly and easily
grab something using your camera whether
that's an advertisement or a picture or
a crime in progress or you know whatever
and then of course we have settings down
at the bottom and this has everything
that you'd expect your refresh intervals
it's syncing and I've got a set to sync
on launch what kind of connections you
want to use whether you want to use
Wi-Fi or data your account information
yes you do have to have a catch com
account I signed in with my Google
account and then set up a CAPTCHA count
so now all I have to do is log in with
Google and it's good to go
very very nice Google login integration
there I like that quite a bit
storage you can store your files over on
your SD card which I would highly
advocate to free up that very very
valuable internal storage location
tagging is off by the
fault but of course I turn that on
because I find that extra bit of
metadata very very valuable now I did
not show you this in a que but both of
the apps have a passcode lock so you can
actually lock your notepad I don't
particularly like that because it's just
locking one app I would much prefer that
you lock your entire device with a code
or at least with a pattern and that will
help secure there but it's nice that
they do offer that for you as well you
can change your sort change of preview
lines just all kinds of things that you
can do export your settings to the SD
card lots and lots of cool stuff and
again very clean interface very nice
widgets very nice icons of shortcuts but
if you just want to go with the basic
a.k notepad is it catch the Big Brother
will do everything as far as I can tell
that Evernote will do without having
that premium cost associated with it so
thank you very much for the tip about a
king notepad it led me over to catch and
they work together so that you can have
a very quick very simple notepad or a
very robust notepad and have the notes
synchronized between the two again this
video came from a viewer comment this is
your opportunity to leave comments down
below let us know what you use then
right now we're on the note-taking thing
but if you want to tell us some app that
you like that we haven't covered please
let us know tell us why it's awesome and
what recommendations you have for it
what what ways you use it in your life
and maybe we can get a video out here
just for you so showing off ake a
notepad catch and catch comm for Pocket
