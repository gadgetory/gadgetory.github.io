Windows 8 just a couple of days later
we'll get Windows Phone 8 announced and
Nokia also launches the Lumia 920 in the
US sort of I'm hi Mary vetta wondering
if I'll be getting that microsoft
surface or not and this is out
daily Microsoft is just sent out invites
for October 26 where they'll be
launching windows 8 to the public along
with the launch they've also confirmed
that they'll be selling the microsoft
surface tablet that same day at midnight
but the funny part of the news here is
that they still haven't confirmed what
the pricing will be on the tablet so I'm
not sure how they're planning for people
to really know they're gonna want to buy
the surface tablet or not if they don't
know how much is going to cost Microsoft
and just a couple of days later on
October 29th Microsoft is also sent out
invites for an event where they'll be
launching Windows Phone 8 to the public
this comes just a couple of days early
for when some of the windows phones will
be launched on November though as
expected none of these dates in November
are still known and we're going to talk
a little more about that in the last
segment an interesting rumor now has LG
building an optimist base Nexus device
and according to the source they
actually held the device now we all know
that the optimus G is a great phone a
great powerhouse and this just fleets
the recent rumors that Google will most
probably run more than one nexus devices
holiday season if that's the truth
hooray for that because if this is going
to be an LG only device oh man that's
gonna flop ATT is just announced that
there will be the daring first carrier
to serve as a guinea pig for the launch
of the Samsung Galaxy camera this
holiday season that's right for an
undisclosed stash of cash you'll be able
to buy that camera that has phone
capabilities but that's not really a
phone I'm not really sure how AT&amp;amp;T plans
to sell you that extra data plan just
for you to be able to use that camera
and upload photos in steadily but you
can't already do it phones and tablets
but still they can always try and
finally for the heartbreak news of the
day Nokia's just announced that they'll
be launching their Lumia 920 and 820 in
the United States in November but
there's a catch it's exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T
at launch at least and what this means
is that probably the best
of the year will be stuck to AT&amp;amp;T for at
least 90 days and that means that if
you're on verizon you're not going to be
able to get the phone on black friday
and your savings will most likely go to
another phone and this is just really
sad news I mean the whole tech world is
extremely disappointed in this decision
because I think Nokia didn't understand
why they're Lumia 900 pretty much
flopped on ATT because of this exclusive
deal so that leads me to the question of
the day would you be willing to switch
carriers just to get a Lumia 920 I
already know your answer but please
leave us a comment down below tell know
he is a big mistake now if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow was on Parker
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hi Mary
better thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
