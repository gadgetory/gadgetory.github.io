com and i've got bean mobile installed
on a bunch of different platforms here a
bunch of different devices and we're
going to take a little comparison of how
it differs from platform to platform
probably thinking well turn it should
they all be the same you might be
surprised let's check it out so first up
let's take a look at windows phone seven
here we are with an HD seven and it's
got its own little search button so if
I'm on the start page I go to search and
we got bean and we have our picture of
the day and we have little hot spots you
can read about it and you got your
search field with a microphone let's see
what should we search for Egypt
and so there's our searchers also go to
news because it thinks that's what I'm
looking for and you can swipe to get the
web and you get a little map and you can
go to local and there's no local results
but that's about it you got three
different tabs let's try a different
search sushi
and that should I have a local so you
get the map there and we got different
places so that reviews what's nearby if
it loads so there's what's nearby you
got reviews about the plays you got
phone number the website at the hours
pretty nice you can share it that's
about it for being on windows phone 7
alright so let's look at windows mobile
6.5 now this you can see is a bit
different we have the microphone over
there we've got the search button you
got the picture but we have buttons here
and we have menu and directions not only
can I get directions I can navigate
so as I drive this is going to tell me
which way to go now just for axe turn
it's a full GPS navigation system right
there in the bing let's go back to home
we also got traffic maps course
perhaps directions there are favorites
this is something you don't have on
windows phone 7 you can save favorite
searches and got movies let's go
straight to a nice list of movies and
you get showtimes really quickly and
easily so that's windows mobile when
does a mobile 6.5 is very similar except
there's no touchscreen so now to use the
little buttons as a menu recent
favorites we also have top news this is
a cool little thing so without a banda
entering search query terms we can
really quickly get to some information
like that and this one also has the
navigation which is great all right
which one's next how about the
blackberry here's the blackberry torch
with the Bing mobile app and you can tap
it to make the menu go away and now you
get your little hot spots and we have a
buttons at the bottom we got search
button at the top now this is really
nice that's a what's nearby so right
away I can see with two taps what
restaurants are closed to me or with
weather is now I don't have to search it
or type it
so that's pretty cool you also got the
news same thing as what we've seen
before and here's Maps very similar no
multi-touch on the blackberry traffic is
there of course locate me and here's an
interesting thing bean has a separate
Bing Maps icon in the blackberry but it
goes to the same program you also have
your blackberry menu so let's try a
search images Angelina Jolie
and we didn't get actually images but
you got an images tab so that's really
cool nice way to quickly find images
now in directions you notice that it
does not have the navigation button it
only has directions and that's about it
for the Bing blackberry app next up
android here's the android a nap and we
got the search the web with got
microphones similar features here but i
can go back and see different pictures
so that's pretty cool feature and we can
tap the hot spots to learn more you can
see the interface is different it
doesn't fade the picture out background
and we have a little tray here it comes
up where we can get maps directions
there's news and you don't get to choose
you know which category of news it's
just kind of all in here movies
so you get all the movies that are
playing and you have to tap one don't
get a list of theaters
alright that's been kind of slow and you
also have images and local search but
here's another cool feature I tap that I
could all the menu so I can choose what
I want to search you know what type of
category Jessica Alba
that goes right to some Jessica Alba
pictures so that's pretty cool
directions we do not have the voice
prompting navigation it's just regular
it'll tell you which way to go but it
won't tell you while you're driving you
know it won't speak to you it'll just
list the turns you have to make so
that's about it for the Android Bing
mobile app sound some different features
there and here we have been mobile on
iOS so this we have some differences we
got text on the image we don't have hot
spots until you tap it and there they
are and this is kind of a zune like
media center scrolling thing so we can
choose images this brings up a nice
little interface you can quickly browse
pictures without you know having to do a
search let's go back home maps of course
did I miss it apps but yes that's right
we have bird's-eye view
and look at this
we are rotating bird's eye view this
feature actually was in previous old
windows live search versions of Windows
Mobile of the windows mobile app of for
live search but it made it to the iphone
version local of course we're going to
find local stuff there's some
restaurants
movies it's going to go straight to a
list of movies again and that's pretty
quick I'll look at this what's that mean
add to plan so that's interesting you
can integrate with facebook to organize
a plan of places that you want to go and
share with your friends pretty neat
feature right as news it's just piled in
there look at all these crazy options
check in
oh yeah that's right I can check in
using facebook places foursquare and my
messenger status all from the bay nap
you can shop for stuff
check out prices here
social look at that it is integrating
with Twitter and Facebook
oh there's my Twitter stream that's
right being on iOS has a twitter app in
it and there's weather
okay so look what else we have up here a
camera and a microphone so let's try the
camera it's going to load up
that gives me options here you can tap
to start selecting text or I can see
what this is that's going straight to
Windows 7 software because that's what I
took a picture of you can also use that
to scan barcodes search for book covers
or as you saw select text pretty crazy
feature right and here's more options
you got bookmarks history settings
private search and we have a lot of cool
options but that's about it for the iOS
vein app and that's it for all of my
being apps on different platforms so
quite a bit of difference there hope you
enjoyed this video hope you learned
about the differences between being
mobile on different platforms I had to
future if you enjoyed this video give us
a thumbs up and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
