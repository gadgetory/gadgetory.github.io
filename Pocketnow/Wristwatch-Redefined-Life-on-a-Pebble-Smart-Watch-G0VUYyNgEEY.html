sexy term but it is a cool idea and this
is the next step toward it I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is
what life on a pebble smartwatch is like
by now you've heard about pebble and if
you haven't you should read our
editorials about the little device and
the company behind it at pocketnow.com
and while you're at it you should follow
us because that's a cool thing to do
pebble isn't the world's first
SmartWatch but it is arguably the
world's best-known one part of that is
because of the record amount of
Kickstarter money that brought it into
being but the more important part is
that it's a really good product that
doesn't try to do more than it's
designed to this isn't a full smartphone
on your wrist or even an approximation
of one in its current form pebble is
primarily a second screen for your
notifications a reason not to pull your
phone out of your pocket or across the
room to go get it on its face that
doesn't sound like a reason to drop a
hundred and fifty dollars and for some
people it sounds absurd but if you're
open to new ideas and a change in your
routine the convenience it brings is
amazing once you're through unboxing
your pebble and powering it on and maybe
adding a metal watch band like I've done
you've got a choice of configuring it
with the standard pebble app or with the
third-party pebble notifier which we
recommend as it gives you a wider range
of notification customizations the watch
connects via bluetooth to your Android
smartphone or iPhone I've used mine on
both a galaxy note 2 and Droid DNA and
outside of a couple minor bugs TouchWiz
and sense don't fiddle too much with
pebbles functionality but though you
will get tired of the accessibility bug
on Samsung phones constantly telling you
when you open and close homescreen
folders closed after you tell pebble
what apps you wanted to talk to you drop
your phone in your pocket and that's
when life on a SmartWatch begins pebble
doesn't have a speaker so the
notifications it delivers our vibrations
right to your wrist it's a little
jarring at first but you get used to it
quickly and it eliminates that feeling
of uncertainty you get when you're
carrying a phone in a backpack or
in a cargo pocket on some loose pants
you never have to stop a conversation or
take your headphones off to ask is that
my phone because the bone-jarring
vibration on your wrist is impossible
not to notice speaking of those
notifications part of the reason wearing
a SmartWatch right now is so interesting
is that no one around you knows what it
is
pebbles unique watch faces might catch
their eye but most average people still
think it's just a fancy timepiece if you
get a lot of notifications that you're
constantly checking people will start
asking you if you've got a hot date you
need to get to or something like that it
almost forces you to explain what pebble
is which depending on how social you're
feeling is either a blessing or a curse
the notifications themselves on the
ePaper display are short they cut off
after a few words whether they're a text
or an email and some notifications don't
contain any content at all they'll just
say new Twitter interactions or somesuch
but it's usually enough to get the gist
of the message and decide whether it's
worth taking out your phone and the
screen is very easy to read under almost
any lighting condition at its core
pebble is really a triage device instead
of oh my phone buzzed let me take it out
and see what that was
it's Oh my wrist buzzed let me see if I
need to take my phone out at all it
doesn't seem like much and people who
want to marginalize the product is
something for the super lazy have an
easy target and pebble but they're
missing the point
fishing your phone out of your pocket or
crossing the room to go get it only to
discover that it's a Facebook event
invite you don't care about is
irritating running to find your ringing
phone only to find out that it's a
telemarketer calling is annoying and
pebble removes that annoyance in a fun
hip relatively stylish way that's only
scratching the surface of what's
possible the watch also includes
functionality to control your smartphone
media player and there are supposedly a
ton of third-party apps coming down the
pipe as developers work with pebbles SDK
but for now the shortcomings like not
being able to read full messages lack of
an aggregator notification area in a
minor bug here and there are nowhere
near enough to overcome the added
convenience pebble brings Plus
especially if you're a tech geek it's
just
again pebbles concept is not a
complicated one
it's a risk-based extension of your
smartphone but in that simplicity it's
amazing by not trying to do more than it
can by not overextending itself it
delivers an excellent experience it's
better to do a handful of things well
than to do many things poorly a lesson
pebble clearly understands will
doubtless see more features creep into
future pebbles but this version is so
good and its potential is so vast that
we think it's the first concrete
indication that wearable technology
doesn't just have to be a fad it can be
practical it can be useful and it can be
the future that's it for this time folks

more from PocketNow thanks again for
