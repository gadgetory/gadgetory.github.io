last month
and while the Xperia z5 premium was the
star of the show with its 4k screen we
can't help but also be excited for the
compact model which should fit much more
easily into our hands and pockets I'm
high on so Huston with pocket now and
this is our Xperia z5 compact unboxing
the packaging here is pretty plain Jane
just a picture of the phone on the front
and some specs and feature call-outs on
the back to name a few we're looking at
an octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor a
4.6 inch 720p IPS LCD display with
Sony's tri aluminum's technology and a
claim of up to two days of battery life
we'll see
although the box of our review unit
depicts a white phone don't be fooled
flopping off the top reveals that we'll
be working with the graphite black model
it looks fantastic by the way with a
gorgeous frosted glass finish on the
back that feels smooth to the touch
almost like aluminum the sides are the
same smooth finish and they housed a
palpable cover for the salmon SD cards
along with a two-stage button for the 23
megapixel camera and a new sleep/wake
button on the side with a built-in
fingerprint scanner we'll report more on
the performance of the fingerprint
scanner and a camera in our full review
along with the phone itself
sony has included the typical wall wart
and USB cable and a free screen
protector I don't usually use screen
protectors but since it was included I
decided to go ahead and stick it on
before powering on the device once it
boots up we're looking at a familiar
layout with so many software skin over
top android 5.1.1 lollipop we like what
we see so far but stay tuned for our
full review to hear our final thoughts
coming soon here on youtube and at
pocketnow.com just be sure to subscribe

clove code at UK where you can pick up
