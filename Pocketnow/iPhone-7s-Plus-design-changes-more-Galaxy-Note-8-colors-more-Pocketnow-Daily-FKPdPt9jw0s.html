the rumors we've already heard so knows
clearly heard the Apple home pod message
n has prepared a competitor and there
are more color options for the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 but not for everyone I'm
Jaime Rivera and we are reporting from
Aoife in Berlin and know the polos are
not coming back this is just for the
trade show this is PocketNow daily the
official loose today begin with deals if
you're in the market for a chromecast
from Google this is probably the best
time to buy it is currently $10 off
wherever show that I'm actually talking
about the ultra variant meaning you get
more power than the regular chromecast
and yeah you get a lot of capabilities
here so you can learn more on which
retailers in the description this is
definitely a good deal now as well the
spotlight over to the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 to the devices not yet available
for everyone but it seems that in Taiwan
you will be able to preorder the pink
variant as of September 1st and this is
actually the second time the Samsung
does this they launched a Pinkberry in
Taiwan of their flagship galaxy and yet
it seems that it won't be out of any
other country anytime soon we'll keep
you posted as soon as we learn more
about that and speaking of Samsung the
company has just made their event to
happen at Aoife official it's happening
tomorrow we're definitely gonna be
covering it live and from what we see we
are getting wearables and we're not
exactly sure if these are going to be a
new Girish 3 it seems that everything is
going to be focused on fitness and
sports I'm hoping that that's not the
case I'm hoping that's not the only
thing we get to see but obviously you
will see our coverage to let you know
more about it now some very interesting
developments have come from Sonos this
is a company we rarely ever cover here
but given the whole fanfare of the Apple
home pod there is a new sono smart
speaker going through the FCC right now
and the reason why the speaker is
interesting is because so knows it's not
trying to reinvent the wheel here
apparently they're not coming with their
own digital assistant that works through
a speaker no you can actually use Amazon
Alexa on it and it's not limited to
Alexa apparently it'll support other
platforms hopefully the Google assistant
will keep you posted as soon as we learn
more about
that one that would be a very hot
product and hopefully not as expensive
as the home pod and finally the very
interesting rumors today continue to be
the iPhone but not the iPhone at this
time instead the iPhone 7s and 7s plus
we've got more trusted sources chiming
in on the rumors we've pretty much
already heard glass back wireless
charging interesting apparently this
iPhone is going to be thicker than the
current one for reasons we still don't
understand and we're still trying to
figure out what the point is of a launch
of an iPhone 7 as it actually leads me
to the question today I mean do you even
care about the existence of this
smartphone given all the rumors of the
iPhone 8 because in my case possibly
know unless they pull out something
really amazing with this thing which
could be a better iPhone for the price
tag but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends

get the news earlier before the video
was filmed follow it wasn't find out on
