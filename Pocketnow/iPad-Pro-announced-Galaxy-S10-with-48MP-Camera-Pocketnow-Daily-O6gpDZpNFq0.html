announced today and let's just say that
they're more pro than ever
Samsung has just introduced two new
imaging sensors that we might see in the
Galaxy S 10 with 48 megapixels and if
your pixel 3 excel just grew a Sega
notch don't panic I know it's horrible
but you're not alone I'm high metal
Iveta and don't worry not everything
that we're gonna talk about today is
focused on Apple there are some really
cool things this is parking out daily
let's switch the scheme a little bit
let's not begin with official news
because well there are ton of those for
those of you having issues with the
Google pixel 3 Excel where you've
noticed the second horrible notch
growing you're not alone Google actually
hasn't really figured out what's causing
this there is an option within developer
options in the pixel where you can
enable that second notch in the bottom
but it's not supposed to just pop off on
its own so stay tuned
I'm not having issues with mine but
apparently it says something normal
right now now let's talk about Samsung
as a the company has just announced two
new ISO cell sensors and before you
start you know just frowning and
everything because I know ISO cell
sensors from Samsung have never been
really great let's just remember that
there are cases where you can really
tell if you're using a Sony sensor or an
ISO cell sensor on a galaxy phone and
they take great photos so the company
has just announced - they've got weird
code names but one of them is a 48
megapixels and the other one is of 32
and yes we know that there is a new sony
48 megapixel camera sensor as well which
makes me wonder if it's some sort of a
collaboration that we could be seeing in
the galaxy as 10 in the future you can
learn more in the description now let's
talk about the brand new Mac Mini and I
know that a lot of you are like Mac Mini
yes the last time Apple launched one of
these was nearly half a decade ago or
updated them I don't know whatever the
case may be I have one I know a lot of
people that like them and now you can
pretty much turn this into a full pro
computer to a certain degree with
options of up to 32 gigs and 2 terabytes
of storage and you've got a ton of i/o
at the back and it starts at $7.99 but
then when you look at what you get for
$7.99 you're
not really getting much so buyers beware
I'm not saying it's a bad product I'm
just saying it's not as cheap as the Mac
Mini was intended to be now let's talk
about the brand new MacBook Air and you
know I'm not gonna lie I've been
considering getting a MacBook or getting
a 13-inch MacBook Pro just to make my
experience editing video while on the go
easier and then having the 15-inch
MacBook Pro here but my god that 13 inch
MacBook Air makes a lot of sense you get
a reddit display you get touch ID you
get a larger trackpad better keyboard
you get two Thunderbolt 3 ports which is
hard to find today even on a ton of
Windows computers and that the
specifications look ok they're not
necessarily the best when it comes to
the processing power but because it's
got Thunderbolt 3 you can't connect any
GPU to this thing so I'm already
scratching my head and wondering if I
should just give this a try we'll keep
you posted because the price is not
cheap it starts pretty much at 1,200
bucks
and we go back to the topic it's not
really a great computer if you buy the
entry-level variant and finally the hot
news today have to do with the product
that I am waiting for most new iPad pros
I was expecting a new iPad Mini that
would you know do more things but
there's not this new iPad pro is
something else because it's completely
changed this design it actually looks
like the first generation iPad with
pretty much the boxy corners it's now
God face ID and now it's got USB C which
enables so many things but makes me
wonder why there wasn't also a lightning
cable connector somewhere because of I
actually have lightning cable
accessories so I wonder if there will be
a dongle for that and it's such an irony
that Apple has this just crazy nightmare
of I don't know for pry eteri things
here and there but USB C is great the
display looks amazing
and I'm really looking forward to it but
then we go back to what I've said about
the Mac Mini and what I've said about
the MacBook Air it's not a cheap tablet
and it starts with 64 gigs and then if
you want to go maxed out we were doing
the numbers it's $1200 if you want to
include the new Apple pencil because the
old one doesn't work with it and if you
want to get that keyboard which actually
looks cool and if you want to get 256
gigs of storage so let me know when the
comments down below what do you think I
mean I saw a Photoshop on a tablet work
and I thought that was great
but for 1,200 bucks I'd rather get a new
MacBook Air that would be me leave us a
comment down below let me know what you
think
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on packing out
