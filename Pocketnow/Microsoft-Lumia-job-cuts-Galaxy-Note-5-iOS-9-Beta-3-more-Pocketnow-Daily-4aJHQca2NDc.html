out of which most are from the lumia
division apple launches a bevy of beta
updates for its products that seems a
sony xperia z4 is closer to a US launch
than we thought I'm Hina be that I and I
think this is the smartest time to go
look for your Lumia 1020 on eBay this is
Park it out daily we have a lot of
official news today let's begin with
Apple as the company has just launched
beta 3 for iOS 9 watch 0 s two and 0 s
10 El Capitan or El Capitan and even
though it's really hard to confirm what
the updates were for watching us two or
OS 10 iOS 9 did receive some major
upgrades for example you get Apple music
support you get Apple's new news
application being launched which is
something we were waiting for but in
addition to that we have some UI
improvements to the iPad user interface
so yeah these updates are available to
developers now sadly there is no public
beta yet not everything is good news
when it comes to Apple as well and i was
already printing thing that the Apple
watch is not selling well at least until
now Apple has not provided any numbers
yet and according to analysts Apple was
selling crazy amount of watches at the
beginning but now we're not selling more
than 10,000 units a day which is still a
good number for the SmartWatch market
but not for what Apple was apparently
doing now obviously we need official
numbers but it seems that the customer
is already gearing up to the apple watch
too and particularly because it's almost
one year since the product was announced
and for those of us die hard Galaxy Note
fans it seems that the galaxy note 5
will be sort of a disappointment
particularly because uh yeah we have the
leaked video from yesterday with renders
where we saw that it looks a lot like
the galaxy s6 but it seems that it will
look a lot more than we thought it seems
that the back will be made of glass
which means that apparently there will
not be expandable storage or replaceable
battery and there are some other
gimmicks that will probably reach these
products but anyways links in the
description for details now other
official news have sony as the company
has a just-published on its website that
there is a sony xperia z4 v coming to
verizon even though it's not on the
verizon website you
but the specification czar pretty much
the z4 in every way quad HD display in
addition to everything else it looks
like a very promising product and
hopefully we'll get a price tag very
soon in an official website for variety
and finally for the very sad and
disappointing news of the day Microsoft
has just made it official that it is
cutting 7800 jobs during the next coming
weeks because apparently the company is
focusing on different things going
forward and seems like mobile phones are
not what to expect seems that the
company is going to be cutting most jobs
from the Lumia vision because apparently
well it seems that we were still getting
flagship lumias coming but we're not
sure exactly how microsoft plans to do
that really sad news for the company
particularly because nokia was nokia
they bought the mobile division and now
they're doing this but it does lead me
to the question of the day how do you
feel about satya nadella strategy with
Microsoft after this because in my case
I am extremely disappointed but leave us
a comment down below what is your case
and friends as always you know the drill
if you want to get the news earlier
before this video was filmed machine
follow us on out comments a sharp
trade Tube channel as well it followed
me on Twitter hi Nurse Corps Rivera on
instagram at hi mera neta please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I am hi Natalie better thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
