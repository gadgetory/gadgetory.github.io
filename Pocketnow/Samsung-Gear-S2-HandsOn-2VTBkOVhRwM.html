a hulking brute of a bracelet for its
sequel Samsung sticks to the basics of a
Tizen powered watch but almost
everything else has been rebuilt
repackaged or repainted into one of the
most attractive wearables of Aoife 2015
i'm michael fisher with pocket now join
me for a quick look at the Samsung gear
s2 Samsung actually announced two
versions of its newest SmartWatch here
at Aoife the gear s2 and the gear s2
classic each is a sleek round wristwatch
rated to ip68 for water and dust
resistance and topped with a 1.2 inch
Super AMOLED display but the classic
trades the sporty plastics of the stock
s2 for ceramics and leather for a more
well classic style each is built on a
stainless steel frame with Gorilla Glass
3 screen protection and the screens
themselves are plenty colourful and
crisp at just over 300 PPI the Bluetooth
4.1 provides the wireless connection to
the phone and this time around it's any
Android phone
not just Samsung devices as long as
you've got 1.5 gigs or more of RAM and
Android 4.4 or later you're good to go
Wi-Fi is also here as is NFC for Samsung
pay support and a separate connected
edition of the standard s2 will offer a
4G radio that can support voice calls
and data without the need for a
connected handset the heart rate sensor
is still here and s health packs new
features like automatically logging when
you're running or walking which is cool
also cool the interface in addition to a
touch screen and side mounted back and
home buttons the gear s2 introduces a
rotating bezel control that provides a
really nice experience in areas like the
main menu where you can navigate just by
spinning the ring from the watch face
you turn the ring left to go to
notifications you turn it right to
access widgets yeah it takes some
getting used to but it's no more
complicated than save the Apple watch my
bigger concern is responsiveness the
Samsung Tizen powered watches aren't
always as speedy has their Android wear
counterparts and the gear s2 did feel
slow on the whole
that's to be expected with non-final
software of course Samsung says the gear
s2 will last two to three days on a
charge a bold claim given its
comparatively small 250 milliamp hour
battery taking a cue from Motorola the
watch will ship with a Qi wireless
charging dock for topping up and this
one uses magnets to keep the watch
firmly in place each version of the
watch offers removable bands with the
classic having a standard 20 millimeter
attachment point and the standard using
a proprietary quick-release mechanism
while the standard s2 will come in
multiple colors the classic comes in any
color you want as long as it's black
Samsung is withholding pricing and
availability for the moment but you can
expect the classic to be priced a bit
higher than its sibling when these hits
stores as a press time every major
wireless carrier except Sprint had
committed to carry the gear s2
personally speaking I think this is a
really sharp looking SmartWatch with a
really interesting user interface and I
can't wait to try it out properly we'll
have more in-depth thoughts on the gear
s2 when we take it for a full review of
course stay tuned for that and dive into
all the other wearable coverage coming
from Aoife 2015 here on YouTube and at
pocketnow.com till next time this has
been Michael Fisher with paka now
captain to phones on Twitter thanks for
watching we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
