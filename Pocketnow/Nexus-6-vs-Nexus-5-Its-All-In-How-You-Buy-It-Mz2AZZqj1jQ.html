description below to find out how you
can start saving money and get in on the
simple way of going Wireless last year's
Nexus 5 was a wedge of LG built
polycarbonate that was remarkable for
its modern specs and low price tag and
basically nothing else this year things
are different with a huge footprint and
a price point to match the Nexus 6
stands out in a way its predecessor
never did but how much better is it
really and which should you buy if
you're shopping for the purest Android
around I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow
here to help you find out in Nexus 6
versus Nexus 5
first let's address the Shamu in the
room the size difference here might seem
obvious and silhouette but it's not
until you slap these phones side by side
that the absurdity of the Nexus 6 really
becomes apparent a one-inch increase in
screen size and the move to front firing
speakers makes the six substantially
taller and wider which also makes it
much harder to use one-handed the Nexus
5 is what Alex Trebek might call a
potent portable the Nexus 6 is a
borderline ridiculous brick but get past
the size difference and you start to see
all the ways Motorola has improved on
LG's take on the Nexus the nondescript
plank of plastic has been replaced by a
curved metal rim to chassis with
Motorola's characteristic finger dimple
and the bold Nexus branding giving the
backplate a look that yes a little gaudy
er than last year's and a little wobbly
or on the tabletop but at least it's got
character at least it's not so darn
boring the same is true for the displays
while there's not much difference in
pixel density here bring up a picture
with a lot of contrast and color and
watch the Nexus 6 take the five to
school some of this is expected whenever
you're comparing AMOLED and IPS but the
Nexus 5 display always struck me as
washed out and dull even when it was new
so it wouldn't take much in my book for
the Nexus 6 to show it up here still the
five will probably appeal more to
purists the newer Motorola panel suffers
from a gray green tint to its whites and
a crazy pink tone when taken to the
lowest brightness setting problems the
five doesn't have also if you spend more
of your time in the waking hours you'll
probably appreciate the Nexus 5's
slightly brighter output in daylight
where the Nexus 6 shines is in the dark
it can get far dimmer than the Nexus 5
can manage and that's something I as a
bedtime reader really like to see also
check out the total bottomless blacks of
the 6 next to the Milky Gray's of the
five accuracy aside the Nexus 6
definitely packs the more striking
display in this comparison
beneath those screens the specs hold no
surprises on the Nexus 6 a newer
generation processor 50% more RAM bigger
battery better cameras you name it
you've seen the spec sheets of course
the six can bench more than the five
what matters is how that translates into
real-world usage and because both of
these are Nexus phones they're both
running the latest version of Android
5.0 lollipop so this section instead of
being devoted to software we're calling
day-to-day and on a day to day basis
damn do I miss the Nexus 5's
notification light while Motorola did
apparently build one into the Nexus 6
it's right behind the top speaker grille
it's disabled in the software so you
need to rely on lollipops lockscreen
notifications to keep you in the loop as
to what's going on that's fine and the
six will wake up when picked up or
removed from a pocket to let you know
what you've missed but there's something
so simple and efficient about a
color-coded flasher to let you know that
someone's trying to get a hold of you
plus it's been a staple of the Nexus
lineup since the first generation so
here's hoping Google enables it in a
future software revision so we don't
have to get root to play with it let's
come back to the size issue for a second
because it's such a significant part of
this comparison frankly the sixes added
pounds make it harder to use in almost
every state it can't fit in a pocket as
easily it's more awkward to talk on it's
almost impossible to reach the
notification shade or even the far side
of the keyboard with one hand it doesn't
have the soft touch the black Nexus 5
does so it's more slippery which makes
it easier to drop and what's more Google
has made no effort to use the added
screen size intelligently with no multi
window and no toggles to trip the
notification shade as we've seen on
other phones but if you're okay with
this if you've got giant hands or you're
cool with being essentially forced to
use your phone two-handed well then of
course everything else is better games
Netflix YouTube even basic web browsing
is much more satisfying on the Nexus 6
just because it's got a bigger screen
the Nexus 5 camera never really
impressed me and no Motorola camera ever
has either aside from the boosted
resolution of the Nexus 6 results here
aren't consistent sometimes the last
year's model renders the better shot and
sometimes it's this year's after a few
good ones in a row you might start to
think the Nexus 6 has fixed the Nexus
5's sometimes harsh exposure issues but
then another look shows you otherwise in
low-light the Nexus 6 initially seems to
do much worse than the 5 but then you
switch on HDR and things look measurably
better with much less noise than on the
5s results around front with the selfie
cam the Motorola 1 delivers a shot
that's wider but not all that much
better we'll have video footage from the
new Nexus and our full review coming
soon
broadly speaking though if given the two
options I'd take the Nexus 6 but there
are several smartphone cameras out there
I'd rather have than either of these hey
know what Motorola knows how to do
really well make radios and the Nexus 6
is a radio Beast while we haven't been
able to test its reception in a true no
coverage area because AT&amp;amp;T has Boston so
well blanketed the spec sheet tells us
the Nexus 6 packs bluetooth 4.1 that's
versus for dotto on the Nexus 5 2 by 2
my mo support in Wi-Fi and added 700
megahertz bands for LTE maybe it's that
latter point that gave the Nexus 6 an
edge and upload speeds in a basement
test or maybe it's just packing better
radios overall Motorola also does
speakers quite well and if you like me
don't always want to be chained to your
earbuds hearing the Nexus 6 front firing
speakers shout down the tinny
side-mounted cans on the Nexus 5 is
profoundly satisfying
the games we're using here listed
conveniently at the top of your screen
as always are more fun on the six
because of the added sound quality and
that massive display and while we're
really not seeing the added processing
power or the newer GPU of the Nexus 6
kick in because the Nexus 5 runs newer
games just fine it is handy to have the
cutting-edge specs for future proofing
so that's something to consider if
you're a big gamer as for how long
you'll be able to play those games it's
a bit early for us to make judgements on
the Nexus 6 battery life we've only had
it a couple days but it is looking
pretty impressive compared to the
smallish Nexus 5 power pack the real
difference here is Motorola's included
turbo charger which can charge the Nexus
6 more rapidly than most phones we'll
have the complete data on that as well
as some thoughts on call quality in our
full Nexus 6 review so as it should be
the Nexus 6 is a huge improvement over
most aspects of the Nexus 5 and we
expected that the question in part is
whether you're willing to switch to a
phablet lifestyle to get it to commit to
two-handed use more often than not if
you are then you need to decide if the
extra money the extra $300 is worth the
jump and even taking all the
improvements into account it's really
tough to swallow that almost 100%
increase in price this comes down then
to how you plan to buy your next Nexus
if all you need is a capable functional
stock Android smartphone to last you
through the year and you want or need to
buy it off contract the Nexus 5 is still
a respectable if dull option but if
you're shopping through a carrier store
and you're going to get all the benefits
of a carrier subsidy with your
top-of-the-line purchase well then the
Nexus 6 starts making a lot more sense
as long as you can live with a two-year
contract again folks this is not our
full review stay tuned to pocket now in
the week of December 1 for our complete
take on the Nexus 6 and be sure to throw
a thumbs up our way and share this video
if you enjoyed it until next time this
has been michael fisher with pocket now
captain to phones on twitter for
urging you to keep your speaker's front
and your branding bold we'll see you
