you're working hard
it all counts and everything has to be
accurate I'm happy that I would pocket
now and this is PocketNow fitness
by now
Fitbit has reached so much popularity in
the fitness tracking business that
almost all your comments last week asked
for a Fitbit to be next for episode 2 of
PocketNow fitness there is nothing we
love most and to address your requests
and we were lucky that AT&amp;amp;T sent us a
review unit of the Fitbit surge a few
weeks ago
even though Fitbit is famous for its
fitness trackers the vivid surge is far
more than just your average step counter
to start this is probably one of the
best unboxing experiences ever not just
for the high quality presentation of the
surge the high quality plastic and the
materials in the packaging but because
of the inspirational words you read when
you unwrap the box it's right then that
you understand that this product was
designed for fitness nuts in mind it's
unconventional design even though rugged
is actually rather cool and the fit and
finish of the materials clearly
demonstrate much attention to detail the
search is actually lighter than it seems
once you put it on something essential
for a product design for hardcore
training just keep in mind that even
though this device is sweat rain and
splash proof it isn't swim proof so you
can't really use it for everything
you also can't replace any of the
components of the watch which is
definitely unfortunate but you'll be
happy to know that users who have
complained about the wear and tear
issues have to receive the free
replacement unit after contacting Fitbit
customer service which is a good
solution now to understand many of the
design choices of this product you have
to be clear who it's trying to compete
with Fitbit calls this the ultimate
fitness super watch and as such it's not
trying to compete against Android wear
or the Apple watch but instead against
higher players like Garmin and polar as
a result the bevy of sensors included
and the user interface were all designed
around the needs of a fitness nut this
is one of the few if not the only
Fitness watch that I've seen that
actually tracks your heartrate 24/7 for
example oh so their products do so every
10 minutes or when you tell it that
you're training but the Fitbit surge is
a true heart rate monitor that works all
day and that can do so for up to a week
with a single battery charge and also
what makes it stand out from other fit
bits is that it includes GPS tracking
for cycling and running but it also
shines is one of the few fitness watches
that provides 10 hours of battery life
while on GPS where your average Garmin
will only give you around five hours or
so
and yes you also have the other regulars
like an accelerometer gyro altimeter and
even cooler you can always run without
your phone and just sync your run
information later probably my only
complaint with the hardware is that the
display isn't the brightest in the world
then that the ambient light sensor is
sometimes too aggressive at them in the
display you also get some SmartWatch
capabilities like receiving SMS and
phone call alerts but don't call it a
SmartWatch as it's extremely archaic and
even though you have music controls for
example
please don't work with third-party
applications and there's really no
memory available for syncing music to
the watch or the option for pairing a
Bluetooth headset to leave the phone at
home as well so now that we're clear
that this is just the very powerful
Fitness watch let's just say that you're
gonna love it for what it can do my good
friend shadi Adel Wahb is not only an
award-winning professional body builder
and personal trainer but has also chosen
the Fitbit surge a surf fitness watch
for a reason weight training in the
surge is just pure delight you can set
the Fitbit surge for weight training if
you want but given its permanent heart
rate tracking it'll still detect that
you're active even if you didn't
activate the mode ones using it it
doesn't matter if you're doing intense
pull-ups petros or just about any of the
most demanding reps on your set you'll
seriously forget that you're wearing the
surge which is extremely important shadi
has daily routines are intense and we
both agree that the surge is far more
comfortable than wearing your average
chest strap for calorie calculations
just keep in mind that the results from
the optical sensor on the Fitbit surge
won't be as accurate as your average
chest strap but it does compensate for
the fact that you're actually tracking
your heartrate the whole day not just
when you're training and using the chest
strap just like with weight training you
can also use the Fitbit surge for pretty
much almost every other category of
workout you could think of just by
sending it through the watch's
interphase or in the application one of
my most delightful experiences was using
the Fitbit surge while running if you're
on the road with a surge it's incredibly
quick and catching on GPS signal the
pedometer calculation is also very
accurate at giving
your average pace which is very
important I also found the search to be
a convenient product for spinning or
even outdoor cycling thanks to the
built-in GPS again my only complaint
with its accuracy has to do with the
calories burned and especially when
compared to the results of my Polar h7t
chest strap where I did notice
differences of up to 100 calories in
each workout and that week-long battery
life is not just something you'll read
on paper we've been testing the search
for weeks now and yes it will last for a
full week and yes it will be as a power
efficient when using the GPS but think
of the fact that you can also use the
Fitbit for sleeping and that's actually
one of the things that the service
pioneered years ago consolidating all
the data provided by the watch is where
things might get mixed for some of you
Fitbit offers one of the most complete
fitness applications in the business and
it's one of the few that actually
supports all major smartphone and
computer platforms if you own more than
one Fitbit tracker like I do you have
the advantage of tracking your steps
with a flex during the day for example
and then using the surge when you
workout which is rather convenient it's
nearly the perfect application with the
options to track your diet water
consumption and even providing you with
challenges that you can use to invite
your friends - my biggest complaint with
the software have mainly to do with how
little you can do with the surge and
adding more information all these
challenges like sleep tracking options
and by adoptions are cool but you can't
really control any of that from the
surge forcing you to use the application
fairly often and then my most important
complaint is that this is probably one
of the biggest walled gardens in history
but it really wants you invested in
their products so much so that you can't
really sync your data with Google fit or
Apple's health services and fit that
it's clear on not planning to support
them either again it's not that these
services are bad on the contrary they're
really really good but just be warned
that once you buy into this ecosystem
you're here to stay
overall oh shah d and i agree that even
though this Fitness watch isn't perfect
in things like heart rate readings it's
definitely one of the most unique and
complete products in its category
at $250 the search matches an average
price for most garments and polar's but
you'll struggle to find any of these at
this price that are able to match the
benefits of both watch brands in just
one product as the Fitbit search does
the minute you unbox the surge and read
the motivational phrase you'll
understand that this product was
designed as a very powerful tool for
people who take fitness seriously and
from our experience we do recommend it
folks this is episode 2 of PocketNow
fitness and we intend to bring many more
of these so be sure to suggest more
