xperia smartphones in a smart band
samsung's new tablet lineup with full
names but also a really cool UI and if
you wanted a new pebble you've got a new
pebble i'm high memory that I and I've
got this pebble first generation for
sale for any of you interested I want to
buy my pebble steel this is pocket now
daily let's go stay off with some
official news as sony has just unveiled
three new products at CES focus in the
United States market first of all we get
the Sony Xperia z1 compact which is
pretty much the z1 only at a smaller
chassis pretty much like the z1 F and
speaking of the z1 F we do get the z1s
but it's focused on t-mobile and for
some reason it's made out of plastic
because apparently t-mobile aspera it
that way but we also get this smart band
which is sort of like a Nike you know
fitness bandits focused on business
mainly because Sony already makes a
SmartWatch but hopefully we'll be
getting these things in the pocket now
lads very soon to tell you how good they
are or not now let's talk about Samsung
as the company is just announced for new
tablets at CES and I am NOT going to
twist my tongue trying to give you all
the names we've got the samsung galaxy
tab pro 8.4 and then we've got the
samsung galaxy note pro 12 dot too aside
from other tablets man these names are
just crazy but the tablets actually
aren't we have been testing these on the
show floor and they've behaved actually
very well for what they are we've got a
lot of errands of these tablets as well
so we can expect these tablets in the US
market very soon now one of the reasons
why these tablets are cool really
deserve the separate segment Samsung has
completely revamp the whole TouchWiz UI
up to the point where actually liking
what they've done they're taking
advantage of the full real estate of the
display and doing more than just multi
window support we got loading windows
we've got different ambiences it is a
really smart you why that we like and
the reason why deserves its full segment
is because we've got new rumors that
this is coming to the smartphone lineup
as well so I do believe this is
something we can expect for the Samsung
Galaxy s5 stay tuned we did really like
it links the description for the full
videos now a company that hasn't made
any headlines at CES but that will very
soon as Motorola's the company has just
sent out presentations for an event to
have
on january fourteenth in europe and
according to the teaser what they're
saying is that because of the success of
the Moto G they want to build on that so
we are expecting for the Moto X and some
sort of variant to launch in the
European market and hopefully bring the
whole boat or make your thing and
everything so stay tuned for that that
should happen very soon though we are
hoping for another phone I mean why not
and finally for the hot news of the day
pebble has just launched their new
pebble steel this is pretty much the
company that's made wearables popular
ever since the beginning of last year
and they you see us again to launch
their new product and I'll be honest
with you this design does not look geeky
it looks very very elegant it'll be
retailing on January 28 for 250 bucks
which is kind of steep but anyways that
leads me to the question of the day what
would you pay for this watch I mean do
you think the two hundred fifty dollars
is good for this new pebble steel in my
particular case honestly I do like my
pebble I don't feel that it's too geeky
but I would like something like the
steel up to the point where I'm willing
to buy it for that price i would pay for
the extra elegance plus the added
benefits i do find two hundred fifty
dollars to be fair but leave us a
comment down below what do you think
about the price and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
