Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich hasn't
been available for that long in fact
it's been available in the AOSP that
Android open source project for even
shorter than that
now the AOSP for those of you who don't
know or those who want a reminder is the
open source repository of where people
developers you know you or me can go out
and grab a copy of the source code of
Android and cook on her own rom for
whatever device we want we can put in
our own bells and whistles and features
take anything out that we don't want
really kind of a cool idea
one of the biggest rom makers out there
is CyanogenMod now the CyanogenMod team
puts together all kinds of different
roms for all kinds of different hardware
but the one that they don't have yet is
Ice Cream Sandwich in a tweet from
cyanogen himself he said that they had
the code they were starting work and to
check back in a couple months well it
hasn't been a couple months yet but I'm
interested to see what their progress is
I think you would be too let's go take a
look
this is the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
specifically the GSM variety which right
now is running Android version 4.0 point
1 well for everybody else some people
have gotten a four point zero point two
update but that's about it
4:03 is available but the update for the
Nexus X was pulled while Google works on
some things with battery life and and
whatnot
so right now on this device I'm running
android 4.0.3 and CyanogenMod 9 a very
very early pre-release now a couple
things to note
officially the Galaxy Nexus is not a
supported device not yet anyway it
probably will be in fact it'll probably
be the first device once cm9 is released
but for now we just have someone in this
case gyro skank what kind of a name is
that who's put together a custom rom
based on that and it's essentially just
something that he compiled for the
Galaxy Nexus now let's go ahead and take
a look first of all you're gonna notice
it looks just like everything else that
you've seen before same launcher same
everything it looks like what you'd
expect same widget behavior same app
behavior it's just the same thing you'll
notice it a little bit of the lag that
some of you mentioned before is gone now
I run a widget heavy 5 screen device so
that explains a little bit of the the
delay that some of you have mentioned in
previous videos but most of that is gone
here it also folder heavy as well but
let's go ahead and take a look we showed
you the launch already now this launcher
is not the stock launch or even though
it looks like it it's based on the stock
launcher but it's not let's go ahead and
look at some settings if we come in here
the first thing that you're gonna notice
is I've got my really cool little quick
power menu up here where I can turn on
and off Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS and sound
that's not there on stock Android it's
something that the CyanogenMod team is
cooked in let's go into settings open
that up now everything here looks pretty
much the same let's check down here
really fast so you can see this is in
fact Android 4.0.3
and we are running three points 0.8
CyanogenMod as our colonel our mod
version is nine point zero point zero RC
zero g and king all kinds of fun their
build number for those of you who want
to know is IML 74 k so go back really
quick and look at some stuff that isn't
the same so like I said everything else
in here pretty much the same until we
get into this let's go into trebuchet
first and foremost trebuchet is
CyanogenMod custom launcher it lets you
do a bunch of stuff that you can't do in
the regular launcher so kind of cool
copyright to 2012 which is kind of cool
because it was written in the future
apparently but that was the launcher
that we're running and it's also the
launcher that's gonna come stock with
cyanogen mod 9 go into homescreen here
and we can set all kinds of cool things
home screens how many do you want
do you want one do you want seven I'm
kind of happy with the stock 5 so we'll
leave it there if you use less home
screens set it to a lower number if you
use more set it to a higher number you
have that flexibility with the trebuchet
launcher we'll cancel that now as a side
note trebuchet is not available in the
market you must have Android 4.0.3 to
run it at least in the current iteration
based on the research I've done so if
you want to head to the market and just
download and install this can't do that
just yet maybe in the future but not
just yet default home screen now since
you can have lots of home screens which
one do you want to be the home screen
the default one that it goes back to
when you hit the home button well you
can set that from 1 to 5 because I've
only got 5 right now you could go
further up to 7 if you had 7 screens but
right there in the middle is where I
like it that way I have an equal number
on both sides search bar you can get rid
of that persistent search bar with just
a checkbox very simple very nice you can
resize any widget this is a carry over
from older CyanogenMod which are really
kind of cool you can resize any widget
if you've got a widget that's taking up
too much space it's taking up say 4 by 1
and it really only needs 3 by 1 now you
can do that simply by enabling that it
is turned off by default but head here
check that you're done
scroll wallpaper you can either scroll
the wallpaper when scrolling home
screens or not if you turn that off
you're going to get a little bit better
performance but you're not going to be
able to have as much of a wide screen
experience for your wallpapers some
people like that some people don't it's
up to you and now you can change that
right there in the home treated settings
for trebuchet the page indicator you can
turn that on or off and you can have it
fade out when you don't need it I'll go
back and show you that in just a minute
let's go back to some more settings the
drawer has essentially the same types of
settings regarding the the page
indicator so you can know how many pages
you have to look at and where you are in
relation to the other pages you can also
join the widgets with the apps which is
the stock behavior of the default
watcher where once you get to the end of
your apps just swiping over to the left
will give you your widgets and vice
versa let's go and look at the dock dock
does nothing yet icons does nothing yet
and general you can tell it to auto
rotate the screen so not an awful lot
and go ahead and look at the copyright
which does nothing yet so still very
obviously a work in progress things that
have not been wired up or are not
complete yet but its progress and
there's still a lot of cool stuff that
you can do up here with the home screen
and the drawer let's go back now out of
the launcher and again it's called
trebuchet and into the CyanogenMod
settings open that up and the first
thing that you're going to notice is
this is restyled to look very Ice Cream
Sandwich like complete with the tabs
across the top that you can swipe
between now you're going to notice here
I've got a zero on application I'm going
to have application settings in here
eventually they don't have anything
wired up yet but there's a placeholder
there for you over on display we can
tweak the automatic backlight I've got
that set to on to help kind of level out
the the backlighting based on the
ambient light sensor you can go in and
make custom changes to that and just
really optimize that to however you want
it I go with the default light enable it
and then I hit this allow light decrease
and that does everything that I need and
I like it and it's great you might want
something different and that's
entirely up to you over on input another
placeholder interface we can turn on and
off the notification tower widget that's
this guy up here very simply the lock
screen no settings yet performance no
settings yet sound system tablet no
settings yet so that's that's pretty
much where we are so it looks like
there's not an awful lot done but let's
look at what well let's look at one more
thing first we're talking about one more
thing
recently on pocketnow.com we've told you
about the new music app and I'll come
over here to show you just there's music
this is the market music app which is
not to be confused with the Android
music app they're both made by Google
but this one lets you connect to Google
music in the cloud and listen to your
cloud music lets you do a lot of that
kind of stuff the Android music app
doesn't let you do that there's no
public API out there yet for developers
to hook into to enable third-party music
players to do it but it's still that
amber a music app that comes on all the
devices that well it really hasn't been
great in fact it's been one of my
biggest complaints about Android is
there's no good music app CyanogenMod is
changing that they've taken the stock
Android music app and they've added a
whole bunch of cool stuff if you missed
that article head back over to
pocketnow.com and read it it's really
cool I'd love to show that to you but it
hasn't made it into a nightly build of
the the source code for CyanogenMod yet
so I can't show hands on to you but just
know that it's coming and it's there and
it's really kind of cool and hopefully
Google will open up an API so that
people can listen to their Google music
from the cloud in their Android music
player on their Android that's just kind
of a hope so there we go now I told you
that I was going to show you the the
paging you can see down here at the
bottom I've got this little bar
separating my icons from my tray and you
can see the little screen indicator here
on the bottom that is just a nice Ice
Cream Sandwich blue that fades in and
then fades out so I know where I am so
really kind of nice you know bike it
quite a bit
if you don't like it turn it off you've
got that capability now so back to what
I was saying I've just shown you
everything that's not available in
CyanogenMod yet or what's kind of
stubbed out with placeholders and
there's an awful lot that's not there
what is there well this is my daily
driver which is unusual for a
pre-release non-official not even a
nightly build it's just amazing
this has speed in fact running quadrant
this benchmarks about 1700 1750 which is
about 200 points faster than stock so
it's a faster rom second it's a little
bit smoother of course it's Ice Cream
Sandwich 4.0.3 so I've got some newer
things for example if you look at my
talk icon down here you'll notice it's a
little bit different it's square there's
a little bit of different tweaks to the
Google Apps or the gaps as they're
sometimes called Bluetooth works Wi-Fi
works HSPA+ works the screen works
streaming works sound works the phone
works everything on this that I have
been able to check works which is
unusual like I was saying for a
pre-release not ready not fully cooked
ROM most of the time you're going to
have stuff that doesn't you know your
GPS which does work by the way might not
work or Bluetooth might not or maybe
even the phone which is really kind of
frustrating for people who want to try
out these these new roms but not
everything is ready to go well in this
one it is you can take this flash it on
your device and should be thoroughly
pleased with it except for the stuff
that's not done yet like I was
mentioning this is my daily driver I am
happy and running this very early
release of CyanogenMod 9 even though
it's not officially supported or not
even an official build for it I love it
it's great and I think you will too if
you want to get this on your phone
you're going to need to om unlock your
device you're going to need to root your
device install a custom recovery ROM
wipe everything by the way when you om
unlock that'll wipe your whole device
just FYI
you're warned go ahead and wipe and then
flash this rom and that's pretty much it
you're done you do need to get the
google apps the gapps package as well it
does not come with the rom which is
traditional for CyanogenMod roms so just
keep that in mind all those links are
going to be available over at
pocketnow.com and the article associated
with this first look at CyanogenMod 9
for the google nexus or the Galaxy Nexus
rather so if you want to see how to do
that head on over there if you like
seeing this kind of stuff and give the
video a big thumbs up so you and all of
your friends know about that if you have
any comments or questions leave those
down at the bottom and of course make
sure you subscribe to our video channel
so you don't miss out on cool stuff like
this in the future and of course the
progress of CyanogenMod as it gets
closer and closer to release for pocket
now showing off CyanogenMod 9 Ice Cream
Sandwich for the Galaxy Nexus GSM I'm
