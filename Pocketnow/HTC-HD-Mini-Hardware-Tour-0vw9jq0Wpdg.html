pocket now calm and this is the hardware
tour of the HTC HD Mini HDC likes to say
that the HD Mini is like a mini HD two
but if you put the devices side by side
they really bear no resemblance the only
similarity that I can come up with is
that they both have a glass multi-touch
capacitive screen which is a first for
windows mobile no other windows mobile
device that you can buy right now except
for these two have the multi-touch
capacitive display beyond that they're
very different devices they're different
thickness they look very different on
the back the software is even quite
different as we're going to see in
another video now let's take a look at
the HD Mini next to a business card so
it is about the same height as a
business card let's look at it next to
the palm pixi which is a very small
device if you've ever held one it's
about the same tallness here and in
terms of thickness they're about the
same thickness although the HD Mini is
not it doesn't feel that thin in hand I
think because it's so short and not very
wide so let's zoom in to the top and see
what we have here in terms of hardware
the screen is completely flush as
mentioned it is glass so if i get a
metal object you can hear that it is
glass unlike other HTC devices or other
windows phones which have resistive
touchscreens the screen is 3.2 inches
diagonal with a very weird screen
resolution 480 down and 320 across
that's hvga we're going to take a look
in another video of how third-party apps
work for hvga because windows mobile
doesn't really support this resolution
it's very strange that HTC went with it
going down we have some very flat
buttons that use capacitive touch to
register button presses we have call
start call end home start menu which
will open up the programs and back these
are the identical buttons that you get
on the hd2 that's really the only
similarity beyond the the screen type
that I can think of over here on the
side we have a chrome volume rocker just
like we have this chrome strip along the
top very high quality looking we got
we've got a kind of chiseled edge here
it's hard to tell
but it helps a little bit to make the
device feel thin on the bottom year we
have a microSD connector for charging
and syncing plus a volume or a
microphone i should say over on the left
nothing on this side and on the top
we've got a weird-looking a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack but normal
headphones will fit in there just fine
so to take off the back battery cover
you have to actually jam your fingernail
in this area and we looked at this in
the unboxing you get this really awesome
looking yellow space back here with a
very cool looking chiseled look with all
the screws and all the different
components something that we really
don't see on most devices something very
strange is that the HD mini does not
come with an expansion card most recent
HTC devices have come with at least a
two gigabyte microSD card but in this
case nothing is there so I'm going to
put that back on and it's also strange i
should mention on how you can actually
see the piece of glass that sits on top
of the screen i found so far that
pocket-lint likes to collect over here
because of this interesting case design
so something you want to watch out for
if you're considering getting this
device so all in all thanks to the
rubbery coating on the back of the small
size the HD mini feels very secure in
hand it looks nice it has a very modern
design also a kind of industrial design
back here and by the way here is the
speaker grille and the 5 megapixel
camera but it doesn't feel or look like
anything that you would spot from across
the room for example on the hd2 if you
had that out on a table someone would
come up and say wow what is that thing
but for the HD Mini it's kind of an
ordinary device but then again it's a
lot less expensive than the hd2 it's
about four hundred and twenty-five
dollars you can get one out clove coat
UK which is a lot less than some of the
higher-end devices so it's not intended
to be a showstopper and amazing device
it's supposed to bring forth some of the
features from the hd2 into a smaller
form factor in the next video we're
going to talk about soft floor to see
exactly how the HD mini brings forward
some of these features that you find on
the hd2 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
