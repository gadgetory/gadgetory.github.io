pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour of the HTC HD Mini HDC likes to say
that the HD Mini is like a mini HD too
but if you put the devices side-by-side
they really bear no resemblance the only
similarity that I can come up with is
that they both have a glass multi-touch
capacitive screen which is a first for
Windows Mobile no other windows mobile
device that you can buy right now except
for these two have the multi-touch
capacitive display beyond that they're
very different devices they're different
thickness they look very different on
the back the software is even quite
different as we're going to see in
another video
now let's take a look at the HD mini
next to a business card so it is about
the same height as a business card now
let's look at it next to the palm pixi
which is a very small device if you've
ever held one it's about the same
tallness here and in terms of thickness
they're about the same thickness
although the HD Mini is not it doesn't
feel that thin in hand I think because
it's so short and not very wide so let's
zoom in to the top and see what we have
here in terms of hardware the screen is
completely flush as mentioned it is
glass so if I get a metal object you can
hear that it is glass unlike other HTC
devices or other windows phones which
have resistive touchscreens the screen
is 3.2 inches diagonal with a very weird
screen resolution 480 down and 320
across that's HVGA
we're going to take a look in another
video of how third-party apps work for
HVGA because Windows Mobile doesn't
really support this resolution it's very
strange that HTC went with it going down
we have some very flat buttons that use
a capacitive touch to register button
presses we have call start call end home
start menu which will open up the
programs and back these are the
identical buttons that you get on the
hd2 that's really the only similarity
beyond the the screen type that I can
think of over here on the side we have a
Chrome volume rocker just like we have
this Chrome to strip along the top very
high quality looking we got we've got a
kind of chiseled edge here it's hard to
tell
but it helps a little bit to make the
device feel thin on the bottom year we
have a microSD connector for charging
and syncing plus a volume or a
microphone I should say over on the left
nothing on this side and on the top
we've got a weird-looking 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack but normal headphones
will fit in there just fine so to take
off the back battery cover you have to
actually Jam your fingernail in this
area and we looked at this in the
unboxing you get this really awesome
looking yellow space back here with a
very cool looking chiseled look with all
the screws and all the different
components something that we really
don't see on most devices something very
strange is that the HD Mini does not
come with an expansion card most recent
HTC devices have come with at least a 2
gigabyte microSD card but in this case
nothing is there so we're gonna put that
back on and it's also strange I should
mention on how you can actually see the
piece of glass that sits on top of the
screen I found so far that pocket-lint
likes to collect over here because of
this interesting case design so
something you want to watch out for if
you're considering getting this device
so all in all thanks to the rubbery
coating on the back of the small size
the HD Mini feels very secure in hand it
looks nice it has a very modern design
and also a kind of an industrial design
back here and by the way here is the
speaker grille and the 5 megapixel
camera but it doesn't feel or look like
anything that you would spot from across
the room for example on the HD 2 if you
had that out on a table someone would
come up and say wow what is that thing
but for the HD Mini it's kind of an
ordinary device but then again it's a
lot less expensive than the HD 2 it's
about four hundred and twenty-five
dollars you can get one at clove code UK
which is a lot less than some of the
higher-end devices so it's not intended
to be a show stopper and amazing device
it's supposed to bring forth some of the
features from the HD 2 into a smaller
form factor in the next video we're
going to talk about software to see
exactly how the HD mini brings forward
some of these features that you find on
the HD 2 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
