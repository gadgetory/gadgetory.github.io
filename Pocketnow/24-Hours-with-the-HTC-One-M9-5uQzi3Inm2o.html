kicking off the spring season with a
smartphone called the one end for the
third year in a row it's an aluminum
powerhouse built to make the world take
notice I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow
and this is our hands-on and first look
at the HTC One m9 HTC cited the Porsche
as inspiration for the m9 industrial
design saying it wanted to strike a
balance between the precision look of
the m7 and the ergonomic feel of the m8
while the curves of the latter remain
there's definitely more of the m7 in the
new phones feel in hand the sides and
back meet in a sharp corner a little too
sharp as far as my palms are concerned
and they're visually separated by a dual
finished construction that leaves the
sides chromed and glossy while the back
retains the familiar hairline finish
fortunately for those who found the m8
too slippery the m9 sports a more grippy
satin coating and that combined with the
thicker sides makes it a bit easier to
keep hold of the overall design is very
familiar the new single piece
polycarbonate bezel frames a Full HD
display of the same size and
construction as last year flanked by
improved boom sound speakers top and
bottom like the m8 the m9 is rated IP x3
for the occasional fresh water splash
and also like the m8 it comes in several
colors with an added emphasis on gold
for 2015 unlike its predecessor the m9
finally mercifully moves the power
standby key from the top of the phone to
the side and gives it a textured finish
to better differentiate it from the
volume keys above it's mounted a little
low for my taste but at least it's not
on the out of reach top edge anymore
beneath the casing the m9 gets a sizable
boost in specs - a Snapdragon 810
processor backed up by three gigs of RAM
the 32 gigs of storage and microSD
expansion all of it powered by a 2,840
milliamp hour embedded battery
that hardware stack powers the latest
provision of HTC's interface sense seven
running atop Android lollipop HTC
brought us to Barcelona to try out the
one m9 for 24 hours and during that
entire period I found it nearly
impossible to trip up the software like
Sense 6 before it 7 is responsive to a
fault and while it looks about the same
it comes packing more than a few new
features the most obvious is the smart
launcher part of HTC's effort to make
the m9 more personal and in its words
break out of the 80s desktop model of
the app drawer it does this by
predicting what apps you are likely to
need based on the time of day and your
location and displaying only those
titles it thinks might be helpful at the
moment it also brings a dedicated folder
for downloads and a suggested apps
folder as well both smart ideas but I
worry about the potential of the latter
to someday push apps BAM HTC is also
making more use of the lockscreen
partnering with Yelp to push restaurant
suggestions at mealtimes and also
offering up a curated newsletter once a
day called the morning bundle will see
if all this ends up being more useful or
more intrusive in our full review
probably the most significant upgrade to
the new version of Sense is the addition
of customization options that make the
one m9 the most tweakable HTC phone ever
trim colors icon shapes keyboard look
you can all be customized either
manually or via downloaded packages with
themes ranging from the professionally
designed to the community sourced you
can manually build your own as well and
if that feels like too much work you can
always let the phone build its own theme
by extrapolating colors from a photo a
pretty neat trick even if it's one we've
seen before and speaking of things we've
seen before HTC has also finally brought
a fourth button option to the home Kiro
since the m9 is still a pretty tall
phone I use it to trigger the
notification tray so I don't have to
stretch my thumb as often
finally with this year's camera HTC
addresses one of the biggest criticisms
of the one m8 and the m7 before it
resolution the new shooter uses a 20
megapixel sensor capable of 4k video
recording with an optics module that
protrudes slightly from the phone's
casing
regrettably despite that protrusion
there is no optical stabilization here
but at least the cover glass is now
sapphire so you're less likely to
scratch it the viewfinder and the whole
shooting experience is very familiar an
HTC has shifted its software focus from
cutesy tricks to well more fun cutesy
tricks I haven't even begun scratching
the surface of the possibilities here
and I'm looking forward to mixing the
conventional with the absurd as I fully
explore the new camera software for
selfies you've got the ultra pixel
sensor back the same 4 megapixel unit
that was formerly on the back of the
phone now at the front and living up to
its reputation for lighting things right
up in dim environments by the way all
these photos front and back were shot
using non-final software so we're not
gonna pass final judgment on the camera
until we get a proper review sample
which we expect soon for more
impressions on everything from call
quality to battery life stay tuned for
that full review coming soon and
PocketNow the HTC One m9 begins its
global rollout in mid-march
and it'll eventually be available on all
four US carriers pricing is unannounced
thus far but HTC tells us to expect it
to fall in line with other flagship
smartphones for more from HTC at MWC
2015 including the new dot view case and
the company's first wearable check the
