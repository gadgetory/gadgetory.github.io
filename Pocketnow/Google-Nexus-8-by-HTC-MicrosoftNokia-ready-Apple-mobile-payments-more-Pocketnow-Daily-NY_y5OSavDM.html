rumor mill Apple hiring experts to focus
on a new mobile payment system and the
microsoft nokia deal is pretty much set
for next week I'm hi Mary betta and
would it be cool if companies would
share a little money after these deals
happen I mean we have been nokia valued
customers heavenly this is parking out
daily let's talk day off with some
official news as those of you interested
in the whole microsoft notegive deal
happening well it apparently is ready to
happen next week and even more
interesting we've been waiting for this
to happen for the last couple of weeks
government regulations for holding it
back but if you thought that Nokia was
going to remain as a name apparently it
won't apparently it'll be called
Microsoft mobile leave us a comment and
tell us what you think I mean why didn't
they keep the Nokia name for those of
you that like Google's hangout services
and applications well the company has
just updated their Android application
that is a more functional and now
integrates SMS messaging and it actually
does it right this would be the first
service that actually gets it right
because in the past we've tried that
with Facebook and it's been terrible now
obviously Google Hangouts is not the
preferred service for a lot of people
and if X to wonder exactly why for me
it's so confusing and I wish I could
just have multiple accounts on the same
feet and stuff and I don't know and
moving away from google just like
Motorola moved away when it was acquired
by Lenovo you thought that the Moto
branding and smartphones were done but
they aren't we've got rumors of a moto e
coming and apparently the smartphone is
ranged in the 230 dollar range though we
don't have any specific details on what
to expect on this phone carolee we're
also waiting on a moto G LTE no price
points yet and even a moto G Ferrari
edition which I don't know exactly what
war but stay tuned for those of you that
are interested in more moto phones
they're coming now probably the hottest
news today was the fact that bitch Times
reports from supply chain rumors that
apparently HTC will be building a nexus
8 for Google and these rumors were long
gone we thought they weren't going to
happen but apparently they're coming
back apparently we are waiting for a
nexus 8 to come from google and
apparently yes hcc will be the maker we
don't know if it'll bring boom sound or
anything
but other rumors point that this could
probably be just a google edition tablet
that HTC will probably make the HTC has
claimed that they won't be coming back
to the tablet market these are kind of
odd rumors not sure what to expect so
stay tuned that would be a cool tablet
and finally for the interesting news of
the day rumors have it that Apple is
hiring and it's hiring executives that
are experts in mobile payment systems
this is very interesting as a first of
all Apple has been totally reluctant to
adopt NFC Apple has been totally
reluctant to adopt any sort of mobile
payment system but apparently the
company is working on bringing this
integration with its iTunes database
your credit cards etc and obviously they
need some experts to figure that out we
have rumors that the iphone 6 will
include NFC and even the iWatch which
these are other rumors that we'll talk
about tomorrow but you know that leaves
you the question of the day do you use
mobile payment systems and your current
phone is that something that you
actually look forward to or is that a
deal breaker for you not to buy a phone
in my particular case I'd never used
them and I've never actually seen
anybody use these things on best buyer
anywhere every time that I've traveled
so you know it's really interesting I
mean what could a palang to do here but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
if you want to get the news earlier
before this video was filmed she follow
us on talking out comment subscribe to
our YouTube channel as well it also
follow me on twitter hein underscore

if you liked what you saw I am hi Mary
better thank you very much for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
