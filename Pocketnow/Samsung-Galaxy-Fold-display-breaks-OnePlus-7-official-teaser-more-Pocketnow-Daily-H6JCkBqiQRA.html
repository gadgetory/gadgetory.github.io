sold very well in pre registers but
apparently there are major screen issues
Pete loud just posted a teaser for the
one plus seven and it looks like if it's
getting three bears it's possibly and
we've got some information of an iPhone
as eetu after a while but apparently
there is a change in design I'm high
metal Iveta and my Galaxy fold is here I
have not broken it not yet but
apparently that's happening this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals those of you in
the market for Apple products have you
noticed that we're full of deals I mean
right now on Amazon the brand new iPad
air is currently $20 off which I know is
not significant but then for those of
you looking for a 13-inch MacBook Pro I
actually recommend the model without the
touch bar and that one right now is 900
bucks for the entry-level model that's
kind of crazy you learn want a
description now let's talk about Apple
and Qualcomm I seriously decided not to
cover any more of the legal drama
between these two companies because it
was getting boring now we get notified
that the legal battles are over that
well it seems that they're making up no
more legal disputes but it seems that
there's a reason for it starting with
the fact that Qualcomm is going to be
providing 5g modems for Apple as it's
20/20 meaning that the whole race for
Intel to do 5g modems is pretty much
kaput I have to reckon it's actually
very difficult everything that Qualcomm
has been doing over the last couple of
years to get 5g to where it is it makes
sense you know so hopefully that keeps
iPhones at the same price though now
let's move the spotlight over to the
iPhone se too apparently there will be a
special edition not necessarily this
year there are rumors that it will
happen next year but I believe it's
gonna be this year just because of how
sales are for Apple it's apparently the
rumors are that the design is going to
be similar to what we saw with the
iPhone 6 4.7 inch display touch ID but
we will be getting that a 13 chip
hopefully a great price tag as well the
rumors are that it's not gonna be like
the iPhone se and price tag around it'll
be around 700 bucks which is kind of
crazy but we'll see now let's move the
spotlight over to Pete Lau oneplus and
what we've got separate room
there are three units we heard yesterday
that it might just be one others that
it's to Pete just teased in Twitter that
we should expect something very fast and
smooth that apparently it's harder to
make a smooth product than it is to make
a fast one so I wonder exactly what that
means we'll see very soon
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy fold
as we've got separate news on the first
day that seems that the products sold
really well during pre-orders which for
me is shocking given the 1980 dollar
price tag but obviously there are early
adopters and this is really cool
technology but it hasn't really been
cool for up to four people on Twitter
marques Brownlee and mark gremlin who
were both with me in the pre-brief
they're having issues with their device
in certain cases it's been because you
know yesterday I saw that this had
something like a I don't know screen
protector and I was like I'm not gonna
peel it off because where am I gonna get
a replacement it turns out that after
they peeled it that's when they started
having issues but then there are other
cases like in the case of eater bone
where his product just stopped working
and there's another case in CNBC where
it's the same thing so definitely there
are seem to be problems our unit is fine
so far expect more videos coming soon
let us know in the comments down below I
mean what do you think obviously over
both things the good sales and the
current results that are happening in my
case you know that obviously being an
early adopter to any product has its
difficulties you just I'm sure that you
could just call Sam saying get a
replacement I mean you're with him the
14 day period but yeah I hope that they
offer some extended warranty or
something because we don't know how this
is gonna leave us a comment down below
