questions we get on social media is what
spart watch should you get this holiday
season and this is a rather interesting
topic particularly because smartwatches
are still in their infancy they're not
necessarily great products but then
again some of them are extremely
compelling for what they can do so we're
going to try to help you out with this
video pick the best one I'm hi Natalie
better with pocket now here with a quick
count to choose the best SmartWatch for
you this holiday season there are two
very important questions when choosing a
SmartWatch number one the platform
because not all smartwatches work with
all smartphones and you actually need
for these to connect so yeah the Apple
watch doesn't work with Android but it's
the opposite case with Android wear for
example but the second and most
important question is what you want the
SmartWatch for one of the biggest
questions I get on Twitter is which
SmartWatch is best for fitness and
you'll be surprised at how few of these
smartwatches actually get fitness right
others are just for notifications for
example so it all depends on your needs
to start Android wear is the honest of
the crowd but that's not necessarily a
bad thing because well if you want
elegant smartwatches Android where it's
got your back the problem is these are
the worst products when it comes to
fitness because most of these just track
you but don't necessarily help you
finish a workout or assist you in any
way or actually serve as a full heart
rate monitor they've got sensors but
that's pretty much it but yeah if you're
out for stylish SmartWatch or something
that looks really good in the dust
notifications really well then hey
you've got the Moto 360 second
generation you've got the LG watch
urbane you've got the huawei watch which
is gorgeous and there are a ton of
options out there when it comes to style
that's the best thing about android
where you can actually pick the one you
want and that fits your needs best when
it comes to design now if you are on a
budget then Android wear also has your
back there are other watches that are
extremely affordable like the azuz send
watch too which is a really nice watch
indeed but also there
affordable and then the good thing about
android where is that hasn't really
changed in the past two years as a
platform per se but when it comes to
hardware and its needs so hey I'm still
using last year's Moto 360 and I'm
really happy with it I feel that I don't
need to upgrade so if you find a good
deal when it comes to last year's
offerings yeah you can also go for that
you'll most likely be good with these
for a good amount of time and the only
problem you'll probably notice is that
yeah you'll have a clunky experience
when it comes to certain aspects of the
operating system particularly hey and
the old moto 360 or in the 1st LG G
watch for example don't go too cheap
with Android wear again if you can
afford a little more and buy something
that's elegant for you and that's going
to last you for a bit then yet spend on
that if you want to live up to your true
inner geek there is no better option
than Samsung's gear offerings that are
based on Tizen and the reason why is
because these are not the best looking
smart watches out there but they're the
ones that can do everything if you want
to make phone calls there's the gear s
and there is the cellular capable gear
s2 but even better is the fact that
number one there is a bevy of
applications that already supports Tizen
for these watches and the other is that
these watches actually bring sensors
that are useful for fitness particularly
if you want to use the gear s2 for a run
you actually can leave your phone at
home and I'm actually talking about the
non-cellular capable watch you can
actually use it for a full run and then
just sync everything you can sync your
music to it you connect your headset to
it and it's actually extremely useful as
a watch on its own without meaning to be
connected to the phone but yes connected
to the phone and can do even more things
these are not the most affordable
watches indeed but they can do a ton of
things and they could do with ton of
things right particularly the gear s2
this is the one we would most recommend
if you want to go all out I mean the
user interface is nice again the apps
are good and the functionality is
actually not bad at all all you have to
do is make up your mind whether you want
the sports very enter the classic and
then you're good to go pretty much now
the king of smartwatches is the Apple
watch but not necessarily for all the
right reasons
did a really good job at marketing the
watch but it's not necessarily the best
looking one are the one that's the most
capable it's still waiting for
application support from developers and
the fact that it's not really selling
well tells you a lot now hey it is
really good for a few things like for
example fitness the Apple watch actually
has its own application that's separate
to the phone that can control your
fitness activities and it also has a
full heart rate sensor as well you can
also sync your music to it and actually
go for a run without the need of a phone
which is a really great option as well
the biggest problem with the Apple watch
is that this is a first generation
product it is clunky in certain things
it can't do other things really well and
the biggest problem is that its hardware
is not the best and it's extremely
overpriced this is actually one of those
products that we would recommend that
unless you find the really good deal for
the sports variant I think it's best for
you to actually wait for the Apple watch
to which could be happening somewhere
around next year particularly for its
price but the best thing about the
SmartWatch market is that there are a
ton of other players out there that are
really good at it like for example
pebble which is one of the pioneers
we've got the pebble time and the pebble
time round which a really good
SmartWatch is when it comes to looks and
when it comes to the notifications but
they're not the best when it comes to
fitness but in the other opposite
direction is Microsoft where they have a
really good fitness wearable with the
Microsoft band too but it's not
necessarily the best when it comes to
other things like looks for example or
feel in the arm but hey if you're
looking for a really good fitness
wearable that's cross-platform then yeah
the Microsoft band who is a good option
and finally you also have other options
from other companies that just dedicate
to this like for example garmin garmin's
vibo lineup is extremely good when it
comes to fitness I would say the best
ones out there but not necessarily great
with other things and then you also have
the Fitbit line about there like for
example in the case of the Fitbit surge
it's not the best smart watch out there
and it doesn't look really well either
but it's really good when it comes to
fitness as well so again it all depends
on what needs you have bottom line I
guess this is the best way to end this
video your needs
determine everything at my personal
experience I could tell you this much
I've been using smart watches for the
past two years and I really can find
myself going a day without them they're
extremely useful if you're able to pick
right if you want good looks there are
good options out there if you want
fitness tracking there are other good
options out there it all depends on your
needs just remember you really don't
need a smart watch but these things are
getting really cool and really useful
over time anyways that's it for this
