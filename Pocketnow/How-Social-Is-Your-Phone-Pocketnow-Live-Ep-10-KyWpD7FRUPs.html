beginning gum face now now we should be
live good morning good afternoon good
evening everybody and welcome to episode
number ten it's been 10 weeks already
it's puckett now live and today's
episode is called how social is your
phone because of all the facebook and
other social read the news this week I
am Anton denied managing editor of
pocket now and I have with me mr.
Brandon minimun editor-in-chief good day
welcome and also with me is mr. Michael
Fisher editorial director no everyone
will be back in the air thank you for
having me good to get to having you back
and I'm gonna just shoot it right back
to you guys let's start with Brandon and
let's kick this thing off alright sounds
good I'm gonna go with Paul hey Paul
unmute your microphone or even do it
sputtering hey I lost pop yeah I think
probably we hope will you suddenly lost
a bit of the ribbon but no problems or
somebody else garnish let's go with
Andrew Oh Andrew how you done good yeah
and you wait where are you from Oh
quakertown quakertown PA yeah nice i can
i can throw my stone up the window and
hit you i'm in my house some quite hit
me but you can try I'm really good at
throwing stones that sliding glass door
behind you just go right you know oh I
feel like we've seen you before I feel
you've been on the live before is not
right Andy yeah yeah good to see you
again I remember your ceiling fan for
some reason it's very spinny um so so
we're going to talk a little bit about a
lot a bit about this facebook home thing
and we just had a roundtable discussion
about it because we're trying to
understand if it's something that we
would use instead of our typical Android
launcher so I guess the first question
is do you have an android phone
yes what do you get Optimus G nice so so
your phone won't be one of the first
that can support it but the optimist
geez got the s4 pro it'll be able to do
it soon do you have a are you running
the stock launcher using something third
party well i'm using a launcher called
action launcher i believe it's called oh
yeah action launcher which i am you
don't leave I video / dead yeah one
other so you're from that you're
familiar with the idea of changing your
home screen I can you can you show it
off and show some of the cool stuff
you've got going on um you know it's a
little different because you know most
launchers are used to having the after
or it actually is then it Scrolls over
this like the list right here well I
mean it's a little different oh and it
also has searched won't wait one button
also has a search button so you can like
search for apps you know if you're lazy
too lazy to go swipe over right now I
mean I don't really messed around with
it too much I just kind of left it as it
is but just kind of the way just out of
the box yeah but you like but you like
it better than what you got from LG yeah
algiers launchers kind of yeah it is
kind of blood did you get your jelly
bean update by the way yeah well
actually I was running a custom rom saw
had it before everybody else did a la
carte AT&amp;amp;T anyways lucky you so so
before I asked my task next question
which was going to be which will be
about facebook home tell me a little bit
about your your usage of facebook do you
use it a lot or not really i do use it a
lot and i do think that facebook home
would be something I would use sometimes
like I wouldn't I would like it if you
know I wasn't all a launcher if they
would just real tight the app because
the app as it is is terrible that's
that's exactly right I was saying the
app is absolutely terrible and all
facebook all the time i think is a
little bit too much it would be cool if
like you get that full screen facebook
experience that immersive facebook
experience but only when you want like
you know when you're when you're in the
bathroom or or whatever whenever you're
checking facebook i mean let's be honest
here yeah I mean you know that's that's
where fish your updates his facebook
status from all the time I know it yeah
clearly yeah um I got well I'm just I
I'm kind of like I'm rereading on this
and I'm very interested in what Andrew
has to say about you know Andrews coming
from the same place we are right Andrew
I mean you're you're running custom roms
you're running custom launchers already
you're not you're outside the target
audience for this for this product so
but it's still somewhat compelling to
you because you use facebook or really
hearing that right yeah I mean the other
thing is I think all those like girls
that like love posting like three
thousand pictures a day of themselves on
the Internet we only really kind of
think only women yes yes of course no go
ahead but anybody else like I just can't
see it being practical that's it didn't
I yeah it's not practical because most
people when they use their phone they're
using their phone for email there you
for calendar for web for Twitter for
facebook a whole variety of things they
use it for a tool for their busy active
life but if you look at some people the
younger young younger generation maybe
13 14 year old i'm going to use i'm
gonna say girls their whole life is is
social it's all about their friends they
don't have jobs they have school and
they have friends and so to immerse them
to make their phone entirely about their
friends would be very compelling but for
the rest of us who have jobs and and
other things we need to get done it's
it's cumbersome it gets in the way of
using our phone as a tool to help us um
you know get get things done so plus i
can't remember the last time i looked at
my phone and said i wish i had more
facebook who said so brenda i have a
counterpoint to your to your point but i
don't want to take away from andrews
time so i'm going to wait until we're
done with andrew and then I want to kind
of
say something sure sure um Andrew what's
the what's the next phone you're gonna
get um eine the HTC one looks pretty
compelling so you know I might jump ship
to that it's just the one like I think I
had expressed this before when you guys
were in a Barcelona and the mwc thing
talking about the camera um is it like
for the megapixels it's just going to be
4 megapixels is that what is it going to
output to or what does the Alpha it too
because that seems like the only logical
conclusion yeah it's uh it's 4
megapixels the dimensions are like 2,800
by 1500 or so yeah citrus 4 megapixels I
mean that's kind of concerning you know
it is better than other 4 megapixel
sensors but if you want to really do
anything to it you're gonna destroy in
like no time at all unless so you can do
anything to it as long as you don't drop
into it well yeah or or unless further
for the one percent of the smartphone
using population that wants to print out
a poster size print of like a 13
megapixel shot you're not gonna be able
to do that on the one but most people
don't do that well I mean you could it
would just look like crap look like crap
right are you are you also considering
the galaxy s4 are you just gonna write
with the rarity of the one nah it's just
I mean I know I said you also like a
hypocrite saying this but it sounds it
looks too much like yesterday it's just
you know I find him weird that they
would just only tweak it a little bit I
mean I guess it works for iphone people
but I don't want the same thing over and
over and over again yeah like have this
conversation once before hey what I then
um well thank you very much Andrew for
joining us we want to be sure we get to
other people but I nothing by Andrew
thank you goodbye co goodnight can I in
a hit you with this i was reading an
article right before we came on because
i didn't have much time to look at the
facebook event yesterday and i think it
was wired who made a really good point
that we talked about before this is not
the but there's not the app for us this
is not the suite for for for tech heads
but so many people use Facebook as the
modern-day AOL like to so many people
facebook is the internet so I I doubt
that many people will call in who are
like that on you know our audience tends
to be quite tech savvy but if there's
anyone out there who who's like so
obsessed with Facebook that that this
thing looks like the most compelling
offering ever I think it would be
awesome to hear from them I think you
should shoot off a flare in your ribbon
like right now well we'll get well maybe
have some Flyers later there's something
that's interesting about facebook home
and I don't think people realize this
and i'm ninety-nine percent sure this is
the case when you download the new
facebook app April twelfth facebook home
and the Facebook app are one so when you
hit your home button you get that prompt
that says will you would you like to use
facebook home as your launcher or
TouchWiz and so this is going to
immediately force so many people just
out of curiosity if nothing else to be
like I wonder what happens when I press
this whoa my whole my whole phone it's a
facebook phone now so they've got that
clever feature of android wear it will
do that on their side to to drive
adoption yeah Michael your turn oh my
turn to Slide something uh sounds
awesome I gotta goodness um I am so
infrequently on of the thing I like I'm
gonna talk to Paul Hunter oh can you
unmute your mic and come on board hello
guys hey Paul how's it going yeah I'm
fine you very well were you calling from
I'm from Germany nice long distance boss
what oh he's so we have a common frame
of reference what kind of phone are you
packing there Paul I've got a nexus 4
and a nexus 7 maybe yes boss go figure
uh what's your what's your status on
this whole Facebook thing is that are
you are you an ardent facebook user or
what not really i'm i use facebook from
time to time just to keep in touch come
on price and some other people
but my main focus is soon with us but
problem especially here Germany is and
that you you cannot make people switch
to do plus if they are facebook already
has the firm humor cantera from getting
a pair I don't know Facebook home is
that so interesting to me but for the
normal user hey if it is ok i wanna jump
in with a question don't mean hi jacket
but if you mentioned google+ if google
plus came out with a google+ launcher
called google+ home would you want
google plus all the time on your home
screen no i don't think so because i
don't agree with the Zuckerberg that
people matters more than apps it's not
the kind I use my phone I need eps I oh
I hit a normal logic I use them effects
on the Nexus 7 and this is a gorgeous
action launcher on my Nexus 4 because I
i always need just one click to open my
arms yeah I I think a lot of us are like
that can we talk for a second about that
people first thing because HTC did it a
long time ago with windows mobile with
their touchflo 3d then then then
Microsoft did it with Windows Phone
people first and now facebook is doing
this thing people first but is that is
that right is that truly representative
of how we use our phone I don't think so
because you see you how HTC does in the
past did in the past and also know
Microsoft Windows Phone or windows
mobile or Windows Phone it sucks I think
it's my opinion yeah yeah
I think the people have on windows phone
yeah definitely is the most visible
modern incarnation of this but yeah like
is that porting an older model to the
experience because I feel like back 10
years ago absolutely when I pick up my
phone yeah I want to i'm picking it up
because i want to talk to a specific
person i'm not exactly i don't think
that's the way we operate anymore i
think we're much more i'm much more
likely to pick up a phone and look and
see what a ton of people are singing me
a about one given thing isn't as there
but the cool thing is these chap hats
this is this is really a great and the
innovative idea i think because that's
right i try to use this perhaps and
what's up and talk but these are all
interrupting the for example if you're
playing a youtube video it stops it
shows to Papa and if you want to go back
it just has to reload the whole clip I I
agree that that's the most compelling
thing and I think a lot of people are
missing that that the chat heads
functionality which allows you to to
hover a person's face on the screen no
matter what apps you're in and you can
continue the conversation and the little
face doesn't go away until you toss it
off the screen and it's got this physics
engine where the head will stick to one
of the edges of the screen it will never
be in the center and if you want to add
more chat heads if you want to have you
know Michael Fisher on on essentially
speed dial so you can chat him anytime
you go into the facebook Messenger at
you tap and hold you say at a new chat
head and his a fancy little face comes
up Oh see that's cool I was wondering
what the deal was I mean because Chad
had nobody is talking about chat heads
people are talking about the name which
is absurd but talking about the
functionality so that that sounds
compelling anytime you can avoid jumping
out of the app you're into go do
something else only to jump back into
the app you're in that's a great thing
that's why things like pop-up video pop
up play on samsung or a good or a good
notion and so forth yeah so it would be
great if Facebook would integrate this
into their messenger that only Facebook
whole button to their messenger because
I used to facebook
a facebook app but well I give Facebook
or Mariah I gonna test it just to have
an opinion mcmorris wise well as a daily
drive on them memory what about the the
HTC first does that Hardware compel you
at all oh that's for your bacon i
thought i need to go for the teens it's
okay yeah maybe is the first smartphone
whatever then would be nice but um as
you guys talked earlier on your round
table hang out of ink and you talk about
the price of the nexus 4 so it becomes
the price i would prefer the nexus 4 and
x HTC first or something like that
that's an interesting conversation
because the the we're gonna have to go
to a new color to sec but that the HTC
purse is interesting because we're
talking out the round table it's one of
like to literally two phones that have
the 4.3 inch high res display 720p not
only that but it has the qualcomm
snapdragon 400 which we've never seen
before and it's probably going to have
performance similar to the s4 pro but
lower power consumption because it's
dual core and i'm hearing these rumors
that on the HTC first you can turn off
the facebook integration and get stock
Android I mean that could be pretty
pretty badass mm-hmm that's not the
thing I'm just saying okay well thank
you for thank you for calling in I
really do appreciate the insights of a
real power user it's not really okay
what I wanted to want to say to them
it's really cool to have these hangouts
with you also to watch them on youtube
because I only a I know I don't have the
time every Friday too
come in but it's just great because
though it's the opportunity to hear
people not professional bloggers
something like that but what is their
opinion how do they use their phones
installed this is a great opportunity
thank you very much thanks man I
appreciate that can say okay that we
gotta take care and I think it's my turn
I made a promise at one point that I
will try to speak with the new people
but I'm looking at the participants
right now and it's those who are quick
on the trigger to click on the link once
we publicize so I'm trying to talk to
you I've always had a thing with duets
and that since our resident duet is not
here I'm going to talk to you Superman
and the pocket now halo Wonder Woman
what's up guys was it are your buns ok
there are muted that we saw muted no
time now now I can hear you how high I
just want to say one thing as our our
previous participant said this is a show
all about you guys and not about us or
our opinions you've had enough of those
throughout the entire week and
editorials news and every piece we
publish or video we we upload so let's
talk about whatever you guys want to
talk about so yeah first of all we are
about the hot topic about a HTC One not
the one I'm sorry about the first
facebook phone we have something
exciting for you guys that you don't see
every day the original facebook phone oh
the cha-cha look at that face yeah I had
I had the utmost pleasure of reviewing
that phone as it Sony is absolutely on
you because we it was me that
practically like recommended this phone
to my girlfriend and and it was because
of your review and now with certainty we
can say please everyone if you get in
touch with this phone ever well we're
getting
that's what it's horrible you need to
get as far as possible from it well he
also had to think about it this way that
that phone was announced in 2011 at the
mwc so the specs are 2011 and even if
you think 2011 that phone was on the low
end of the entire thing so I really has
the nicest physical QWERTY keyboard that
you can get well that's a good keyword
and even even even matter Michael the
roads an editorial or in such defending
the HTC chacha that it actually is a
great phone and really after a year year
and a half days it was a very time
sensitive piece yeah i think i think i
was i was less defending it and more
saying like hey it's not that bad it's
actually kind of cool in this one way
look if has some good ideas but that's
the implementation of the ideas that's
not quite there it's not knowing that
and then and I have like bulletin points
for you last time when I was here I was
your dream on yeah I wasn't really
prepared for this and I was I so over
excited I couldn't say a word right so
the next thing about the HTC first if
someone reviews this phone if someone it
takes it under its wing for example
Brandon this one goes out to you because
um Brandon youth you do one thing often
and and I really want to point out that
to you so you don't do its maybe in the
future ever again so you don't make the
flame wars in the comment section so
huge enough okay well it's about when
you comparing phones 2d iOS devices when
you compare the browser's between two
practically two operating systems you
practically look at the bar that's
filling up and when it's full and
disappears then you practically think
that it's done right right yeah no yeah
but yeah but the iphone the iOS models
do a really nice party trick if you
didn't know
is that they're practically it when when
bars for when it disappears it actually
doesn't doesn't stop loading the page
and if you look at the top left part of
the notification bar I'm rotating SAT is
a circle that indicates that you
actually continue to load lot page so if
you if you ever reviewed okay I'm sorry
so you review the HTC first don't give
it too much smack so to say that if it's
the loading bar doesn't disappear as it
has a Qualcomm S is for processor so it
should it shouldn't be fast Shido had I
don't want to defend Brandon because he
he's a big boy he can defend himself and
I don't know and I don't want to defend
iOS either I just want to say this I've
been using iOS the same way i've been
using all the other platforms for years
now and even though it might be a tricky
thing that Apple does there with the
spinning a circle in the top right
corner actually when the bar has
finished the phone and the page is
usable for scrolling without
checkerboards for chickens you know so
maybe it does some sort of loading into
memory and caching but as far as the
user is concerned the moment that bar
has finished as far as I the user I'm
concerned that page is fully loaded but
web could break the dragon webkit-based
browsers apparently are now out of date
hence the fact that that Google is
looking towards a way that practically
go away from the webkit browser they got
from iOS because it's slow and I always
spectacle II yeah they managed apart to
get the fluent the medicity I'm yet to
find a phone which is faster and
browsing performance that the the iphone
oh come on no to at any time any place
Wow note so really yep Brendan if you
disagree or Michael even my rooted phone
it's the galaxy s2 in with my rooted
phone with a custom wrong
Becky does it faster than the iphone I
don't believe you guys talk about page
load times and you start because like
splitting hairs in terms of seconds
between page load times I just start
every millisecond what I'm talking about
is just that the don't get smacked to
the phone because yeah yeah as far as
the consumerism concerned yeah pages
like loaded and usable but but the thing
is that they both still loading and
that's just the one what I wanted to
point out the the tricky thing is when
you have two phones to compare and
they're totally different operating
systems so you don't have the same thing
to look at is you need something to try
to qualify which is faster and you can
scroll down the page and see which
elements load first but then then that's
not very scientific so the closest thing
we have is progress bars even if they
might not be truly representative of the
usability of the page because every
operating system handles it differently
yeah even the scrolling iphone does a
really nice body to it there too when
you scroll on Android you get a one
flake and you're on the bottom of the
page so you can easily spot these blank
spots if you if you will but yeah the
iphone Brickley restricts you from doing
it so and if I may make the most of it
of these five six minutes that I have
for this famed moment next one goes to
Michael yes sir nicholas so you go sting
the factory where they produce
artificial sapphire you know I have one
question your question for you would you
rather pick a low-end or a mid-range
Huawei with a sapphire display Wow Wow
rate or huh or a high-end phone like the
galaxy s4 or or the iphone 5 for that
matter which we know that I really
easily shattered and n scratch now this
chatter ability is actually
as I know quite bigger on the sapphire
screens is that right right when
sapphire screens it suffers a very
brittle material and so it yeah its
shadow resistance is not the selling
point there it's a scratch resistance
because yeah it's much more brittle and
so will shatter more readily so the
question is what I rather carry
something like a mid-range Huawei but
with a sapphire screen versus a high-end
device with a likes a gorilla glass
display go read last blog my glass I'll
take a tank over a Ferrari I love I love
me some rugged phones I am very hard on
my phones I scratched them up like crazy
that's what she said hey but I and I
also um ah that's a really tough one but
no really oh I would carry a higher end
device just because of my needs but that
is not any that is not to impugn
sapphire at all it's a really cool
material and I need it on my phones but
I wouldn't carry mid-range like a screen
protector right like a sweetie protector
see that's the thing i should have said
this on the piece and I did omit it I
don't like screen protector do you use
them yeah it's actually the thing that
holds my swing together because if you
can see it's it's shattered on the top
and and if I peel off the screen
protector april ionic leap at fallout 2
pieces but the screen isn't attacked i
can see everything is it and the thing
is yeah but what do you think rumors
said that's it samsung galaxy note 3
which i hope will be my next phone that
it will have an unbreakable display what
is that all about maybe its sapphire
maybe it's the elastic know that their
lesson nobody I don't but I don't get
the sense of sapphires production rate
or cost has matured to a point where
it's going to be it's not going to be
sapphire I don't think but yeah then you
always hear this flexible display room
are kind of reemerged on the the note 3
gets discussed and I don't know I mean
to me that's in the same neighborhood as
the as the samsung galaxy s3 will be
able to why
honestly charge 30 feet away it's one of
those rumors that i'm not sure i'm sure
it's a little bit more less baseless
than that but I I think we'll we will
see I I think that that's going to be
compelling but I don't have any
information about it unless unless you
guys do unless there's news i'm missing
Brandon or Johnny oh I i I've been on
vacation for the best buy they so I'm
out of news how was it it was tiring i'm
more tired now at the end of my vacation
that I was for instance last Friday when
I was before my vacation that perfectly
did the word real vacation starts no no
the thing is at work is the place where
you go to relax after a great vacation
that is also true and it's also true
that I spent a lot of time at work and
people once they find out I'm a vacation
everybody wants to meet to go somewhere
to do stuff and it's just too many
people to please you don't have that
kind of stomach right no not at the
moment I'm too old for this ya know but
the last time you was yeah you were
catching breath catching breath after
the gym when you had what yeah and I was
lucky that guy didn't come online to
shame me do you guys have any final
thoughts before we say shame here yep
yeah any final thoughts I just wanted to
ask one question if I say the word what
was it would know okay just keep it
family friendly yeah yeah no not use up
kind of language if I use the word
fragmentation what do you say first of
all yes why because it's reality you
know it's not every operating system out
there is fragmented everyone I actually
think that the better because for
example if you have for example iphone
3gs and you get to latest iOS 6 on it
will you get absolutely the same
functionality on it then on the iphone 5
counterpart you see it's not about the
functional
because it might be missing something
like Siri or stuff like that it's its
effect that a three-year phone is
getting the software update three years
later it's like me I don't know HTC
initial desire getting four point two
point two today which is it doesn't
happen but what do you get with that up
type Justin number of the version well
in case of Android you get super
fluidity with project butter and all the
other in case of Android yes but for
example if you take Windows Phone
Windows Phone practically could do the
same thing as Apple did they which is
women with each new iteration of their
operating systems a promising the same
functionality or at least a margin of it
of for the older phones till the 3gs
practically a Windows Phone could do the
same by calling windows seven point
eight windows 8 because it has the same
home screen practically the same
functionality only the company with some
new games or something like that it's a
chorister de Oro platform is different
but I'm getting your point and Microsoft
had a huge opportunity to to kill
fragmentation at its birth with Windows
Phone because all the updates were
controlled by Microsoft initially and
that's what we were told but I have a
phone which proves that the Microsoft
was wrong i had the initial LG optimus 7
and I I didn't get P 7.8 update an LG
abandon that phone so yeah fragmentation
is there whether we talk about Windows
Phone iOS android windows pcs or Macs
it's the thing that on Android it's more
pregnant and it's more present at the
same time as far as I am concerned but
but the end user chooses to to pick out
the phone that actually fits heats needs
if it feed it just needs a phone to
update the status on facebook or or or I
just take funny pictures on myself or
check in somewhere then this has
gingerbread and it's routed to so you
can take all the bloatware out of it but
it's still for which okay just one
question to plan my point wouldn't you
be happy to run jelly bean on that phone
and two
you have everything run smoother and
faster it wouldn't run smoother and
faster because the rectory jelly bean
has its specification that it needs from
the film too so it's like like with
Windows the minimal requirements so then
then there's your fragmentation but but
that is with every other operating
system to write no the 3gs runs the iOS
6 even though it runs a slower processor
with less ram but not the same
functionality you don't get Siri you
don't get practically the fluidity isn't
there too if we talk about iOS in
particular when you get that 6.21
upgrade it's practically jaggi and laggy
and any other kind of work you can knock
it over I'm not gonna convince you
you're not gonna convince me so this
will come down to what you believe in
what I believe I'm sorry it's just just
last question that was it just just to
get the most of it of my five minutes of
fame sure no problem thank you guys last
person to Tony if I may um will you will
your country get to eurovision song
contest finalists to this year i know i
have no idea i am not looking at those
contests because i think that the
romanian music industry which goes to
these contests is way below the
potential of the music industry which
happens inside the country and goes for
export yeah the same here so thank you
for having us thank you for dropping by
come back next week ok I will be taking
your buyback branding your life of a
nice weight evening you two have a great
weekend it thanks my dear bye how's that
that's very interesting I've been
informed that to my term so therefore
i'm going to choose sin floyd jr. hey
yes did he ain't no one afternoon I'm
will oh thank you thank you Sam had a
good at a good compliment in the chat
before which I am can't find because the
chat is being spammed by a bunch of
entrances and exits what did you say
this is the goofiest hang out you've
been apart yeah really
um my question relates to facebook home
on a 10 inch tablet what in the world is
that supposed to look like because to me
Facebook home is geared towards
one-handed use on a 4.3 inch screen how
they gonna translate that to 10 inches
yeah mama go ahead Oh God you know and I
was going to say where they release it
as well with the special 10 inch tablet
but it did for the facebook home at 4.3
inch foam then your second question I
think is really interesting whether
they'll release accompanying hardware
let's circle back to that what they're
going to have to do is instead of having
these full screen pictures because I
Nexus 10 most pictures that people take
are going to look like crap with all
those you know all that resolution
they're gonna have to do like some sort
of mosaic or some sort of like magazine
display where pictures are kind of
layered or kind of a side-by-side or
something like that um and I really hope
that they do something more with that
screen space then just say like oh here
are two pictures from your feed um what
what I hope that Facebook home does for
tablets is kind of I hope Facebook home
gets big enough to where people like
really wanted and then they think oh if
I can get this on my tablet oh I'm we
have to buy an android tablet and
android tablet sales go up because right
now they're still there they're getting
better but they're nowhere near the ipad
so so so they're gonna have to do some
retooling what do you think about the
hardware do you think they're going to
do a an HTC second um well no personally
speaking I don't I don't see HTC first
sailing all that well and I don't see
Facebook really wanting to go down that
road again with architects tab I don't
see that working most likely they'll use
whatever the the Nexus tablet is at that
point the newest Nexus I think because
they should come out with the new
facebook home around the same time that
tablet the new Nexus 7 will come out so
I would assume that users on that
yeah alright so so are you gonna use
facebook home on your phone uh no all
probably just watch the reviews I'm
sorry to interrupt just a small rent
because it's something I have to say the
way Brandon is obsessed with pixels I am
obsessed with photography and I've seen
a couple of hands on with the HTC first
running the Facebook home and of course
it's an excellent concept as far as I'm
concerned to have those pictures
full-sized on your screen but the
algorithm in which those images which
are landscape are being zoomed in to
fill the entire portraits screen and
make them jaggi and over zoom that's
just plain ugly so that would be
probably the only thing stopping me from
using facebook phone because facebook
home because i like the concept on it i
think comes down to the friends in my
facebook which post interesting content
and i often get rid of those who are not
interested in I'm that's the way I
function but just having those jaggi
images appear on my I don't know notes2
or HTC One that's just horrible so did
you think the man i'm sorry i was going
to say it's going to make your your new
high-end phone with my crap if you do
you think then that the right
implementation would have been to do
something similar to what Google wants
to do what we think they want to do with
Babel and make it more about the
conversation and the things that you can
add to your conversation versus making
it about the pictures and the things you
to add to the pictures so how would that
look if they did make it about the
conversation um I don't know it's a good
question i mean i have no idea what
Babel would look like i was talking
mobile Dom about it about how i think we
need it because we're talking to
fragmentation there's a million
different apps we use just the top of
people available is supposed to get rid
of all that so i think it would just
integrate really well um with all the
other messaging apps but from one app
and if you want to add pictures you can
add pictures and maybe make them full
screen or if you want to do a google
hangout like we're doing now it will be
simple a button press will it make that
possible I think that will be
implemented better than having your
entire screen be full of pictures then
pull a chat head yeah i think i think we
are comparing an application which if i
know well this bubble or babel thing
will be most probably a chat application
with voice video and pictures we're
comparing an app to a basically launcher
replacement what we think that maybe
babel will be very well implemented in
the key lime pie or not well there was
the discussion which guy being
implemented at windows phone 8 and or
not so it might be the same
implementation there there are just too
many chat services it's just and you
know for example that most of them don't
talk to one another like like I message
still is only iphone and and it's it's
really frustrating because what happens
all the time is that when i switch for
my iphone to android i get all these I
messages on my iPad because you have to
change your settings in order for I
messages to stop and go to your phone
and it's just it's just really
frustrating in the hope of the facebook
Messenger thing with the in it has
integration in facebook home with your
SMS which is a step in the right
direction but i don't know i don't think
most people rely on facebook Messenger
it's like if I get a facebook message
it's rare you know oh well I see I think
that goes back to how often you use
Facebook and as an the average user I
would argue random that facebook
Messenger is probably even more
prevalent than email and then text
messaging that's what that was about to
say the all my online communications
which are not my professional
communications with you guys and with
anybody else from my professional life
so all my private conversations and
communication happens on facebook
Messenger yeah I think this goes back to
like people treat modern-day facebook
like they treated AOL and times gone by
and facebook Messenger is the new AOL
instant messenger so I I think it's
critical that that Facebook not only
maintain but enhanced messenger and you
know I think that they're still going to
be able to compete really effectively
against Google's
no matter how good the latter is just
because it's it's so pervasive so many
people use it I love I used to keep
Marik making the AOL comparison because
there's only a takes a pertinent person
of a certain age I guess do it to
appreciate that and the thanks buddy
preciate reminder i'll remember a i did
all of my talking to my friends or a
yeah so what's it to wrap things up some
what phone do you have right now i have
an HTC Sensation 4G nice it's the that
was their flagship of 2011 that is
correct and i remember i was actually
looking at a leaked picture of that I
don't know how I got to it is on XDA and
it was their first dual core phone what
what are you what are you looking at
next I'm trying to saw it between the
note two or three depending on how fast
they can get a note 3 here or the yacht
cs4 I'm a fan of Samsung their their
products worked really well they have
they stand up well to Tom and all the
value-add should get just can't really
be denied they do add a lot of stuff in
there do you think you would use stuff
like the dual camera mode and all of
those other fun features um I probably
play with it but no not usually the
stuff that I like most will be able to
see my messages before I open them and
things of that sort probably while I'd
rather have a note 2 versus the galaxy
s4 but seeing that is seven months old
probably no 3 kind of wish they had put
the the note a release around this time
because a lot of people are concerning
the galaxy s4 but they want to wait for
the note 3 or even the one and the note
3 whether it actually a note 3 i think i
read they're coming out with this
samsung medal or something they're not
going to kill the note brand it's too
strong and maybe
they're going to create another brand of
devices because like the galaxy stuff
they're going to compete with themselves
then with that brand have SPN as well no
I think the S Pen is just for for the
Galaxy Note brand which is tablets and
phablet so unless samsung once a galaxy
fess gaelic galaxy s watch note so i see
many any final questions um no that's
everything thank you guys so much thanks
for coming did you see you again soon
thank you yeah so what does that means
that mean it's my turn their yellow yeah
so I am NOT on the hangouts as often as
some of you guys so can you tell me if
there's anybody in the ribbon that has
not been seen before because I love ya I
can tell you Derek who drove is new yeah
yep Oh once my hovering function now
they starts working again I'm gonna pick
that person here's the one with the
Canadian flag mmm yes ah there we go yes
this is derek yeah good you very well
thank you were you I don't suppose
you're calling from Canada today all
right oh yeah Nova Scotia if you know
where that is i the East Coast really I
sure do actually my girlfriend and I've
been talking about taking a day trip up
to to Nova Scotia not a day trip the
weekend oh never been before but so nice
to hear from him yeah hey what are you
were you working with now my what your
mobile device just so gotta land
citation another say this whole Janice
globalization owners my god yeah you
worse they're worse for me I can't
upgrade to a whole nother year this song
we have a three-year contract so oh the
Canadian three-year conjure them that's
awful i'm sorry at least phones a oh
that good how's the sensation holding up
for you I never owned it but I know it
was a 2011 device right yeah it's not
too bad but like I can't Rudy because
I've been paying like seven months seven
dollars a month for like a like to say
something happen to my phone I get like
a new one order for like
regular something insurance replace oh
if I route it well there that go so yeah
but why did you can restore it though
like on tariff oh yeah to to restore it
to and to remove evidence of software
tempering okay yes okay we're gonna
bring up Brenda cuz Brandon brown is the
expert there he can you can speak err ok
I just wonder do you think the Facebook
would come for like even this phone as
old as it is you think that Facebook
launcher would be compatible what's
guaranteed to happen is that the APK
will be released on XDA and other sites
and you'll get it on any phone but our
performance might not be so hot yeah but
the only thing I really want tries that
snapchat the snap chat head or whatever
head chat bubble they need something
remember oh uh what is it Chet Chet head
I did I didn t memorable i think that's
already cemented itself into the public
discussion that's the youth text message
too or is it just facebook messaging it
does yes it integrates with SMS that's a
rule and you guys in Canada should also
have voiceover of a messenger whoa wait
why is that Tony certain certain
countries certain countries among which
I think Canada the UK and the u.s. have
also voiced calling capabilities through
facebook over existing facebook
Messenger yes I'm sorry yeah yeah yeah
yeah so that's gonna be very interesting
i'm brendan makes a really good point
that i frequently forget when you asked
about an official release i was like i
don't know if they're gonna do it for
that but yeah the APK will be at XDA and
cysts install it try it anyways yeah are
you a heavy facebook user not much like
eye contact a few people over once in a
while but music I just peek added to see
what's up with my people at home because
I'm at university right now so I thought
that was a dorm room behind you that's
not them ya know your side yeah my
college days as Brandon will remind you
where you know decades ago but i still
remember here look like if I don't think
you're old enough to make fun of your
age and you're on my age so I want to do
that to myself no I but it's interesting
like I it is your drive to to use
facebook home morally curiosity or do
you think it's something you would stick
with for a while probably more curiosity
and to have something new because I've
had sent whatever for like the longest
time now so Derek Jeter he pried um have
you tried apex launcher or nova launcher
I've tried those but like the RAM on the
phone can't handle it at all it'll just
free the whole phone constantly have you
tried to hard reset recently to clear
stuff out and try it yeah just an ad I
do it almost every couple months no I
just did it go today what operating
system are you running what do you mean
would operate existent like what what
version of Android I think you told you
like I don't know better check price
rubber dinghy bread right probably
ginger burn know it yeah it's know it's
ice cream sandwich alas no interesting
um if you're if you're tryna get some
more legs out of the phone you could
install like a jelly bean ROM and you
probably did android 4.0 three okay so I
i I'm just going to shamelessly drop in
here because I i feel i'm sensing we are
talking to the first person who is not a
heavy android power user is that is that
true Derek yeah kind of because I was
always worried about my insurance I
light so I couldn't have the choice to
do that kind of stuff so you don't even
care whether you're running
four-point-oh or 4.2 or 4.1 or there are
so many numbers i kind of just forgot
okay that's on the work must be fast
yeah what didn't I don't think you're
making a good point there who Tony yeah
I'm sorry i was i was about to ask you
that if you can in a couple of minutes
just described to me how a regular
non-geek like like me or like us uses an
android phone as his daily driver
basically but for me I just do emails
texts a check Twitter every morning
that's really about it so when you're
launching your your email application
and you're you're checking your statuses
and changing them do you feel that your
phone is slow or do you have a feeling
it could be
faster or it's not not noticeable at all
and you don't care I definitely feel
like it's slow specially cuz i got like
I don't leave that have that many apps
but like I feel like it it's that the
RAM gets overloaded very easily like I
always have under I always have around
100 megabytes or less for ramp left over
and that's just on a date like not using
anything and most I'll have 200 so it's
it's strange dare you say this because I
use a sensation for a while it has 768
megabytes of RAM right yeah mine only
says 500 like that i can use I guess
yeah the operating system is taking over
the rest pens um if you if you are brave
and you this is a good weekend project
install cyanogenmod 10 on your phone
that'll give you back probably a good 50
megabytes of RAM on boot and it will
take out of take out all the heavy
graphical elements and make your phone
significantly faster yeah it's it's it's
challenging to get started if you if
you're willing to do a little bit of
research you know there's there are
tutorials out there they're videos out
there and there's a chance of breaking
your phone but it's relatively low if
you can follow instruction yeah so like
is it is their chance for me them to
track me like oh dad put a custom rom or
whatever on it what do you mean like if
I put cyanogen mod on it can like two
people from bell or whatever track meet
say hey you did this you're in terms of
Ghana as long as you you make sure to
make a backup and to revert if you have
any problems for which I'm sure there's
another jelly by video somewhere yeah
I've watched many of them trying to
figure it all out yeah it's it it's easy
to revert if if you're something happens
you're phoning you need to make a claim
on the insurance you put it back to
stock and you bring on the phone and
they don't know anything would it would
happen would they be able to tell i had
a custom rom and say if I like smash my
screen that can use any more to do all
that stuff you can revert even without
the screen working oh okay yeah and in
other than I mean it carrier I don't
know exactly how paranoid bail is or how
you know i'm gonna die like a pinch but
when i worked at sprint routing was
still a thing I mean people would hack
their phones and we
is the same policies and as long as they
don't have a reason to suspect that you
have done anything to your software
they're not going to question it you
know if you bring it in with either a
shattered screen or a screen that is
running the usual sense rom if you've
taken all your modifications off there
they're gonna just replace it they're
gonna follow their normal what Michael
is saying is if you fry your processor
because you overclocked it and it gets
burned just smash the screen yeah fraud
advice from Hoffman no know what this is
I know is pink so I would say that if
you know it sounds like a fun weekend
project for when you're not you know
Susan party yeah exactly exams are all
this week so yeah treat yourself to a
new rom after exams yeah basically well
any I mean any final thoughts before we
have to uh before we women lon not
really just thank you guys for all your
videos and everything you guys do thanks
a lot really love me a venir up here and
thanks for watching all yeah thank you
so when I am back when I use the
sensation I dropped it in the toilet and
then i sent it to Jaime and I know the
story and he and he referred to it as
the P phone but I told him that it was
not that kind of drop in the toilet um
but then I put it in a bowl of rice
right and I turned it on and it didn't
really get Wi-Fi and the radio didn't
work but then I waited like a month and
then it worked so you know if you drop
your phone in the toilet there is still
a chance that it will be fine yeah I
still remember when when i'ma and I have
met in Barcelona last year and he
brought that since he was like hold on
just I'm gonna mute this person and he
was like a Tony can you see that red dot
there and I know the story of around a
lil is like I know the story I
as this I the sensation I I was so
excited for the sensation was one of the
first ones to go beyond wvga resolution
and it's crazy that two years later were
all the way at 1080p and like two years
from now we'll be at like 8k and and oh
boy mr. Chris Williams he's a new face
to join our hangout please i'll reach
your microphone and tell us a little bit
about you hi yes I like taking pictures
I'm a gamer and uh yeah and my phone I'm
doing right now is a acc Windows Phone
Windows 8 x oh and how do you like that
it's actually kind of good it's a good
phone I really do like it though this
person i'll step towards me and yeah but
I see you have an interesting
combination there is are those beats
your pieces your breasts they are where
they those bundled with the with the
Windows Phone een x no no I have both
inseparably okay what do you want to
talk about yes the ACC one per se good
what do you want to know about it or
what do you want to ask see now uh look
at the quality inn the speed like the
screen quality and everything well i can
tell you i can tell you this much among
all the phones which i have held and
tested the HTC one is in my top two as
far as scream quality is concerned
what's the other one claiming good yeah
okay iphone okay III will agree with
Tony the screen is I I have not seen a
better screen on a phone and I'm usually
an AMOLED guy i usually like those
really over saturated colors and really
deep like off blacks but Talan know it
spits before I haven't seen a better
screen the most delightful thing about
using the one for me or one of them not
be most is changing the wallpaper and
then I change it about once per day just
so I can like turn it on and just marvel
at the detail that the detail that my
eyes can even perceive
because there's so much detail in the
picture it's um the screen just a try
right now so if you are concerned about
the screen it is one of the if not the
best greens on the market at the moment
okay what was the second thing you
wanted to know about the build quality
or well uh the internet and hat like
this speed and you cover that one right
now already in SB and uh well yeah we
have covered that in the review and
correct me Brandon if I'm wrong you got
the international version and you didn't
get the chance to get the maximum out of
your carrier right alright so i can tell
you i'm i'm in europe and i'm using the
international one and i have no problems
it usually maxes out at the max speed of
my carrier which is anywhere between
forty five hundred and sixty nine
hundred the kbps and as far as Wi-Fi sir
this thing is that the fastest build on
Wi-Fi got to do a live Wi-Fi this here
if you stick with me for a second let me
jump your speed test before i'll point
out that the Wi-Fi radio also is capable
of it or two point 11 AC i think it's
the first phone in the world capable of
that standards the first it's the first
phone in the world i just got an AC
router and i've got a video on my camera
showing how redonkulous the Wi-Fi speeds
are on the one over AC you can see it
you get the exact same speeds as if you
were plugged into the router with a
ethernet cable yeah right check this out
oh wow 41 and 41 down this is actually
61,000 down and one 27,000 up and at 127
that's got to be an anomaly right no
actually those are my upload speeds
Chris where are you located a Baltimore
Maryland us okay so yeah so we're gonna
get the carrier variants of the HTC One
and we're gonna either review them where
we're going to cover them in some way so
stay tuned for that because we will be
testing them on the US carrier networks
to see how how well they perform and and
what kind of down and up we get
okay I have a question for you Chris are
you considering the one and if yes why
or are you considering the one and
something else and you're vacillating
between them well actually the one just
the workers that the s4 is a horrible
phone I'm sorry uh like it's like it's
like a mix between the s2 and s3 not s
to my bed the note no joy the s3 and the
nail too yes this is like the same it's
like if you're holding your hand up my
plastic there's nothing but as you said
there's nothing but like it feels like a
cheap phone per se because it's like
this like is we touch you and your hands
like queasy get like smears all over all
over the screen and on the back to and
the sound quality is not isn't actually
gonna do it's not that at all okay
anything anyone tells you want to know
uh that's basically what you want to
talk about yes uh the text in in the ACC
today you're gonna talk to Michael about
the HTC windows phone 8x he's the
windows filming the samsung tablet
galaxy player the worst tablet ever ah I
was at a bar once and I saw a guy with
the galaxy players running the
restaurant audio on it and I was like
really you bought one of those are you
like it is like I actually like a lot of
my okay cool it's awesome but if you
haven't for like more than a year is
horrible oh really you just got see
players are actually a joke by Samsung
but people actually okay let's do a poll
a life poll we have 10 people here and
of course we will vote to those who
agree raise your hands do you still
think that in 2013 there is a need for a
dedicated mp3 / audio player only only
two three four oh my god we had to talk
about this because I see no reason why
such a
I should exist i mean everything can
playback music you don't have you don't
have I see what you're saying I was
gonna say you don't have kids you know
yeah or do you would like we have been
closed after this week who knows we'll
talk again at the next hangout nine
months from now well Chris what uh what
why do you carry a dedicated player
because like okay so I have a phone
that's good music and everything but
like what if the phone dies and you
don't have no music listen to and you
just you have a backup I see what you
did there the same thing I do with my
cameras would it be simpler to carry
like it like a power pack Oh for your
phone so you have everything I mean she
said a Popek yeah see I have this little
charger right here and uh that basically
rest up my phone so I don't use no more
but like this phone is actually been
like almost two weeks now this phone has
she has a good better like I'm serious
like what on a normal day for me it'll
be like charge it i wake up at nine it's
phone is fully charged will I become six
o'clock seven it's like a 45 nine
o'clock ten o'clock is 20 that's not for
you you're not talking about just like
uslike leaving an inner pocket all day
it's just actual right right i was all
you to kill the berry as much as i
kidded that buddy couldn't it's really
cool and so that's always good to you
would love hearing about that I don't
have the EDX I have the Lumia 920 you
know and that doesn't play well yeah i
love the Lumia 920 I'm gonna be wrong
but it doesn't do as well with battery
life I have to charge a pretty
frequently right is it ok Chris do you
have any final closing thoughts
questions or anything you want to talk
about before we say goodbye um I do has
welcomed it though I want to see you vs
vs phoneDog us vs Conor ok that's gonna
be a street fight will win I guarantee
so you have to be more specific hmm what
caught it as in see again as in what uh
what we wouldn't trust isn't like like
what do you want to see how do you want
to see what in what respect do you want
to see us vs 4 that's what I tried to
find out yeah i mean like y'all have
like the best young pickle on the best
topics to talk about is it's actually
kinda good though too because i watch
every single every single episode your
post on YouTube I follow it every song
is your step and you like it work yeah
and Jaime is the person I'm not a magic
I hear right now but uh I mean I just I

really awesome Steph seen that for me
what technique so you know I like stuff
aren't we all that is everything I'm up
to date on everything so yeah I'm like I
have one final question for you yes it's
gonna be a tricky one why Windows Phone
and why not android hmm okay Wow why
Windows Phone 8 and Android because I
would never go apple
sorry okay happens not in the end the
question why did you go with Windows
Phone and not with Android well he has a
galaxy-class I guess what started off
one then you know then in Windows tous
up next I'm emerged you something else I
don't know which would I whichever phone
comes out next I'm go to that one
because I will look you're always
switching them and trying to use all the
platforms whenever your contract expires
for instant right mmm that's when I ask
me that's good so like so like how to
Android and Windows Windows okay normal
logical follow-up question why because
because for when for Android you have
all these apps all these things floating
around in the market tomorrow and you
don't know which was fake which was real
and this one they have all the real at
relapse and everything so as either this
is like turn it all right now head
pocket now like right there parking now
at this right there um oh yeah again and
it's like you probably wouldn't pop
probably wouldn't find it on like
android market at all try to go through
all these setups and everything and then
type search it in so you're saying that
for your normal regular day-to-day use
when the stone is easier simpler yes
okay virus the Beats Audio fair enough
Chris thank you very much for joining us
and hope you come back next week again
okay thank you thank you bye random do
you all right uh um I was just going to
say something about that I forget oh
okay um actually can I ask you a
question real quick go on um have you
dropped your HTC one I have never
dropped any phone in my life all right
are you kidding me bro yeah yeah I'm
that look at my face this is a great
classic Tony moment I believe you it's
my hands got some BS going on on the
Hangout oh you've dropped a phone man I
never dropped phones
I never scratch bones interestingly it's
the way I handle them as Brandon would
describe it in a not so safe for some
people manner got it I I dropped the HTC
One on a hardwood floor oh boy and it's
it did a good job except for the
chamfered edge good yeah showed up I was
really hoping that it wouldn't i phone 5
if I wear like the edge looks like a dog
has like chomped into every so so I've
got a little bit of a nub a little piece
removed from one of my chamfered edges
these chamfered edges they look good but
guys they're they're fragile as heck
okay let me ask you something back real
quick we're going to talk about two
metals right now would you prefer the
phone made out of aluminum like the
iPhone 5 or the HTC One which looks good
but it's soft and when you hit it it
will look badly because the chamfered
edge doesn't hold up to that or would
you prefer a phone made out of titanium
which is really strong but look at these
scratches on the surface so what would
you prefer if you drop it it should
scratch but stay in its exact same shape
or you drop it and it we have a dent so
the question is knicks vs. scratches
yeah I prefer nicks I mean that happens
much much less commonly scratches happen
all the time because you accidentally
put it in the pocket there's a piece of
lint in there that has like a little
crust on it so definitely then I rather
aluminum you know I agree i'm with
Brandon on that one you of course
doesn't it needless say I'm the black
sheep again so i prefer i prefer a
titanium phone which i could probably
drop and abuse it will get scratches of
course because it's easy to scratch that
even with your fingernail but that's
just me let's move on that guy's one one
day okay let's move on someone I haven't
seen in here before is Alex nao Alex
yeah really yeah hey you do it yeah I've
been here first time and I love to try
to get on but I was getting that you
know I would call it boom got all the
peoples at this time I'm like you know
would you know the times of time so I
took a fine Howard fitting them for
fresh but then over and over and over
well I am I my baby i'm getting it on
this time well that's uh that's that's
creative you that you well here's a pro
tip for you instead of refreshing tried
being five minutes early and those
people who are regular faces down there
basically are glued to our twitter feed
and once we publicize the link they just
click like like in the good old western
movies with it and the pilings you
usually i know when i was reading the
penis with two o'clock so i know i'm
going to a clock and I'm like oh it's
not my chocolate like central time so
for me if they look like lemon apart so
it's funny but I went on and I'm like
you know it's 25 below where are they
Shh annually there my question that I
had was is that I'm with my I'm thinking
what coupon to get is that we like the
LG optimus G and then I'm thinking like
or the HTC one that was holding you guys
gonna help me excited I mean I really
like the build quality in both phones
are like haha welcome look like one is
class- meadow and both like little bit
of time in between two problems are Mike
told me you gotta help me out thinking
like I that so you're saying between the
optimus G and the HTC One yeah Optimus G
and the HTC One uh look at him I know I
was ready for this question I was born
dancer um I'm trying to think of one
thing that the optimus G does better
than the HTC One and the only thing I
can think of is is how it looks maybe
maybe you like the the glass on the back
the nice interesting texture that
reflects in the light and looks awesome
it really comes down to design because
the one is faster it has a better screen
it's got louder sound
it feels better and in hand in my
opinion is there is there anything about
the optimus G that you like more than
the one uh yeah I actually papa I
stoniest question on the fee as I'll
dock in a zoom in on the video i really
like tada def must be that you watched
video and in zoom in and have a pop-up
video of a window and I you know windows
and have like a lot of about Kathleen
yeah that's unfortunately not available
in other phones at the moment stock
except for samsung and some LG phones so
HTC one doesn't had that had that stock
yeah i mean if those are game changers
for you then the optimus G sounds like a
better choice so what I'm speaking to me
like I think I like that you know reason
I'm like others ago I'm come clean
because I mean I have been in some
reviews and I heard that Optimus G is
not so good for home party that sounds
to my motto let's be fair I'm back it's
kind of a time when I was watching
actually Mike was reviewed and accepted
the completely gave it a error kind of
leave or among other remember exactly
but I said also that we speak of the bag
not also that didn't specially believe
him a table and blocks up the speaker a
little bit he's okay it just one this
actually has a better speaker so the
thing that's bad when they see team has
been on the LG event on that on HTC
banana Ganesh they should see that I
have the lives in on video like that I
really like and I mean that I always
want to add almost on Michael oh you
know with launching video and I'm like I
would you know always kind of like you
know zoom in so like they'll be like
when you were shooting the video and you
know you shooting an exact weight is
that Michael and you know you like
without which means demain kinda like
the zoom in on the video let you know
who the person is and maybe I'm just
wearing anybody know one one who takes
their it's a question of how much you're
going to use these extra features that
the g throws in in terms of multitasking
in terms of that q view stuff where it
brings the video behind whatever you're
doing that's not terribly it doesn't
it's interesting it's cute it's novel I
don't think it's terrible
useful I think Samsung's approach of
popping a window / / what you're doing
actually works a little better if you
have a big enough screen but the HTC One
doesn't just do audio better than then
the optimus G it does it better than any
phone I've used since 2004 probably so
if audio quality is a big thing to you
both in phone calls and for media than
and I'm sure Brandon will agree it's you
can really can't really do better than
the HTC One certainly not in the
optimist gr8 brenna dude concur oh yeah
yeah so hey oh oh they actually use the
whole more days testing I go like that
I'm almost people she's texting a little
i still call him for more like text so
I'm like thinking I me like I'm saying
maybe I should do they should TV doesn't
mean hadn't got a fun party yeah no i
phone calls are priority the one is
amazing bedroom yeah I was gonna say as
I was going to say that I think that the
HTC One feels really good in the hand as
a phone because it's tall and it just it
feels solid against your face Michael
and Tony what do you what do you think
about that I was not paying attention at
all because I was trying to entertain
those with whom we are not talking in
the offline check well I we were talking
about voice voice calling on the HTC One
and I'll have not used the optimus G but
I can tell you that the HTC One I'm
using it on a carrier here in Romania
which supports HD voice and it is just
awesome to talk to somebody who on the
other end has HD voice enabled it's just
like CD quality sound coming out of your
earpiece and since the top speaker acts
as the earpiece the quality is
exceptional in the in coal quality I'm
not talking about the audio quality
because we know that's the best among
phones on the market right now and that
quality also goes to the other end of
the call as well it'll video popping up
where I compare the HTC one to another
device and when I switched from that
other device to the HTC One on a phone
call the caller immediately was like you
sound so much better right now and that
it's it's a tour de force as far as fuck
column goes the HTC One does a really
cool party trick I like that word that
phrase that you don't even realize it's
happening but you know you ever are you
ever on a call that's a weird way to
start a sentence have you ever been on a
call and something happens in the
background it gets noisy so you're
hitting the up volume button and then
that sound gets quieter then you hit the
down button the the one regulates the in
call volume this isn't just noise
cancellation which it does too but it
just the volume up and down on the fly
so that you don't have to be tapping
that up and down button all the time oh
by the way Brandon what what audio
volume are you using for your earpiece
because I'm I've tuned it down to the
maximum I I still find it too loud I I
have no idea and you know who I was
talking to Michael about this yesterday
how I think the volume needs to be
readjusted on the one it needs to go
down a little lower and the maximum
could probably be slightly higher so I
think it needs to expand a little bit
yeah nobody so we're talking about
tweaking and experience that still is is
much better than the only other
smartphone good customers we can ever be
satisfied yeah and I also one that would
be hammer because I'm hours also i mean
the ones mobile so violated the LG i'll
forget that international was now a lot
version and i will do now that that
pretty make my camera i was wondering
the sense that the agency has their 40
pixels how was it impair of the 13
megapixel ended and he pulls it out or
I'm like this mean i i've had to take a
lot of photos of my phone so like on my
own as I probably hate pics on my phone
he just probably just photos and videos
only has a better camera I am I use the
sprint Optimus G for a period time which
ad has a 13-megapixel camera that's is
that right Michael and then the eighteen
t is the four other 88 correct yeah and
and the pictures were we're we're good
but not great you know it was great that
they were in 13 megapixels so you can
blow it up and then but then you didn't
don't want to zoom in that much because
the quality of the pictures isn't that
good and the HTC one is the similar
story
dipika sures are good but not great and
then the downside of course that even if
you get a perfect shot you can't zoom in
that much yeah so if you're just looking
at the pictures on the phone they look
pretty darn good you're putting them on
your your big monitor your TV here
printing them out to poster size you're
gonna run into some problems there so
the depicted have pretty much the same
kind of their can make its own it and
the 40 foot that pretty much have it out
some vallecano yeah I'd say they have
about the same image quality so I what
do you think Michael I think age is
trying to change the conversation away
and trying to move it away from from the
megapixels and they've said as much I
would say that the megapixel still
matters resolution still matters to some
folks but not to the degree that it
should it should make the difference in
your buying decision if you take a lot
of photos your view no no no your view
right we're like a Lumia 920 or
something like you know I'm just
discussing this on this HTC one that I'm
looking at right now in another piece
and if you're not planning on taking
family photos that you can zoom into and
frame and stuff and put on your wall
you're going to be doing just fine if
you are planning on doing stuff like
that then this is you know then a 4
megapixel camera is not going to do it
for you regardless of what phone it's on
one thing I she like above it no this
time the phone that other way the camera
and then the preview button i got i like
for me I after a windows phone down like
I am never ever getting in the zone I
don't hear there's a I know I'm here is
like the best Windows Phone ever I know
the other guy most are they even have
the best tip I best like I'm Microsoft
home and it's free I'm like no I think
I'll pay you hundred-dollar I just take
this microphone I might know ok so I'm
just telling me it's like I am never
getting a win as far as I did you say
it's good it's good when that there are
multiple platforms to choose from it
sounds like maybe you wouldn't buy a
windows
yeah yeah yeah if you're if you're stuck
choosing an android phone for its camera
odda yada yada if you're sharing photos
if you're using for social media the
ones cameras is going to do just fine
yeah yeah we'll make em look beautiful
on the device too oh yeah Alex thank you
for joining us very much and that's as
good as I have a long duration as I do
that the some of the features from there
with you come down you see my mom leave
like an up day that you think you'll be
able to delete videos leave i got
holiday or something they'll come or
that's like you know that's wrong with
that why would you need to zoom in on a
video because i know you can zoom in on
a zoe on the HTC One but but why would
you zoom in on a video I just you know
maybe get a closer shot to what were you
looking at like uh you know they
separate some to you what are we
watching a movie and it's like somebody
like background like maybe like I should
be like oh well with that you wanna be
pizza mia mia you can you can take a
screenshot of video playing on most
android phones and go into the gallery
open it as a picture and pinch to zoom
as much as you'd like I see another
thing I was like is that I'm not trying
to be negative here I was just trying to
find out why would you want to zoom in
on a video yeah less then unless you
want doesn't sound like the pop-up
window like no you can play seven types
and watching videos without it no no no
and you really need to you need to
evaluate how often you're going to use
that because I was very effusive about
that technology on the galaxy note 2
especially but that's a device with a
very large display on a 4.7 inch screen
you're going to get cramped pretty
quickly trying to like make a window
hover over what you're trying to do and
it's a feature that I think I if many
people are like me and I have a pretty
good pulse on the average user you're
not going to use all that often for
specific situations it's very good but
it's not even using that on the note
yeah I only use I use multi screen on
the notes so rarely now that I was just
checking to see if you can zoom on the
video and you can I use multi screen on
the note so rarely now
I sometimes forget it's there but it's a
powerful awesome feature but you have
very limited to use cases for it unless
you're multitasking all the time I feel
with the month testify when I own agency
one because I remember the one I've got
a lot of problems the most have them the
Buddy how they did it proved enough
attacking or that's what router looks
like only HTC One you of your nine your
nine running apps and then you can throw
them away if you want to close one I
wish they had a close old button and
yeah they may did then they might build
a close all button and what's nice about
it though is that you can instead of
pressing to hold to get into
multitasking like on a lot of phones you
double tap the home button which to me
is a faster quicker thing Brandon
William Tony sorry I know you have them
to what do you guys think about that no
I I like the way it multitasks I'm only
missing a glozell button because I like
to have all my applications closed and
instead of swiping nine times up I'd
rather much press a button like on
samsung phones to have everything closed
down and I oftentimes restart and not
shut down plus boot up again because I
like to clear up memory I I think that
HTC is added to Android's experience by
doing the grid of nine because in in
stock Android you only get like three or
four on the screen at the same time and
I'm like Tony I wouldn't want a closed
off button because for the times that
I've checked the RAM on the one I've
always got so much available no matter
how hard I'm pushing it and without
managing apps that every app opens
quickly so I don't see any reason to
close all the apps at one time maybe one
at a time which you can tell it's it's
not it's not for memory in my case
either so it manages memory perfectly
and it has a lot of memory in my case
it's for seeing or not being able to see
my application history I'll give you an
instance I go to the gym I leave my
phone on one bench I go workout on on
one machine at the end and I come back I
doubled up and I see if somebody worked
with my phone because I had the latest
applications there ah that's an
interesting little security feature
that's crazy you can do that on any
phone i guess but that's really cool way
of figuring out of someone messed with
your phone yep cool man
we Alex we will have to wrap it up so
please make this your last question all
right is actually not quite Molokai
create criticism kind of my head within
a month talkative you guys it just like
in general like a bit much unboxing
video and the personal unboxing the
phone is like okay so here phone and if
you have some headphones and they have
some chonies me to put data type and
that I best focus on the phone and I
mean when I was not a much video I
actually see people attended the
headphone seen over the hedge
authorities and their voice mike is
their control models so when I'm
watching an unboxing video i expended
see more of a what what what's inside
the box because when we seen what pump
the new neck and a predicar matures in
other videos so I mean it's not like I
said I can't actually tell you that you
guys but I'm like a lot of a lot of
textures in it and it's like when i
unbox the phone is that then we'll
probably not much on there what's inside
phone and then i gotta gotta pay phones
we have to charge us up some homework
like no one here let me address that i
agree with you that there's a need to
look at stuff but for the longest time
in the last like three years the things
contained in the box were literally all
the same there was no differentiation
for the headphones we're starting to see
that come back now like the HTC One
comes with this killer set of headphones
the the galaxy s3 came with a unique set
of headphones and so just because that's
happening we're going to start paying a
little bit more attention to what comes
in the box you know chargers are still
the same but headphones are changing a
little bit and hopefully we maybe one
day start seeing accessories again like
a maybe a case back in the day everyone
came with the case HTC always bundled up
ouch every I always had a case of some
kind so I that's a good that's a good
point i will try to look at the other
stuff especially if there's something to
talk about and the agency headphones are
those like beef but I not be that's the
beats Tony you have them yeah it's right
here it's not beats its most probably
something in collaboration with beats
but they are not beats branded they are
HTC headphones and as you can see
there's no
branding on it except for the HTC
branding on the button itself I'm not
sure if you can see it it still got the
rap on it right there but no it's not
not beat at all but there are these are
about the best sounding headphones which
I have ever listened to you and I
compare them all the time with my high
end sure st 535 speaking of the HTC One
and what's in the box i gotta gotta go
find out what that is so we got it we
got to wrap it up here soon right yep we
gotta thank you guys think that happy i
try to be up here next show thanks no
exams you can pack them unboxing
feedback thank you Michael let's go a
full circle and you pick the last person
we talk to you tonight judge sounds
perfect that sounds good I think that
Jesus and who wants to talk to Michael
raise your hand no I'm just gonna say
well uh we'll go ahead and Oh God and
then I love um oh my god duh I haven't
talked to it's been like a month and a
half and we should probably close with a
veteran let's talk to donessa can we do
that you're mildly excited about that
yes I am very excited hey welcome back
welcome back guys I've been uh what were
you get the chat has been focused on
dogs and hideous and while drinking wine
i think that's that's awesome that's
good we have a good chat going on yes is
that me Sam and Dominique oh I think in
a few others became friends over Twitter
and not married Tony aren't you got you
glad to be on Twitter now so we can make
friends like a good leg I'm happy that
we can finally steal Nokia's punch line
it's bucket now live connecting people
yeah yes I think it's great that Sony is
using Twitter think is absolutely great
me too I'm glad to know what's what's
what's new in terms of
sweet screenshot uh what's new in terms
of HTC here for you I know you're an HTC
superfan are you uh what's your feeling
on how this integrates with facebook
home and all that kind of stuff well um
just like I think it's steven earlier
today that oh what is this nothing aside
from the fact that we lost your video
yeah it's telling me that somebody took
a capture all the time on your back oh
you're back okay well um like Steven
it's not bad I'm a mild user of facebook
i use facebook because i used to play a
lot of online video games and that was
that's my way of keeping in touch with
everyone and old friends and everything
i have everyone from my high school in
my facebook and I don't talk to them
that much it shows that this new HTC
first I think is good for people that
are constantly on facebook I wouldn't
make it like a thing that i would use
because it's just it's not for me I'd
rather use Twitter Instagram and things
like that but it is good for people that
absolutely love facebook but not for me
yeah so so this is one of the reasons
that I wanted to finish up with you
because like we have heard from very
habitual facebook users we've heard from
people who couldn't care less about
Facebook we haven't heard the HTC super
fan perspective and it sounds to me like
the first mid-range specs and kind of
low profile are not enough even for you
to justify it and HTC is like your
favorite ever yes oh well what I always
say about um phones that are high in and
made like right there in the middle is
that they tried to aim those phones for
everyone so everyone can buy them you
can make really what's the point of
having a phone that is Facebook based if
it's I n you're just going to see
pictures talk to people you want a high
in phone is because you would like to
take pictures video and things like that
and you need your phone for a whole lot
more than just Facebook right so that's
that's the question this is what I
and kind of trying to figure out and the
conversation is shifted we don't have
this old question any more of like why
would you want a facebook phone we you
every phone as a facebook phone and all
that it confuses me that the HTC first
is a mid-range device I mean we know
they're focused on the one for their
premium kind of coverage but you know
why I launched a facebook device is a
mid-tier unit that doesn't necessarily
excite I can answer to that if you wish
I would love you to answer them nice i
think that they they are targeting the
the emerging markets and the those in
the market for a budget phone if you got
to think of it last time i've heard
facebook was well over 700 million users
and that's a huge potential owners pool
or clients pool and if you consider
countries which are not like the US or
the UK or great countries with great
economical statutes but emerging markets
like i don't know i don't want to point
names or fingers right now but those who
are in the market for a phone which is
functional and will also happen to help
you keep in touch with your friends then
I think the HTC first is the perfect
solution for those sure and and I don't
mean to say it's not going to it's not
going to sell well and I think it's a
good match for the people i was talking
about earlier in the show like the the
live you know from excuse me the AL
users the people who use Facebook as the
internet it's just a move that i wasn't
necessarily expecting especially
considering the status did you then I
said did you have an HTC status at one
point no um the first age 50 that I ever
had was the mytouch 3G from t-mobile
then my cousin gave to me and um matter
knows sorry no one hooked you yeah that
one I was before that I was all like all
the way sony ericsson and once that i
had the phone in my hand I was like can
you please please I'm begging you give
it to me and he sold it to me but really
low price and I i was absolutely hooked
up after that with android and
everything and i don't know it's just
that after that um going back to the
thing it my one of my friends he told me
Oh have you heard about the HTC first
and everything
you get that I know you will get your
you're gonna get that phone and I'm like
oh no it is no it's not for me since i
think it's it's just like the chacha
when the chacha first came out I was
like really it looks like a weird laptop
that it's just hard plastic and it was
weird and awkward I thought the the
thought behind it was really cool but
making a device solely for a social
network is not I think it's kind of
pointless to me are you going to run the
the rom on your on your device on your
higher-end HTC device whichever your
room I don't think so cuz I use whatsapp
it's a messenger and I used to have the
option of popups and since I get
constantly texted by my friends now I
won't be I don't know looking for
something for school and I will get that
pop up and it will interrupt completely
everything that I'm doing and of course
it's not the same because you will get
the notification in the middle and in
this case is on the very top is still
like your concentrated doing something
and then the pop-up comes up and you
don't know exactly like you just you get
caught up and you get either really
pissed off when you're like oh this is
the person I want to talk to but it's
always like in both extremes to me and I
got annoyed and I had to turn it off
after like less than a week so chat
heads are not a good fit that's
interesting guys I don't want to
dominate the floor tonio Brennan if you
guys have a question reviewed no I'm
good unless janessa has a question for
any of us well yes I have a question and
it's really not out of nowhere but it's
kind of random I was talking to my
brother about this do you guys think
it's absolutely necessary or it will be
a good thing to have shutter buttons for
the phones now that a sense tastes
completely stopped having them because I
have this phone and is really big is
this sensation XL and I mean come on
it's hard to try to figure out when you
taking a picture of everyone and you're
trying to figure out where is the the
button in the middle to touch there's a
front facing camera for that yes but you
know it's not the same
genre the same pixels and I I like this
conversation because I think every phone
should have a shutter button and that
was interviewing Simon I forget his last
name from HTC we were talking about
building the HTC One and whether they
talked about having a shutter button and
they said yeah we talked about it but we
didn't do it and I think it's just
because they wanted to keep with the
clean design I think at the very minimum
they should be OEM should do what Apple
did and have the volume plus button be
the shutter cuz that helps so much with
studying the phone as you know from
other devices that have to have a button
so um random i agree with you a night
but i think the clean look I don't have
a good enough lighter but i think the
clean look could be preserved just by
you know doing something exactly whilst
i load that volume rocker just right let
me help you i got there too light here
oh yeah yeah yeah I i agree i can't no
I'll stop talking Johnny yeah no it's
left its locked on me oh this gets okay
um III think that it's so yeah I cannot
agree more with you Brandon I think that
hardware the buttons are good they're
not just good for shutter things cuz
they yeah the volume up thing on the
iphone is great but for jumping into the
camera with a quickness I don't want to
have to look at the phone when i unlock
it to jump into the camera if
something's happening right now this
pocket and take it out and go slightly
the half the time when I'm taking a
quick shot with the Lumia and I've got
it in my pocket the camera is launched
before it leaves my pocket because I
know where that button is I'm impressed
and hold and the cameras ready I'm BAM
there it oh yeah I don't know why but it
was something that I started seeing and
I was like wait why are they making
phones like this now because it's so
practical I mean it takes from the from
the design and a really nice aspect of
the whole phone but so sometimes you
want to take a picture with the
back-facing camera or the back camera
and you don't have that button you don't
have you have to like look at the screen
and zoom in and zoom out and I don't I
think it would be nice like the iPhone
you can use the one of the bun bun says
it's already there hey
I was even thinking maybe somebody
should make an app or something because
it's always good to have that shot
shutter button because sometimes I click
and non clicking the options or I'm
clicking the back button and it's a
little annoying but it's not impossible
to live with and then that there's
always the other side of the story and
those who are advocating against a
dedicated camera button because pushing
a button needs pressure from your hand
and oftentimes that pressure for pushing
down a two-stage button might and use
some blur into your images so I'm just
saying that I would love a dedicated
camera phone camera button on the phone
but those who advocate against that
bring this to the table this explanation
yeah well i believe so I'm how I have
really nice control of my holes for the
way I use my hand because because I used
to draw on paint on the computer and I
most people even with with the button
here they didn't they click it and they
move the phone day they have shaky hands
for some reason and we will always have
that problem but i don't know i think it
would be nice to have that back but i
absolutely agree with Tony let's let's
wrap it up if you guys don't have
