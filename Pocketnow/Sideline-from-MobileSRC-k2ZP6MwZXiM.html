now calm and this is a look at the
latest piece of software just released
from mobile source software they came
out with a program called G scroll not
too long ago that brought some really
interesting functionality to touch pros
and touch diamonds it allows you to
actually use the capacitive touch
sensitive area down here to scroll
around on the screen to launch various
applications really brought forth a lot
of great functionality and it was really
inexpensive software to which was really
refreshing and the latest piece of
software is called sideline and I think
it solves a common problem that of
having so many people to call and you
need some way to remind yourself to call
you know two people tomorrow and three
people the next day and call your boss
on Friday this is basically like a task
Liske but centered around calling people
so it's pretty smart so this is the main
screen and from here you can kind of see
who you need to be calling you can
actually change the view to have larger
icons bigger pictures as you can see if
you have a picture associated to someone
it will list it there or you can keep it
small let's say I want to add a new
reminder to call someone I press the
plus button and type in the name of the
person so be minimal that is me and then
I get a screen that asks if I have any
reason for the call so i can type some
notes here i can do some extra notes
over here and I can sit when exactly i'm
going to be calling this person let's
say on friday also i can set a reminder
with this little stopwatch up here so
it'll actually beep when i set the
reminder for so let's say I want to set
it for you know 730 p.m. on the day of
the deadline and i click ok and there's
actually a quick link button there to
call the person right now if you want
and click OK again and it's set for this
week September fourth and you can
actually go right into the the item from
there and then this is what will happen
when you're supposed to call somebody so
if it's the phones on vibrate at a
vibrate if the phone is not on vibrate
you'll get a sound you get a big picture
of the person you're supposed to call
and you can click view
called details and kind of see the notes
that you have about the person and if
you want to action on it right now you
can just click the home button and it
will dial them from this screen and as
mentioned sideline will integrate with
your contacts so that if you're going
through your contacts list and you find
someone that you need to call tomorrow
you can select their name hit menu and
go down to where it says sideline
contact and it will bring up the same
car that allow you to choose when the
call should take place and whether you
want to remind her so just a quick look
at sideline for mobile source again it's
five dollars which is a pretty good
price for a utility that it's probably
very useful too many I will push the
link on pocketnow.com on how to get it
and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
