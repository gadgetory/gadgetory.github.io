to surface HTC confirms a februari 19th
event and the Nexus 4 is back on sale
hopefully I'm primarily later and I've
seriously given up on the Nexus 4 but
this is out daily that's right
google has once again started selling
the nexus 4 on the Google Play Store and
even though I've currently lost complete
faith in them and try to buy this device
I know many of you are still on the
ropes trying to get one it still retains
the same price tag and it'll ship in one
to two weeks but I would hurry up if I
were you because this message will most
probably self this truck before this
video even goes live and speaking of
Google new rumors have the company
working along with a sous on a newer
version of the nexus 7 that sports a
1080p display and probably a new
redesign rumours also have the company
working on launching this device on mace
15 through 17 ish somewhere around there
which is interesting because it's
probably a little bit earlier than
google i/o when it happened last year so
stay tuned for the news and speaking of
announcements we were expecting for HTC
to announce their m7 at mwc 2013 but as
it turns out they just sent out press
invites for an event on februari 19th in
London and New York City m7 will most
probably be launched there but hopefully
we'll be getting some hands-on time at
mwc 2013 as well now which of you will
believe that HTC will also announced a
tablet of this events the moas believe
it will happen so stay tuned for the
news nfb iPad 5 is your thing new lead
them to show a larger version of the
ipad mini already out in the blue n the
design looks exactly the same to the
other one which is code to the ipad 5
now it's hard to know if the design will
be ready for a launch within spring of
this year like it happened last year but
with Apple you never know and finally
for the interesting news of the day
Apple has just announced that iPad form
with 128 gigs of storage just think
about it you could buy a mid-tier
macbook air with the same 128 gigs of
storage and you'd have enough for a
computer the device will retail on
februari 5th for 800 bucks for the Wi-Fi
model in 930 bucks for the LTE model
that leads you to the question of the
day what would you do with 128 gigs of
storage on consumer Bay
tablet in my particular case I'm okay
with 64 gigs on all my iOS devices but
still leave us a comment down below what
would you do with so much storage if you
think about it there's a hundred dollars
of difference between the 64 gig in the
128 gig so it makes some sense for some
people like me but still it's overkill
and if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet Road make sure you
