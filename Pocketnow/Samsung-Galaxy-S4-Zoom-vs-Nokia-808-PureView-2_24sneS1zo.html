and this phone needs no introduction
this is the 808 PureView and I'd like to
call it the camera with a phone now this
one right here is the samsung galaxy s4
zoom which is the phone with the camera
and we're going to compare these two
right now even though it's not a fair
comparison we have Android versus
Symbian here we have a pure view
technology of 41 megapixel sensors
versus a 16 megapixel sensor but it
should be fun okay so obviously right
from the start you'll see that there's a
huge difference between these two
platforms and we're not going to talk
about software here we are going to talk
about the imaging capabilities of these
these cameras the Nokia 808 PureView has
the 41 megapixel sensor and the way this
phone zooms is that it drops down
towards the 1.1 point of the sensor sets
for instance if the sensor is a 41
megapixel sensor and you are outputting
only 8 megapixel images it it will try
to shrink down and drop towards this
100% of the sensor to give you lossless
zoom now on the other hand the Samsung
Galaxy s4 zoom once I will unlock it and
it will extend its
it will extend its lens like this you
will be able to zoom in with this ring
right here for a ten times optical zoom
it is a huge conceptual difference
between the two there is no actual
optical zoom happening on the Samsung
I'm sorry and Enoch 808 PureView here
everything is done through this lens
construction as far as sensors are
concerned we know we have a 41 megapixel
sensor here and of course in the future
beginning of July on linnethia iOS we
have a 16 megapixel sensor right here on
the s4 zoom with the lens with a xenon
flash and the optical image
stabilization because at that zoom you
will have shaky hands believe me so this
was a short quick look at the Samsung
Galaxy s4 zoom aka the phone with the
camera and the knocked 808 PureView
which is the camera with a phone or vice
versa
these two are awesome shooters with
finance on pocket now coming to you from
London thank you very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
