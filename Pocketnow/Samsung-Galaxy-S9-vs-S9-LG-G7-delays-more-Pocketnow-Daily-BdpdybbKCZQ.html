the smaller variant won't get as much
love as the Plus those of you waiting
for the LG G 7 will be surprised to hear
that the wait will probably be longer
and CES 2018 has begun with Samsung
laptops and honor pushing hard for AI
I'm Jaime Rivera and thank you very much
for 1.5 million subscribers that is
awesome this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with CES in
our coverage we've got two videos
already live there are actually more
videos ready but we're still under
embargo we can't really share them yet
but there is a ton of content right now
the Samsung Note put 9 pen in addition
to the other notebooks in the lineup and
we also got to see the honor view 10
yesterday you can learn more about these
videos in the description now let's talk
about Sony as a you know what we haven't
talked about the company in a long time
in the daily and that's mainly because
they haven't taken smartphone seriously
at least until now we presume we got the
X a to the X a to ultra and also the l2
even though these devices aren't really
what we would call flagships the cool
part is just the changes in design which
kind of deal with the things that we've
been asking Sony to do for a while like
for example things like the fingerprint
scanner you can learn more about them in
the description now let's move the
spotlight over to Google for those of
you that don't understand why there was
Google Wallet and Android pay and the
company just not making up its mind now
we have Google pay the company has
finally unwrapped it and it's probably
bringing the best of both worlds to a
certain degree and there are actually
some deals that range up to $50 when it
comes to be an agent deals if you use
Google pay though let's just see how
long it'll take Google to adopt or
consumers to actually adopt the protocol
is not even Apple Pass taken off and for
those of you that thought that we'd get
a g7 early or probably CES for MWC we
were the ones that thought that we were
gonna get it NWC as it always happens
but there are some very trusted sources
that claim we're gonna have to wait
until sometime within late April sorry
late March for a launch until April what
exactly that will happen or will we see
some sort of a briefing at MWC that's
still yet to be seen I hope that that's
the way it's gonna happen but we'll keep
you posted and finally the very hot news
today then really happen at CES these
are still rumors of the Samsung
Alexia's 9 + s 9 plus we've got other
trusted sources now chiming in more on
the case of RAM and storage for this
phone and it seems that it will be a
case where we will have differences
between the regular s 9 and the s 9 + so
for example it seems that the s 9 will
be stuck at 4 gigabytes and you have
options for 64 and 128 gigs of storage
and then if you're going for the plus
you will be getting the 6 gigabytes of
RAM and then you'll get 64 128 256 and
apparently there will be an option for
512 gigs of storage though that will be
limited to some markets we know that
samsung launched this chip early last
year so that's great to see but you know
leads me to the question today do you
like the fact that Samsung apparently
will change their scheme and give you
lesser specs on the smaller galaxy s 9 +
sorry s9 as Marcus I do feel that yeah
it is probably not the best way to go
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
