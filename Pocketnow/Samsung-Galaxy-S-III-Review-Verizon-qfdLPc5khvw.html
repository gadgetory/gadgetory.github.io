super phone to come out of South Korea
it's available for most major carriers
in the United States and even for
international friends as well in fact
the international version got very high
marks from our very own Brandon minimun
in his review just a few weeks ago today
we're going to look at the verizon
version of the samsung galaxy s3 how
does it stack up against the
international version and the other
domestic versions as well does she have
any proverbial tricks up her sleeves how
does she perform against the others
let's go take a look specifications are
an important thing that we all look at
when considering a new smartphone how
did the specs of the verizon version of
this phone stack up the casing of the
verizon version is pretty much the same
as all of its siblings like all the
other US variants it's almost a totally
different device from the international
version of the phone do the different
band requirements that we have stateside
the verizon version like the other
american variants instead has a
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 SOC
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz 2 gigabytes of
RAM lastly the choice of processor
brings with it another bonus support for
verizon LTE unlike the sprint version
the verizon sgs3 includes a user
accessible micro sim next to the micro
SD slot all the other details are
essentially the same from the huge 4.8
inch super amoled display with 306 ppi
and 720p resolution to the 8 megapixel
capable of 1080p video recording and an
LED flash nestled neatly on the back of
the phone there's been a lot of talk
about the pentile sub-pixel arrangement
that Super AMOLED displays on the sgs3
use unfortunately despite its high
resolution the display on the sgs3 isn't
as great as that on the HTC One X on the
other side unless you put your phone
under a microscope you're probably not
going to notice so with everything we've
heard in the news about Samsung copying
apple and
an apple apologizing to Samsung for
saying that it was copying Apple what do
we think of the design of the samsung
galaxy s3 there's nothing wrong with the
design of the sgs3 but there's nothing
really outstanding about it either the
finish of the phone is a hyper glaze
coating that makes the phone feel cheap
it's terribly slippery and it attracts
fingerprints better than anything we've
seen recently are we being too hard on
samsung perhaps but this isn't an
entry-level phone this is a
six-hundred-dollar flagship class
superphone holding it in your hand
however you won't feel like it is which
is somewhat disappointing
notwithstanding Samsung's failure to
impress us with the hardware of the
phone they did manage to impress us with
the software Samsung has exercised a
great deal of restraint with TouchWiz
five-point oh lots of features which
made ice cream sandwich such a
breakthrough in you I haven't been
messed with or they've just been tweaked
with a little to improve them pushing me
why forward Samsung put a lot of thought
and effort into gesture and motion based
commands some are fun and surprisingly
useful others are still very rough
around the edges like the other versions
of this phone the verizon offering
includes smart stay buddy photo share
pop up play and s voice and is still
laughable like the other versions
Samsung decided to include a physical
home button below the display
additionally the menu and back buttons
are capacitive and backlit but not all
the time one more knit to pick there's
no multi task button so if you want to
quickly switch to another app you'll
have to long press the home button
adding time to something that by its
very nature should be fast one of
androids biggest advantages is its
ability to load up a separate custom
input panel or input method or soft
keyboard whatever you want to call it
the version that comes pre-installed on
the galaxy s3 it's terrible it seems
like every oam feels like it's necessary
to customize the stock keyboard to quote
make it better
close quote the keyboard on the galaxy
s3 is worse keyboard notwithstanding the
everyday apps like email and messaging
we're tolerable it's more than that
they're functional and utilitarian just
not all that pretty even after all that
we're still very positive about the
software experience on the galaxy s3 it
works it's fast and it looks nice in the
places that you're probably going to be
using the most since a lot of us use our
smartphones is our dedicated camera how
did the sgs3 for verizon stack up color
reproduction is quite good though the
higher than normal saturation of s
AMOLED displays means your results will
often look quite different when viewed
on a computer screen versus on the phone
screen like its siblings there are many
fun and useful features included with
camera software which you'll probably
never use the front facing camera is
good for video calls and face unlock but
not much more Samsung is customized face
unlock to include some words so that you
have to speak something if you want to
choose that option it's nice and it adds
a little bit extra security how about
performance is this thing fast the
phone's responsiveness and software
experience was well above average it's
not the buttery smooth experience that
we've gotten used to in devices running
jellybean but the update to jelly bean
should come along fairly soon I tested
the LTE everywhere I could in fact it
got to where I was showing the thing off
because I hardly ever got below 10
megabit per second that was usually
always in the mid to high 20 megabits
per second at work which is really just
an industrial complex nothing really
special there 30 megabit and higher all
the time it blew everyone away 18t hspa+
couldn't hold a candle to it t-mobile
two to three megabit down 10 times
faster on verizon LTE but that comes
with a cost unlike its siblings that get
fairly good marks in the bat
department the verizon version is just
above average we were able to eke a full
day out of the foam with moderate use
but just barely on days we didn't use
the phone much battery life was
excellent your results will vary
depending on how you use the phone but
as long as you're not going nuts this
device should last the average user from
morning until at least early evening
power users will probably want to carry
a spare battery or plug in at the
halfway point at the end of the day this
thing is still a phone so how does it
work making phone calls and doing other
phony stuff voice calls were perfect
probably due in part to Samsung's incall
EQ settings Samsung's in colleague Q you
can either set to OFF you can set it to
a soft sound a clear sound or even
optimize it for your right or left ear
surprisingly this works really really
well so in conclusion let's talk pros of
course the first thing you're going to
see on the phone is a big bright display
it's slim and sleek has lots and lots of
features and excellent you I
customizations but the main thing you're
going to take home about this phone is
it's ridiculously fast LTE performance
cons the lack of a quad-core processor
may impair some power users or gamers
but most users aren't going to notice
the pentile display will be irritating
to some although again it's not
noticeable in everyday use it's
unremarkable design feels too light in
hand for a flagship phone this phone
should have some heft to it it's
slippery casing is a fingerprint magnet
collects oil and honestly I've almost
dropped this thing several times because
it's so slick bring on the aftermarket
back plates so in conclusion should you
get this phone the Galaxy s3 isn't just
a standout product it's probably the
best smartphone available right now on
any carrier honestly with the LTE speeds
we tested this phone is the reason to
switch to verizon right now
how does its core hardware gets a solid
nine software and user experience both
tie with an eight bringing the total
overall score to eight point three out
of ten which isn't something that's
easily done in my book if you like this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
