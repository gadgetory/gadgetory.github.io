brought to you by D brand to buy the
best fitting skin for your phone or
tablet please visit D brand calm I mean
I haven't even finished my copy yet so
if you remember back a couple days ago
we produced a video about the iPhone 7
audio and I was all full of piss and
vinegar about the headphone quality and
the lightning connector and how this
isn't progress well we got one major
thing wrong now all of the numbers and
graphs that we showed off from our
testing those are still legit but our
explanation of the signal processing on
the iPhone 7 is maybe not quite accurate
ok so here's where we went wrong and
this is kind of cool and kind of
frustrating all at the same time so on
our iPhone 7 testing the numbers that we
generated were so similar to the iPhone
6s through the Lightning 2 3.5
millimeter connector that we made an
assumption and our assumption was that
the onboard audio processing hardware
was being passed through the Lightning
connector and that the extra pins on the
Lightning connector were serving as an
analog bridge to the headphone jack and
that assumption wasn't made in some kind
of vacuum there is actually a process
documented where you can take the
additional pins on a USBC connector to
send out an analog audio signal well
just this morning the folks at 9 to 5
Mac published a video teardown from a
site called tint a Vienna probably
butchered that name where they take
apart and I don't know they managed to
just kind of cut this thing to pieces
but they take apart a lightening - 3.5
millimeter adapter and wouldn't you know
it buried in this plastic right here is
a tiny little DAC and a little serious
logic audio processor it would seem that
even though there is onboard audio
processing hardware that's only being
used to power the speaker's the
Lightning port itself really is only
putting out a digital audio signal first
of all I just want to apologize to our
audience because we work really hard to
try and make sure we're feeding you guys
accurate information and so that signal
processing chain that we detailed in
that first video a little inaccurate
okay a lot a bit inaccurate and there is
something really impressive about the
engineering involved in making such a
tiny signal processor but there's also
something frustrating about this
manufacturing process - that every
single adapter every pair
headphones has to supply their own
digital-to-analog conversion hardware
and this also explains why we saw
slightly poorer performance on the
iPhone 7 over the iPhone 6s they really
aren't using the same DAC I don't have
to hold my notes here because I can't
remember all these numbers the iPhone 6s
and the iPhone 7 both have an internal
Cirrus Logic 3 3 8 s 0 0 1 0 5 audio
processor the DAC built into the adapter
is the 3 3 8 s 0 0 1 0 4 audio processor
which is obviously one whole number less
quality than 105 obviously I don't know
how Apple and cirrus logic rate their
individual components and whether that
numbering scheme really means anything
but it is a different part number so we
can't expect that there is some
difference in performance between those
two units and that this just echos some
of the concerns we had in that original
video that the quality of your audio is
going to be dictated by how much you
spend on accessories on the adapters on
the headphones whether you decide to
move to a wireless solution the phone
actually isn't providing any of that
quality to the peripheral that you're
attaching to it after spending six
hundred and fifty dollars on a phone to
really maximize what you can get out of
that digital signal so if you still got
to buy a pair of headphones that will
only work with this phone well folks
this assumption that I made was an
opportunity to engage in another level
of discussion and nuance so I'm glad
that we've at least been able to address
where I went wrong we had all the right
data it just led us to the wrong
conclusion pocket now is iPhone coverage
is brought to you by D brand check out D
brand comm to customize your iPhone with
a real-time preview D brand skins are
designed to add grip texture and kill
those jet-black iPhone fingerprints they
ship worldwide and iPhone skins start at
under 10 bucks if you're interested
links are in the description below I
want to thank all the people who sent in
the video and the story from 9 to 5 Mac
for keeping us on our toes keeping us
honest as always folks thanks so much
for watching be sure to subscribe to
this channel for more correction videos
like these I'm sure I'll probably make
more mistakes in the future for pocket
now I'm Juan Carlos bag now some gadget
guy on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
