new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all on to the next
big thing already so let's do something
about it let's take a look at a phone
several months after its release when
it's not shiny and new anymore I'm
Taylor Martin with pocket now this is
the Moto G and this is episode 33 of
after the buzz when we first reviewed
the Moto G the $180 smartphone was a lot
better than we ever imagined it would be
in fact how great it was and how much it
favored the Moto X both in performance
and user experience surprised us but how
has it handled the test of time is the
phone still such a great deal five
months later on the outside the Moto G
was never exactly beautiful or
mind-blowing of course nothing on that
front has changed it's always been a
plain-jane phone with an understated
design and a very stark appearance it
bears a strong resemblance to the Moto X
but it's thicker heavier and a little
less refined and that's okay because
it's also a fraction of the price
starting at just 180 dollars and it has
the much-loved dimple around the back to
boot
considering that ultra low price point
the specifications aren't all that bad
either
it comes with a Snapdragon 400 SOC which
is made of a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
cortex a7 CPU and Adreno 305 GPU it has
one gigabyte of RAM 8 or 16 gigabytes of
storage with no option to expand and a
2070 million power battery the
connectivity options are pretty basic as
well Bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi b/g/n and HSPA+
connectivity here in the States
no LTE all things considered the display
is nice as well
it's a 4.5 inch 720p IPS LCD which lacks
some contrast and has some pretty milky
black levels but the colors are
relatively vibrant and the text and
icons are pretty crisp thanks to the
approximate density of 3
hundred and twenty six pixels per inch
in the hand the phone feels pretty
sturdy and the build quality is
exceptional
especially for a budget smartphone in
the last five months the hardware of the
Moto G is no more or less impressive
than it was from the start and that's a
good thing it was always a nice piece of
kit from the very beginning and it
hasn't aged a bit
it's still a little bit chunky but it
doesn't feel like a 180 or smartphone
instead it still feels like a foam worth
twice that much even today the software
situation has actually improved
originally the Moto G launched with a
mostly stock version of jellybean
Android version 4.3 within just a few
short weeks it was updated to KitKat as
promised
there have been a few minor updates to
fix bugs ever since but the software is
only getting better over time the Moto G
comes with minimal bloat and only a few
useful features from Motorola such as
the watered-down version of the assist
application which can toggle the phone
to silent based on your calendar
appointments moto care and one of our
favorite motorola features trusted
devices which can suspend your device
security requirements while connected to
chosen Bluetooth devices outside these
minor differences the Moto G is
practically running pure stock Android
it comes with the stock Android launcher
and untouched notification shade and
settings application the Google keyboard
and a pure stock app drawer it is for
all intents and purposes stock and
that's particularly helpful when it
comes to user experience
it's almost as vanilla as it gets which
means the mid Ranger isn't bogged down
by unnecessary software tweaks or bloat
it purrs along just fine performance is
still a high point on this tiny modest
smartphone you wouldn't think it could
handle a heavy workload and it certainly
can't quite handle tasks like its
high-end counterparts can but what this
little phone that could can handle may
surprise you jumping down to the Moto G
from a device like the One m8 the
difference in clock speed is noticeable
but that's no reason to completely write
it off it can power through most mundane
daily tasks with ease you can even take
care of gaming though we wouldn't
necessarily say it's the best experience
ever
we experienced some lag and framerate
drops and some more graphically
intensive games after all this phone
isn't for the hardcore gamer but instead
for the minimalist who doesn't need a
lot overall horsepower if you approach
this phone from the right
distractive it's an impressive little
device and the Snapdragon 400 is not to
be underestimated the one gigabyte of
RAM does lead to some aggressive app
closing meaning it isn't the best for
multitasking but basic users should have
no problem here in the States the Moto G
will be fixed a t-mobile or AT&amp;amp;T 3G and
HSPA+ the speeds won't wowed you but
they shouldn't disappoint either call
quality is also passable though nothing
particularly noteworthy when we first
reviewed the Moto G battery life was
pretty modest we could typically manage
a full day of usage through pretty
normal usage patterns frequent social
media updates taking lots of pictures
syncing three Gmail accounts streaming
music and web browsing in the short time
we've been using the Moto G this time
around things seem comparable to before
the camera still isn't the best the five
megapixel shooter around back is capable
of taking some decent photos from time
to time but the vast majority of
pictures will prove to be bland and
lacking important detail photos tend to
be low in contrast even in great
lighting making colors pop less and
making the images look pretty dull
overall all things considered it's not
the worst camera possible but you
definitely get what you pay for in this
phone's camera experience in all we're
still just as impressed by the Moto G as
we were the first time we looked at it a
humble meagre phone it may be but it's a
valuable smartphone for not a lot of
cash and even as more and more viable
budget Android smartphones emerge the
Moto G manages to remain the best deal
around it may not be the best value or
the best specifications for not a lot of
money but the Moto G is the best bang
for your buck period and the last five
months have had virtually no effect on
this phone at all we still recommend it
the first time and returning smartphone
buyers who want to save money without
sacrificing too much performance and
polished
