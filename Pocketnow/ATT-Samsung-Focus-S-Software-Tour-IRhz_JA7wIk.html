next up we're going to take a software
tour of these sampson focus as on ATT so
first off in this software tour i'm
going to show you kind of all the
customizations the 18 th sampson have
done to this focus s now it's got
windows phone mango when it's gone some
point 5 and there's a lot of new
features in that so if you're not
familiar with all of them be sure to
check out our windows phone 7.5 review
for all the details on that so in
addition to the customizations and
bundled apps we're also going to look at
the camera and what was customized there
and maybe a speed test with one of the
games so let's check it out here's our
default screen we have 18 to u-verse
mobile that's for uverse subscribers so
we can open that and we have our default
tiles are all laid out here pictures
music down here we have 18 teen
navigator that's your GPS navigation
Program ATT radio for some streaming
music and here we have a Samson app
called now let's check this one out and
we're loading and it looks much pretty
quickly now let's the painting is really
smooth so here you have your weather
nope this is updating something weather
looks pretty good there's your news and
that Scrolls really nicely so we can
read something there and it's just going
to load the article kind of in a web
page and their stocks and your options
your other sections and your settings so
some cool stuff and we have live tile
option
so this is new for a mango we can add
secondary tiles for news and top tweets
so that's a pretty cool if I go back
I've already pinned those down here so
there's your top news and your top
tweets those are from the Sampson daily
briefing app and you see they flip
around show you a little preview of a
something going on there so that's
pretty cool now this focus s has a front
facing camera so we can finally use a
video calling so that's a what tangos
here for but it does not come bundled
with the device so you're going to have
to download that separately it's
currently the only video calling app
available for Windows Phone 7 but we
know there are more to come so let's see
what else we've got you got a bunch of
eighteen t apps family Matt Morales
that's that's a good one to keep on
there for checking out your account you
know the balance how many minutes are
using that kind of thing but if you
don't use any of these other things that
all you have to do is tap and hold and
uninstall and right away it'll be gone
so even though people complained about
bloatware it's very easy to get rid of
them so we have more Samson apps I'll
show you a few of those we have fun shot
let's see will do bulge
so we got to have our camera going can
you see that there we go so that's a
weird effects going on the camera so
i'll save that and there's my bulging
picture and i can share it there let's
loot settings we can also share it to
Facebook photobucket picasa so there's
something fun with the camera we also
have where are we photo studio Sampson
has big on the picture apps so here's
some different things we can do and it
goes into the camera
so that's going to do some effects there
you can see that so there's some fun
effects to play with you can also edit
pictures that you already took and we
have options for auto levels suckers are
maybe not and brightness that's a little
too much color adjustments with RGB
sliders rotation if you want to flip it
and cropping so those are good good
picture tools to have there's also
photograph more more a picture editing
programs i'm going to show you the
marketplace because this has some unique
things that are only going to be
available either on ATT or sampson so if
you have a samsung phone you're going to
get Samson zone and these are some apps
they're going to be only available to
you as a samsung customer there's a
Rubik's Cube game few other photo
related apps and if you're an ATT
customer you also have all these 18 teen
apps that you get just for you alright
next Sampson has done some cool
customizations in the settings so all
the way down here we have high fidelity
position this is kind of a going to help
with your gps we have Simmons I don't
have any some applications but that's
where they would be and we have extra
setting it's kind of a weird name for a
setting call it extra setting but let's
see what's in there here we have Auto
display intensity so if you set your
background to white and have this on
it's going to really lower the
city to save battery life and we also
have a vibration feedback I could shut
that off but I want to have to feedback
on the buttons and we have an echo
cancellation so those are pretty good
options let me show you the white theme
and how that setting affects it so it's
you saw that difference there with
automatic brightness off now this seems
to be doing automatic brightness in a
way that's there and those are our extra
settings but we also have camera now
this is an 8 megapixel camera with a
flash and we have the front facing
camera switch right there and we have
settings what do we have for settings
let's see if I in Oakland area autofocus
mode you got macro switch so you got to
switch to macro if you want to take
close-ups white balance automatic
there's your save settings button don't
forget about that we have image effects
kind of filters not sure I'd want to use
those well taking a picture but those
are their contrast adjustments
saturation is good sharpness controls
exposure value compensation so if you're
always if you want to take kind of
underexposed pictures and maybe your
highlights are getting blown out we can
turn down the exposure ISO settings this
is for your light sensitivity controls
metering we can do matrix
center-weighted or spot matrix does like
the whole frame center-weighted saw this
just the middle of its spot is going to
do the metering based on your focus
wait hopefully hey there's your quality
so that's the JPEG compression levels
and here's a good one wide dynamic range
so that's going to be similar to the
wide dynamic range feature on the iphone
it's going to get a lot more detail in
the highlights and the shadows so you're
not going to have really really dark
shadows and really really bright
highlights it's going to kind of balance
them a little more there's your photo
resolution options and of course antes
shaking which doesn't really do a whole
lot it's not like vibration reduction
with the lens it's just kind of
increasing the sensitivity so that the
lens can take pictures quicker with less
light so there you have it no special
features like you saw an HTC with the
panoramic or the burst shot options we
don't have any of that here okay next
let's see if we can try out that one
point 4 gigahertz processor you're
probably looking at this and saying this
is pretty pretty much the same as the
first generation windows files
everything is real quick everything was
real quick on the old ones let's get a
little comparison where you're going to
see the speed increases the most let's
see how about a slow game like
kinectimals so we're launching both
these at the same time see the focus s
is already well ahead and this even has
a trial so it should be bringing up some
dialogues
so already this is ready to play and
this one is just finally starting so
play that one and this one's loading my
character and we'll see which one's
quick that one's already done we're
already going this one's finally there
maybe I should put these like so and
switching him to trick mode it's a lot
of loading screens so you'll noticed you
can jump there we go notice this focus s
is actually a lot faster but you'll
mostly only notice it in things like
games and whatnot alright so that's our
software tour of the Samson focus now in
eighteen t a lots of cool things some
bundled software you might want to
remove but a windows phone mango and
it's running really really smooth if
you're not up to speed on all the new
features in Windows Phone mango be sure
to check out our windows phone 7.5
review and I hope you enjoyed this video
your thumbs up if you did and that's it
for now
