the new iPhone 6 is in stores
if you're one of the millions who is
going to pick one up or have already
done so I have a great way for you to
make some extra cash you can get up to
$400 when you sell your old phone on
eBay it's up to $200 more you can get in
other places still not sold on the deal
eBay is so confident that your phone
will sell that for a limited time
they'll hook you up with a $100 coupon
if it doesn't that's awesome click the
link in the description box below or go
to WWE Bay for the win calm to see how
much your phone is worth are you still
watching hi click below and get that
money
after this video finishes of course I
know what you're thinking hey moron
why are you comparing the Galaxy s5 to
the iPhone 6 plus
shouldn't you be comparing it to the
Galaxy Note 4 well yes but there are two
points I want to make first we don't
have a Galaxy Note 4 on hand and there's
no point in comparing it to the note 3
to the galaxy s5 sits exactly between
the iPhone 6 and 6-plus and screen size
literally smack dab in the middle so
it's no better suited to be compared to
one over the other
despite the Galaxy Note 4 now that
that's out of the way let's get on with
it I'm Taylor Martin with PocketNow and
this is the iPhone 6 plus vs. the
Samsung Galaxy s5
the iPhone 6 plus is a beautiful mashup
of aluminum and flowing glass that is
except for those damn polycarbonate
spacers no one seems to like otherwise
it's a very pretty foam that like
Michael says almost makes you feel that
you shouldn't be holding it the galaxy
s5 is quite the opposite
it doesn't feel fancy or special its
plastic trim which is painted to look
like metal feels cheap and flimsy so
does the faux perforated leather around
the back it's super lightweight much
lighter on the bezels then either iPhone
and comes packed with at least a dozen
sensors you might never use the
fingerprint scanner for example is not
all that compelling like the iPhones
that's embedded in the home button
however you must swipe your finger over
the scanner instead of simply holding it
there this is both awkward and difficult
to do one-handed and it fails to work at
least half the time the iPhones touch ID
sensor requires the user to simply place
their finger on the button after a short
pause the iPhone unlocks let's talk guts
for a minute on paper the galaxy s5 is
the more powerful more capable phone it
has twice the RAM and if you include
removable storage it has more storage
options than the iPhone 16 gigabytes
built-in with up to 128 gigabytes in
add-on storage though with a maximum of
128 gigabytes on the iPhone 6 plus we're
confident both will have ample storage
for just about any type of user the
camera on the galaxy s5 has double the
resolution and its CPU has twice as many
cores and nearly double the clock speed
the iPhone 6 plus does however have the
advantage in battery power 11.1 watt
hours to the s5s ten point seven eight
both phones have NFC though the iPhones
has locked Apple pay Bluetooth 4.0 and
Wi-Fi AC the s5 has a heart rate monitor
IR blaster and a notification LED
none of which come on the iPhone and not
to forget the s5 has ip67 certification
so you don't need to worry if your phone
takes a dive into a cup of water or a
pool the six plus does have a
significantly larger display though its
IPS LCD is 5.5 inches diagonally
well the s5 has a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED
panel both are 1080p meaning the density
is marginally higher on the s5 but the
major display differences are the more
vibrant colors higher contrast deeper
blacks and broader brightness range on
the s5
five obviously you have more real estate
on the six plus as well as more natural
looking colors and better daylight
visibility both panels look awesome but
if you're after more dramatic everything
the Super AMOLED panel is the way to go
that display difference also means
there's a sizeable difference in device
footprints the galaxy s5 is much easier
to wield and use one-handed the iPhone 6
plus is sixteen point one millimeters
taller five point three millimeters
wider and it weighs of whopping 27 grams
more yet it's one millimeter thinner in
fact it's incredibly thin dangerously
thin as some unlucky users who pull bent
iPhones out of their pocket learned the
hard way but let's not get all bent out
of shape over the so-called bend gate as
we have yet to hear any official
statement from Apple and we don't know
how widespread the issue is yet that
said Apple is reportedly looking into it
and is considering replacing damaged
units I for one have been using the 6
plus without a case and carrying it in
my somewhat tight front pants pocket for
nearly a week now with no issue either
way the iPhone certainly gets our vote
of approval on aesthetics and build
quality it actually looks and feels like
a high-end phone that said the s5 isn't
bad it's just not quite as nice to look
at or hold
on the software side samsung's touchwiz
at Apple's iOS have never been more like
thanks to extensibility api's in iOS 8
which allow third-party keyboards
third-party sharing and even today
widgets in Notification Center but make
no mistake
iOS and Android especially TouchWiz are
very different at the respect of course
this version of TouchWiz is more
TouchWiz II than ever
packing countless features and add-ons
that some may never care to use the my
magazine for instance is just a baked in
version of Flipboard that's no more
useful than the actual app however some
features are useful like toolbox a
floating bubble of user definable apps
or multi window true split-screen
multitasking while TouchWiz is more
toned down than usual it still tries too
hard to be everything at once de cater
to all types of users with every
possible feature the result is a few
features that stick out and find their
way into our routines and three times as
many half-baked ideas that don't benefit
anyone iOS 8 brings some much-needed
improvements to iOS mainly the
aforementioned third-party support but
there's a catch it's taking some time
for developers to update their apps to
support third-party sharing and
third-party keyboards are very buggy
that said today widgets are every
deeming factor while most of them are
just at a glance informational widgets
for things like agenda and news feeds
some simulate a similar function to the
toolbox feature I mentioned giving you
apps shortcuts in Notification Center or
quick entry into Evernote the most
disappointing aspect of iOS 8 on the
six-plus specifically is the lack of
so-called phablet features Apple had the
perfect opportunity to bring
split-screen apps into the fray but it
didn't instead it gives you a reach
ability feature accessed by double
tapping the home button split pane views
in certain apps and a landscape home
screen three things I have yet to find
very useful if you've been satisfied
with iOS in the past iOS 8 is just the
icing on the cake TouchWiz is still
TouchWiz I'll be at somewhat better than
before but if we had to choose a winner
in software for the first time in a very
long time it would go to the iPhone in
daily performance both handsets are
quite snappy but you'd expect the s5
with the beefier CPU and faster clock
speed to run circles around the iPhone
not so in fact we'd give a slight edge
to the iPhone 4 it's more consistent
scrolling pinch zooming opening apps and
over
performance in general gaming and
benchmark scores also show how close
performance is between these two to the
general consumer it's indistinguishable
at best but these are both newly set up
phones over time the iPhone has the
reputation for maintaining its stellar
performance for at least a typical
two-year cycle Samsung's devices don't
have quite the same reputation and
sometimes slow down over the course of a
few months
like Michael found the speaker on the
iPhone is noticeably better than the
rear firing speaker on the s5 even if
it's much easier to completely mute with
the palm of your hand it's louder more
crisp and full
where this comparison takes a strong
diversion from the iPhone 6 comparison
is in battery life the iPhone 6 plus has
an 11 point 6 watt hour battery and
we've yet to kill it in a single day
it's capable of lasting at least a day
and a half on normal usage and a full
day on really heavy usage the galaxy s5
doesn't have quite as much stamina but
it does have a removable battery as well
as some power saving features so
depending on whether you're okay with
lugging around a spare battery in your
pocket or backpack you could call this a
draw
network performance here on the Verizon
Wireless Network in winston-salem North
Carolina is also similar between these
two devices call quality surprisingly is
a little better on the galaxy s5 it's
more crisp while the iPhone is a little
more muddy with more background noise
and even in a relatively weak coverage
area both managed acceptable data speeds
and then there's cameras both phones use
phase detection autofocus and lock onto
subjects very quickly however we've had
more problems out of the s5 with shutter
lag resulting in blurry photos that's
especially true in low-light wherein the
iPhone uses optical image stabilization
even in poor lighting it has a sharper
focus captures more detail and results
in brighter photos overall the s5
seriously struggles in low-light and the
software stabilization samsung uses
doesn't help all that much in broad
daylight the s5 is capable of taking
very nice vibrant photos with lots of
detail it has double the resolution to
work with so there's more room for
cropping but colors are more realistic
on the iPhone even if they're often a
little more drab and cool in most cases
we were more pleased with the photos
taken with the iPhone 6 plus in the end
we're left with two very solid very well
rounded smartphones the Galaxy s5 has a
little something for everyone and the
iPhone 6 plus has some things many
existing iPhone users have been looking
for all along third-party integration
and larger Hardware Apple ultimately
failed to capitalize on its larger
hardware not offering any truly useful
way to use the extra display space but
at the same time Samsung failed to cut
all these useless frills and only added
more the water resistance of the s5 is
something sure to draw buyers especially
those with a more active lifestyle but
overall if I had to pick one it'd be the
iphone 6 plus hands-down it's more
reliable in terms of performance
I prefer its camera over the s5s
especially in low light and the battery
life is certainly better the only thing
that gives me pause however is pricing
with the two-year agreement the base
model 6 plus is $100 more than the s5
without its 150 dollars more and you can
add $100 more for each storage option
