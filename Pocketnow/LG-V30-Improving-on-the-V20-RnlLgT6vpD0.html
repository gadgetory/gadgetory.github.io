something satisfying about watching a
company correct course find their
footing it's early days for this phone
but we can use these first impressions
to also take a look back from v-22 V 30
this is a whole new beast we were
confident the V 30 would follow in the
g6 footsteps but we weren't expecting
such a sleek handset at a glance few
people would assume these two came from
the same manufacturer with only a year
separating them that's a significant
shift in aesthetic a hallmark of the V
Series the V 30 loses the secondary
ticker display in favor of more screen
on the front face software replaces that
function and a floating strip users can
customize and if you miss seeing your
name on the phone when the screen is off
and always-on display setting should
scratch that itch shorter and thinner
this handset is easier to use one-handed
and there's more screen area to play
with this aspect ratio is still novel
getting more display smaller bezels and
many in our audience will be happy to
see LG return to an OLED panel not seen
since the flex to more vibrant wider
contrast ratio and a lot more control
for folks to tune their display we do
lose a few fan favorites in this
transition though IR blasters on phones
are likely gone forever as is the
removable battery sacrificing that for
more dependable water resistance losing
the V twenties metal back allowed LG to
add wireless charging to help people
better manage their power thankfully
that battery is a touch larger and
combined with a more power efficient
chipset maybe throw on a dark theme we
should expect a noticeably better
runtime a longtime complaint with the
v10 and V 20 what hasn't changed is the
phone's focus the LG v aims to be a
multimedia and content creation monster
dual rear cameras maintain the standard
and ultra wide fields of view the V 30
reigns in the barrel distortion by
narrowing that field slightly almost
identical to the scene you would see
from a g6 the main camera sensor now
boasts the widest aperture on a phone
and a new glass lens element to improve
image clarity or
samples are proving to be sharper and
clearer than the v20 will certainly be
digging deeper into this on our real
camera review the V series is still the
only line of phones with as significant
a focus on cinematography and the V 30
takes steps to improve over its
predecessor with better image processing
and editing tools LG includes options to
take advantage of the taller aspect
ratio but also includes a new video
option for shooting log files these are
flat fairly desaturated videos allowing
the user to apply the color and contrast
settings they desire I'm pretty terrible
at color grading but even in a phone app
you have a lot of room to manipulate the
shot while retaining image integrity and
it wouldn't be a V launch without
talking about killer headphone audio the
built-in 3.5 millimeter Jack continues
in the V 20s footsteps with a quad DAC
system and a smart amp to tune headphone
playback LG has not missed a step here
with impressive fidelity and the ability
to properly drive nicer headphones we'll
have more to say in our upcoming reel
audio review but this has been a core
feature for the V + LG fans will not be
disappointed ah the difference a year
makes and this is a significant
difference LG is pivoting the V adopting
more consumer pleasing design and
including water resistance which has
become more popular of late on premium
phones while this means a few
compromises on features enthusiasts
might enjoy the core philosophy of the V
remains intact
building a premiere option for consuming
and creating content we have a ton of
questions to answer as we produce our
full review properly testing the camera
and audio performance will this phone
deliver better runtime than previous LG
phablets we'll have a lot more to share
soon as always thanks so much for
