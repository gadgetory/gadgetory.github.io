pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a closer look at the software on
the amazon kindle fire so sit back relax
enjoy the show so when you power on the
device you get the Amazon lock screen
which just slides over with your finger
there it does have some information on
it such as the time and the date and you
notice that the the screensaver there
the the wallpaper and the background
rotates as you turn the device on and
off and unlock it back and forth moving
into the primary view from which you'll
use the Amazon Kindle Fire day-to-day
we've got the carousel here which shows
kind of all the apps that you've opened
recently you can see I was in the the
Nook tools here a web browser etc etc
and then it also has items in here that
you may not have opened recently but may
have in your kindle fire or rather your
amazon library available to download you
can tap those items and view them if you
scroll down here this is your favorites
kind of bookshelf and you can add items
to those bookshelves by simply tapping
and holding and then you get an option
here to add to favorites and then vice
versa you can tap and hold on item down
here and remove from favorites or remove
from device content that is listed here
that is not let's say we find a item
here so this video here I can add it to
my favorites but I can't remove them
from the device because it's not
actually install on device it's just
something that was watched the Amazon
video system across the top here we've
got the newsstands which connects to the
Amazons all of these items here connects
to Amazon's back-end the weather to be
the newsstand looks music video docs
apps the web including the web because
the web uses the silk browser newsstand
is specifically for magazine style
articles and then sorry not articles but
magazines in general books are for
obviously at the kindle books that you
can get either purchasing them
through the store here or even on the
web and being able to save them and
download them this device same thing
with the rest of these music for music
obviously video for the video you store
on the device plus the video you want to
use through amazon prime service it does
not connect the video for netflix for
example you still have to go into apps
and find netflix for that docs are files
that you've put on the device that our
files like in my case I've put a couple
of books here that are a book that I've
got on the device that I've loaded as a
mobi file that shows up here in the docs
and then apps is the app store it shows
all of your apps in that you have in the
tray and then it also has these little
arrowed apps here which are apps that
you can download because you've already
purchased them in some fashion from the
Amazon store web browser which we'll
come back to in a minute is the silk web
browser which I really haven't found to
be terribly faster than any other web
browser that I've used on an Android
device up here at the top if you top tap
the left hand side which would unboxing
we couldn't get to do anything that's
because if there's not a notification up
here you won't get the notification bar
won't appear if you don't have something
to see up here and as you can see I've
downloaded the Kindle update just to
show you as an example of an item for a
notification and I can clear all of
those and then the notification bar will
pop up and it won't come back down again
unless there's something else there if
you tap on this side then you get your
settings menu you can lock the screen
orientation change the volume up and
down brightness Wi-Fi forces
synchronization and if you go under more
then you get a pretty typical Android
menu it is missing some items for
example the ability to be able to change
your own keyboard but there's ways
around that just note that you know this
is where you're going to find
information like your battery life and
how much storage space you have
available be able to toggle on and off
the ability to install apps from outside
of the Amazon sources down at the bottom
we've got the
menu the back button and then if you're
in a that uses let's say a menu then you
can tap here and get your menu option as
well let's go ahead and open up the
browser and I can show you what that
looks like so standard keyboard here for
the Amazon Kindle Fire it works great
too haven't had any problems with with
accuracy or anything like that I'm going
to type upside down here and we'll
navigate to pocket now you see how fast
this loads up on my Wi-Fi while the
browser's loading you can see we've got
an option here for adding a bookmark for
this page if you like so here we are
with this and feels a little bit
sluggish in the scrolling it's still
loading up some side items here so it's
not terribly surprising there I have
installed a application from the Google
market that increase the sensitivity of
the touch screen thus making it I'm not
missing as many touches or taps when I
tap on items and I find that the
scrolling is a little bit better as you
can see here the text is a little bit
small for reading at this size if you
zoom in then of course you know the text
becomes easier to read scrolling up and
down is fairly smooth but really I
haven't found again that it's really the
silk service is being very much faster
than any other browser that I've used on
the device you have multiple tabs by
tapping the plus button at a new tab as
you can see some of the other items that
you've gone through then you've got the
ability to close said tabs by just
tapping the X for some reason when you
tap the X on the last web browser it
doesn't then open up a new tab it just
closes the web altogether the content
that's available through say video or
otherwise and if you've got a prime
subscription there's a lot of video
content you can watch free same thing
with books if you're a prime member then
there are books that you can check out
for free i'm just going to go in here
and find one kindle owners lending
library here and i'm going to say
fiction and I can see the list of items
here and if I want to check this book
out for this month and you can only
check out one book per month I could
just go right here and say borrow for
free and it's processing my borrow right
now and I can return this book here
because I'm done with it now the only
problem is that you only get one per
month so if you download a small short
story which is what I did before in the
middle of the month and you finish it in
15 minutes then you have to wait till
the month cycle is over in order to be
able to borrow a new book hopefully that
will change in the future but for now at
least it's a neat feature and then once
it's downloaded then you can move right
into the kindle app which I've got set
here to black text or black background
with white text but you have many
options to change the font size the
background color margins etc as you deem
fit and then just tapping on the screen
moves you back and forth or you can
slide to scroll back and forth between
pages no fancy page-turning effects here
just the simple tap very quick very easy
on the eyes makes it very more
comfortable to be able to read on apps
that don't have arch designed for the
amazon kindle fire let's take for
example the PV here you've got a little
option down here at the bottom that
allows you to tap on this little up
arrow that makes it so you can access
the home menu and all of the other
options now I have had the occasional
lock up and hiccup with this device but
really it hasn't been any more different
than I've had with say the any other
Android tablet or android device as far
as the music app is concerned you can
see that you've got music on here you
tap on it's a pretty straightforward
simple music player nothing too fancy
about it same thing with the video
player there's no fancy features it has
a limited capability with the type of
codecs that and support at least out of
box so you
don't expect too much out of that
feature in functionality but it does
allow you to play music at least in the
background while you're reading other
books and then be able to control that
via the upper menu that wraps up our
closer look at the software on the
amazon kindle fire if you have any
comments or questions please leave them
below give us a thumbs up if you liked
the video thanks for watching
