Galaxy S ten that show was the device
and it's full glory boy it looks good it
looks like Samsung is beating more way
to the punch in the whole display race
after all and Sony just published some
weird patents for a foldable smartphone
I'm Jaime Matt Rivera reporting live
from Maui for the Qualcomm Snapdragon
summit 2019 there are three days of hot
announcements this is Fargo down daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you're in the market for iPads that
nine point seven inch model which is not
as really the best iPad in the world but
good enough for a lot of uses is
currently $40 off and retailers like
Amazon and B&amp;amp;H obviously this is the 32
gig variant which yeah it's kind of
limited but you can learn more about it
in the description now for those of you
that have been waiting for ear pods I am
NOT gonna buy a first pair of ear pods
until second generation comes out and
according to Minh Chico this is gonna
happen in the first I would say quarter
of 2019 we're gonna have to wait for
that and apparently it's not gonna get
redesigned it's just changes and updates
if you want to get a redesign for the
air pots that I would actually like
that's gonna be 2020 now let's talk
about Sony the company has just patented
certain designs for foldable smartphones
and the weirdest way possible which is a
vertical fold I assume that you want to
make like a clamshell smartphone and
then there are some I don't know what
you would call that transparent displays
that gets that gets stacked up together
like whatever it is that you're thinking
Sony can't wait to see something cool
now this one's the spotlight over to the
battle between which company punches a
hole on a screen first as we thought
that it was gonna be wall way with an
over for no that event is apparently
until December 17th
it seems that Samsung is going to have
their event for the galaxy a8 s on
December 10th so I don't know who's
gonna beat who to the market when it
comes to the launch timeframe but yeah
punch a hole on the screen of your phone
that's gonna be a thing it seems and
finally the hot news today have to do
with the Samsung Galaxy S 10 and an even
larger hole in the display we've got
Kadri
the possible final design and this looks
legit three cameras at the back
apparently this is the s10 plus with
three cameras have but back in an array
that looks like the Galaxy Note 8 I love
that design and then we've got in the
front two cameras in a punch hole that's
even larger but they said that it was
gonna be smaller but anyways the punch
holes they're the fingerprint scanner is
apparently gonna be on the display
because it's nowhere else we've got a
headphone jack that is cool
listen in the comments what do you think
do you like this possible design or not
cuz in my case I you know I just I want
to know how they're gonna pull off that
punch hole on the side but I'm curious
to what ideas you guys bring in the
comments
