februari third and plant some hot coffee
for that timing hence i have iOS 4.3
being released just around the corner
and yeah believe it or not angry birds
will have a movie all this and more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
high metal iveta and welcome to the
pocket now I review the show we go
through all this week's cool and
not-so-cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices let's start this week off
with the cool wool verizon's plans for
their new iphone are out voice data
plans may vary but you'll get unlimited
data for thirty dollars if you quick
about it why well verizon has also
confirmed that they'll be only offering
unlimited data to new customers for a
short period of time before they go
tiered so our advice to use to move
quick if you're going to want the
hotspot feature well that's going to be
an extra twenty dollars above the voice
and the data so that's it for the
verizon plans for now well verizon
iphone for yours to begin on februari
third at 3am for all previous verizon
customers so our advice to you is to
plan for an all-nighter and get a lot of
coffee because we don't know how Apple
plans to meet demands on both servers
and also on you know the fact that
they'll be able to deliver as much
iPhones that they're hoping to sell so
aside from that itunes 10.1 point2 is
out and you will need it to activate the
new cdma iphone so our advice to you is
go download it right now can you believe
it Angry Birds has been such a hit the
20th Century Fox it's actually going to
make a movie out of it it's going to be
called angry birds rio and it's going to
be released on april fifteenth and
theaters so commemorate this rovio is
going to release a true sequel to the
current games of angry birds and this
time we're going to be bashing something
else it's not Pig so really cool reports
have the next-generation iphone sporting
NFC technology you know that really cool
new thing out there that allow you to
use your smartphone as a wallet
currently you only see this come out on
the nexus s android smartphone and not
very many places out there supported but
it's a feature so expect it to be
mainstream really soon an interesting
note is that we already have iOS 4.3
compliant applications being approved by
the f store we really don't know when
the beta is going to end though or
there's going to be a beta 3 or
something
like that and we also don't know if AT&amp;amp;T
is going to prove the hotspot feature to
be released our biggest bet is that will
see the release coming out somewhere
around the verizon iphone launch so
let's see what happens and while apple's
app store has just reached a 10 billion
downloaded apps milestone which is
really cool Apple was giving away a
ten-thousand-dollar gift card for the
winner of that 10th billion app
downloaded and a woman from the UK
wanted now the really interesting thing
was the fact that she hung up the phone
when she got call thinking it was a scam
one of her daughters was the one that
won the prize by downloading paper
glider and well she got called
eventually and she did claim her prize
so really cool well that does it for the
coolest continue on with the not so cool
rumors have the white iphone for being
released by apple again this time it may
be ATT system somehow and some other
systems out there and other people have
been mentioning that Apple has finally
figured out the white coat of paint that
they need for the phone to look good now
the question is why is this a not so
cool well because Apple it's late
already figure it out and well just so
you know AT&amp;amp;T is secretly offering
unlimited data to users that want to
move to verizon for the new iphone now
well competitions good the question is
why is ATT doing this until now and why
secretly why not do it publicly for
everybody not to leave to the rise in
iphone anyways and well on a funny note
a woman gets stopped at an airport in
israel for trying to smuggle in 40 for
iphone strapped to her body now the
question is if it's really difficult for
me to carry two phones around every day
how could a person strap 44 iPhones to
their bodies without looking like a pig
call that desperate anyways well that's
it for today's show thank you very much
for watching remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
