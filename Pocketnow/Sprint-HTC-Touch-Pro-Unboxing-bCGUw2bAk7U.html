pocket now that
and this is the unboxing of the sprint
HTC touch pro
first release of the touch pro in the
United States AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will be
getting theirs before the year is up so
let's take a look at sprint version Wow
pretty nice unboxing for a carrier I
like how the device is sitting right on
top I'm going to put this to the side
for now let's see what else we get so
getting started basics guide very big
manual in full color it looks like or
yeah in color setting up email
experience sprint speed agreement and so
on and so forth alright so let's take a
look at what we have over here looks
like you take out some accessories dump
these out on the table so we get an
extra non collapsible stylist the same
stylist that comes on the HTC touch pro
that you've probably seen already
released in europe we've got headphones
it looks like we have a sinking cable
which uses HTC's EXT USB but it also
works with mini USB connectors so if you
have those laying around we get a case
very nice let me open this up and see if
it's a leather case yeah well sort of it
smells leather um it's actually more
like a suede so and it's actually a
holster rather than a case so you clip
this on your belt very nice we have the
converter for 3.5 millimeter headphones
and looks like 2.5 millimeter also good
glad they included that and then we have
the charger that we plug the USB cable
into
alright so let's take a look at the
device okay so here it is well the edges
are much more rounded than then you
would find on the European HTC touch pro
very interesting um we've got a kind of
a flat back in here with a 3.2 megapixel
camera we'll cover that later here's the
keyboard and oh great they kept the
fifth keyboard row so you have the
dedicated numbers up here that's great
they're not embedded in the letters for
some reason the slider feels kind of
slow and not spring assisted I really
hope that this is just because there's
some plastic behind here we'll we'll
have to look into that but as it stands
now it's not spring assisted except for
right at the top okay so let's compare
this to some other devices so we have
the good old tighten too and the touch
pro on sprint is about the same
thickness although i think the touch
pros a little bit thinner so let's take
a look at the xperia x1 we've been doing
a lot of coverage on that lately so the
touch pro is wider it has a vga screen
whereas the x1 as a wvga screen the x1
is a little bit thinner and let's take a
look at the other touch pro the the
european version that's been out for a
while now the the sprint version is
actually a little bit taller and it's
rounded all along the edges it almost
looks like this this metal accent has
been added of course we don't have the
front-facing video camera the buttons
here seem to be exactly the same chrome
on the sides which one's thicker is a
tough tough call they look about the
same that the sprint version is probably
a little bit thicker and on the back we
don't get the faceted backing as we did
with the european version let's look at
the keyboards i think they're going to
be quite similar so open that open that
and yeah guys they're identical
keyboards which is really good because
the keyboard on the touch pro that came
out in europe really did did great
including a lot of different keys
not only do you have the dedicated
number row but you also have you know
links to text messaging and email and
you can use keyboard shortcuts with the
control button control C control x
control p just like you would on a
Windows machine so we've got more
coverage coming up on the sprint version
of the HTC touch pro we'll be back with
more soon and be sure to follow us on
