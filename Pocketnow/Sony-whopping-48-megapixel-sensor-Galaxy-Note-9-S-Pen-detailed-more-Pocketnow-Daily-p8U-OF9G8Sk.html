48 megapixel imaging sensor that was
just announced we get new leaks of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 telling us what
the s-pen will be capable of doing and
Trump's tax war with China continues
bringing new taxes on certain
smartwatches I'm high in memory that I
and I do agree this is the face of no
sleep we've had a lot of work tons of
great videos on the Spanish Channel make
sure you watch this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
even though amazon's prime day is pretty
much over technically the company
continues with deals on devices like the
huawei mate 10 pro
it is currently $300 off pretty much
$500 on the retail price you can learn
more in the description now for those of
you that have been following the whole
Trump war with taxes on certain
countries when it comes to importing
goods right now China we hear that there
are sport watches now on the list for
extra taxes the funny part is some of
these smart watches are no longer being
made like the first generation Apple
watch but then there are some smart
watches from Fitbit that are included in
this are still being sold you can see
the full list of the description and
let's see how this ends up now let's
talk about Qualcomm as the company has
just published some Euclid data that is
rather interesting for those of you
wondering what smartphones are faster
when it comes to data speeds and also
you know retaining those data speeds
technically you could say that the
iPhone 10 is the same but according to
this data it's not it's up to the point
where there are Qualcomm Snapdragon 8045
processor phones that have performed 192
percent better than iPhones in the same
scenario obviously this is not technical
information that I cover I'm actually
thinking about making a separate video
for this but yeah let us know in the
comments if you're interested and you
can learn more about this information in
the description now let's talk about
Samsung and some leaks that have just
emerged on xda-developers we hear that
the S Pen is going to be able to control
a ton of things from your music controls
to even answering phone calls to locking
and unlocking your phone which has me
skeptical too your camera shutter you
could pretty much hold the S Pen with
your hand and somebody I don't know your
place the phone somewhere else there are
some interesting features here and we
can't wait to see what we get and
unpacked and I've even been seeing leaks
of the phone being on box on Instagram
lately we also see in
formation on the galaxy watches well
stay tuned there's a lot coming
and finally the hottest news today come
from Sony for the first time the company
makes it to the hot news but this is
rather interesting the new Sony IMX 586
sensor has just been announced with 48
megapixels we're talking eight thousand
by six thousand pixels here that is a
crazy amount of megapixels that assists
in so many things like again dynamic
range is this sheer size of the sensor
also allows for better shallow depth of
field and in addition obviously being
able to zoom at things it proves that
the whole idea of providing more
megapixels that we saw with the Nokia
808 PureView the later made it to Lumia
1020 that is now on the Huawei P 20 Pro
is now going to be available to
everybody according to Sony as of
September so I guess we can expect some
great smartphone photography very soon
and today's question let us know what do
you think do you think that this is the
depth of the point-and-shoot of
smartphone cameras start becoming this
capable in my case after using the
Huawei p2 any pro for a bit I have to
say I think it's time but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier follow us on
finding out our comment subscribe to our
channel for more videos like this one

Instagram at high memory data please
