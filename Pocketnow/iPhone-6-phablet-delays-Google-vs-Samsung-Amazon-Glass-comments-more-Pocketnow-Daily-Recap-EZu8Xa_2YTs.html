think I should speak slowly or do you
think he needs to listen faster don't
answer pocketnow daily equals pocket now
rumors and there's kind of a reason why
we didn't call it pocket now news dude
imma can you do a pocket out daily but
drunken I'd need to stop drinking miller
lite for that tap that's right it's that
time of the week i am high memory that
this is pocket now and this is the
pocket now daily recap for last week so
on monday i asked you if you're waiting
for the 5.5 inch iphone 6 phablet as the
rumors are that apparently apple won't
launch on until 2015 a new reports say
that it's actually part of the strategy
and we have hundred and four comments
out of which one of them says who thinks
the iphone phablet will cost a thousand
dollars and dude you know it's really a
problem in most countries that are not
the United States where I phones are
sold at a really expensive price but in
the United States the iphone costs
pretty much the same as almost every
other phone out there surely Apple could
probably sell it expensive but I don't
think apple will be able to compete that
way the lawn says I'm waiting for the
5.5 inch iphone 6 so badly but if it's
not out by September and if it's
confirmed that it won't happen until
2015 which that's not going to happen
I'll just cave and get the 4.7 inch but
I'll wait if the features are a handful
compared to the 4.7 inch and most likely
that's going to be the case i think that
the difference between one phone and the
other is just going to be the size i
think that the features are most sighs
it going to be the same in apple is just
going to want to give you the option to
buy one or the other but we could be
wrong then another commoner says iphone
5.5 inch or galaxy note 4 i think it's a
no brainer there's only one phablet
ruling the market and it's the note 4 um
i am going to give you that one the note
4 is probably one of the phones that i'm
most waiting for i love the galaxy don't
line above love that ever since the
second generation i have been using and
constantly i don't think that we want
bigger phones we want bigger phones if
they are more useful and i don't mind
putting up with the size of the galaxy
note 4 because of the s pen and because
of the multitasking and stuff like that
but you know unless apple figures that
out I don't want to blow to the iphone
that's just my case as well then on
Tuesday asked you what do you think
about amazon products lately as the
were the company had just hired the
product leader from google glass into
working into amazon labs and we have 227
comments out of which daniel says amazon
glass anything you look at will be added
to your cart and I do feel those same
thoughts as well amazon is really crazy
into thinking that people are willing to
buy anything in order to buy everything
from them but mr. jeff says amazon
should be concentrating on delivery
drones leave the cell phones and tablets
to Samsung and Apple and this is a great
comment this is a great point I didn't
think about it this is like Starbucks
selling you a phone you know at the same
price as an iphone for you to just buy
them coffee not everybody wants to spend
their entire day shopping and not
everybody wants to do it buying from
amazon and getting it two days later
then rato says i think someone in amazon
needs to get fired this has gone far
enough and i do agree not that somebody
needs to get fired but Jeff Bezos really
think about it amazon each to focus on
their core business and fine you're
looking for new ways to distribute you
know new ways for people to acquire your
products that's fine that's decent but I
would focus on building better
applications for people to consume on
your current phone &amp;amp; to try to find the
way to convince somebody to pay so much
money for a phone then on Wednesday ask
you how much would you be willing to pay
for good pair headphones as the news
where the Samsung was launching its
samsung level audio products in the
United States for prices of one hundred
eighty dollars for Wired almost four
hundred dollars for wireless we have 660
comments out of which Lazarus says
twenty dollars no more for Wired sixty
dollars for wireless and you know most
people are like that sixty dollars you
can find a really good pair headphones
for 60 bucks of course I'm not an audio
file so I can't be the expert to tell
you they're great uh but it's really
hard i mean i feel that sound quality is
something that depends on the person
some people love base of people love
fidelity i love fidelity for example i'm
not really into based so i really
wouldn't pay that crazy amount of money
for beats headphones that just give me
great bass and the other things are
really not left out but not given as
much importance but Michael best says
$350 for Samsung headphones these people
have got
to stop smoking that stuff and you know
Michael a lot of people out there want
to buy headphones that are expensive
I've seen six hundred fifty dollars for
headphones a thousand dollars for
headphones and there is a market of
people out there that actually buy that
yes I do consider it crazy I wouldn't do
it I do agree with you but then again
the palm is there is a market out there
and then Ronnie says I paid one hundred
and seventy dollars for Jay bird and
blue bud wireless headphones and I don't
regret it I paid 150 dollars for pair of
bose headphones that were good for
running because they were really good
for handling sweat and they were
waterproof and I do not regret it either
because I had already paid like a
hundred dollars buying headphones almost
every month because the others would
break so there are products out there
that do have a point in a reason for
being in which I don't mind buying for
more expensive price but then again for
just unproven audio quality that's a
tough one then on Thursday I asked you
have you ever tried surviving with an
iPad or tablet for a day as the news
where the Tim Cook had just said on an
interview that he spends eighty percent
of his time using an iPad only and that
he's able to survive just fine we have
605 comments out of which Lando says
when your job is just to read and reply
to emails it's easy to work from an ipad
only and dude this is probably the best
comment of the week you're right it
depends on what you do and if you're Tim
Cook you probably have three assistants
that do all the hard work for you you
have all your VPS that send you all your
reports and all you have to do is read
the emails look at the charts and
respond and reply and confirm so I do
agree if you're attending cooked and of
course living with an iPad is fine but
Michael B says I have two tablets and
I've had many in the nexus 7 I have a
laptop and I've had it for three years
but i only use it maybe once a month I
use my tablets for everything and you
know Michael that's really the reason
why Apple launched tablets there is a
huge market out there people that don't
really need a computer they need
something to read email to watch a movie
to surf the web so tablets serve them
just fine there is a huge market out
there but I particularly am not part of
that market that's really the problem
then bloody says try to play battlefield
3 or 4 on an iPad try to root your
device using an iPad try to flash a rom
you get the idea and of course we all
get the idea there is a market of people
that cannot live with the content
consumption device again I am part of
that market so yeah your comment is
extremely valid and finally on friday i
asked you would you pick the samsung
gear live or would you prefer the gear
tizen products that samsung has as
google is not too happy with Samsung's
offerings but mainly because Samsung is
pushing marketing more fruits geared
Tizen models than the gear live we have
349 comments out of which Bobby says I
like the ties in gear too I own it and
it's great better battery life heart
rate sensor ir blaster a camera all the
things that the gear live doesn't have
and you have a tremendous point there it
cost you almost the same price to buy
gear too so why would you buy gear live
and the only reason would be Android
wear which really depends on your taste
then JP says I prefer the samsung gear
Tizen let's be honest it does much more
than the gear live let's not be fat
girls here whatever the point being is
he has the prom is Android wear I still
in its infancy watch our review from
michael fisher and you'll tell you that
the biggest pong with Android wear is
that there's a lot of promises that the
promise is not there so is it really
worth it for you to invest the money now
and you've got a point there then
walking audio says I don't think Tizen
is good OS four watches I'd rather
prefer Android wear I do agree with you
on this one in the fact that Android
wear has more future it's great because
Google only focuses on android samsung
moment mainly focuses on hardware and
surely they've got their software
department but because there will be
more OEMs adopting Android wear
eventually then it has a broader scope
of growth and whatever you could focus
on from Samsung even though Samsung the
sell more of everything that even Google
does so you know it's a hard topic there
I would prefer Android wear personally
because I'm not really stuck into the
Samsung ecosystem but it really depends
on you thats it for our pocket out daily
