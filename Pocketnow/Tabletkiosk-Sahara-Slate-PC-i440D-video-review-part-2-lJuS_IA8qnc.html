pocketnow.com and this is part two of
the video review of the tablet kiosks
Sahara slate pc I for 40 D tablet pc
today we're going to check out the
fingerprint reader and attaching a
bluetooth keyboard so let's examine the
fingerprint reader I've already enrolled
my index finger and you can see the log
on now shows the fingerprint at the top
left hand corner it's actually easier if
I lay the slate pc down and then all I
need to do this is the fingerprint
reader right here is slide my finger it
validates it up in the corner and logs
on it's a very nice feature especially
when you don't have a keyboard and it's
a great way to secure your slate pc
they've included a wizard for your
fingerprint enrollment and since i've
already enrolled my index finger i need
to pass it on now get into the wizard
and I can actually enroll any one of my
fingers so let's say I want to enroll my
middle finger on my right hand it's a
very simple process right here it tells
me whether it's successful or not and
when it has enough matches it says that
it's enrolled so I needed five tries to
get it enrolled and now my index finger
is actually enrolled so i can press ok
here
whenever I have a need for inputting
large amount of texts I can't do without
a keyboard I mean it's just faster for
me than writing the tablet kiosk slate
pc has a two ways to hook up a keyboard
the first is through the USB port with a
USB keyboard which i don't have this
keyboard also allows you to get into the
bios the second method is using a
bluetooth keyboard i happen to have an
igo stowaway keyboard which i did a
review on a while ago on pocketnow.com
and i use this keyboard when I need to
do a lot of typing with my windows
mobile devices so with Bluetooth here
odd so the sahara slate pc has the blue
Sol a bluetooth stack and i can actually
bring it up using this icon and you see
I've already paired the keyboard so to
connect it you need to wake up the
keyboard by pressing and let's get the
right click here so it has connected the
keyboard and you can see that it shows
the icon i don't have the associated
mouse but I go also has an a bluetooth
mouse as well as the keyboard so to type
text in I could bring up the notepad and
I can say this is a test so it works
quite well and it uses the embedded
drivers for Bluetooth keyboards that are
part of the blue Sol a Bluetooth stacks
and I can use the start key as well as
the other function keys that are in the
that are part of this five row keyboard
from I go
so there you have it how to hook up a
Bluetooth keyboard to the Sahara slate
pc works quite well on in addition to
using the pen for entry which also works
well it's just not as fast for me or you
can also use touch by pressing the mode
button here and I don't want to say this
so you've got quite a few input
mechanisms on the Sahara slate pc i'll
be back with more of the review later on
this week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
