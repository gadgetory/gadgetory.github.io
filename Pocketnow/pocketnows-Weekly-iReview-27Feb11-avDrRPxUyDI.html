second event leaks have the first mug
shot of the probable next-generation
iphone screen an apple patents yet
another social network again not sure
why this time all this in more coming up
right now hello everybody I'm hi I'm
Italy then welcome to the pocket now I
review the show we go through all this
week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off with the cool
well Apple has already shared their
invitations for their March second event
in San Francisco and even though we do
assume that everything will mostly have
to do with the iPad remember that
everything that happened to the iPad one
paved a lot of the changes that happen
to the iphone 4 last year so the events
name is come see what 2011 will be the
year of so we do see changes to
everything else not necessarily just the
ipad now our biggest predictions are
that iOS 4.3 will be released with a
couple of minor changes to iOS aside
from that we do see I was five being
announced with the future generation iOS
platform in competition to what's going
on with honeycomb and gingerbread and
Android and Windows Phone 7 making it to
nokia devices now aside from that we do
see that Apple will also release changes
like for example more storage in the
iPad to a slimmer case and also a couple
of other changes that will most probably
come to the iphone 4 like dual-core
processors and even dual-mode gsm and
cdma radio so again we'll see what
happens in the end nothing is confirmed
so wednesday is going to be the day for
us to know what changes will be coming
leaks out there have shots of the
next-generation iphone and even though
they do assume the device will keep the
same than profile it'll be an edge to
edge screen from side to side and only a
very small bezel from top to bottom now
our biggest bet is that this is probably
just a mock-up and a fake for now
remember that apple will most probably
drop the home button eventually but it
could be true now remember that apple
always tries to cover the backs of
developers and usually the fact that
they change screen resolution brings
problems to developers porting
absolutely next-generation device now
if Apple is working on iOS 5 being a
dynamic resolution display operating
system like you see on PCs this could be
true never know now changes have been
happening quick in the mobileme
department just last week we rumoured
that most probably it will go free and
also offer music streaming services and
added value to iOS device owners now
this week it's no longer on sale on
stores as the box version that only
gives you a register it's not only
available online but most probably we
will see that these changes come on the
March second event so stay tuned and
while facetime leaves the beta for mac
OS owners and is now available as
space-time HD for one dollar for you to
interact on FaceTime calls between your
mac and iphone 4 or ipod touch new
generation owners sad to see that they
brought a price tag to a supposedly free
service you know but it's now available
for a dollar and well aside from that it
also supports HD video calls as a new
offering with the new macbook pro line
up again not really sure why they're
charging a buck and not really sure why
they don't bring this to windows-based
pcs to and well for all of you that were
worried about the subscription based
services changes the App Store
applications for in-app purchases and
developers fighting around for it Apple
has recently clarified that this will
only be available for publishing
applications and not for software as a
service applications like ebay amazon
etc now in my case i'm still going to be
buying Kindle e-books because I prefer
the fact that I'm able to port them
everywhere as opposed to ibooks but not
really sure if the ebooks will be more
expensive given these are publishing
applications so not sure what to expect
after this but at least we'll know that
these changes are not applicable for
everybody else
well that does it for the cool let's
continue on with the not so cool Apple
has recently patented a new trademark
name called places and everything points
out to Apple being after starting a new
social network based on sharing your
location sort of like Foursquare and
Facebook Places now not really sure what
Apple pretends to do here or how they
plan to be any better than Foursquare
and Facebook Places given this will be
locked into the only iOS devices meaning
if you have an Android device you really
can't interact with this application
with iOS device owners Apple has already
lost it with paying and the big profit
was being closed and not really you know
offering anything compelling to users
out there so not really sure what to
expect but again this is currently new
there's just the patent we really
haven't seen what it's going to go on so
let's wait and well what did we tell you
Consumer Reports goes out on TV you know
a couple of weeks ago as we talked on a
past I review stating with the verizon
iphone 4 did not have any antenna gate
issues and they hadn't really tested the
device yet now they come and pull back
their statement and say that they can
recommend the verizon iphone because it
does have antenna gate issues again guys
testings first and well as our last
prediction for the March second event we
do see Apple coming up on stage biting
the dust and stating that they will not
be releasing a white iphone 4 to wait
for the iphone 5 so sad for those of you
who waited anyways that's it for today's
show I'm Hyneman Rebecca thank you very
much for watching remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
