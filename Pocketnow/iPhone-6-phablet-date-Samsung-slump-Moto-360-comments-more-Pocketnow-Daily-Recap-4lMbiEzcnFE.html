jokes when will he learn and if you
don't find it funny you clearly have
never trained yours be warned there is
no alcohol related intros today finally
and I'm sorry dude I know you were
looking forward to them but they'll come
back very soon i mean i will pay you to
don't say this in a video in my
particular case LOL um how much that's
right it's that time of the week i am hi
Mary there this is pocket now and those
are out daily recap for last
week so when they ask you what will you
think about a motorola Nexus phablet as
the rumors are that the company is
working on the Nexus 6 and that it will
have a 5.9 inch display we have 156
comments out of which Michael best says
motorola will undoubtedly make an
awesome Nexus device but five point nine
inches is a bit extreme the only way the
size would work is if they add features
that complement the size like
multitasking you make a solid point
they're the only reason why I like to
note lineup is because of the
split-screen multitasking that was at
some point unique and only available on
note devices you now get them on almost
every other samsung phone but yeah
that's really the only reason why I
would put up with a bigger phone as well
then raulito says no thanks I got tired
of a big phone they should keep it at
4.7 inches or 5.5 inches and wouldn't be
cool if we actually had two different
nexus smartphones a bigger one at a
smaller one another commoner says just
the other day I was thinking of a bigger
screen 45 inch Nexus 5 this would be
just perfect and the problem is five
point nine inches is huge the galaxy
note 3 is not uncomfortable but yeah it
is a big bone it's really hard to hide
in your pocket so not everybody likes
that I wish we had some choice but on
Thursday I asked you if you ever wait to
buy anything until december as the
rumors are that Apple is going to hold
its launch of the iphone 6 the 5.5 inch
model until december and we have 334
comments out of which alex yoon says my
contract is over is over in december so
i need a new phone and yeah a lot of
people will have their contracts over by
that time but not very many people
actually people go crazy on launch date
and usually happens in September so a
lot of people will be left from
September to December
waiting for the other iphone if they do
John Castro says no I wouldn't buy a
phone in December the fact that it's so
close to CES and mwc would make me hold
off to see what's announced their mwc
CES yeah nwc yes but CES doesn't really
launch that very many good phone so
we'll see the neo and 12 says I'm not
buying the 4.7 inch iphone and I'm not
buying it I want the 5.5 inch but the
Nexus 6 could come out before december
and that's what I'm waiting for I'm not
waiting for any company the biggest
problem is that yes there are some
really great smartphones right now like
the LG g3 the HTC One m8 so it's
probably not even worth waiting now uh
we'll see how that goes then on
Wednesday ask you what SmartWatch design
do you prefer as Santa has just patented
around SmartWatch even though all the
ones they've been doing r square we have
425 comments out of which one on says a
circular display on a watch feels and
looks more natural than a square display
moto 360 now that's a beautiful watch
you know we've been used to seeing round
watches for the longest time but then
we've also been used to seeing squared
ones I honestly don't agree that there
is anything natural about a watch it's
just an accessory but it depends on how
you were brought up and what SmartWatch
or should I say what watch that you wear
back in the day a Karthik's s square
looks better around this classic and I
do agree with that comment definitely
and then laser lens says I can't see
myself wearing a square on my wrist look
around on your body and you'll notice
that you are curved really not straight
square watches look terrible and aren't
practical I don't agree this is square
watch and I love it it really depends on
your taste and it really depends on how
well it was designed it depends on
quality but I do get your point there is
a sort of nature towards curves but that
doesn't necessarily mean that it applies
to accessories if not that all
smartphones will be round but on
Thursday ask you what do you think
Samson needs to do to improve as the
company hasn't been selling smartphones
really well over the last couple of
quarters asked for the quarter results
we have a thousand three hundred and
ninety comments I think that's a record
guys thanks a lot which is dodgy says
Samson needs to make less phones with
better specifications and better support
you know I'm not going to agree with
everything here they have great
specifications on
every phone at least the high-end phones
and they do offer really good support I
really think that they need to do less
phones yes I do agree or probably find
different name that's not galaxy and
that is what karthi says maybe galaxy
sales are down because people are
waiting for the s5 F or the note for
that could be a good point a lot of
people are waiting for the big revamp of
the iphone 6 a lot of people are waiting
for the buzz behind the Galaxy Note 4 as
well these people are creating their own
demons here they're building up for
other phones that aren't launched yet
and then you know people hold back from
buying and that effect is really
negative in my opinion the minute up
says Samson needs to change their
software get rid of the esta live with
no uses make less phones it gets
confusing with too many options and
maybe try experimenting with new phone
designs cough metal cough they also need
to get their own game with updates no
one wants to wait months for an update
to their phone and yeah exactly that all
that and finally on Friday I asked you
will you prefer moto 360 and plastic
just to get wireless charging we will
allow it to be metal without wireless
charging as the rumors are that it will
be plastic just to be able to bring a
wireless charging plate we have 180
comments out of which Abdul says if it
doesn't love being with plastic I would
like to see the price drop we don't know
what the price is going to be yet too
but yeah sure why not and brendan says I
would prefer if they made two variants
just like the HTC One m8 and EA this way
people would choose what they want and I
agree with that that should be the way
you want wireless charging pay for it
you don't want wireless charging don't
pay for it i prefer metal and finally
jacob says how about a moto 360 be metal
and have wireless charging and start
trying to make a SmartWatch that will
succeed in the industry I love this
comment you are so right the rumors are
that apparently it will be metal and it
will include wireless charging which is
great those are the new of rumors before
these comments and yeah we do need the
SmartWatch market to take off it's been
existing for more than a year and
they've sold less than a million units
combined I believe that's actually
terrible performance we'll see how it
goes because yes we do need the market
to grow it is a good idea but for some
reason people are not really buying into
it that's a far pocket out daily recap
