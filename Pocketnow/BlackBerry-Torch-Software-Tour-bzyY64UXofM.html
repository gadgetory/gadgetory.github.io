we're going to take a look at the some
of the software on this new blackberry
torch with the BlackBerry six operating
system so here we go
right now we have this big clock showing
that's our screen saver I guess so we
can out of that and here's your home
screen your time date up you know the
usual suspect signal strength battery
life over here is the speaker for you
know your profile is silent loud
whatever
I'll leave pressing the blue first thing
the volume buttons on side doesn't let
you access those just doesn't do
anything and here's our notifications
bar you get to see all our notifications
in one place you got messages calendar
Social Feeds myspace Facebook but you
know all those right there that's pretty
nice over here's a search new and it
brings up a keyboard so we can search
for stuff
and that does previously down here is
our little mystery meat icon which is
our application tray so I can also
dragon if I want to resize it and put it
down like that maybe I want to rose and
oddly if this isn't scrollable down
there you have to bring it all the way
up in order to make a scrollable see
that look if I go to the side I can make
some favorites well there's my media
section
yeah the reason is it there's our
downloads and frequent apps
here's a weird bug if I do do this I go
off get stuck there so yeah that's kind
of weird
mm-hmm so let's go back to all and let's
check out some of our programs
what do we have browser aware stuff
visual voicemail calendar Social Feeds
this is a new thing so this is like it
combines MySpace and Facebook updates
and Twitter updates all into one big
list
so you see little myspace icons for
those and Facebook icons for those
so that's kind of cool yeah my sweets
been you can filter them
and we have app world or you can
download new apps
the 18t appcenter just goes to a webpage
we got a greedy
or maybe it will download something yeah
we have to install that I don't feel
like doing that
let's go back sure
it does come with Facebook
if it'll open
there we go
Twitter
currently unavailable
that works pretty good usually myspace
that comes with it as well of course we
got all of them
comes with some instant messaging apps
wonders live you add unnecessary Google
Talk yeah well that's good to have
applications let's see what's in here
just Rayleigh things mobile banking
we got documents to go like versions I
guess yes
premium version you have to pay for
some games yet Sonic 2 bejeweled
brickbreaker and word mole
seen in these are some web pages that
are just application icons
well melanism you gotta download this
one shortcuts to download those programs
which is good I guess because it doesn't
clog up bloatware
and that's about it for the programs
I hold the BlackBerry button we get to
our task manager and uh we're frozen
that's a pretty good bug for freezing up
your BlackBerry you have tap on the
Twitter icon the second Twitter icon and
then my buttons work
see for frozen but I can go to the phone
still my buttons don't work and I can
end a call and now we're back
so another thing I like is the universal
search is really good so I can type
something
that goo and it's gonna search it sees
something an email set up blackberry
messenger myspace is three things and
brings up Google Talk because that's a
possible match and I can even search
google for goo
so those are really nice
browser has multi-touch works okay but
there's no flash support and it can be
kind of slow zoom in doesn't always
rewrap on the effect only if you
DoubleTap that'll fit to the screen size
this blackberry menu I really hate
because you can't see everything at once
yeah tons of things to scroll through
here it's you know mystery meat you know
see that there's menu there you don't
see that there's other options here so
that's kind of pained but I got such
blackberry for you
okay
but also if we got media let's see what
this is about
that's pretty nice pictures viewer Jim
not bad again
mystery meat these buttons mean I don't
know they don't tell me oh if I hold on
it it'll tell me
No No
maybe if I use this nope can't access
them from the pointer
well sometimes a tooltip comes in okay
anyway not very user-friendly videos
there's one that comes with
still low resolution screens to get what
you get
I'll get out here Podcast this is good
program
get your video podcast just like the
ones on your credit card let's get out
of here
hello I'm going back to Stockholm
Bavaria
sir podcast so you can get again more
mystery icons what's that mean
sometimes it shows a tooltip
all right well there we go don't
understand why that only happens
sometimes well still we have YouTube is
just a link to mobile YouTube
just the regular mobile site
we also have Mobe TV which is good but
it's not preloaded you gotta have
download it
snap more shortcuts to applications you
have to download
sanfur Slacker Radio
so I guess it's good that it comes with
not very much but a lot of shortcuts to
programs that yellow so you don't have
to use up all your memory on bundled
programs
perhaps I'm goin otherone you have to
download
so there we go that's what we get with
the blackberry torch and Blackberry six
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
