production with a four-inch screen
mobile me now sounds like a music
streaming service for twenty dollars a
year and the EV SIM card comes to rescue
us in need of an iphone for carrier
unlock all this and more coming up right
now hello everybody I'm high Meadow
Bavetta and welcome to the pocket now I
review the show we go through all this
week school and they're not so cool
inside the old of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off with the cool
more rumors of the iphone 5 come to town
this time the China Times reports of the
device is currently already in trial
production and that it does carry the 4
inch screen inside the current iphone 4
design no word on the fact that they got
rid of the home button or probably made
iOS 5 support dynamic resolutions now
another thing that was barely mentioned
was NFC technology support but no 4G
support was mentioned so we'll see what
happens in the end great news for those
of us in need of a carrier unlock GV
gevey or gevey whatever it's called has
just released a specific sin card chip
that allows carrier unlocks on your
iPhone 4 through Hardware no matter what
baseband you have the way it works is
that this little chip inside a specific
new SIM tray that they provide will be
swapped inside your device with the SIM
card and once that's done you dial the
emergency phone number of your country
wait for two seconds and then hang up
and then put your phone on airplane mode
a couple of times until you get the
carrier unlock now it can't be confirmed
that it works a lot of people have said
that as does but we've got your back it
costs 70 dollars so we just order ours
and just wait a couple of weeks for us
to get it and tell you if it does work
or not so far we are expecting and
crossing our fingers that it does work
rumors of mobileme keep coming this time
in word of a musical digital Locker for
twenty dollars a year the way this works
is that you currently can get all your
itunes purchases in the cloud and don't
necessarily have to download them why is
this cool well in the past that you had
more than one iOS device and you want it
to sink your music between devices you
needed a wire this time all you need is
your iTunes account to log on to
mobileme and download the songs that you
want or stream them in the end again
these are just rumors so we'll see what
happens
now if you had any doubts on your iphone
4s design being sturdy ask Air Force
combat controller Ron Walker who stuck
half his body outside of moving airplane
at 1000 feet only to look at landmarks
and well his iphone 4 fell off his
pocket fell 1,000 feet and well when he
came back to the ground he started
looking for the device and noticed that
Find My iPhone was still working he
found the device and it was intact no
scratches or anything really makes you
wonder if these glass gate rumors were
really true or this is just a viral
video anyways well it seems iOS 4.3
point one has already been leaked to BGR
and a sort of a weird way because these
updates barely make it to developers
before they make it into our hands now
call this a great work a photoshop as
you may but it seems that this update
only brings a lot of bug fixes and even
fix us to the exploits that allow
jailbreak so beware on that update when
it comes out in the next couple of weeks
that does it for the cool let's continue
on with the not so cool Steve Jobs is
still on medical leave but it seems that
he's still there for the big projects
and even his famous micromanagement this
time he was personally in charge of
blocking an iOS application that gave
you information on radiation emissions
to your head now even though you know
it's not really going to keep me from
sending my iphone4 back just because of
this information it gets you to wonder
what's wrong with Apple blocking content
just because it gives you transparent
information on your device weird and
well Apple didn't wait one day to sue
amazon for releasing an android app
store just because they use the same
name app store I don't see Ford suing
anybody for calling their cars a car
like Toyota for example who also builds
vehicles just like four does so just
beware because it seems that apple will
sue you if you call your phone a phone
just because they trademark the name to
anyways and well with all the news of a
TNT buying t-mobile everybody went crazy
in the media about the fact that the
iphone was going to make it to tmobile
but just wait I mean t-mobile released
the fact specifically to tell people
sorry guys we're not going to get the
iphone 4 so if you want your device
legally you're going to probably have to
wait a year before the magenta turns
into orange and blue sadly that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm high medal you better
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
