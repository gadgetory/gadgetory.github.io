pocketnow.com right now we are recording
a phone call through Skype we're going
to test the noise cancellation on the
iPhone 4 the iPhone 4 has two
microphones one located on the bottom of
the phone and one on the top of the
phone to provide noise cancellation
the only other smartphones I know of
that can do this is the Google Nexus One
so I'm going to test the noise
cancellation with three scenarios one
with sort of a gentle hum in the
background in front of an air
conditioner number two in front of a fan
to kind of simulate being outside on a
very windy day number three playing loud
rock music kind of as if you are at a
rock concert or a bar stadium or just
somewhere where there's a tremendous
amount of background noise so right now
I am walking up to the air conditioner
and I'm standing in front of the air
conditioner it's kind of a gentle not
terribly loud kind of a beefy sound so
hopefully this is coming through alright
what usually happens on the iPhone for
noise cancellation is that it starts out
kind of loud but then the software works
and then it becomes quiet okay that was
test number one I'm walking over to the
fan to simulate being outside on a windy
day you're probably not going to hear me
because it takes for the iPhone to cut
down the noise I'm going to jack up some
loud music sort of as if we were at a
rock concert so scream aloud so loud
that I hear myself talk so if your knees
off and the noise cancellation during my
very good job cutting down the
background really wow that was loud
so that's it for the test on the noise
cancellation of the iPhone 4 hopefully
it worked
please leave a comment below the video
and let me know is it did work that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
