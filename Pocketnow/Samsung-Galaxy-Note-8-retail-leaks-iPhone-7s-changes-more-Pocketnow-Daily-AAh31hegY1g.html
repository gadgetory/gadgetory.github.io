its Galaxy Note 8 ahead of a launch
iPhone 7s CAD renders show us that a
phone will be in will not be different
and Google brings some interesting deals
ahead of Android O's announcement
I'm Jaime Rivera and expect Android code
news tomorrow
this was actually recorded early mainly
to be able to attend to certain events
and don't worry this is not my attire
this is PocketNow daily official loose
today start with deals of here in the
market for a Wi-Fi router and Google
home and whatever there are some very
interesting bundles for the Google home
and Google Wi-Fi bundled together and
these kind of vary depending if you buy
it on the Google store or on Amazon or
on target so you can learn more about
these in the delimited description
another company that is finally offering
deals and I mean finally as HTC with the
vive I mean we've seen oculus drop the
price of the rift for the past couple of
months pretty much almost $200 and as it
stands you can now get an HTC vive with
an apparent permanent discount of $200
so yeah $5.99 instead of $7.99 is a
compelling or not it'll all depend on
when we get the next vive which I think
could be soon now sorry will be iphone 7
iphone 7 s plus for those of you
wondering of these will follow the same
trend of Apple in keeping the same
design aesthetics of the past well it
seems that they won't we've seen leaked
images of glass and metal and now we see
some leaked CAD renders that show with
the glass and metal are there apparently
there is also a leak for the wireless
charging module and even more
interesting is that the source claims
that these phones will bring B 811 chip
so there is a lot of change coming to
this iPhone 7 7 S Plus let's see how
that goes
and speaking of leaks famous hipster
Evan glass has been showing us what the
gear fit 2 Pro from Samsung would look
like the design looks great and the
specifications are also great but for
those of you wondering exactly when this
product will be available it seems that
it should be available in the next few
months and the price tag should be
somewhere around $200 so expect that
announcement of Aoife I mean the gear
fit 2 is probably one of my favorite
wearables for fitness and this one
should just be better and finally the
very interesting rumor should they have
to do with a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 in
both teaser
years and also leaks the teasers are two
videos that Samsung has published where
they show is things like the features of
the S Pen which is expected and then the
second is the probability of a zoom lens
so yeah that's what the secondary camera
lens is going to be for but then most
important is the leak that Samsung
pretty much showed in their u.s. website
where we saw the phone and its full
glory being available for sale that
happened on Friday by the way so yeah
this is pretty much a confirmation that
the device will be called the Galaxy
Note 8 8 being stuck to the note name
just as it has for the past couple of
years it leads me to the question today
I mean with all the rumors and
everything do you think that it's smart
for Samsung to call this the Galaxy Note
8 especially after everything that
happened with a note 7 in my case I
think that there is nothing wrong with
it but hey leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion brennan's
you know the way it goes if you want to
get the news earlier before the video
was filmed but was I'm talking about
comments a structure our channel as well
for more videos like this one you can
also follow me on Twitter Jaime
underscore Yvette are on Instagram but
hi Milly better please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw I am
