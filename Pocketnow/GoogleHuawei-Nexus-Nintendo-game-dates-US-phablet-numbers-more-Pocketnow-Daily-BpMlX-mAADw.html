will once again be a phablet Nintendo
shares a timetable for when we could
expect its mobile games and it seems
that the US market has fallen in love
with phablets I'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter
with so much work on a Friday that only
a beer would help me through it this is
parking out daily we have a lot of
official news today starting with
Nintendo the company has come on record
to confirm when we can expect mobile
games in a very vague way because well
they've confirmed that they plan to
launch up to five listen five new games
between now and 2017 five games and the
home oh my god this is like almost three
years two years I know but Mike that's
just crazy but yet Nintendo is planning
to do that remember new games we're not
talking about ports to existing ones
let's see when the first one comes in
another official news today is etes
launch up this Nubia z-9 that we've been
covering for a couple of weeks now
what's cool about the smartphone is that
it has no bezels with beat Oppo to the
punch for the r7 and other cool things
about this photo the fact that it's
really not admit to your device this is
a flagship phone we've got a Snapdragon
810 processor we've got various options
for RAM and storage and depending on
that as the price tag and yeah you also
get a 1080p display with that and it's a
really cool design that allows you to
use the bezels as a way to operate the
phone we'll keep you posted as soon as
our review unit arrives Samsung has also
made its gear VR for the galaxy s6
official you can pick it up at best buy
today for two hundred dollars a really
decent price and if you're wondering if
it's really worth a divide this product
I would say it is I would definitely buy
it if I had a galaxy s6 mainly because
the whole experience playing games is
actually very cool just keep in mind
while the battery life shot the galaxy
s6 is not the best so that's the only
caveat for those of you asking us on
Twitter when is the next Nexus
smartphone going to be launched by
google it seems to the program will
continue we've heard rumors that it's
coming from China and we've got trusted
sources now claiming that the OEM will
be Huawei and particularly
the interesting news today is that
apparently it will be a phablet again
hopefully not the same price tag but
seems we're getting a 5.7 inch quad HD
display and this display will be an oled
display provided by Samsung in addition
to a Snapdragon 810 processor which is
really interesting because if it's an
810 we wonder if we're going to wait
much for this phone will probably learn
more Google i/o and finally for the very
hot news of the day we've got some
statistics over the phablet market in
the United States and this is a true
shocker first of all between q1 2014 and
Q 1 2015 the market has grown four times
which is crazy it's currently making
twenty one percent of the smartphone
market in the United States and if you
wonder which is the company that's
owning it Apple forty-four percent of
the phablet market though we don't get
any news on the galaxy note 4 given this
is the first phablet ever and yeah it
should be up there but we don't really
have any details it's really interesting
how big phones are becoming a thing
lately up to the point where phablets
are on the klein and it leads me to the
question of the day if you had to pick a
phablet today which one would you buy if
you had the money and wanted to buy a
phablet which one would you buy which
one you have in my case the Galaxy Note
lineup will always be my preferred
phablet not because it's a samsung phone
or because of the s-pen I just feel that
it give me more for my money but that's
my opinion it was a comment down below
