Pocono calm and one of the cool thing
about android or windows mobile devices
or pretty much any other smartphone out
there is that you're allowed to download
torrents directly to your device so the
program i'm going to show you today is
called an torrent and it's a pretty
powerful application and one of the
highest rated on the android market so
let's get started okay so here i am on
an torrent and the first thing i'm going
to do is actually go into the settings
here and give you a little demonstration
so we can change our maximum connections
and maximum leechers and we can also
change your default search so this
program will search through different
torrent sites and I have it set to be
deep junkie right now sam's gonna cancel
and we can also change the start
download on load and auto stop download
if we want and also our default
directory so i'll just go back and go
down to menu again and search and let's
try something that's pretty popular
let's try avatar and you search for that
and it came out pretty quickly so as you
see we have all these different types of
files with avatar movie of course and we
can also see how many seeds there are
and how many leechers there are and of
course the higher number of the seeds
the more quickly that the download will
occur so we're just going to go back and
if I want to add a torrent from a file
all I have to do is go down here to add
torrent and let's see here I think it's
under downloads and there it is avatar
dvdrip so I can click there and there is
my torrent file now downloading of
course it does take a few minutes for it
to upload and download on to the torrent
websites so I'm just going to stop this
download so this is another Android
Market pick and the application is
called an torrent and it costs four
dollars and ninety-nine cents on android
market thanks for watching and if at any
time you want to download this program
to your device just navigate using
google goggles to the image of the QR
code on the screen and snap a picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
