official and we already begun to give it
a try some early leaks of the Moto Z
showed us moto maker is here to stay and
t-mobile has just decided to turn
customers into owners with uncarrier 11
I'm high Meadow iveta and for those of
you curious over how I get these
t-shirts follow the first link in the
description to RIPT apparel com they got
amazing designs this is pocket out daily
the official news today begin with
tmobile as the company's on carrier 11
is now official and you get a couple of
things starting with tmobile Tuesday's
where you'll get free pizza movie
tickets you name it and every week you
get a new deal every Tuesday and some
gift or something but even more
interesting is the company's new stock
up option where customers actually are
entitled to company stock and if they
recommend the company to other people
for every person they add that's another
stock option it's crazy and it's very
daring from t-mobile but hey it's gonna
take them somewhere I think and speaking
of carriers and daring moves a sprint to
just showed us what their 5g network is
going to be like in a recent game from
co-op America which is a interesting
it's on their 2.5 gigahertz spectrum
which scratches the surface of what 5g
is in theory obviously we weren't there
to test exactly how good 5g is because
well current smartphones are in a way
compatible with it let's just see when
sprint plans to expand it to other
markets and speaking of teasers 1 + CEO
just recently decided to show us what
the camera of the 1 plus 3 is capable of
and the reason stills that we saw this
is a very capable camera does seem like
of one plusses upping the ante in image
quality and we've seen a lot to expect
from the paperwork in the specifications
and obviously in optimum conditions any
camera performs well so we cannot wait
to get our review unit to tell you more
and from teasers we move into leaks
those of you that are wondering if the
Moto Z will retain that moto maker
mentality apparently it will there are
some leaked photos of the Moto Z back in
the
front options you have for bamboo and
other wooden options and colors etc
we're not exactly sure if these are
replaceable backstreet of this means
moto maker will continue existing but
everything points to that happening and
it would be awesome if that's the case
though I would love replaceable backs as
well let's see what we get in the act
and finally the very hot news today have
to do with the new Samsung Galaxy s7
active we've been covering leaks for a
while and well we've actually had this
review unit since last Thursday and
there's a lot to talk about this phone
obviously our review period has just
begun juan has just published his first
impressions of his unit and now I have
to work on mine and so far I'll tell you
this much you think that this is just
the Galaxy s7 with a case in theory it
would be but it's actually more than
that up to the point where it leads me
to the question of the day what kind of
tests would you like us to conduct on
this galaxy s7 active going forward by
24 hours video is going to be published
very soon and we'd love to test it out
though I'm not a fan of torture test
because that's not how people use phones
in the real world they don't torture a
phone intentionally be more creative
we'd love to see what you want us to do
