the tablet to talk about if you were
talking about large Samsung devices not
anymore
it CES 2014 i'm michael fisher with
pocket now we're checking out the note
12 to the Note pro 12.2 we'll see how it
compares in a very vague non-committal
kind of way sound like fun good let's do
it so yes this was large not long ago
but not anymore because now but this is
the new large 12.2 10.1 most obvious
differences of course size what you
might not expect of course is that the
feel in hand not all that different
dudes the 10.1 the 12 dots you very very
very big difference in size tailor can't
even get them both in the same shot
there's the overlap shot look how much
more screen real estate you have and
look how many things pop up when you hit
the wrong buttons on the 10.1 but the
feeling hand 10.1 I can hold relatively
easily in landscape and I really don't
feel too bad about it that's the one low
point of the 12.2 yes you can hold it
one-handed in landscape but guys at
seven hundred and grams and change
depending on the version you get to
Wi-Fi or LTE this is uh this is beefy
he's a two-handed tablet
no real surprise there but my original
point of course was that they feel in
hand when you are using a two-handed
it's not all that different on the 12.2
inches unit
then on the 10.1 entry really not an
encumbrance and in exchange you get a
whole lot more display real-estate specs
are comparable three gigs of RAM on each
XO notes or Snapdragon 800 depend on
what your what you're looking at in
terms of Wi-Fi or LTE eight megapixel
cameras around back two megapixel
cameras up front etc and of course the
s-pen the biggest difference of course
being that pretend odd one runs on the
old TouchWiz the variant of the nature
UX customized in this case by our own
tailor Martin whereas the 12.2 features
the new redesign of Samsung's user
interface the one we've seen on all of
the tablets here at CES 2014 and one
that we are frankly very very refreshed
to see may not be for everybody it may
not be for you but the amount of
customizability the amount of
information density you can get even on
a large panel such as this is really
really quite impressive so we have to
say kudos to Samsung and finally not to
say waking up maybe that's too cruel but
finally maybe coming into 2014 or right
on time
in terms of software
a lot more to say on both of these
devices but for now a quick look at how
the 10.1 compares to the 12 to the note
versus the note Pro at CES Las Vegas
