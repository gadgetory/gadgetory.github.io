easy a few years ago each had its own
set of compromises that make the choice
of no-brainer 2016 is a very different
animal and with three great galaxies
flagships the stakes are rather high I'm
high memory VAT with pocket now and this
is galaxy s7 active versus galaxy s7 and
galaxy s7 edge
if we were comparing vehicles the galaxy
s7 would be the sedan the s7 edge would
be the higher trim and well the galaxy
s7 active would be the truck in the past
if you went active you'd have to put up
with a certain degree of compromise over
the flagship siblings but in 2016 there
is no compromising and buying into the
truck some claim to the galaxy s7 active
is really just an s7 with a rugged case
but that would be overlooking a ton of
the benefits of going active for
starters the average rugged case doesn't
make your existing display shadow
resistant and even though some narrow
few include an extended battery none
result in a sleek device like what we
have with the galaxy s7 active to be
fair the S of an active isn't really
what we call a beast compared to its
siblings the edge is obviously a hair
taller but the active is really just 5%
taller and eight percent wider than the
standard galaxy s7 and the 20% in added
thickness is understandable if you're
getting 30% more battery power it's
simply not as pretty as the others but
even that territory is subjective the
look and the feel are matters of taste
the first two galaxy iterations were
designed with the intent of creating the
same level of desire you could have for
a piece of jewelry the glass and the
aluminium is both elegant to see and
cool to feel in the hand in addition to
easy to smudge as well by contrast the
s7 act that feels soft around the
borders with a one feel to the metallic
sides and some extra grip enos to the
back
neither phone really feels cheap by any
means but this is probably the most
substantial difference in day-to-day use
internals are really no different
you have the same snapdragon 820
processor four gigs of ram and 32 gigs
of expandable storage the same antenna
bans Wi-Fi fast fingerprint scanners and
about the only change is the differences
in battery that we've already discussed
the four thousand milliamp hour power
pack of the active didn't do so well in
our first tests
I've been able to nail a solid six hours
of battery-life after that which is
simply awesome keep in mind that the
other two siblings don't fall far behind
though as the edge will give me around
five hours of screen on time and then
the regular would give me four all three
devices sport a gorgeous AMOLED panel
that ranges from 5.1 inches to 5.5 and
even with the added polycarbonate layer
for shatterproof protection of the
active you can't really tell the
difference viewing angles are crisp and
punchy color along with one of the best
always-on displays of the market all
come standard this is where products
like the edge do a good job at shining
just as much as being annoying the edge
display provides a window to quick
shortcuts to different features though
all at the expense of the phone feeling
rather awkward to hold in turn scenarios
the active doesn't really have a curve
to show off but it's got an action
button that I find more convenient you
can set it up to up to three
customization options and I do love the
activity zone mainly because the comp
ass is always permanently active while
in the case of the edge you always have
to force and fumble around to make it
work and the s7 well you don't get any
of that the software story is not even
worth spending time comparing if you've
seen one you've pretty much seen them
all all three devices run the same
version of TouchWiz on top of
marshmallow all three allow for theming
in addition to larger grid options and
some very useful widgets and yes all
three have the most annoying app tray
that doesn't follow alphabetical order
you'd think that Samsung would bundle at
least a few wallpapers that are focused
on the market that caters to the active
but there's just one and I did not
really like it looks aside all three are
extremely snappy and everything except
the Flipboard menu that you can easily
disable whether you're navigating
through menus or playing graphics
intensive games the experience of all
three devices is very pleasant if not
for the major differences in the edge
features or the active button you really
can't tell each phone apart for some
this is good but I find it unfortunate
that the active wasn't given more active
software features
like what we see with the recent Casio
Android wear offerings where the
difference is sore is when using these
phones in day to day all three devices
are ip68 water in dust resistant but if
you've ever taken the galaxy s7 to a
pool you'll know how the water activates
the capacitive keys automatically making
the experience of taking the photo a
true nightmare at times that's where the
active comes in handy as the physical
buttons work in any scenario even though
at the expense of these not lighting up
the milspec 810g also takes the act of a
step further by providing shock
resistance in addition to the ability to
survive saltwater solar radiation you
name it just keep in mind this is a
rugged phone it's not indestructible
phone calls sound just as great on all
three devices data speeds soar in the
toughest of areas and anyone who told
you that the speaker on the activists
bad is probably over exaggerating the
differences are really negligible and
about the only thing I don't like about
the active in the audio department is
the placement of the headphone jack at
the top the camera is also the same
story there's really nothing to even
compare here all three cameras support
the same optically stabilized 12
megapixel sensor with a face detection
autofocus and F 1.7 aperture in addition
to a 5-megapixel selfie shooter that
shares the same aperture all three
cameras are launched through the
DoubleTap to the home button and then
offer the same software and same
features and all are still regarded as
today's best cameras for smartphone in
2016
great color saturation contrast in
detail amazing low-light and in case of
video recording you also have some of
the best double is a ssin you can ask
for whether you're going on a hike or
just your typical walk in the city
either of these cameras just going to do
you just fine the bottom line is that
2016 is clearly the year of the galaxy
s7 and this time there are three flak
ships for you to choose from
the times when going active were a
reason to compromise or long gone and at
this point I even say that the active
button the milspec 810g
and the added battery are enough to make
me consider being an active user the
fact that Samsung even decided to launch
a golden variant catered to moms is a
clear indication that this phone was not
designed only for construction workers
about the only problem that I find would
be active is that well you have to be on
a TMT to be able to use it if you're
more of a business type or casual and
you're looking for gorgeous device in
both look and feel the galaxy s7 or
galaxy s7 edge or definitely the way to
go so long as you don't use a case
because then that would completely
defeat the purpose of the design now if
you're a gym junkie the average person
who loves hiking outdoors going out
running going fishing or simply lives an
active lifestyle or hey it's just the
average clumsy person who doesn't want
compromise for the price tag of the
galaxy s7 edge
I would definitely prefer to go for the
active it's just better to go for the
peace of mind overall folks our coverage
