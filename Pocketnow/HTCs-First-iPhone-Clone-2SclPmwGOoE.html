we've got a special throwback for you
today
now this is one of HTC's first iphone
clones may have heard about how Apple is
suing HTC about patent infringement now
this device came out in 2003 I bought it
from a guy in Dubai because that was the
only place to get it at the time so come
on let's check it out
oh what was that you said the iPhone
wasn't reached until 2007 and here is
the HTC Himalaya this was released in
September of 2003 also known as the I'm
8 Pocket PC phone Edition and here we've
got a 3.5 inch screen you know very
large compared to may of the devices
from just a few years ago we have
hardware buttons at the top those can be
assigned to whatever application you
want
here's your speaker you have a five way
directional pad a very nice feel to it
with the action button in the middle and
you have your call send and end buttons
as well as a microphone down here the
screen is inset so you got a little
bezel there at the top we have our power
button LED indicator light infrared port
yeah you guys probably don't even know
what that is and a full SD card slot
over here we've got the stylus silo this
is very hefty stylus nice fit the bottom
is your sink port it's a proprietary and
a little rubber flap covering a 2.5
millimeter headset jack back when you
know those were popular over here we
have a reset button
and then up here we have a couple more
customizable buttons this one is a voice
recorder this is volume up and down and
this is for the camera and on the back
we have a VGA camera this is their
mirror so you can see yourself and this
is a antenna extender you got a little
rubber thing covering that and here's a
battery cover latch so you press the
little button that comes to off of a
battery there's another latch to our
release the battery and here it's an
expansion port there was an accessory
you could get to replace the battery
cover that also allowed you vga output
to a projector so if you wanted to show
some PowerPoint presentations now
originally this came with Windows Mobile
2003 but it's since been upgraded to
Windows Mobile 5 so let's take a look at
that
when does mobile 5 introduced our soft
key menus at the bottom and we've got
our Start menu see the today's screen
looks pretty familiar to Windows Mobile
6 and 6.1 and you know you got your date
and everything calendar that's all
customizable just as it always was we
have our Start menu same as everything
camera see how that works just fine
and file explorer of course you can see
how quick this is pretty easy to browse
and let's just where do we have we got a
video here
check out that video quality really nice
actually you gotta consider that this is
this phone was made during a time when
Apple was making iPods with grayscale
screens a little hardware clicker
buttons we've got a phone really nice
video coffee in addition while this is
Windows Media Player so of course it
syncs with your desktop computer for mp3
files you got your big SD slot so plenty
of music we've also got Internet
Explorer and if I can press it
say got a full HTML browser again at a
time when nothing else was really
capable of doing this
you've got notes of course voice
recording exchange push syncing tasks
PowerPoint
Office Mobile looks pretty much the same
as it always has
games bubble breaker and solitaire array
messaging of course we got outlook
calendar
and there's the phone dialer
now this was actually the first Pocket
PC phone that doesn't have an antenna
sticking out it's an internal antenna
there's also the first Pocket PC phone
with Bluetooth support you see my
Bluetooth light blinking over here so
that meant you could use a Bluetooth
headset and you could also use a
Bluetooth GPS so you can get your GPS
navigation instructions using any and
indeed you know half dozen GPS programs
that were around at the time so you
could hear your voice prompting
navigation instructions and have your
Bluetooth headset for making phone calls
while also listening to music through
Windows Media Player all at the same
time now back in 2003 here's another
thing I want to show you for the
Himalaya this is the dock that's what it
came with and this goes plugs into USB
and we have a nice little cradle for it
but we also have a battery charger so
there's the cradle and we also have a
microphone for speaker
this is a little light indicator for the
secondary battery for one last charging
so you could you know use up your
battery here swap it into the fresh
battery real easily really a great
innovative pocket pc phone from 2003
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
