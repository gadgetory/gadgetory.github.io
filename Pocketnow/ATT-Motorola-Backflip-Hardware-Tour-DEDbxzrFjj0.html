pocket now calm and this is a look at
the motorola backflip which is eight
EMTs first android device it's running
android 1.5 and it has a really
interesting form factor then we're going
to talk about in detail in just a minute
but first let's talk about the hardware
on the front of the device I'm going to
zoom into the top here up here we have
the motorola logo plus the speaker and
also a proximity sensor and a light
sensor that you really can't see right
now zooming out a little bit we have a
three point one inch capacitive screen
the software on the phone does not
support multitouch so you can't pinch to
zoom on photos or on the web which is
very unfortunate going down a little bit
we have the typical android buttons a
button for menu button for home button
for back and everything is very flush
and flat on the front of the device
there's no raised ridges for you to feel
the buttons which is good and it's bad
it's good because it makes it look sleek
and it's bad because you really can't
feel for these buttons too well and by
the by the way the screen resolution is
hvga which is 480 down and 320 across
now let's take a look around the device
over here on the left side we have the
hinge it's a very wide hinge very sturdy
on the bottom there is nothing its
overall a thick device thanks to this
extra keyboard that we're going to talk
about down here here's the dual action
camera button for the 5 megapixel camera
we'll talk more about photo quality
later there's a micro USB port that's
used for syncing and charging a volume
rocker up here at the top we to 3.5
millimeter headphone jack for audio and
the on / standby button so let's flip
open the keyboard here and as you can
see there is a keyboard on the back of
the backflip that's why they call it the
backflip kind of interesting if we slide
this open we get to see this track pat
on the back of the screen it's very
unconventional to see this and it's
pretty cool to have but it doesn't have
as much usability as it really could it
doesn't really live up to its potential
back here we have a piece of metal for
the for the battery cover which we can
take off by just sliding the Stover and
it comes with a 2 gigabyte microSD card
quite nice so we can slide this back on
okay so the idea behind the trackpad is
that so that you don't have to keep your
fingers on the screen to cover up screen
contents you can move your finger to it
back and kind of scroll up and down in a
web page or at a list you can also
scroll side to side kind of as a d-pad
and you can tap it gently to select it's
it's a good idea to not have to cover up
the screen to move around on certain
screen elements the trouble is that you
always have to have the keyboard open in
order to use it so you can't use it
quickly if you're trying to dial
somebody's name we're just moving around
a web page you're probably going to use
the web most of the time in this
orientation just because you're trying
to get to a website quickly so having it
only display when you have the the
device open it's a little bit cumbersome
let's talk a little bit about this
keyboard the keyboard actually has the
camera embedded right into it because
it's on the back of the device where
else would it go it's five megapixel
camera with a flash we've got a cool
edge to edge design here and if you move
it in the light you can kind of see the
different design the keys are laid out
in a grid making a little bit difficult
to type they're not staggered like you'd
find on sort of other devices like touch
pro 2 and up here with a search button a
quick link to AT&amp;amp;T s website don't think
I'm going to be using that we have an
alt button to get to these numbers and
if you don't find the symbol that you
want you can type the symbol button here
and get to that we have a quick link to
messaging ok we have a d-pad here a lot
of d-pads here one on the back of the
screen one down here and also you know
standard backspace and other things like
that the keys are slightly raised as you
can probably tell in the video here
they're not flat which is good they're
plastic and actually the entire phone is
plastic but it has a high quality feel
which is nice but it does indeed feel
thick because of this just large size I
don't I don't consider this device to be
elegant it's a little bit rugged a
little bit crude but I think its
intended for younger audiences who wants
something a little bit quirky and
interesting and really that's that's
where this backflipping keyboard comes
in so
up soon we're going to talk about the
software the motoblur interface on top
of Android we're also going to talk
about the general user experience how it
is with email and calls and how the
photo quality is and all that sort of
stuff and if you like our videos be sure
