a number for samsung HTC one wins the
best mobile world at mwc and we wrap up
on the musi 2013 I'm hi Mary vetta and
you can bet that I'm going to end this
month with a good dose of beer this is
poking out daily for those of you
wondering what the galaxy s4 branding
would look like well wait no more
Samsung is Justin out press invites for
an unpacked event to happen live in
Times Square on march 14th at 7pm set
your calendars in clock because we're
going to be there covering it live but
the point being is that they're using
the number four and wait for the next
galaxy and the invites so for the first
time they're actually not going to be
using the numeral it's going to be the
number four to be called for the galaxy
s4 to stay tuned then of course we'll
see you there now let's talk about HTC
even though the company did not launch
the HTC One at mwc 2013 they didn't use
the show for the devil the device and
well they just won the best mwc award
because well let's face it it's a
beautiful phone it really is and it
brings a lot of innovations to the table
we're still kind of skeptical about that
for megapixel camera which will
obviously prove once we have the device
in our pocket now laughter review so
stay tuned obviously we'll keep you
posted if that camera is as great as HTC
says it is even though pointing to that
megapixels don't count now let's talk a
little more HD see if any of you like
the features that come in HTC Sense 5 on
the HTC One series well you're kind of
in luck and the reason why I say kind of
is because if you're using an
international variant of the One X one
x+ the butterfly and the 1s then you
will be getting HTC Sense 5 in sometime
within the year there are no dates
confirmed but sadly we still can't
confirm this will come to the carriers
in the United States and obviously we
know how that works it's not really
HTC's fault is more the carriers but
we'll keep you posted once these
features and launches come because we're
definitely waiting for them and for all
11 of you that are having issues with
the live tiles on windows phone 7.8 well
you're not alone Microsoft has just
confirmed that there is an issue with
the live tiles and they're probably
working on a fixed sooner than later
now if you're not noticing any issues
that's because most of the problems are
happening under the hood look at your
data consumption because apparently it's
taking up more bandwidth that it's
supposed to so we'll keep you posted
whenever this update comes obviously we
will have a tackle at it but so far as
always with Microsoft you won't get any
dates and finally for the both great and
sad news of the day mwc 2013 is now over
it's been a great week with tons of
content to show you our own Michael
Fisher and Anton de NOC did a fabulous
job in building 35 awesome videos of
everything that happened in the show
floor and you can obviously follow all
of these in the playlist down below but
that leads you to the question of the
day what was your favorite device to be
launched or shown off at mwc 2013 in my
particular case I honestly like the
Galaxy Note 8 the most that's probably
going to be my next tablet when it comes
to smartphones i'll admit that i'm
waiting for the galaxy s4 and see what
happens there but leave us a comment
down below that you have any particular
device that you like that mwc 2013 or
are you waiting for the galaxy s4 as
well leave us a comment as always if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone it's
half the world machine you follow us on
Parker now calm and subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well please give this
