popular Android widgets around and it's
all about the extensions I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and these are
the best extensions for your - clock
widget widgets are undoubtedly one of
the best parts of the Android experience
they offer at a glance information and
turn what might otherwise be a boring
homescreen into something that looks
great or is interactive or even both one
of the most popular widgets available
today was made by one of Google's own
Roman Nurik and is called - clock widget
on the surface it looks like nothing
more than a standard clock widget that
displays a few bits of information but
it doesn't take a lot of digging to
realize there's a lot more to it than
that
within the settings sure you can tweak
the appearance of the widget change the
clock and date style the opacity of the
background and you can even change the
color of the text in the daydream mode
but as soon as you enter - clock
settings you're met with the defining
feature of the widget extensions you can
add and rearrange the order of the
existing extensions and if you hit
action overflow you will be given the
option to get more extensions from
Google Play there are dozens and dozens
maybe even hundreds of - clock
extensions and more are being added as
standalone extensions or packaged within
existing apps all the time to save you
the time and trouble of sifting through
them all we've composed a list of our
favorite - clock extensions most of
these extensions don't do a whole lot
they aren't meant to they're just there
for shortcuts or to display some snippet
of info Google Voice 4 - clock for
example displays your unread count for
Google Voice SMS - clock Hangouts
extension does the same for the hangouts
app and plume extension 4 - clock the
same for the plume twitter client press
has a built in extension 4 - clock which
displays the number of unread articles
and my personal favorite cloud desk
clock extension helps me keep tabs on my
Klout score there are also extensions
for - clock that allow you to monitor
your phone status such as - clock
Hardware extension which displays your
current CPU usage as well as how much
RAM is being used
- clock storage extension helps monitor
how much free storage your device has
left and - clock battery extension as
the name alludes displays your battery
level percentage as well as other useful
formation about your battery usage such
as how long you've been on battery power
temperature
how long until fully depleted or charged
etc we also like to keep up with the
weather at a glance and eye on the sky
weather has a nice extension for - cloud
built into the existing app and we like
to keep track of the sunrise and sunset
times with - o'clock sunrise extension
if you need to keep track of how far
away a certain date or event is count
town - o'clock extension is quite useful
unlike most other extensions it allows
for up to three countdown timers that
can be customized
it's 241 days 8 hours and 19 minutes
until my next birthday and it's 93 days
until Thanksgiving not every extension
for - clock however is simply for
displaying information power lock -
clock + widget is a settings toggle
extension configure the extension to do
what you need in the initial setup and
tap the extension in the widget view it
can toggle Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS and turn
the display off or lock it if you have a
password or PIN set a great use for
daydream mode and from the lock screen
these are the - clock widget extensions
we regularly use but they are many more
we didn't cover so be sure to tell us
your favorite extensions in the comment
section below and answer a question for
us is - clock widget and its many
extensions helpful to you or is it
something you can do without personally
I don't go a day without - clock and at
least a half dozen extensions it's the
epitome of what an Android widget should
be that's going to do it for this video
