September by credible sources case
makers in two additional variants of the
galaxy s5 and microsoft launches office
for iOS or sort of I'm hi Natalie that
and tell me how many of you would like
to pay a hundred dollars for a
spreadsheet raise your hands I know this
is pocket now daily let's actually off
with some official news as Microsoft
this finally announced their version of
Office for iPad Satya Nadella was just
in his first press conference and well
the product is there it's actually free
for download but you can only edit
documents spreadsheets and PowerPoint
presentations if you pay office 365
subscriptions which will amount to a lot
of money every year makes you wonder if
you really really need this but anyways
it's there in the versions for iOS and
Android when it comes to the iphone and
smartphones from android now becomes
free so at least that's a benefit you
could look at your spreadsheet on the
tablet and edit it on your phone right
now let's go through some rumors of
future smartphone launches as the
companies that get it right all the time
or the case makers they get molds of
these phones and they start building
cases even before the phone is made and
we now get some case makers hinting to a
Nokia Lumia 1820 which is interesting
though we don't really know when and
we're also being hinted to future
variants of the galaxy s5 which is the
galaxy s5 zoom the mini and the active
which is interesting great let's see
what we get for the active specifically
as the galaxy s5 is already waterproof
that's how about HTC as the company CEO
peter chu was recently in an interview
and yes that is the correct way to
pronounce it according to chair wang and
he confirmed that he is planning to take
a bite out of ten percent of the
smartphone market with his plans for
2014 and that is really interesting
because uh we know that HTC has really
really had a tough time trying to get
some market share traction even with the
one and the one m8 is pretty much almost
the same phone so hopefully that will be
the case but leave us a comment down
below do you believe they'll be able to
make it i would look for them to and
even though we don't usually talk about
apple patents because they are a lot the
company has just entered this really
interesting one call
transparent texting and the idea is that
whenever you're texting and the phone to
text that you're walking the phone will
actually provide you with a transparent
vision of everything that the cameras
eased in front of it so that you're able
to see everything in the messaging queue
and therefore know where you're going
it's a really interesting patent
hopefully it does make it some time
because it could have warned you from
tripping and if you remember that a
really announcement and add from
Microsoft that would be a cool case and
finally for the very sad news of the day
we get some credible sources saying that
apple will not launch the iphone 6
variants until September and this is the
same source that said that the iphone 5s
and iphone 5c would be announced until
September 2013 and they were exactly
right up to the date so this is quite
credible we don't really know why Apple
will not launch a phone at WWDC as the
rumors pointed that the 4.7 inch iphone
would be announced at WWDC and then the
bigger phablet would be left for
September but anyways that leaves you
sure the question of the day what are
you do for a smartphone upgrader for a
change in your plan I mean how much time
are you really waiting for would you be
getting the one mA the galaxy s spy
where would you be waiting for the
iphone 6 of your do for the fall leave
