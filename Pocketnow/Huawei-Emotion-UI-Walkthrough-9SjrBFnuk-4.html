i'm here with other another michael from
from huawei who's going to show us not
any new hardware this is still the
ascend p1 but it is running Huawei's new
user interface layer called the imagine
you I Michael do if you wouldn't mind
just take us for a quick run around the
software yeah this is called the emotion
UI it's a new thing we invented to make
it simple for the end user so as you can
see you have different home screens as
well as a standard Android for example
but you also see that here is an icon
missing the app launch is simple we did
a lot of research in the US and Europe
and a lot of people coming from
non-smart phones just were confused on
the Android experience because it's some
kind of tacky sure and so we just talked
about okay let's erase the home screen
buttons to erase the app launcher and
make it very easy for the end customer
to have his fullness for example you can
easily have it here and push it to the
next fold up and like this sure somehow
they switch here we go here we go and
you could just name the folders like
games so it's taking that initial the
existing colder functionality and ice
cream sandwich and making it a little
bit simpler yeah what we also have is
it's all the help center so whenever you
do actions which you didn't do before
like switching to the home screens they
will display the first time you using it
it's like a tutorial yeah it's like a
tutorial and you also can access it
afterwards so if you've just forgot
about basic things just go to basic and
then they show you the guest is always
touching hotel does it work late sure
can easily leave engine out and and can
you get to the app launcher itself like
is it possible for a user to but you get
to the app launcher and then new UI or
not exactly like this so we have the
menu and if you want to add widgets or
things to the screen to a folder for
example you can easily hit the plus
button here you can have the application
which you want to include for example
block symbol there press ok and now the
clock symbol is there
very angeleyes you can just have it on
your home screens
you can easily negotiate them that way
is there a positive is what we're
planning on putting this UI on all of
their devices going forward or just the
p line or that's a good question we're
just about to launch it as a beta test
for the p1 okay then we start a forums
contact to the end-user just to get to
know what they're thinking about this
and if it's not received we could
definitely imagine to roll it to the g
series to the y 0 as well and also to
the tablets we'll have to see yeah we
won't have to say of course so it's up
to the end customer we did this for the
investor so he can tell us yes we want
it or no better stick with vanilla and
or whatever okay Michael thank you very
much your local appreciate this been
Michael with Huawei and Michael with
pocket now checking out the new imagine
you I on the huawei hardware here at
