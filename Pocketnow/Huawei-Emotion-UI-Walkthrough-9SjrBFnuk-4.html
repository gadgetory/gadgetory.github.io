I'm here with other another Michael from
from Huawei who's gonna show us not any
new hardware this is still the ascend p1
but it is running while weighs new user
interface layer called the imagine UI
Michael do if you wouldn't mind just
take us for a quick run around the
software yeah this is called the emotion
UI it's a new thing we invented to make
it simple for the end user so as you can
see you have different home screens as
well as a standard Android for example
but you also see that here's an icon
missing the app launch is simple but we
did a lot of research in the US and
Europe and a lot of people coming from
non smartphones just were confused on
the Android experience because it's some
kind of it techie sure and so we just
talked about
ok let's erase the home screen buttons
to erase the app launcher and make it
very easy for the end customer to have
his fullness for example you can easily
have it here and push it to the next
folder like this show
somehow they switch here we go and you
could just name the folders like games
so it's taking that initial the existing
folder functionality and Ice Cream
Sandwich and making it a little bit
simpler yeah
what we also have is it's all the help
center so whenever you do actions which
you didn't do before like switching to
the home screens they will display the
first time you're using it take a
tutorial yeah it's like a tutorial and
you also can access it afterwards so if
you've just forgot about basic things
just go to basic and then they show you
the guess which is touching hotel does
it work
can easily and can you get to the app
launcher itself like is it possible for
a user to but you get to the app
launcher a new UI are not exactly like
this so we have here the menu and if you
want to add widgets or things to the
screen to a folder for example you can
easily hit the plus button here
the application which you want to
include for example block symbol there
press ok and now the clock symbol is
there as well
very angel eyes you can just have it on
your home screens
you can easily negotiate them that way
is there a is what we're planning on
putting this UI on all of their devices
going forward or just the P line or
that's a good question
we're just about to launch it as a beta
test for the p1 okay
then we start a forums contact to the
end user just to get to know what
they're thinking about this and if it's
well received we could definitely
imagine to roll it to the G Series to
the y0 as well and also to the tablets
but we'll have to see
yeah we won't have to say of course so
it's up to the end customer we did this
for the end person so he can tell us yes
we wanted or no rather stick with
vanilla and boy whatever okay Michael
thank you very much you're welcome
appreciate this been Michael with huawei

the new imagine UI on the huawei
