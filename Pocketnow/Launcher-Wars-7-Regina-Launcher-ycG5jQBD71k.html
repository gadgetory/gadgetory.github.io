is its ability to customize its look and
feel just by installing a new app
specifically a launcher so popular and
there's so many out there we've got our
own launcher Wars series today we're
going to talk about lunch or wars 7 the
Regina launcher I'm Joe Levi this is
pocket now let's go take a look the
first thing you're going to notice about
Regina launcher is how heavily into 3d
it is to see exactly how deep all you've
got to do is start looking at your home
screens now take a look at that I'm
actually feeling a vibration as it
changes to each different home screen in
the panel there this is what they call
their cover flow version you can also
change this in the settings to a
circular carousel if you want to do that
but very 3d like very nice very fluid
does take a little bit of a time a
little bit of time to initialize to get
into that but even when you're just
flipping from side to side you have nice
animations nice transitions not quite as
fast but then again it can't be if
you're going to experience those nice
animations and transitions in there
something else you can do if you don't
want to wait for that you can drag your
bar on the bottom left to right just to
switch between them works really well
really intuitive as well I was quite
impressed with how fluid and easy it was
help how simple it was to change
different home screens in three
different manners that I've shown you
here let's go ahead and look at some
other things you'll notice that we've
got kind of an integrated whether with
current time clock actually showing the
time as being zero 559 which means it's
5am even though it's 1759 so it's not
respecting the the time settings as much
as I'd like it but you can come into the
settings notice the nice 3d animation
effect there we can change the hour mode
over to 24 hours right there and that
should take care of my issue we'll go
back now and it should update to the
time now you also noticed an iced
rotating animation everything about
Regina launcher 3d is 3d it is animation
really kind of nice again nice fluid
transitions and animations I've got my
calendar down here for some reason it's
not pulling in my calendar events but I
can tap on them to get into it really
kind of a weird bug there but I think
it's because I've got multiple calendars
set up let's look at another widget this
is my to-do list now these widgets are
kind of there and they're kind of not to
get advantages with all these extra
widgets you have to go to the the play
store and download and install them it's
kind of a pain that you have this cool
launcher then you got to go and get no
another four or five or six widgets to
make it look really cool but you know
that's what they did whether you like it
or not that's what we've got some other
stuff is the the app manager widget and
if we want to add something let's go
ahead and long press you'll notice I've
got this new interface really kind of
cool i can add regina widgets this is
what I've got installed or i can add
regular Android widgets shortcuts or
folders I don't know if you can tell all
that well we've got a tab here and we've
got another tab on the bottom so we can
edit we can edit a work space wallpaper
in this case I've got just this nice
wood grain wallpaper and I can change
the workspace name now workspaces are
kind of interesting I can have an entire
workspace setup for home one set up for
work one set up for even secret if I
want to let's come on back over here
let's just go ahead and add a shortcut
now you are kind of familiar with this
it's the the old gingerbread style let's
add what do we want to add here currents
let's put that on the screen so we'll
just select that and there we have it we
can pick it up and move it to wherever
we have these nice guidelines show me
where I can and can't drop this so
really kind of cool we'll put it right
there in the middle you see that nice
ripple effect whenever I drop something
not really when I add it but when
move something around to another
location now all of this is 3d and we
talked a little bit about wallpapers
you'll notice this is not a live
wallpaper and in fact this is not
compatible with live wallpapers at all
so if that's something you like I'm
sorry you're out of luck but it's
because there's too much of an overhead
to do all of this cool 3d stuff and a
live wallpaper all at the same time so
you just kind of have to live without it
and if that doesn't suit your fancy
there are other launchers you can try
let's go ahead and take a look now in
our app drawer will open that up if you
can tell in the background you have kind
of a ghosted silhouette of your home
screen that you just left and then a
nice animation up here on your paginator
it's got some nice 3d tilting action
going on really quite quick I can flip
through really fast and go back home
really quickly so that's about all it is
if we want to go in and look at settings
there are a few things in here there's
this secret menu that we were talking
about you can either set a password or
just hide it you know if you have I
don't know your android fan by fanboy
secret area I guess you could have and
you'd want to hide that from all of your
android friends but you can do that
workspace transition effect again
coverflow is what we have now circular
rail will switch it to that I can only
do that in the pro version now the
version i'm showing you is free there
are some limitations that's one that you
just saw another one is you're limited
to five workspaces you want more than
that go ahead and pay it's about three
dollars us to get the professional
version but the the standard free
version is every bit as functional as
long as you don't want either one of
those two things that was really all i
could see the difference in vibration if
you don't want to have vibration you
think it's a pain I like it you can turn
it off you can backup and restore you
can turn on and off various different
reflections to help speed things up
magnification you can do that as well
turn it on or off anti-aliasing to
smooth things out scroll effects these
are just speed if you want more speed or
if it's being a little bit too slow and
you want to speed it up to you know a
tolerable level go ahead and play with
though
restart the launcher and of course reset
to defaults which I really like once
you've customized something and mess
around with it you might want to just
start all over again from scratch well
this lets you do it really easily
version 1.2 is what we're showing you
right here it's very nice I've been
running this for some time now and other
than you know a few little quirky things
I haven't noticed any problem with
battery life or any untoward would be
the good word slow down because of all
of the advanced features now this is a
relatively high end phone it's a Galaxy
Nexus gsm so it's a dual-core 1.2 got
plenty of RAM in it so it's near the
high end of the spectrum but overall
I've really liked it once you get
familiar with it and how it works it's
just a joy to use did we miss something
that you wanted to see covered let us
know in the comments over at
pocketnow.com if you like what we're
seeing here with this cool 3d give the
video a big thumbs up and of course head
on over to pocket now so you can stay up
to date on the new upcoming launcher
wars because there's plenty more to
cover showing off Regina launcher in
launcher Wars 74 pocket now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
