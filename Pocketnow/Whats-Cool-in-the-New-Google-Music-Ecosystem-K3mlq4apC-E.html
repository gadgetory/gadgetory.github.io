Google music just came out of beta has a
new app and a bunch of new features
let's go take a look alright so let's go
ahead and take a look at the app itself
we have the same new Google music icon
that we were introduced to with the
honeycomb version of the app that's now
available for Android 2.2 and above
opening that up
this is what I have on my now playing
screen so not a lot has changed there
you can thumbs up or thumbs down a track
if you want it gives you some track
information and of course lets you play
that track so kind of cool stuff there
looking at this in landscape mode gives
you a little bit different view in fact
let's do a some of the more of this
landscape stuff let's go back a little
bit this is the the recent playing
screen and you can see it's really
smooth really kind of cool
it shows what you've played recently in
this really nice fluid carousel we've
seen stuff like that on iOS devices in
the past so it's nothing unusual when
you're looking at that in portrait mode
however it's just straight up and down
but this is just the app this is version
4.0 point 9 point something or other you
can check to see if you've got the
latest version by going into settings
all the way down to the bottom it says
music version 4.0 point nine point five
zero nine right there at the bottom so
this is the latest version that was
released that takes advantage of some of
the the new non-beta features of google
music but lets go away from just the
device for a minute and look at some web
stuff so here we've got a motorola xoom
the zoom out for you there and i will
log in now this may not look like it and
we got some real bad glare going on
sorry about that guys this is a website
this is google.com slash music and you
can see everything
that I've got in my library here all
kinds of fun stuff its girls pretty well
a little bit of graphic weirdness going
on up top but let's see who that and
artist was that we were just listening
to you know what let's let's listen to
some some AFI it's right up here near
the top you can tell the list gets a
little bit long but you do have this
pagination feature over here on the side
that you can kind of see where you are
we'll go into AFI now this works on not
only a large layout but also works on a
smaller screen as well and it works on
even the browser that comes with iOS
devices it works in Safari it works on
Chrome on Mozilla you know all kinds of
stuff so here we've got a fi the the
whole interface is pretty much the same
it's very similar it's reminiscent
enough that you're going to be familiar
with it it's kind of a quiet song to
begin with but really kind of cool now
this is the same library I have this on
my desktop computer I can stream this to
my tablet I can stream this to my phone
it's also suited through my Google ID so
very very nice let's go to another
website now this is going to be the
Android Market so if you go to the
market on your browser this is what
you're going to see it's new you're now
featuring up here in the top you've got
new featured songs as well you also have
a new featured music section over here
and of course they're calling it out
with a shopping music button on the
screen so go ahead and jump into that
we're gonna say that we want to use you
know let's use the the browser for this
demo and then we'll get into the market
in just a minute the market app so
that's gonna load up the new category
that they just created for us being a
little bit slow today because everybody
is hammering it everybody's using it but
here's what we've got top songs staff
picks top albums free song of the day so
you know let's say hey you know we like
Bowie let's go ahead and
do some Bowie here we're gonna again
stick to the browser just for this
demonstration you could have launched
the the market app and and then
essentially the same thing there so if
you want to buy the whole album you can
see here it's now nine dollars and forty
nine cents that's the next big piece of
news Google Checkout and Google Wallet
are now essentially the same thing which
is really a logical connection between
the two I was surprised they didn't do
that in the first place but they're now
wiring that up even when you have a free
track it is still going to to charge you
through your wallet it's going to charge
you nothing but you'll still go through
the the checkout process so and
interesting there and I'm not seeing
that there we go that free song is right
there if we want to listen to a preview
let's cancel that really quick if you
want to listen to a preview you can come
over here and tap on the song and that
gives you a play button which lets you
listen to a full 90 second preview of
the song right there you can decide if
you want it or not
it doesn't look like it registered in my
tap so I'll do that again
but kind of nice there that's really not
what I'm trying to show you though let's
go ahead into this free sound and vision
that brings up the traditional checkout
screen so as you're buying this for free
or you sure you want to do that gives
you a little advertisement on the bottom
we'll go ahead and continue and once
that's done and the purchase has been
made you can see here it's got my Visa
Card
it's charging it nothing I'm gonna
complete the purchase I'm now see
there's that Google Wallet integration I
am now going to be able to get an email
that has this purchase so I have a
receipt and it's now also been added to
my library and is available on my on any
of my apps to be able to stream it so
really kind of cool there so let's let's
come back over here just a minute and
click the close button I don't want to
put that down there
but let's say now we want to come over
here to a similar artist and let's open
this up in the market now this is where
there's some some difference your market
may or may not have the music tab built
in yet don't worry it will
it's just gonna take a little bit of
time to to get that update to everybody
but you can see it's still got pretty
much the same the same interface so here
we are back you can see I don't have
that available to me so let's go back to
the to the web it's not the web back to
that's the market that's music anyway
let me get that set up and we'll be
right back alright so we're back in the
web view of the Android Market this is
the track that I just purchased and you
can see I now have a little share button
right there let's go ahead and share
that now this is sharing it via Google+
and you can see that's what it's doing
over there it's bringing up Google+ a
little bit hesitation there here are
some of my circles I can share this with
the public and I can share this with
anybody I want to any of my circles so
you're familiar with this if you use
Google+ it will then put this snippet
and any comment that you want in that
post and people can then listen to that
entire track once for free now that you
can also do through the music app itself
so let's go back here to teddy bear zero
gravity if we come down to that we now
have the share option so we'll tap on
that once that is done I'm going to add
this to my circles and I've got an
android circle right there so we'll do
that and let's go ahead and share it
with the public as well on song so I've
gone ahead and done that that's
everything that I want to share about it
we'll go ahead and post it's sending
that and unfortunately there was a
problem I'll figure that out and get
that shared for you if you would like to
have a copy or listen to a copy of this
song again one time I'll go ahead and
get that posted on my android circle if
you want to join that wall the link to
that over in the article at
pocketnow.com so you can get all of my
android news in there so you can keep up
with Android on Google+
overall very cool we need to wait for a
couple more days to to get the sharing
stuff taken care of fact let me show you
over here sharing the same song if I can
find it
zero gravity if I open this up there's
the song again go down to the minified
view here's the song you'll notice I
don't have a Share Option on that yet
I assume that's coming soon if I am
wrong let me know in the comments but
overall very cool now the main thing the
coolest thing about this is not all of
this I mean having your music available
for you anywhere that's cool being able
to have your library on multiple devices
that's cool having it all automatic
that's amazing the big change here is
the fact that this now lets artists
upload their tracks and price them just
like they do apps on the market they can
price an entire album they can price
individual songs they can do both they
can relieve stuff for free and there is
the distribution channel all they then
have to do is market it and there
they're making money how much money
seventy percent of the revenue is going
to go to the artist compare that to your
regular recording artists and it's
nowhere near that amount so very cool
for independent artists in fact if
you've got an artist under contract this
is a good way for them to release some
of their unreleased tracks live concerts
and whatnot that may not be under
contract with the big labels and still
be able to to get some revenue coming in
there this I think is going to be a
major shift in music it this is this is
huge more and more independent artists
are going to be able to come and publish
their music more and more songs are
going to be available to you and through
some intelligent technology you can be
able to discover and add similar songs
similar to what pandora is doing to
playlist and track them down and get
recommendations
for artists you may never have heard of
so overall very very cool
this is game-changing and we're just
getting in and getting started in it
very neat if you have any comments or
questions make sure you leave those that
down in the comments below and if you
want to listen to teddy bears zero
gravity make sure you check out the
