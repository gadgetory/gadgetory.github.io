on the Galaxy s5 and on the one I made
so why not give you some for one of
2013's most memorable smartphones I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and here
are three fun things to do on your Moto
X the Moto X is still one of the most
unlikely flagships its specs aren't
terribly impressive its small budget a
standards and its software looks mostly
stock but if you dig just beneath the
surface there are a lot of really cool
features on the Moto X here are three of
those features the first feature is
extremely simple and seems a little
strange at first if you pick up the Moto
X and twist it twice like you would turn
a screwdriver it will launch the camera
you can do this from standby or from
within any application it takes some
getting used to at first but once you
figure out the motion that works best
for you you'll be flicking your wrist
every time you want to launch the camera
another awesome feature on the Moto X is
trusted devices if you secure your
device with a pin password or pattern
lock it can get annoying constantly
having to re-enter it you could
sacrifice some security by extending the
password we prompt time limit or you
could use trusted devices if you connect
a Bluetooth device to your phone
regularly and want to disable your
device security when you're connected to
it add it as a trusted device for
instance if you connect a pebble to your
Moto X as a trusted device the only time
your phone will lock is if your pebble
dies or if you walk out of Bluetooth
range and the pebble disconnects from
the Moto X when they disconnect the
security will be re-enabled
automatically you can do this with your
car stereo bluetooth bluetooth
headphones or any Bluetooth device you
want
finally motorola assist this is one of
the hidden gems of the Moto X there are
four different ways Motorola Assist can
help you when you're driving and a
meeting when you're sleeping or when
you're at home using one of the Moto X
is contextual computing course it can
detect when you're driving and begin
playing music and speak calls and texts
to you you can then speak to the Moto X
and tell it how you want to handle
incoming messages or calls based on your
calendar entries it can also determine
whether you're in a meeting or not it
will silence your phone for the duration
of the meeting and it can auto respond
to text messages with a custom message
when you're sleeping motorola sis works
similarly to the mini do-not-disturb
features out there you can sign with all
incoming notifications between set times
you can tell it to allow a ringer for
favourites or when someone calls twice
finally the newest addition to assist is
a home set your home location and
motorola assist like when you're in the
car will read text messages aloud and
tell you who is calling it's a very
helpful feature when your hands are tied
up washing dishes or playing video games
