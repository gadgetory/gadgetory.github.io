different order home key main menu keep
that key and search key on the back

also the volume rocker alright let's
move on to bigger and better things to
talk a little bit about processors in
the Epic Touch 4G have a 1.2 gigahertz
Exynos dual-core processor the Evo 3d
also has a 1.2 gigahertz it's a Qualcomm
Snapdragon MSM 80 660 dual-core
processor the memory 16 gigabytes of
internal storage on the Epic Touch 4G
3.7 gigabytes of internal storage on the
HTC EVO 3d both offer 1 gigabyte of RAM
as far as Wi-Fi
I've got 802 11 a B G and n support for
DLNA HDMI out to the micro USB port
would be an adapter on the Epic Touch 4G
on the Evo 3d give 802 11 B G and n
support for DLNA and again HDMI out via
micro USB adapter both offer Bluetooth
3.0 is support for a 2 DP the Epic Touch
4G also has support for high-speed data
transfer both out for GPS to support for
a GPS both can be uses Wi-Fi hotspots
operating systems on the Epic Touch 4G
Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread on the evo 3d
2.3.3 Gingerbread the user interface on
the epic Touch 4G is Samsung TouchWiz
4.0 and on the Evo 3d its HTC Sense
version 3.0 time to boot up both of our
combatants ensue we've got four
available RAM on both we got the epic
touch before just fired up
we go let's fire up the Evo 3d HTC and
it's fire it up man we've got the Sprint
preview on both little 4G and here we go
I'll put it up about the same time
that's going to settings and the worse
applications why can't I find out what
I'm looking for there it is
applications running services settings
applications running services showing
577 megabytes of free memory on the Evo
3d and 640 to 640 there abouts on the
Epic Touch 4G so it looks like the epic
text 4G is gonna have around 70
megabytes more of free memory after boot
time to read some of our tests we'll
start with the Quadra Center benchmark
tests and kick those off go to clean
start on both alright let's check our
results on the Epic Touch 4G 29:56
when evo 3d 19:27 so our winner was
definitely the Epic Touch 4G on our
quadrant standard benchmark test next up
I'm gonna run the smart bench test and
we're off good clean start on both and
we have a winner in the Epic Touch 4G
CPU thirty nine ninety seven to twenty
seven fifty two GPU 23:52 1687 and last
but not least let's run the Olympic test
and we'll run single thread and we're
off and we have a winner and the Epic
Touch 4G megaflops at fifty-six point
one eight six and one point four nine
seconds and on the Evo 3d we've got mega
flops forty four point nine two seventy
one point eight seven seconds so we're
all winner on our test at this point has
been the Epic Touch 4G it is time for
artificial speed test so you can see how
download advanced advanced task killer
on both so I just killed all the
background tasks it's going to start
with
try me as close as I can that definitely
looked to be the epic touch 4g let's try
maps again definitely the epic touch 4g
it's going to contacts that look pretty
close but I think it was the epic touch
4g if I'm wrong please let me know let's
try messaging on both not seem to be the
epic Touch 4G let's go to Gmail you know
we got that but it was definitely the
epic Touch 4G again as well let's try to
mark it on both was the epic Touch 4G
let's try the cameras on both that was
definitely the epic Touch 4G let's go to
Fandango third party and let's try that
was that portion up to there would look
to be the epic Touch 4G let's try
playing the trailers on both as well see
you loads quicker
and the winner of loading the trailer
was the Evo 3d overall I have to say the
epic touch 4g was quicker and absolutely
everything except loading the last video
alright try a little gaming on both of
our combatants and we'll start on the
evo 3d and will run the caps of course
one asphalt to remember I'm doing this
to a camera so be gentle with your
opinions I have good start
get off of me buddy Oh
all right there's the epic I mean excuse
me Evo do the same thing on the epic
all right a little bit of gaming on
folder I can badness all right let's
wrap up today's face-off featuring the
Samsung Epic Touch 4G and HTC EVO 3d
with our browser comparison another one
in our pocket now face offs don't forget
after this I'll have a video sample from
each of our combatants yep ik Touch 4G
and HTC EVO 3d all right I've got
running off the boss both off the same
Wi-Fi network their displays are set to
default brightness I've cleared the
cache and history on both them both of
them are fully enabled for flash and
we'll kick this off with paint gadget
and we're off and it looks like a pretty
even race up to this point and our
winner is going to be but Eva 3d looks
like it wants it nope Epic Touch 4G got
there first you can see just how smooth
it is let's try the Evo 3d and again
it's not as smooth not bad as you can
see but it's just not as smooth let's
double tap to zoom in on both give you a
look at the text and pinch to zoom no
problems on either one and both of them
will dynamically rewrap the text to fit
the display which is very slick so
you've got two great browsers you can
see just how smooth it is and how easy
both of them are double tap to zoom all
the way out boom
any rendering issues doesn't look like
it on either one both of them seem to
render everything very well no no wait a
minute one we have here fact I'm almost
missing up at the top we're missing an
add missing some of the portions to the
top here on the Evo 3d so we're entering
a little bit more on the Epic Touch 4G
than what's rendering on the evo 3d all
right what do you see we head over to
the mothership
and check a few things out there smart
phone reviews smartphone reviews and
we're off I think that was pretty close
Wow epic they see the Evo 3d is well out
in front oh and we went to the wrong
version on the Epic Touch 4G let's see
if it can come back and get anywhere
near what the Evo 3d is done wow it's
almost caught up again we're running
through all the flash at this point I'm
guessing the evo 3ds gonna take it we'll
see yep Evo 3d is done pretty smooth too
still waiting on the Epic Touch 4G to
finish loading the flash in there it did
you can see the flashy ads running on
both and again the Epic Touch 4G is
considerably smoother than the Evo 3d
double tap to zoom in I would say of the
browser's I've used on both on Sprint
smartphones these two are definitely the
two best I believe the evo 3d definitely
feels smoother than the Photon 4G in a
Nexus S
if it touches four she was first live in
a page and again you can see just how
smooth it is there's just a little bit
of lag on the evo 3d so there's a look
at our faceoff for each of Epic Touch 4G
HTC EVO three four pocket now this is
Craig don't forget to hang in there and
check out the video examples from each
one of our combatants hope this was
helpful take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
