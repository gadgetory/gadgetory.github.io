and better things talk a little bit
about processors in the epic touch 4G
have a 1.2 gig or hurt xedos dual-core
processor the evo 3d also has a 1.2 gig
earth it's a qualcomm snapdragon MSM
8660 dual-core processor the memory 16
gigabytes of internal storage on the
epic touch 4g 3.7 gigabytes of internal
storage on the HTC evo 3d both offer one
gigabyte of ram as far as Wi-Fi got 802
11 ABG and n support for DLNA HDMI out
to the micro USB port would be an
adapter on the epic touch 4G on the EVO
3d you have 802 11 BG and n support for
DLNA and again HDMI out via micro USB
adapter both offer Bluetooth 3.0 with
support for a2dp the epic touch 4G also
has support for high-speed data transfer
both out for GPS for support for a GPS
both can be uses Wi-Fi hotspots
operating systems on the epic touch 4g
android 2.3 point for Gingerbread on the
EVO 3d two point three point three
gingerbread the user interface on the
epic touch 4G is samsung touchwiz
four-point-oh and on the EVO 3d it's HTC
Sense version 3.0 time to boot up both
of our combatants and see we've got four
available RAM on both we got the epic
touch 4g fired up
we go let's fire up the EVO 3d HTC and
it's fire it up and we've got the sprint
preview on both little 4G and here we go
we'll put it up about the same time it's
going to settings and worse applications
what can I find out what I'm looking for
there it is applications running
services settings applications running
services should I 577 megabytes of free
memory on the EVO 3d and 642 640 there
abouts on the epic touch 4g so it looks
like the epic touch 4g is going to have
around 70 megabytes more of free memory
after boot to enter on some of our tests
will start with the quadra Center
benchmark tests and kick those off go to
clean start on both alright let's check
our results on the epic touch 4g 2956
when evo 3d 1927 so our winner was
definitely the epic touch 4g on our
quadrant standard benchmark test next up
I'm going to run the smart bench test
and we're off good clean start on both
and we have a winner in the epic touch
4g cpu 3997 to 2752 GPU 2352 1687 and
last but not least let's run the Linpack
test and it will run single thread and
we're off and we have a winner and the
epic touch 4g mega flops at 56.1 86 and
one point 49 seconds and on the EVO 3d
we've got mega flops 44.9 272 1.87
seconds so we're all winter on our test
at this point has been the epic touch 4g
it is time for artificial speed test so
you can see I've download advanced
advanced task killer on both so I just
killed
the background tasks it's going to start
with calendar try it as close as I can
that definitely look to be the epic
touch 4g let's try maps again definitely
the epic touch 4g it's going to contacts
that look pretty close but i think it
was the epic touch 4g if i'm wrong
please let me know let's try a messaging
on both not seem to be the epic touch 4g
let's go to gmail and when we got that
but that was definitely the epic touch
4g again as well let's try to mark it on
both was the epic touch 4g i'm sure the
cameras on both i was definitely the
epic touch 4g let's go to Fandango third
party and let's try that was that
portion up to their would look to be the
epic touch 4g let's try playing the
trailers on both as well see you loads
quicker
and the winner of loading the trailer
was the evo 3d overall I have to say the
epic touch 4G was quicker and absolutely
everything except loading the last video
all right try a little gaming on both of
our combatants and we'll start on the
EVO 3d and we'll run a castle course on
asphalt to remember I'm doing this to a
camera so be gentle with your opinions
are hot good start
get off of me buddy oh
all right here's the epic let me excuse
me Ebell to the same thing on the epic
alright a little bit of gaming on folder
I can badness alright let's wrap up
today's face off featuring a samsung
epic touch 4g an HTC evo 3d with our
browser comparison another one of our
pocket now face offs don't forget after
this i'll have a video sample from each
of our combatants yep accordion a cc evo
3d alright I've got running off the bus
both off the same Wi-Fi network their
displays are set to default brightness
I've cleared the cache and history on
both and both of them are fully enabled
for flash and we'll get this up and
gadget and we're off and it looks like a
pretty even race up to this point and
our winner is going to be but evil 3d
looks like it wants it nope epic touch
4G got there first you can see just how
smooth it is let's try the evo 3d and
again it's not as smooth not bad as you
can see but it's just not as smooth
let's double tap to zoom in on both give
you a look at the text and pinch to zoom
no problems on either one and both of
them will dynamically rewrap the text to
fit the display which is very slick so
we've got two great browsers you can see
just how smooth it is and how easy both
of them are double tap to zoom all the
way out boom any rendering issues
doesn't look like it on either one both
of them seem to render everything very
well no no wait a minute when we have
here back to mobiles missing up at the
top we're missing an ad missing some of
the portions to the top here on the EVO
3d so we're entering a little bit more
on the epic touch 4g than what's
rendering on the EVO 3d alright what do
you see we head over to the mothership
and check a few things out their
smartphone reviews are phone reviews and
we're off I think that was pretty close
Wow epic they see the evo 3d is well out
in front oh and we went to the wrong
version on the epic touch 4g let's see
if it can come back and get anywhere
near what the evo 3d is done wow it's
almost caught up again we're running
through all the flash at this point i'm
guessing evo 3d is going to take it
we'll see up evo 3d is done pretty
smooth too still waiting on the epic
touch 4g to finish loading the flash in
there it did you can see the flash ads
running on both and again the epic touch
4g is considerably smoother than the evo
3d double tap to zoom in i would say of
the browser's i've used on both on
sprint smartphones these two are
definitely the two best I believe the
evo 3d definitely feels smoother than
the photon 4G and a nexus s
epic touch 4g was first live in a page
and again you can see just how smooth it
is just a little bit of lag on the EVO
3d so there's a look at our face off
reaching the epic touch 4g HTC evo 3 4
pocket now this is craig don't forget to
hang in there and check out the video
examples from each one our combatants
hope this was helpful take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
