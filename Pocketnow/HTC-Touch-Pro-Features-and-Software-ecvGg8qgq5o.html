pocketnow.com and in this video I'm
going to cover all of the interesting
features of the HTC touch pro
lot of little things that HTC has done
with this device that makes it really
interesting so I'm gonna start off with
the case in this case is more like a
sleeve it's made out of leather and it
actually has two purposes one purpose is
to keep the device protected of course
so that if you drop it you don't get a
scratch on your beautiful touch pro and
the second purpose is to actually clean
the device the sleeve has very little
clearance if you can see that so that
when I push out the device it rubs
against the flush screen and takes off a
little bit of surface debris if there is
any if you can see inside of the case
it's a nice felt that does a good job of
cleaning the screen now obviously it's
not going to clean off
facial grease or you know smudges are
that kind of thing that requires more
agitation but for surface debris or
little pieces of dust that does a great
job at keeping the screen clean so
that's a really good reason to use the
the case that it comes with now like the
touch diamond the HTC touch pro has a
magnetic stylus such that when you
remove the stylus the screen comes out
of standby goes on automatically which
is a really good feature so that you
don't have to take the extra step of
pressing the power button at the top of
the device okay now that we're closer in
I want to show you more about touchflo
3d touch flow 3d is HTC's acclaimed
interface for Windows Mobile that
replaces the today's screen and it does
a lot of interesting things this is the
first screen it's the home screen and
what you can do with this is you can see
your call history if you click on that
you can see your appointments or you can
go straight into your calendar for the
day and you can flick your finger
downward if you are upward actually to
get a different clock if you don't like
the massive clock and you want to see
more appointments but for me I like to
see my next appointment and that's
that's about it so having this big clock
is really nice and as you just saw the
animation is really catchy too you can
you can navigate through touchflo 3d
through this bar at the bottom and as
you can see there are a lot of icons and
what I was afraid of is that I would
have to slide my finger numerous times
to get to all of the icons but HTC has
designed this such that you only have to
move your finger left to right one time
to get from beginning to the end okay so
let me take you through some of these
tabs the next tab I'm going to go to is
the people's tab and I can get there of
course by pressing the button down here
or I'm gonna actually swipe to the side
and it goes right to the side and from
here I can dial a favorite person or I
can flip through the pictures that I've
added kind of like album art or Cover
Flow as they call it let me go to the
next tab here which is messaging so this
shows me my text messages and I can flip
my stylus upward or of course I can do
that with my finger to see my messages
my SMS that have come through and if I
want to read the message in full I can
click on the message if I want to make a
new message I click this button right
here and go over the next tab we've
email an email just like SMS allows you
to preview the message that's there
although with mail it gives you a nicer
visual representation you can actually
preview the piece of email as if it was
inside of an envelope it's very
beautiful
and from here you can click on the
message to go into outlook mobile if you
want to do some some work in there going
over to the next tab we have Internet
it's a dedicated Internet tab we can
scroll to the bottom here and see all
the favorites that we have added for
Opera Mobile I'll cover a little bit
about Opera Mobile in a few minutes and
from here we can launch the browser with
this big icon on the top sliding over to
the side we have pictures and video
which will look into your device for any
pictures that you've taken or look into
your storage card if you have any photos
and it will put them all in here and of
course you can slide your mouse or I
keep calling it a mouse you can slide
your stylus up to flip through the
pictures in a very beautiful way if you
find a picture you like you can just tap
on it with your finger and it will bring
open the gallery and the gallery is one
of the places that the accelerometer
works so it'll automatically reorient
the picture so let me get out of the
gallery and go to the next tab the next
tab is the music tab and like the photo
tab it will search your device for music
that you have and if we click on
library' here we can kind of use this
really nice looking touch flow based
playlist control so we can see the
albums that we have on the device and we
can click on one of those or scroll with
our finger to see various ones it's just
it's just really refined and we can also
make playlists we can filter by genres
and all that sort of thing and it just
integrates so nicely throughout the
whole device so I'm going to get out of
here by clicking now playing and it'll
take me back to the main screen and if
course you can play songs right from the
screen which is pretty neat too the next
tab is weather and it needs to be
updated right now it says updating
because the moon's not out it's actually
during the daytime over here in
Philadelphia and the animations for the
you saw it right there are beautiful for
the weather and I here I haven't seen it
yet but when it's raining you'll
actually get a animation of a wiper
blade come across the screen to wipe off
droplets so that's really well done and
down here we have a five-day forecast if
you want to see more of what's happening
in the weather and if you press more it
will take you to the accuweather.com
homepage through Opera Mobile so you can
get you know a 10-day forecast or the
current humidity or something like that
and then over in the Settings tab we get
access to just some basic settings we
can change the wallpaper sync all of the
data on the device turn on Wi-Fi
Bluetooth that sort of thing and if we
go over to the final tab it's a program
launcher and you can scroll through the
programs you can add new programs
shortcuts and if you click all programs
you don't get the Start menu you get
this much better-looking list of
programs that is very thin you're
friendly and you can scroll through them
and see all of the programs that are
included on the device so that is really
well-done
so you may be wondering what is touchflo
3d looking landscape because this has a
slide-out keyboard and the screen
rotates to landscape well I'll tell you
what there really is no touch touch flow
3d and landscape much to my surprise
look look at this look look what it
looks like this is touchflo 3d in
landscape I'm really not sure why HDC
didn't put the same experience in the
landscape orientation that they did in
the portrait orientation it's completely
different it's it's kind of silly
actually but that's what we have to work
which with which is fine if you want to
use the real touchflo 3d interface you
have to keep it in portrait mode to do
that okay so let's go into the programs
listed I'm going to get out my stylus to
do this I like the precision of the
stylus and you can see the Start menu is
arranged in a nice finger friendly
fashion there are dividers between all
of the entries now a note on screen
rotation because you just saw the screen
rotate and if you watch any other videos
that I've made you know
that I hate slow screen rotation and
Windows Mobile exhibits very slow screen
rotation well take a look at how it how
it is on the touch pro let me dismiss
this email first okay watch this pretty
snappy it's a little slower going into
portrait it's pretty fast let me compare
that to the HTC Kaiser so let me get
that out here I've got it over here I've
got the same menu open I'll zoom out
even more so we can kind of get some
perspective and let me try this at the
same time the keyboards slide out in
different ways so one two three it's
funny because sometimes the touch pro is
faster and sometimes the the Kaiser is
faster but overall I'd say definitely
the the touch pro has a fast screen
rotation speed which I am pleased about
okay let's get back in here now in the
Start menu and throughout the entire
operating system you can flick scroll
which is really good because it has a
touch flush the open up FM radio it is a
touch flush screen and so too feel for
the scroll bar is kind of annoying so
having that capability to flick scroll
is pretty good it's not as good as the
iPhone I don't think it ever will be in
Windows Mobile until major changes are
made to the platform but it's it's
pretty good and it's precise and you can
move just a little bit if you want and
that you don't really get accidental key
presses so let's take a look at a few of
the programs on the device that stand
out a little bit and are of interest so
going down we have you know a
Communications Manager which is
especially well done graphically for the
touch pro I'm going to turn on Wi-Fi so
that I can show you a demonstration of
Opera Mobile the camera applications
beautiful I'm going to show you that in
the review it's just very fast the icons
are easy to decipher everything is laid
out very well we have standard things
like Google Maps we have a printing
utility we have this cool program called
mp3 trimmer and what this allows you to
do is look at any mp3 that you have on
your device so I'm going to go to open
I'm gonna go to my storage card I'll
choose any track really and what it
allows you to do is play
the mp3 and stop it when you want and
you get what is called a little segment
and you can apply this segment to your
phone as a ringtone and it works really
well I mean in about two minutes
I got a whoops in about two minutes
I got a from a song and I applied it as
my ringtone and it worked great and what
you just saw up there I want to show you
too if you click any of the
notifications it brings up this big
finger finger friendly list of what the
notifications are which is great because
if you want to check you know your Wi-Fi
status you don't have to be really
precise with your finger to get in on
that you can just click on the top bar
and go right to your Wi-Fi status so
that's a really good addition to making
it finger friendly going down the list
we have opera browser I'll talk about
that in a second I want to show you the
YouTube application because it's another
thing that's really well done it's as
good as it is the YouTube application on
the iPhone so right now it's downloading
and I'm just going to go to search and
I'm going to search for pocket now of
course I could use the slide-out
keyboard but I don't really want to
rotate the device right now so it's
searching and here we have the matches
and it comes up pretty fast and I'm
going to click on the first one I see
and it goes into the other orientation
and it looks very similar to the YouTube
application on the iPhone and the
quality is fantastic if you've been
around you YouTube lately you know that
there are settings for high quality
video which makes the clarity much
better and up here if you go to this
button at the top you can choose whether
it's high quality or low quality I've it
on auto select right now so that is the
YouTube application so now I want to
show you Opera Mobile 9.5 which is
revered as one of the best mobile
browsers ever made here I've got
cnet.com loading it's a it's quite a
complex page it's got a lot of tables
it's got a lot of content and that sort
of thing and if you want to zoom in on a
column you can double tap and resizes
the column so that you can see it nicely
it wraps it around you can move around
the page as if it was a piece of paper
double click to zoom back out and
because there's an accelerometer built
into the touch pro if you flip over the
device to landscape it will reorient the
screen although sometimes it's
it does it a little bit slowly it's not
as sensitive as it should be but
generally it works well so opera mobile
9.5 is especially well done and I'm glad
that HTC has included it on this device
and the last thing I want to do is take
you through the settings of the device
to see if there's anything interesting
in there here in the settings we can
make a sound for the keyboard sliding
open you know some people find that
annoying but I actually like it going
down the list nothing else interesting
in here if you go into the settings for
the today screen you see that touchflo
3d right now is the only entry that is
set as on and that is why it's
displaying going over to system we have
some usual things we have a calibration
utility for the G sensor or for the
accelerometer and again there's not that
many places in the operating system
where the G sensor is used unfortunately
so you know this allows you to calibrate
it so that it's you know exactly right
vertically and horizontally and that
sort of thing unlike the omnia which can
orient itself in any screen throughout
the operating system now if we go down
let's take a look at memory I've been
opening a bunch of programs but even
then I have a hundred and three
megabytes of program memory left and
there's a good amount of storage space
but of course I have a storage card
installed which is probably what you
want to do if you get a touch Pro going
down the list we have some settings for
touch flow not that many we can enable
the Start menu we can enable the sound
when fingers scrolling and that sort of
thing and finally on the bottom here we
have TV out and because I don't have the
accessory I can't show you that HTC
should include the TV out cable just
like I'm eight did with the ninety 502
professional device and over in
connections nothing really here except
what was really great is when I put my
SIM card into the touch pro it
automatically configured itself for AT&amp;amp;T
and I know a lot of people will really
appreciate that and it says country and
operator AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile so if you're
in the United States that this will work
I am getting an edge signal right now
unfortunately no 3G though and one more
thing that I want to show you that's
pretty cool is how this touch sensitive
scroll d-pad works so let me go into a
program where I can adjust the font size
so I will go into messaging and I will
let's see I'll go into Outlook and here
here's a message that came on the device
actually it's called email tips and
tricks and so what I can do is I can
take my finger and I can just graze it
around this touch sensitive scrolling
mechanism and it resizes the text now
unfortunately it doesn't scroll the text
which is what I would like it to do but
this is a good way to on-the-fly change
the size of text in a lot of different
screens on the touch pro so it's quite
useful in that way and again touch touch
scrolling works in a lot of applications
it works in Outlook mobile of course
which is quite helpful when reading
through a long email so that is it for
the HTC touch pro it's definitely one of
the most refined windows mobile devices
that exists that is not to say that
there aren't some flaws with it and I'll
cover all of those in the review coming
up in a few days so check back at
pocketnow.com for the detailed and very
thorough review on the HTC touch pro
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
