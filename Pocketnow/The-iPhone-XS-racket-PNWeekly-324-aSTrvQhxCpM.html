voice for this one gather back around
children
again the big trucks have dropped off
boxes with a bunch of apples in them
it's ripe season for that now we sound
like some sort of wizard it's ripe
season for those new iPhones and Apple
watches and we're about to take our
first bite well not me personally mine
has not come in yet because well the
rest of our guys are on the East Coast
where delivery trucks have been earlier
than they have been here for me in the
West Coast but before we have our
dessert we've got dinner a smorgasbord
of new things to talk about Amazon's new
echo speakers and an Alexa powered
microwave a oneplus television set is
included a Bigsby key that will never
not work and the galaxy note 9 that has
that key and a problem with temperature
Oh a note up in smoke here we go again
hello everyone and welcome to episode
number three to four of the weekly
brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers on this day Friday the
21st of September 2018 from phones
tablets smartwatches microwaves yeah
we're talking about smart Mike
microwaves now let's go ahead and get
talking about all the things that you
wanted when you were a kid let's get
chatting
I'm your host with not quite the iPhone
10's max not yet it is up for delivery
right now I am watching the UPS tracking
like like a hawk right now I'm just
waiting for it to come in but then I got
to drive all the way back home to grab
it anyway but it's Joshua for Gaara
what's going on everybody
and today we are joined by Brandon
minimun who joins us with his own you
actually have it in your hands the oh
that's a huge looking doesn't this
look excessive see what I did there so
how is that fun treating you right now
like how many hours have you even had it
for her so far um like three but like
half of that time it was setting up and
downloading my apps and data so okay
yeah the setup is something that I'm
kind of I'm not really I don't know I'm
I'm not super excited about the iPhone
coming in I'm excited because it's a new
piece of technology and I'm really
excited to like you know play around
with it and see what it's like but I've
never really had an iPhone for a long
period of time so I'm gonna be
downloading everything fresh
everything's gonna be new to me so
I don't know getting to know a new
ecosystem it's gonna be interesting for
me well that's good you're starting from
scratch it'll be nice and fast
well that's true that's true well we'll
see yeah we'll see how it goes I'm not
the biggest proponent of fullscreen
gestures or huge phones so this is good
a view next this is gonna be an extra an
extra journey for me and also we are
going to be joined by Jaime Rivera who
also has the iPhone 10s not the Macs as
Brandon and I will have but he will have
an Apple watch series for I he'll be
coming in in a few minutes and we'll be
talking about that a little bit now I
just want to give one quick shot I want
to make sure that we give Jules his due
he is in the producers booth still but
he's kind of in under the weather for a
little bit so he won't be chiming in
much on this particular podcast but
shouts out to Jules still in the
producers booth all right let's go ahead
and jump into our stories and our first
story for today is uh well it's a little
okay trigger warning for anyone who had
a note seven as it seems with the galaxy
note 9 which I have mine just sitting
right on my table right now apparently
this is still it might still be a bit of
a dangerous piece of kid to have because
a New York woman has launched a lawsuit
against Samsung after her note 9 got
extremely hot and started to emit black
smoke while she was in an elevator where
she panicked and kicked the phone as far
as she could the moment those elevator
doors opened now this particular phone
the Galaxy Note 9 does have a four
thousand milliamp hour battery and it's
it's the largest of any galaxy device or
at least in the note series and that
comes after the 3300 milliamp hour
battery of the note 8 switch they did
bring down in capacity after all of the
debacles that happens with a note 7
which had a 3500 milliamp hour battery
and ever since the note 7 samsung has
said that they have so many checks and
balances in place now when it comes to
their battery manufacturing but maybe
maybe that's not quite the case this is
one instance Brandon but do you feel
scared about the note 9 after hearing
this story no in fact I would like to
see proof and witnesses that this
actually happened it sounds on a strange
you know it happened in an elevator
where no one can see you know true
other there are cameras in that elevator
we should get that footage right can we
make that happen I'd love to see the XDA
in pocket now doing their investigative
journalism I would love that actually
why don't we call this we should call
this hotel and see if we can get that
that that video or maybe the maybe
someone's going to unearth it but yeah
there's a multi-stage battery check
process for all of its devices but can
processes like that actually be perfect
I would venture to say no there's always
going to be a couple of there's always
going to be a couple that kind of fall
through the cracks also this particular
hotel was in Bayside Queens apparently
so it was reported by the New York Post
so that makes sense but like not every
process is perfect if one slips through
the cracks is this that big a deal
I guess not I mean there's a there's
like a small percentage of phones that
are defective in certain ways like the
screen doesn't work or the battery I
mean it's it's dangerous with the
battery has a problem with heat and you
know catches on fire but like there's a
deef there's a percent defect for the
entire phone and someone's got to have
the you know the point of 1%
yeah the battery problem I think it's
just a coincidence I mean like everyone
remembers what happened with the note
seven and you know they're just you know
that that wouldn't be the craziest thing
ever if the note 9 or the note 8 had the
same problem I mean it's the same
company and they've put certain checks
and balances in place to avoid it but if
any company is going to be victim to
this it will be Samsung have you had
have has your note 9 ever gotten like
super hot in your usage so far no but
it's got the liquid cooled whatever yeah
it's kind of ironic right that there's a
cooling system in there and yet the
issue here is that it became extremely
extremely hot I actually have a story
about that my girlfriend who's in my
office right now working on her side of
things
ISA Rodriguez of gadget match she's
she's writing right now using my using
my noise-canceling headphones
so she can't even hear me anyway her
phone is an XO no spurgeon of the note 9
and when we were in Cabo I was on
vacation for the past week when we were
in Cabo San Lucas the phone was
constantly getting really
hot like uncomfortably hot nothing bad
happened but she does admit that two
things were happening
number one the the phone was getting hot
which is kind of weird but I told her
that the cooling should be keeping it
performing well enough even if it's
getting warm and sure enough the phone
still purrs like performed pretty well
number two her battery life has not been
great on the Exynos version compared to
my Snapdragon edition so I don't know I
don't know maybe we can investigate a
little bit further but clearly her phone
is the Exynos one and I don't know maybe
there's something there's something
different going on there so that's
surprising maybe there's some background
process that's you know running in the
background using RAM and CPU cycles
perhaps so and one of those background
processes is one that we all kind of
okay there's it's not to say that it's a
bad service it's just not one that many
of us really use I'm talking of course
about big speed so there was a story
that we covered on this this very show I
think it was maybe two maybe three weeks
ago where somebody out in Germany if I
remember correctly said that they tweet
it out to Samsung that like please stop
the big speed button please please stop
it from just give me give me the option
to disable it please and Samsung Germany
said that they would look into it well
as far as as far as that would be
concerned and update might be coming a
little bit later this month but as of
right now it looks like the Bigsby
button is never not going to be
triggering Bixby they're just going to
make it so that it might be just a tiny
bit maybe 1% harder for you to trigger
it because this hilarious photo honestly
I love this Jules wrote this article
this hilarious photo shows Bigsby keys
select how to open Bixby with the Bigsby
key press wants to open Bigsby press
twice to open Bigsby pressing and
holding the Bigsby key will always open
Bigsby voice that's one two three four
five six seven references to the word
Bigsby in one screen Samsung's trying
really hard but they're trying to
appease their their their customers just
enough to shut them up I feel like um at
the wrong time I feel of course yeah oh
you came in at just the perfect time
talk about better things to talk about
why
resale which I do because I want to sell
my note 9 eventually I would I would cut
off the big squeaky which I'm very close
to doing you just take a razor and just
shave it off and then it's completely
flush with the with the side rails and
you probably never press it again just I
just wish he's the expert was fine
perfect I just wanted to be contextual I
wish it was okay if you want this thing
if you want this button to be about
smart whatever a smart assistance in
your phone make it smarter than if I'm
in the camera app don't let it do
anything because I constantly okay so
kind of a peek behind the veil Here I am
rocking a obviously my no.9 as my as my
daily but I actually have an early look
at the moment case for it so I used the
moment lenses on my vacation last week
in Cabo so you can look forward to that
but I use this for vlogging for most of
my trip so what I do is I put the
wide-angle on here and I turn it around
and I always hit the volume down button
in order to trigger video recording so
that's a really easy way of vlogging
which is awesome and I like using the
rear camera for vlogging in that case
but every now and then I hit the Bigsby
button and then I got a come back and go
away Bigsby and go back to it why not
give me an option just in the camera app
just give me this in the camera app that
the Bigsby button can trigger video
recording and the volume down button can
be a photo just give me that just just
give me that and I will give you all the
faith in the world that you're not
trying to shove Bixby down our throats
it's so simple or while watching a video
or somebody give you like a white list
of apps you know yeah exactly or if I'm
listening to music and I accidentally
hit it like be contextual be smarter
Bigsby that's all I want out of it but
that is our story on Bigsby at least for
this week I don't know if we're gonna
get more about it but Samsung did say an
update will come later this month this
potentially will probably be where it
ends but we'll see what the update does
later on
hi may came in at the perfect time
because our next story is about his new
toy the Apple Wow the one that I'm
actually setting up because you guys are
talking about something I don't like do
we have a clock over how much time we
spent on Bixby
I heard my best not to go too far but
that camera one was in real-life
scenario that Samsung is just to give
you an idea how much we would prefer a
camera key yeah like you know for seeing
something that just I mean Bixby was
fine with the no date it became terrible
with the with the note 9 I don't know
why it's something about it I'm not sure
um okay so in the note night it's full
screen whereas in the note 8 it was just
kind of like kind of like on the bottom
of the screen no it's just it's just
predictions predictions on Bixby like
went downhill with the note 9 oh come on
I'm not talking to you well our next
story has to do with one of okay so if
you've been listening to the podcast for
the last two weeks you know that Jaime
has a lot of opinions on the Apple watch
and now we are talking about the series
for who's one of its main claims to
potential fame is the fact that it can
do ECG readings
however despite being FDA approved
apparently it is only it only has an
accuracy rate of 98% which means that it
could it could be potentially unreliable
yeah but there's not even enabled right
now so oh really isn't oh no it's that
apparently though there will be a
software update later and once that
happens we'll see okay no well
potentially the well apparently the FDA
approval happened literally the day
before the announcement so there's some
speculation that Apple just like just
barely made it work but which is funny
to me because they were able to make it
work so they could talk about it on
stage and yet it's still not available
so clearly there are kinks to be worked
out that's exactly the point they made
it just available and just approved by
the FDA so they could mention it at the
keynote yeah and yeah there you go Jules
with the with the reminder the American
Heart Association representative that
was on stage as well I barely i barely
was able to catch most of the keynote
because i was at an airport getting
ready to go to cabo but lisa and i were
were watching the the keynote from my
phone from my note 9 of all things and
we i thought that
and I thought that was impossible what
browser did you use because it doesn't
like Twitter Twitter reaches every phone
let's just say that there was a whole
section of Twitter that was dedicated to
just the Apple event so if you search
for a hashtag Apple event there was a
feed at the top of just the keynote and
yeah we had a lot of I wanted us to vlog
about our opinions of the keynote but we
didn't catch most of it so and plus we
were supposed to be on vacation so
whatever but in any case you still use
so I've been watching if you look at
Jaime Rivera's Instagram and his story
is he's constantly using at this point
the galaxy watch for workouts and
whatnot are you looking forward to using
the Apple watch series for for your
workouts and everything I'm actually
looking forward to going back to an
Apple watch for workouts to be fully
honest I the galaxy watch is a very
beautiful looking watch I would say far
superior to any other watch when it
comes to looks it's just God the you
know once you go on a run on a treadmill
and it doesn't calculate your pace
you're like really like it's it's just
the mathematical equation between the
pedometer the amount of steps per minute
and then you just divide that and you
get how much what your what your speed
is yeah and then you have to use
third-party applications so I tried map
my run now that that wasn't great I
tried a couple of other solutions you
know and these were actually comments
comments of people recommending try this
try that all great recommendations but
sadly you know once you you put them to
the test no or they would kill the
battery life or the like again this is a
very beautiful watch but it it needs
work like for example I don't know if
you've if if you've noticed any other
people complaining I noticed people have
praised them but I'm like okay how much
have you actually used that your fitness
so I actually need to use lose weight so
I'm been I've been actively trying it
out and so you're halfway through your
run and the heart rate is no longer
working it doesn't find you and so it
keeps recommending it keeps recommending
that you pull the watch back but then
the watch is so heavy then there's just
no way if you're doing this with your
this your running it will slide from
there at some yeah so it's supposed to
be past that like little bone thing
right like this yeah right here so they
they actually want it to be all the way
at the back oh you know part of my
review I've been you know putting
together clips as I've been training
just to you know created enough database
to be like I used that for these amount
of days these amount of trainings and
this is what I got and you know most of
the time I'm even even if I'm spinning
on the bike like it'll lose our great
and then for example one thing that's
very accurate is GPS like it's funny
because it'll tell you that you're you
this is the amount of miles that you're
running and and it's like completely off
but then by the time you reach one mile
it knows that it's one mile oh so the
indicators bad but then the the
information you know at least you get
the mileage correct so that's you know
on par with even an iPhone connected you
know side by side doing testing which is
what I've been doing all that's been
fine but then these kinds of things you
know just that one that's one thing I
don't like the other thing is risk
detection oh my god like dear Samsung if
I do this with my watch you know what I
want to do you know exactly what I'm
trying to do right there order pizza you
know I'm not I really don't care I'm not
looking at it because I want to look at
the rotating bezel I actually want to
look not just at the time so I've
noticed a little trick first of all of
you use metallic bands risk detection is
not as good I recommend you use either a
leather band or the silicon bands
included that's just the metal bands too
loose and it like doesn't turn as
quickly could be that's one thing then
the second thing is my advice whether
you like it or not switch the always-on
display not just because of because
you're gonna be able to see your time
but because for some reason wrist
detection works better with the
always-on display active hmm yeah yeah
well I I I'm still waiting for my 42
millimeter to come in so I'm you're not
missing out on much it's worthwhile to
finally look at like what Samsung is
doing especially since we just came back
from the snapdragon 3100 or we're doing
and then of course we have the Apple
watch for so it's a word it's worth it
to look at all the smart watches and see
where they're coming right now
so definitely yeah so Apple just had
their big announcements obviously the
the Apple watch for all everyone's
getting their iPhones today but not to
be outdone Amazon has gone ahead and had
their own event as well and I was
watching a few one of our buddies Andrew
Edwards was at the event in Seattle and
Wow I mean exactly it looked like a lot
of fun actually
um but what I was invited I don't know
Andrew it was it was Andrew I think yeah
Andrew and Andrew yeah so yeah the the
event looked kind of fun it was very
Amazon like if you want to put it that
way but it just looked really trendy and
hip and all that and then it had a very
Amazon look to it and then everything at
the event where all of these products
that they announced not only is there a
not only are there going to be new
designs and refreshes for the echo dot
in the echo plus and also the echo show
which now has a 10 inch display two inch
drivers for a better audio a five
megapixel camera and integrations with
more services like Hulu and NBC there
are also a lot of these other products
that they're bringing out that are
supposed to be considered either Amazon
basics or even more connected to the to
the echo ecosystem so one thing that I
thought was pretty cool was the echo
wall clock it's a good looking clock
right and it's only 30 bucks yeah yeah
like I'm trying to member who it was was
it was it the verge that said Amazon's
trying to be like IKEA now and I was
like that's kind of I like that I like
that by comparison because now you also
have you even have this car plug-in that
is the echo Auto it's going to be this
new thing that you put on your dash and
just kind of connects to your to your
car
and you know the would you want to have
Alexa in your car as compared to like
Android auto or I know car place
terrible I love an Android auto yeah
Android I was like I love that thing to
death that is just so cool I feel the
user interface is probably the best yeah
that's not that's one thing I'm really
not looking forward to when I get my
iPhone
connecting into my car because car play
is just horrendous but that's the reason
why I carry two phones like you know and
the cool thing is that you know the
dashboard of my car accepts both either
car play or auto so for me that's that's
perfect
where do you post I go right oh yeah I
was gonna say I
I thought the Alexa thing for the car
was a great opportunity except that you
have to connect it to your phone and
connect your phone to the car for it to
work properly I thought they were gonna
do in like an LTE modem inside of that
car thing that would be really cool is
anyone on this panel an avid Alexa user
no I you I have one in every single room
I use it so much it's crazy and what do
you use it for ordered diapers for this
ordered diapers for that oh my god I use
it for everything just so many things I
use it to find out what the commute is
to work because it knows where I work I
use it to turn on and off the TV because
I have one of those Logitech Smart
remotes because my kids always forget TV
I used to turn on and on on and off
lights I can use it to lock and unlock
my front door of course I use it for the
weather for questions I have nest
cameras all over the place so I can say
Alexa show me the front door camera
should I keep going I use it for
everything well now you're gonna be able
to use it for even more things because
Amazon has also brought on Amazon basics
smart plug so if you've been using like
tp-link or lifx or what are the other
ones
Belkin the Wemo there you go the we know
ones like there's a bunch of smart plugs
out there and this one is priced pretty
similarly at only $25 so it's not I mean
if you're an Alexa person then cool that
would be totally so my biggest problem
with adopting like smart lights and
everything it's just how much do you
want for the damn light bulb thing like
what it's a closed ecosystem so Philip
stops updating the hew firmware your
lights don't work and you just spent
five hundred dollars on light bulbs
exactly I just I um I'm sorry
you know deer companies uh you know it's
funny because I know that I can reach
out to certain companies and I could get
these things free but you know just from
the consumer standpoint these are all
really cool ideas that are just too
expensive it's just too much money guys
like really it's like I think it was
like $80 for like a socket to
- from one lightbulb I'm like no no well
before we before we move on I wanted to
end with a hot take on the microwave so
do you guys that you can wake up in the
morning and say Alexa good morning and
then it will start heating up your
pre-made coffee which will probably
taste terrible reheated anybody got more
of my growers stories okay so the
microwave the microwaves thing is so
stupid and it's very clear what Amazon
do here's why it's stupid listen the
microwave doesn't have Alexa built-in
it's just as a Wi-Fi chip so you have to
you have to say Alexa turn on the
microwave to heat my coffee
guess what's faster you roll up to your
microwave you press one or two for one
minute or two minutes you know exactly
what's gonna happen after this they're
gonna start putting Alexa in multiple
appliances so that you can talk to your
echo to do certain things on your
appliances it's just but the question is
can you do it from your bedroom to the
coffee machine that's downstairs in the
kitchen I don't know of any coffee maker
that will turn on I mean that's what the
smart plug is for yeah but like if you
turn it on like you still have to press
the button yeah you have to go control
and say what you want yeah exactly
okay so you're to wait a second so
you're telling me that Alexa is not
going to put your coffee or whatever it
is that you're gonna heat in the
microwave it's not going to be in there
already saying on our check can Alexa
bring you your coffee now again one be
right it's it is kind of dumb but it is
the beginning of what could be a pretty
pretty big amazonbasics
ecosystem so as hard my office is mostly
IKEA if that can become IKEA Plus Amazon
I'm okay with that like if they can if
they can make the ecosystem actually
work well then that's all I'm saying
speaking of speaking of bigger
ecosystems apparently oneplus is looking
to expand out of smartphones now they
have a bunch of other things as well but
when I first was working with oneplus
what the oneplus 2 I believe they did
say that they wanted to be a lifestyle
brand in a long term so they gave me a
bunch of like desk organizers with the
oneplus logo on it and like the
backpacks everyone works the backpacks
in the tech industry so
definitely this push now there's gonna
be a much bigger push because they want
to go into the home as one plus is
looking to launch something called the
oneplus TV so I'm confused like what is
it like is it television likely a CO or
a television live as a television
service is likely no no don't jinx
oneplus with the term lis eco please but
yes they are looking to expand into the
home because as far as their they are
concerned let me look up the quote real
quick okay here we go for most of us
there are four major environments we
experience every single day the home the
workplace to commute and being on the
move the home perhaps the most important
environment experience is starting to
enjoy the benefits of intelligent
connectivity that's exactly what they
are looking to add to with that so what
the oneplus TV they're trying to bring
the best of all worlds the TV having
seamless connectivity between your
smartphone and itself and also having AI
smarts I love that they use AI smarts
the type of AI smart sensor that in
their everything smarts yeah here's my
my hot take on this it's quite simple
oxygen OS on an Android enabled
television win-win oxygen OS is the
cleanest Android interface still makes
the oneplus 6 one of the most enjoyable
phones to use and I would love to see
that
on a 1 plus TV but Android TV is super
clean especially like on an Nvidia
shield where it's super fast have you
used that it's just so even I have a
shield TV and I agree with you there but
it's great to see that and then one plus
bring oxygen to the TV I just you know
it's a win-win so I I like that a lot
honestly I hope that doesn't take away
resources from their phones because I
love their phones and it would be really
a shame if they put all of their time
and effort into the TV which is going to
take a lot of research and development
in fact development and they kind of
neglected their phones a little bit put
a in display fingerprint reader on the
TV is it just me or can I can I consider
the fact that one plus there there are a
lot of things that oneplus admires about
Apple and they've been they've been
clear about it they've expressed it at
their events but I think that one of the
things that I love the most
about one plus that they follow from
Apple is that they behave like a
start-up they start something they
perfect it they get really good at it
then they move into something else and
so I I love that about one plus I love
that they continuously refine and refine
and refine but they keep it simple as
far as possibly tried a second phone
with the with the Oppo Oppo sorry though
the one was X then then they were like
no that wasn't a good idea and they you
know they stuck to just one thing and so
they've been evolving into other things
like and have you used their merch by
the way like their backpacks and it's
like alright like their notepads are I
use them you know and so I think that
it's I think that I wouldn't mind one
plus to experiment with something like
televisions I mean we've got TCL we've
got so many companies why not like I
think that they it was so long as they
right now they're doing phones and
they've come to the point where their
phones are popular and so they're just
moving into other ecosystems but slowly
one by one I think that that is genius
I love that they haven't come up with
the oneplus watch for example I wouldn't
care I think you know I think that they
they're focusing on things that are
actually like TV the TV business is
booming like obviously ak's is the thing
now whatever that is whatever that is
you know okay
IKS that you think so they're probably
gonna jump into 4k and just come up with
like a really affordable 4k TV like if
they come up with something like that
and battle TCL I think that that's a
good thing and you've got to see how
they're now using their own panels from
the technology that they learn from TCL
into their phones and so why not one
plus I mean I think that there are a lot
of synergies here yes and I'm trying to
look for a G Bob's are in our chat
oneplus probably saw what Xiaomi did
with TVs in India the Xiaomi me TV for
killed it with competitive pricing and
if there's one thing we know about
oneplus is that when they start
something new
it's usually a pretty competitively
priced because they're going to build it
from that starting point I mean
obviously the oneplus phones have become
more expensive but they've also become
better
so that's it that's nothing I mean you
know I do know that the one place phones
have become more expensive I just you
know I think that the value has grown a
matched by the quality of their products
like if you grab the oneplus 2 which I
have in a drawer I never had the oneplus
one but if you compare the oneplus 2 to
the 1 plus 6 for example you're like
yeah you can totally tell the difference
in price here and then you know from the
performance standpoint like the cameras
on oneplus phones before that we're
crappy yeah now I you know I did a
comparison between the 1 plus 6 in the
iPhones and shameless plug and you know
I I was like you're not getting $500
more of a phone with the iPhone 10
indeed you did yes I mentioned Xiaomi
which brings us to our final story in
this first segment how cheap should have
phone be so that you can accept that
there are ads all over the place I'm
actually that's the name of the article
that's that the headline but I'm
actually asking you guys and I can I
defend Xiaomi on this one ah how so do
you know how show me makes me through
their software yes so what's the problem
when your software is no longer
controlled by Xiaomi completely which is
the thing you know for the company to
move away from China it's uh you know
it's it's very difficult think about it
if once the company moves away from
China they don't control the store they
don't control a lot of the things where
they are they're able to monetize in
order to be able to sell people an
affordable product and so I don't mind
one banner ad drink in the settings if
that's gonna allow them to sell me the
me mix to us for 450 500 bucks true I
don't care to see which is I was
completely against this by HTC if you
remember HTC was the first one to come
up with their whole we're gonna serve
you you know in the nads yeah which was
I'm like okay how much rate how much of
a discount are you giving me on the
phone for that because Xiaomi does give
you and it creates it's a five percent
margin over a phone nobody does five
percent margins Oh
her phone and so that's literally what's
made Xiaomi so popular I don't mind it
so long as they keep the prices where
they have I mean look at the poco phone
guys that's not easy I'm trying to look
at the phone is just so hard without LTE
anyway as always gonna be my gripe with
that phone but when as far as Xiaomi is
concerned I don't know like coz what
you're looking at is a bigger ecosystem
picture if a if a cheaper phone with ads
allows them to cut overhead and then
they're able to make their premium
phones for a much lower price as a
result that's okay I can get that but
how low does the phone itself that has
the ad have to be $1.99 $2.99 I think
under 150 years so an Android one device
would dad's which is kind of against the
whole idea of Android one I don't know I
mean there's this very interesting video
by the way I've become a really big fan
of a channel called tech alter the guy
makes these like amazing case studies of
like why this company does this or why
this company does that I think we should
definitely link to him I'll do it once
this video goes live cuz there's like a
very complete study over why like I can
explain it too but he has a full nine
minute video over how shall me and why
the why they're now doing poco phone and
why this whole changes strategy and the
rebranding etc and again mark that's his
name Martin exactly I mean do he does
some really awesome videos and you know
it's it's one of those things where it's
like these are business models I you
know what do you want would you rather I
I don't know of anything like if you buy
the New York Times you could buy the New
York Times now for like a dollar a week
or something stupid like that but
obviously for for the New York Times the
price of the product the paper is really
just distribution probably for them
really they make more money off the ads
and that's just the way it is we've been
we've been served ads on the street in
banners we've been served ads just about
everywhere in the world I mean we
survive out of ads when it comes to
YouTube etc and so again if they price
the phone aggressively I don't care yeah
Amazon's been doing it not well with
those ads at the beginning of their of
the phones that they serve well we real
quick the jewels did just make a good a
good point in the chat that the
difference between Xiaomi and Amazon is
that Amazon is very up front with their
ads yeah you turn on a Kindle and it's
like hey this is the version of the
Kindle you buy and when you pay for it
when you pay for it they actually ask
you do you want the version with ads or
the version without ads and want the
version without ads you pay an extra 30
bucks I think Xiaomi should probably do
that that's a good point yeah
all right um so that that is our new
segment for today as the landlines
alright so um apparently Brandon have
some stuff he wanted to do in our
check-in I will say one quick thing that
I was on a little you you may not have
known this viewers and listeners but I
was on a little bit of a vacation but we
were able to get what we internally
called the monthly done where we had a
great show with a returning Michael
Fisher and tech Meowth and Danny wing it
or whinge it rather I mean he's okay
with either pronunciation but that was a
great show and I hope everyone enjoyed
that one make sure you check that out on
the YouTube channel of course but yeah I
was able to use the poco phone out in
Cabo and it's it kind of got LTE like it
got it got it got really great HSPA+ let
me just say that Latin America has got
great HSPA+ like hilarious out here in
in the United States they're like LT or
4G and like the fallout 2 for two HSPA+
is terrible it's like worse than 2g here
oh man yeah it was it was kinda nice
using it out there and I did use it for
a few shots I am finally putting
together my final review of it I'd be
more than happy to share my camera
samples by the way with you guys and
yeah I I spent some time in Cabo I was
up late the day that the iPhone went on
sale for pre-order so I have a bit of a
story about that but I can talk about
that a little bit later in our iPhone
segment jaime is leaving for just a
minute so Brendon why don't you let us
know what your thoughts right is all
about
well it's kind of a mini discussion so I
kind of want to wait till Hymie comes
back oh okay well then why do you just
let us know oh you were - you okay so
first of all there was a show that we
did a couple weeks ago where you said
you were off that day but you were all
you were still in the chat
were you like were you not off of that
day what was going on yeah I had
something I had to do but I wanted to
check in and see what you guys are
talking about just jumped in for like 10
minutes just to kind of stalk you guys
and see what you were talking about yeah
Jules and I were laughing when we saw
that you like appeared in the in the
live chat were just like Brendan I
thought you were off today what's going
on he's back so I can all right let's go
sorry let's go for me that neither spare
battery because I'm actually you guys
were working like I'm working on Clips
right now as we film because we felt a
little time yeah all right so go for our
brother okay so I just want to go back
in time a little bit to the Nexus 5 the
Nexus 5 had a 5-inch screen which is
actually pretty big for the time and
then the Nexus 6 came out which had a
six inch screen and I remember watching
one of the earlier reviews dieter bone
made the review for the verge and he
said the following he said I'm calling
it phones are not going to get bigger
than six-inch this has become absurd
okay so fast-forward 2018 the 1 plus 6
was 6.3 inch the note 4 was 6 point 4
inches the iPhone 10's max is 6.5 inches
the vivo Nexus 6 point 6 inches and then
there's a little phone that came out
recently called the honor Note 10 which
TK over on his job god TK showed me that
phone
Goten has a 6 point 9 inch screen I'm
thinking wait a sec wait a sec it wasn't
that long ago that the Nexus 7 came out
which was a tablet that you held in your
hands how is it possible that a phone
can have a six point nine inch screen
and still be considered a phone and that
got me thinking and what I want to ask
you guys is you know 2018 was the year
of the 6 plus inch phone with but they
had kind of smaller footprints because
we got notches and small bezels do you
guys think next year is gonna be the
year of the high six inch low 7-inch
phones or is it just are we done here
with the size increases well I may bring
up your 10s max again on camera
Oh what the hell man I'm all sorry hold
on I gotta clear up my notifications
because I've got secret messages that
you guys look at that thing it's no it's
not that it's not it doesn't have a big
I know but it still looks big I don't
know like the screen is a little
deceiving in that regard all right so
I'm gonna say this you have to remember
what happened last year last year when
was it the LG G 6 announced last year
two years ago wasn't it last year right
so remember what changed like the the
length of the display hasn't has
increased but also the form factor was
so 16 by 9 so the biggest problem with
the Nexus 6 was a six inch display in a
16 by 9 aspect ratio it made it a wide
phone provide yep so the genius move
last year was oh we're gonna offer you
larger screens but these weren't really
larger screens of the if we do the math
and you know how much space area there
is the screens haven't really gotten
that much bigger it's just you know
they're taller 18 by 9 18 point like the
iPhone is like what nineteen point five
by nine and so it's just this little
trick that they're doing and also
they're also playing with things like
that notch where they're telling you
which I'm not gonna blame Apple for
using the knotch because forever Google
would be like yeah we're offering you a
6.3 inch display but then the control
buttons at the bottom would pretty much
take a part of it anyways you know so
it's this little play that companies
have been doing so if you grab a nexus 7
and I have one by the way I could bring
it oh I could bring it next week that we
meet like I have a Nexus 7 if you
compare that 7-inch with the honor note
whatever you really won't see two
devices that are the same size one two
bezels have changed dramatically
dramatically like if you even if you
grab the iPhone eight I mean just grab
your iPhone eight plus and compared to
the iPhones and 10s maxi-pad I mean it's
the tennis match
what the tennis max did you see my tweet
last week this airmax
yeah god it's it's it's the worst but no
it's you know companies are playing with
all we're offering you a larger display
like if you notice the node 8 the node 9
what did they do it's literally the same
footprint of the node 8 and they just
added an extra millimeter an extra point
something inch to the bottom bezel and
made it asymmetrical and they just
they're just reducing vessels they
continuously reduce bezels if Sony could
just get out of its own way for a second
I think 2019 should mark the return of
the Z ultra it's just all screen great
you know I think it's a I think that the
phone that does it best that sadly I
don't have here amongst all this mess is
the Oppo find X and I I have to pin it I
have to finish that review I've been
working on it
od keep talking sorry yo go find X for
me is honestly the best cuz it's
literally a full symmetrical bezel all
around just display with curves and feel
small in the hand and it's frickin
gorgeous and it's OLED and oh my god I
want more phones like this if they could
figure out how that mechanism is not
gonna get as much lint as mine gets can
you can you bring it nice size ISA has
hers and I've been meaning to to play
around with it myself those look pretty
dope I'm not gonna lie it's kind of good
it's a beautiful phone dude it is such a
beautiful phone like you said just that
the screens amazing my conclusion on the
review just uh you know the the script
and everything and I've also already
recorded my arrow but my conclusion is
this like the Oppo find as is like a
Lamborghini and I love that they created
the Lamborghini edition because it
pretty much is this it's a beautiful
product to be admired it is a beautiful
product to drive and use so long as you
don't bring it to Braddock Avenue here
in close to Long Island in Queens
Village because you're going to destroy
the suspension of that Lamborghini if
you bring it over here and so
that's the same thing with the find X
it's not the most durable phone it's not
for everybody but so is a Ferrari not
for everybody you know yeah it's true
it's not like and that's the thing you
won't be able to like you won't be able
to use it like you like you'd use a
Honda Accord or you use an SUV
it just wasn't designed for that and so
the find X is that it's bragging rights
is instead of buying that horrible
Acorah expensive virtue phone by a find
X like that is more bragging rights than
anything but you barely able to take it
into the pool you won't be able to but
so won't you be able to drive that
Lamborghini in certain certain roads in
the pool it's the same you made some
good points on me about how
manufacturers have done certain things
to bring down the size of a phone but
make the screen bigger Josh curious what
you think if you think that we're gonna
be seeing a push towards seven-inch Plus
phones next year or anything I would say
why not and let's see how they skirt all
of this all of this quote-unquote wasted
space that might be that might occur
because someone in our chat I'm sorry I
don't remember your name I got a look
back on it it got buried under all the
other comments said that yes the the
screens are taller like Jaime said and
then when you watch in landscape there's
the there's the what do they call that
the pillarboxing
so is that a waste of space it kind of
is like it kind of is I mean come on
please don't tell me that you didn't
survive at a time when televisions were
making the move from sit from four by
only the sixteen by nine I totally agree
but its octagon on a phone that is over
seven inches large like that's kind of
annoying it was annoying and I get the
point and I find it hilarious whenever I
get comments of like when are we gonna
make the move to 18 by 9 video and I'm
like shoot like not even cameras sensors
exactly find in that in that symmetry
yet if I want to provide if I want to
use the full sensor I need to film in
sixteen by nine one and two have you
ever seen the pillarboxing on an iPad
which is what a lot of people use to
consume content particularly on
airplanes like everybody's using iPads
or you know tablets that are sixteen by
nine and so why do I want to create that
pillarboxing
I would rather figure out a phrase a way
to frame myself and if you want to see
screen to zoom in dude I mean you've got
the option yeah it's just it's there and
then yeah it'll compromise this is what
I'm saying so pillarboxing is one and
then let you zoom in you cut the top and
bottom off like it's it's kind of dumb
and there's still some content out there
that I do consume that's four by three
action classic TV sometimes there you go
so here's the thing this is like the
dongle life that we're living where I
have my microphone connected to this
laptop using an adapter from Samsung
because it doesn't have USB a and there
will be a time when this microphone will
ship with a USBC connector try to find I
try to find a mini not micro mini USB
cable to USB see they don't exist
they don't know they don't exist yeah
you know all right so speaking of our
speaking of our pillar boxing Brandon
now that we're getting into it
you guys both unboxed your phones
already though huh so there's not really
much to show can we can we can can you
guys comment on one thing for me because
I'm I know I'm going to throw the box at
the wall when I see this in person cuz I
know this is the case there's no adapter
for a headphone right no what the heck
like come on you got okay first of all I
am the truly wireless but advocate I
agree
but what I I don't know this still
pisses me off I don't know why I you
know to be fully honest with you I'm not
like because first of all to be fully
honest with you I never use that dongle
like I gave him away to my son because
he likes to use wired headphones he's a
smart kid but I don't like for me it's
it's been I've been using Bluetooth for
the past six years yeah you know and
it's funny like I I will use this just
because it connects to the microphone
and I'm able to monitor the audio but an
absolutely everything else if air pods
had a better design I would use air pots
like why not I just I feel that they've
brought in so much convenience and just
how easy it is to put them to put them
on take them off and how they can
connect to every single one of your
Apple products so seamlessly I feel that
it's a genius move it's just a terrible
design but I feel that that's just we
need to embrace it man
hey just because your ears don't work
with iPods doesn't mean it's a terrible
design I don't I totally agree that my
ears have not
shrunk over the last couple of years
sadly as I was expecting that to happen
but ya know I mean that's that's it it
is where I was going yeah Brendon when
was the last time you unboxed an iPhone
it's been a very long time
oh we do remember which phone that was
maybe the 5s maybe oh my goodness it's
been a long time
so we're ten we're ten generations in on
the iPhone and you can you can share
whatever your experiences are on
unboxing this particular device does it
still have the magic it used to have
because I've never unboxed an iPhone not
not not with the grandeur that it used
to have you know because the iPhone is
the phone that everyone was like the
plastic peel and all that I feel it's I
feel it's do you guys remember unboxing
HTC products not recently not recently
but I'm talking from the Pocket PC days
and probably up until the last Windows
Mobile devices right before they made
the change to Android their boxes were
awesome and and there was a time when
HTC made palm palm devices right yes
right exactly so you remember those box
designs and just the whole unboxing
experience is stunning it was awesome
so what about special yes so for me and
by the way my my unboxing should be live
soon I'm still putting together a couple
of clips but honestly like the iPhone
experience unboxing is asked with the
first iPhone it's just a small box with
everything the unboxing experience that
I really like this time was the Apple
watch well what was it about the Apple
watch
so I already dropped it and because of
the way the box is now so the boxes this
is this compartment and the watch
doesn't come with the band the watch
doesn't come with the bands anymore and
so it's the the just the the piece of
the watch is in here the bands are
separate and then so it's funny the
moment that I lifted it on video boom
the watch fell
oh no but it's just the way they put it
together wear the watch band is here and
then there's kind of an elaborate
yeah package yeah no dude this is like
and I there's a piece of the package
down there that I can't reach for right
now but it's got like hold on
we try to get it it's got like different
designs of Apple watches and just
different options and I feel that they
did that really well it reminds me of
the old times with HTC devices where you
had an accessory for everything and it
just the the box just the quality of the
box everything felt really good okay I
think the best iPhone box things I can
remember were the ones where like the
form factor had changed but I remember
good unboxing the 500 pretty so that is
kind of cool yeah cool and just the way
you want to wrap the box so these are
like little tabs at the bottom like this
and then you snap and then you start
unpeeling this and then once you peel it
off there's another inner box that's so
HTC man I see I like that you I like
that you you ended it with that was so
HTC because there are a lot of people
one thing that I always found
incredulous about Apple fans is that
they do little details they would go
nuts over and I'm like it's I don't know
this is an Apple way of talking but it's
it's just you know that HTC an Apple
collaborated for a few years yes yes
particularly at the time of the iPhone 6
between the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 6
they collaborated a lot from the design
of the antenna built into the aluminum
and everything that's all in HTC design
by the way and so you know it's one of
those things where I love a company that
has attention to detail in things like
the packaging I do praise it because
you're not paying 3 bucks for these
things yeah so so while we while we are
chiming in a little bit about our
unboxing situations and whatnot I don't
I don't know if I'm gonna do one when my
phone comes in in the next hour so babe
I don't know it's not it hasn't arrived
yet I'm on the west coast it's already
like yeah it's 3 3 p.m. for you guys
already sorry sorry it's all good I will
I don't know if I'll maybe I'll do
something on IG live or something like
that who knows
but we do have a little bit of news
about the iPhone 10 as we're talking
about the unboxing experience and all
that stuff so the suppliers of the
iPhone that make that basically
manufacture the physical parts for it
did I include the company Foxconn
they're a little bit worried about the
high prices of the iPhone because
well everyone makes a speculation that
how much is a phone like this truly
worth when there's a ton of overhead on
top of it because obviously these phones
are very expensive and here's where I'm
gonna bring in my story yeah I stayed up
late until 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. to preorder
the 10s Max and after all the horror
stories that I heard about pre-ordering
and how tough it is to do so I had the
easiest I had the easiest time just
doing I just I just got in I hit I want
the gold one 64 gigabyte I'm not gonna
fill it up too crazy anyway and then
boom I bought it I was nice why was that
it oh that's that's because people
aren't like pre-ordering in the droves
that they used to so like yeah you can
go through Apple system and there's like
less congestion and get your order
through boom it ships when everyone else
gets it and there's no congestion yeah
ii didn't we have news where Apple had
like hijacked I don't know how many
cargo planes and just placed an order
like really an event like for example my
iPhone shipped from Connecticut it
didn't ship from Shenzhen now mine did
yeah and so I feel you know the one
thing that Tim Cook is really good at is
distribution now I mean I feel that they
were if you remember they got like a
really thought they got scolded by the
board but they were like you know we
need to figure this out this whole we
don't make enough phones for the demand
like it doesn't really matter how many
phones you can manufacture at the
beginning eventually they'll they will
sell like people will end up buying them
at some point in the case of iPhones and
so I don't think you know Foxconn made
the comment and it's you know it's it's
understandable but a lot of people were
making comments oh there are not so many
lines right now in front of the Apple
Store it doesn't go around the block I
think it's just because people are
getting smarter about ordering perhaps
oh but I was in a room I have I think it
was a family vacation so I had my
parents and my girlfriend and my brother
his girlfriend my brother's girlfriend
is a huge Apple fan and I guess you
could say my girlfriend is a somewhat
former Apple fan is that okay she was
acceptable this is the point I was
make everyone in the room was excited
but me and the reason why is because of
that price tag
it was $1200 down the drain in less than
five clicks less than five clicks buddy
but like for example my my
so the UPS driver is like my buddy his
name is James Bowie
so James walks in and I'm like dude I've
been waiting for you for a bit I mean
he's like he's like dude I'm here early
he was here like a like 10 minutes
before 10:00 he's always here at 10 a.m.
and the guy was like and no and he's
like and I know what you're waiting for
I've got 387 more packages to deliver
and I just delivered another 50 before I
got here mmm so do the math how many
iPhones is one UPS truck delivering
that's a very expensive truck yeah one
UPS truck just do the math dude it's a
that's about 500 phones for one one
driver yeah he's like dude it's gonna be
crazy today so yeah and it did look like
it a lot of our friends are or love our
friends went to Apple stores and it did
look like it was kind of it was it's not
quite the madhouse it used to be but
it's still madhouse so to sort of quell
these different speculations about how
expensive the phone is and why it's so
expensive and whether or not the
suppliers are kind of feeling the the
penny pinch a little bit
Tim Cook did do an interview on Good
Morning America basically stating why
the iPhone 10's is priced the way that
it is and there were a couple of really
interesting like takes that he made on
it so when you think about it I'll just
you know what I'll just read the way
that yeah I didn't see the interview
tell me yeah so what this is what this
is what uh this is why you ended up
saying basically we want to make an
iPhone for everyone that's always been
our objective and we've got several
iPhones in line and the prices go down
to materially low I'm gonna skip that
part but the way for most people with
these as it turns out is they do a deal
with a carrier and they pay so much per
month so if you look at even the phone
that's priced over $1000 most people are
paying $30 a month for it that's just a
dollar a day
one cent a minute I mean come on no no
so David Cogan made like the perfect
analogy he's like why am I going to
order the iPhone last year why am I
going to order the iPhone eight or eight
plus and not the iPhone 10 it's just six
dollars more a month oh geez those
comparisons stop though nobody was like
dude I drink six dollars six dollars in
in just the amount of cop drink every
day million now she compared to a
Starbucks latte he's like I drink today
that six bucks right there you're their
children for six you see Jules just
brought it in right there see it'sit's
that plus car payments mortgages now I
get it and for me is so my account
argument was like all right so we live
in a world where all companies want to
make some money out of us like like if
you wanted to use Adobe tools that's a
that's like wow like 60 bucks a month if
you want to use Microsoft tools that's
like $12 a month and then you've got
Netflix for another 11 then you've got
Hulu for nine and then you've got Apple
is so you've got Spotify for 10 bucks
and once you do the math yes you're
gonna end up with like a two hundred
dollar bill just in subscriptions and
then an you know the the extra six bucks
for your iPhone but you know what that's
what that's you know this is the system
is where we are right now you know what
the problem is Josh I wish that would
there so I remember when HTC came up
with the with the m7 you know and they
were like four megapixels as all people
need and four megapixels is it and the
phone was a huge it wasn't a flop
but it did didn't sell well because you
can't just tell people that you're gonna
reduce technology and charge them more
and people are gonna be fine with it
the problem with iPhones you know what
it is that people still buy them yeah
that's the process that there was a let
me find that comment real quick someone
was in the live chat with this DBS said
oh my goodness it's gonna take a while
you guys are very active in the chat
today
which is great thank you so much but it
was it was some sort of it was some sort
of comment about virtue how virtue would
make $1500 phones and then they ended up
going bankrupt that's not gonna happen
with Apple No
simply put but I guess I guess there is
still the argument though that you know
for the average person as Jules was
trying to say in our check here the for
the average person this is still a lot
to ask you know is yeah it is it is and
people just don't in the barn um but
hold on you made a good point right now
it's remember the thing that we were
talking about Xiaomi with the ads on the
app on their settings and stuff mm-hmm
Apple controls their App Store just like
Xiaomi controls the App Store in China
Apple makes 30 percent off of every
transaction in their App Store their
music store their movie store their
everything that's the reason why they're
so wealthy and this is the reason why
Shou Musa made sense so yes the no
apples not gonna go bankrupt mainly
because of how much they how many
services revolve around iPhones and how
they create this walled garden that they
actually make aspirational with all
their advertisement and the fact that
people still buy them that you know
whose fault it is your your fault
because for 1300 hours here's why simple
economics things are worth what people
will pay for them and as long as you
guys keep spending 12 and 13 hundred
dollars on your phones Apple is gonna be
able to charge it because the market
says you are the market that and
everyone listening they say that's okay
I'll spend a mortgage payment on a
frickin phone I would have loved I would
have loved when the iPhone 10 came out
and for the quarter results to be like
ya know we've we've had our first
decline since this is the iPhone success
yeah definitely and then boom we're
gonna price it more aggressively you
know I wish that would have happened
that actually didn't so Apple did sell
like crazy when it came to the the first
iPhone and even then if you remember it
was $500 plus the plan in AT&amp;amp;T with the
first iPhone then came the iPhone 3G and
instead of going $500 it was 200 like
they dropped $300 even if they sold well
with the first iPhone so I was waiting I
was waiting for that to happen with the
iPhone 10s be like all right we already
paid for all the are and
deal with the iPhone 10 we've already
done this now we're gonna drop the price
no because people went crazy and bought
the I like I haven't I have rarely seen
people with an iPhone 8 plus or an
iPhone 8 everybody has a 10
well yeah everybody has it you know what
you touch upon something that is it's
kind of our next topic here like
upgrading from an iPhone 10 to a tennis
or a tennis max does it for you who have
sorry King tongue-tied for you right now
Jaime who has the 10s and now the 10 so
that that is like does that feel like a
lateral move to you or is it is it
actually an upgrade that you're willing
to make if you were not who you are it
could be to be fully honest the only
reason why I went for gold was because I
couldn't tell people that I was
reviewing the 10s if haha if I baked
gray that I prefer and it's the only
reason I chose gold I actually don't
like the color because like your your
finger smudges make the stainless steel
look darker which is one of the reasons
why I like the Space Gray I feel that it
aged better i dude like I don't think
that this phone has I'm probably biased
I need to start using it to be able to
give you like a full opinion but like
there's really no reason to upgrade so
far the only the only reason for me
would be the camera on the iPhone 10 was
not good it was decent it was not good
so if I go out and I start taking photos
and this phone and presses me then I'll
be like alright fine I get it there are
some people on social right now who are
saying that smart HDR seems to be doing
a pretty good job everybody's like oh
the cameras dramatically better yeah but
but these are the same people that in
the review were like oh the camera on
the iPhone 10 is great I'm like no it's
not no it's not compared to what like
it's great compared to what the iPhone 7
no I don't know man like like dynamic
range on the iPhone 10 it's just bad
well this morning dr is doing it so like
there are some examples out there that
look like they're you know it's doing
it's doing a job like I say it's doing D
job but it's cuz just doing a job as far
as video goes that's gonna be where I
I'm going to be very scrutinizing about
just a small slightly selfish plug Jon M
Chu who is the director of crazy rich
Asians
he used an iPhone 10 s max to film a
short and it actually looks pretty good
but you know then again you put a phone
like this in the directors hands and of
course they're gonna be able to do some
good stuff with it
there is one dead giveaway though is
when he tries to do slo-mo footage using
the 10s Max and it's footage of a
breakdancer I don't like where
slow-motion is going on smartphones
where everyone's trying to go higher and
higher and higher in the frame rates
because it causes flicker in
incandescent lighting 1:20 but that's
the thing like was it a was it a bright
or a dim shot it was it was a bright it
was a well lit shot inside of like a
garage I know but it was inside a garage
that's the problem it's basic principle
of filming I mean your shutter speed
determines everything yeah so if you're
if you're gonna give me a nine hundred
and sixty frames per second video which
the iPhone doesn't it's 240 but if
you're doing 240 you better make sure
you get me like what's the maximum
shutter speed of an iPhone is the
question I just don't know I just I
don't think it's capable of providing
enough shutter speed to compensate for
that frame rate and therefore you need a
lot of light you can't do good slow-mo
if it's not in daylight yes exactly
that's why 120 120 is perfect why does
everyone going to 40 like once when he
was perfectly fine and it doesn't cause
flicker anyway sorry we keep
interrupting Brendan I was just gonna
say I just took a picture first time on
the on the excess Max and the zero
shutter lag thing is real like I can't
believe how fast it takes the picture do
you guys remember the first iPhone you'd
see this animation when Shh it was like
literally three seconds but I may check
it out take a picture well there go if
you use the camera a lot there goes your
battery life because Apple watch my
theory with that unfortunately is that
if it's always doing something so that
you have zero shutter lag that's also
going to it's going to cut into the
battery and there's a story that just
broke today about about the battery life
on the two phones and apparently
it's Jules was doing the math for me
over here the iPhone 10 has a 26:59
million power battery but why I'm sorry
let me let me change that the iPhone 10
had a 27 16 million barrel battery while
the 10 s has a lower capacity at 26:59
Abbey you've got the seven nanometer
processor like every time that Apple has
made a jump to in nanometers meaning to
drop technically every time that they've
done that they have reduced the battery
size if you remember they did it when
they did the 64 bit between the iPhone 5
and the iPhone 5s they dropped the
battery size they did the same thing
between the 6 and the 6s and you know
it's what's happening now I guess so
apparently apparently a obviously people
are going to be up in arms about that
whole thing
you know meanwhile we have this battery
in the note 9 but the we'll see what
happens there but I'm not looking
forward to the fact that zero shutter
lag might be great but if it's always
doing something that means battery life
F for a vlogger
is going to be much lower now I'm gonna
defend iPhones our galaxy s 9 review our
there's a video that we did comparing
the iPhone 10 versus the note 9 and data
speeds and I think there's another I'm
not talking to you why would it say
exactly it's the worst
it is so dumb it doesn't even know and
you're not talking to it but uh so I
these videos have a lot of footage
filmed in an iPhone 10 at 4k at 60 you
need a gimbal uh but if you like if you
use a DJI Osmo with an iPhone 10 at
1080p at 60 it is incredible it's it's
red for a phone it's really good I'll
take you up on that I will use my Osmo
too let's see how it turns out I'm
looking forward to that now okay we have
one last story as far as iPhones go but
I do want to just call out one person
that was in the live chat okay maybe I
do drink fancy tea and that's a lot of
you know this love money every day
sometime
okay I get it but still these phones are
very expensive someone was like Josh
drinks $25 worth of fancy tea every day
why is he talking about I'm like hey Dad
everyone has a vice all right so our
final story on the iPhones at least I
have to do with the iPhone 10 or which I
will admit I'm kind of excited to check
out I was I was disappointed when the
10r was not I I didn't really keep up
with the news the 10r was not available
for pre-order yet when I got the 10s max
I think that I would actually be excited
the way that I wasn't with the 10s max
to check out the 10 or any takes from
you guys about this metal phone find
bringing back metal but I so probably if
they would have launched the iPhone 10s
in red that would have been like oh I
want that but I think that the coolest
thing about the 10 ed the 10 R is really
the color options and that red looks
real I'm going yellow yellow yeah Rendon
oh sorry
with hi made it the coolest part about
that is is the colors otherwise like I
don't know it doesn't have the OLED
screen it has what a liquid LCD what
does that even mean well I don't know
like Apple does really good out cities
like I'll give them that
I I don't like I used the A+ at some
point and I don't really tell a
difference with the 10 like at all well
do you have a hot take on this whole
little controversy about the liquid
Retina display having the same PPI as
the iPhone 4 was everyone but yeah but
that's the thing like I mean Apple Apple
if you do what is what was the PPI on
the a+ i and on the 8 so they're
literally just making a lateral phone
with a knotch that's what they're doing
they're giving people like a consolation
of they can't buy the 10s and I you know
they're building a phone for everybody
at every price point they are keeping
the 7 they're keeping the 8 then they've
got the 10 are and then they've got the
10s in 10x max you can pick whichever
iPhone you want please don't buy this
than everybody that's the worst iphone
ever I would highly recommend the 88
plus those were good oh my god and and
by the way now that we're in the podcast
let's let's talk about these upgrades
before if you want let's finish with the
10r but then I have something to say
about the Apple watch before before I
forget okay um I guess to to our
producer maybe we won't be talking about
this huawei story but there is one thing
that I do want to say though there's one
thing that I want to make sure that we
touch upon it we don't have to talk at
length about it okay there were no air
pods at the event I was a little bit
disappointed about that because I wanted
to see what they would take the air pods
next there wasn't even the air power and
apparently Huawei is going to start
making their own version of that of the
air pods or that design that does have
wireless charge and called the free buds
but I just kind of like I would
recommend all the listeners and viewers
go to go go to pocket now and check out
this story because it's kind of an
interesting concept of having the free
buds the case actually have a wireless
charging in and out available so you can
charge your phone using the battery in
the free buds case I kinda that's kind
of cool
yeah you have to Oh hold on Jose is
correcting me sorry oh you can try sorry
you can charge the free buds using the
phone there you go thank you sorry I was
saying that wrong so the phone can
wirelessly charged the free buds when
they are in their case which i think is
kind of that's still cool I mean I got I
got mixed up but that's still pretty
cool you have to buy into that ecosystem
obviously but that's the way Apple works
anyway so hopefully we'll get air power
at some point in the future or pods too
might actually be pretty awesome and
it'll dictate how truly wireless earbuds
are in the future I just want to make
sure I gave my two cents on that
particular part so make sure you take
out that story on pocketnow.com alright
so uh
Jaime with his final hot takes before we
wrap up the Apple watch Series 3 was a
device that I recommended that I was
like yes finally we have an Apple watch
that can run applications and that
brings like in the case of the series ii
had brought ceramic at the back and so
it didn't scratch and that's the only
way that these sensors are gonna work
have you guys noticed the specifications
for the series three the pretty much
what they're not telling people it's
it's not the same watch it's not the
same series three that we got previously
so if you order the GPS only variant now
that one doesn't have ceramic it has a
composite back and the only way for you
to get ceramic on series 3 is if you go
for the LT variant oh do not I repeat do
not buy an Apple watch with a composite
back you're gonna save a little money
but that composite back because of the
charger design will scratch so much so
much that the sensors won't work oh ah
and so it just doesn't make any sense
free to pay a little less money for a
series 3 anymore and it pisses me off
like Apple is like yeah so now we're
gonna have the series 4 and a series 3
and you can pick whichever one but
they're not being straightforward with
you in the fact that they're making
changes the series 3 so it's not the
same watch this is me off man well now
we know thank you buyers beware
definitely alright well on that note I
guess we can go ahead and call it on
this one so I love talking about the
iPhone 10s the 10s max make sure you get
