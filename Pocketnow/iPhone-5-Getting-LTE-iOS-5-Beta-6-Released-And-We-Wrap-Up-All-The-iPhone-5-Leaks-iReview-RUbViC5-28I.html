bug fixes we around the ball at current
links of the iphone 5 they rumors have
that the iphone five will get LTE after
all all this and more coming up right
now hello everybody I'm hi Madeline and
welcome to the pocket now I review the
show we go through all this week school
and the not so cool inside the world of
Apple's iOS devices let's start this
week off with the cool well it seems
that our past report regarding the
release of the iPhone 5 has brought up a
lot of debate we say that it will
probably be released on September
seventh but all things he came on the
record to state that no it'll most
likely be released in october and they
could be right but think about it Apple
never changes or usually doesn't change
the base of their events their September
music event has happened obviously in
September for the past 25 years non-stop
so most likely they won't change the
date of their event they most likely
will announce the iphone 5 on September
and launch it for sale in October makes
all the sense in the world Apple's never
had an iphone being announced one day
and being released the same day most
likely it's just an announcement in
September a release for sale in October
let's wait to see what time tells well
iOS 5 beta 6 has just been released the
developers and it brings a lot of bug
fixes to the table first of all photo
albums are now working iCloud restores
are working and bookmarks don't seem to
be multiplying within multiple devices
hopefully they figured that out and then
it seems things are moving forward this
time you don't have to delete your
device completely to be able to update
over the air so it seems that everything
is working fine but still verizon
customers a couple of Verizon customers
just now have been complaining of
problems making phone calls it seems
that it can only make their calls on
speaker so definitely not good but still
too early to know so we'll see what time
tells eventually and we'll keep you
posted about it interesting enough
images a diff surfaced of LTE equipment
being used within Apple stores to test
devices and we've all heard the rumors
of apple using iphone 4 units with
different internals to test what we
could expect to be the next generation
iphone
now having this equipment being tested
raises the bar Apple wasn't really clear
about the fact that we would get LTE
this year or not Tim Cook even came on
record to say that they were going to be
pushing LT to 2012 because first of all
it wasn't really well adopted yet and
second it made the device too big so it
does seem that Apple is planning to
bring something to the iphone 5 and
given that Apple has been delaying the
device probably almost three to four
months it could be that Apple was just
waiting for the right time to bring this
equipment to work in look getting the
device so we'll see and speaking of
iphone 5 rumors let's go through the
leaks and see what we can find first of
all there's been a lot of talk of new
ones and sri technologies bringing a lot
better voice integration to the iphone 5
they're talking about a new
revolutionary uy for the way you speak
to your phone and for the way your phone
responds to you not sure what to make of
that just yet again these are just
rumors aside from that we have images of
factory workers a twin tech building
iphone 5 screens and they do look larger
than the iphone 4 and also you do see a
larger home button but again these are
just leaks not really sure that they'll
be making it there and well aside from
that so iphone 5 parts have leaked these
are headphone jacks that have been
leaked in white and black but
interesting enough everybody's
mentioning that the next generation
iphone 5 will have a curved back but
still if you look at the headphone jack
in the ipod touch 4 and then the ipad 2
you'll notice that it has a certain
curvature to it and you don't see these
curves on these leaked to headphone
jacks you see them completely flat so
cut the iphone 5 bring up flat back or
curve back time will tell and that are
the deals for the week go get your latte
at starbucks because they're currently
offering a free application for every
purchase that you make all you have to
do is make your purchase and pick up a
card at the cash counter where you'll be
getting a free application every week
and they're doing a really good job
because first of all their first
application which is a mon coeur which
costs three books in the App Store and
is a really good application so you're
not really getting cheaped out on this
and well the only problem with this is
that it's the app pic of the week so
you're like me and you drink three
lattes a day you'll be getting three
cards of the same application but still
they make really good
so it's either that or you drink too
much coffee like I do and well aside
from that Skype is offering this
application called skype Wi-Fi where
they'll be making available 1 million
hot spots around the world where you can
be actually logging on and paying with
your skype credits a really good option
and well aside from that rage and rage
HD are currently free for the week and
the week is almost over so better make
sure you go into the app store and get
it because they got I don't know how
many likes on their facebook page and
they're offering it for free as part of
their commitment really nice okay so
that does it for the cool that's
continuing on with the not-so-cool
tablets aren't really our Britain butter
here but we were looking into the
lawsuit that Apple's recently brought to
Samsung for their galaxy tab 10.1 and we
saw a lot of really bad business
practices Adam Lane recently posted an
article written by one of our readers
where he actually compared the images
that Apple's submitted of the galaxy tab
10.1 and compare them to the images of
the real Galaxy Tab 10.1 and we noticed
there were a lot of differences call
this a really lame way to try to get
your way I mean Apple the ipad 2 is a
really good product in the opinions of
many people you really don't need to use
fake images of a product to try to get
your way why don't you just let
competition do its way and make your
products good enough to compete and sell
by themselves let customers say what
they want and not have your lawsuits and
lawyers be dealing with things in ways
that are completely non ethical I mean
talk about a coat of Business Conduct
there are other images of the Samsung
Galaxy S line that's being compared to
the iphone and being sued over that and
still you did manipulate the images too
so not really good practices my friends
you really need to change that and well
speaking of lawsuits HCC just filed a
patent lawsuit against apple for two
different pens that are pertaining
communications and Wi-Fi where it seems
that Apple has been infringing these
pens ever since the first generation
iphone was launched and well it what can
I say I mean Apple you've been suing
everybody and let's just say that you
pretty much ended up bringing this upon
yourself first of all HCC has been in
the market for a while so we do see
probably the HTC will win those patent
wars
just as no get that winning you know
it's just to give you an idea of why
don't you just try to get along with
your competition and build really good
products that are going to do a lot
better than your current competition
than having to go the court for
everything that's popping up there on
your mind then that's it for today's
show thank you very much for watching
I'm hi many veteran number to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
