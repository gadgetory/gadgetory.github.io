quarter results disappoint and nokia
announced is the Lumia 810 on t-mobile
I'm hi Mary vera and yes I'm proudly
wearing this jersey and this is parking
out daily those of you who are still on
the ropes about getting a nexus 7 this
holiday season are in for a treat since
I soon made the venerable mistake of
shipping a 32 gigabyte tablet does
somebody the only order the 16 year by
tablet and if you think of it the only
reason why people complain about the
Nexus 7 is because it doesn't have
expandable storage so it's always great
to have an extra option of storage now
we still don't have any dates for
particular prices but if a susan was
able to ship that tablet now that's
because they're ready almost now and
speaking of Google they've now made
another move to show the world that they
care about tablets that's second only to
their launch of the Nexus 7 this time
because they finally sent out a check
with the developers to help them build
better quality applications for tablets
because if any of you have ever handled
Twitter on Android tablet you'll
understand just how frustrating that is
now sadly we don't know if that's gonna
be mandatory or not but let's just hope
developers get the picture android
tablets need better apps seriously now
recent leaks already have sony working
on their 2013 flagship smartphones and
listen I said flagship smartphones
because we have three devices with
different code numbers but the same code
named Odin and they have the same spec
so this could be just different variants
for carriers or regions like the T the T
X and the TL but what's interesting here
is that Odin codename if any of you have
ever heard that in sams and that's the
way Samsung device is moving to stock
Android so stock Android Sony Xperia
Nexus devices you never know yes nokia
has just announced the Lumia 810 on
t-mobile and yes the news are
interesting if you were worried about
the fact that the Lumia 820 was stuck on
a TNT exclusively now there's a variant
for tmobile it's kind of similar to the
820 the design is different so the
interchangeable backs are not the same
but you can interchange the fact you get
the same specs from the 810 and now all
we need is a variant
Lumia 19 for tmobile how about a 930 for
verizon and called the 944 sprint I
don't care and finally for the sad news
of the day HTC has just provided their
quarter results and they're not good at
all I mean the company is down a
depressing seventy-nine percent of net
profits when compared to last year if
you want me to rephrase that they barely
made twenty one percent of the profits
that they made in this same period last
year and it just makes me wonder what's
going on I mean what's wrong with HTC
the HTC One series is beautiful there's
nothing wrong with the products I
thought they were doing great but that
leads me to the question of the day what
do you think HTC is doing wrong to be
honest with you their phones are great
they're built quality is great in my
opinion sincerely I think their
marketing is really bad I think they
need to make a better push with carriers
and not delude brands with like the one
series with different carriers but leave
us a comment down below what do you
think now if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening at a
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi never be better
