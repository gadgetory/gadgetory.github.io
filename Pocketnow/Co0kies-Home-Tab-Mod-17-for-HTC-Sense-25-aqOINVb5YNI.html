packing.com and today we're looking at
version 1.7 of cookies home tab mod for
HTC sense 2.5 we've covered this awesome
mod before but now that it's matured
quite a bit and has even more amazing
features I think it's time we gave you
another video update so here's a touch
pro2 with version 1.7 of the mod applied
and right off the bat you can see that
there are some new items on the home
screen we still have the links at the
bottom and right above that we have our
expandable appts a new feature here is
the notification bar for missed calls
SMS and emails tapping on the icons will
take you to their respective areas this
allows me to move my email and SMS tabs
further down the slider so that I can
access some of these other options much
more quickly we can also retract the
slider out of view but that will come
later in this video and as you can see I
now have an analog clock with the
weather on the side rather than the
traditional flip clock were used to
seeing this is where the customization
comes in if we go to menu edit home
layout we can now tap and hold on items
to get a nice little pop-up with options
to either remove that item or to change
its appearance so as you can see there
is an at all analog clock a dual clock
the familiar manila clock a more basic
manila clock a compact clock and the one
I was using before I'm going to go with
this smaller looking clock and resizing
is not an issue because another new
customization feature is the ability to
move and reorganize items so I can
actually drag all these items around I
think I'll put the clock weather and
appointments near the top I'll put the
Quick Links in the middle
and notifications can go down to the
bottom since I have some extra space
here I'll tap and hold and actually
display two rows of icons now so that
looks good if we click this right
softkey we can actually get a list of
the different options as well so I'm
going to go to done and now we have our
Quick Links and our appointments another
new feature actually brings home screen
items to the lock screen so if we tap
this lock icon in the corner you can see
that the task bar now sports the
notification bar and we have some HTC
Sense items at the bottom we have a
left-to-right unlock slider let's go
ahead and unlocks luck and show you how
to edit the layout of the lock screen so
we go to menu edit lock screen layout
and now we can move stuff around and
change their appearance by tapping and
holding so I'm going to go with an
analog clock using cookies Home tab
editor we can change the unlock slider
to the windows mobile 6.5 style or even
to a vertical slider style like on the
HD Mini to do this we'll need to access
cookies Home tab editor which also has
some nice new options so I'll press the
back key to finalize these changes and
let's go to menu and we'll go to cookies
Home tab editor
as you can see the editor has been
changed a bit it looks much nicer now
and has many more options so let's go
ahead and jump into the first category
which is quick link settings as you can
see we have different grid layouts we
have three by three quick links 4 by 4 5
by 4 and 5 by 5 we can also change the
number of panels or pages before by
default in the last version it was only
three pages but now you can actually
increase this to up to six let's go to
five and i'll leave the default starting
page i'll change that to three and we
can also choose to hide empty quicklinks
hide icon frames hi text and text
background and the page indicator so
those are more preference options so
let's go back and we'll go to lock
screen settings here we can show lock
button enable the custom lock screen
which I have done enable default lock
screen lock on standby unlock on call
lock after call unlock when plugging
into power lock on unplugging enable dim
lipton backlight animation on power
enable vibration when locked or unlocked
you can set the suspend timeout and at
the bottom here's where we can change
the lock slider style so right now it's
set to manila you can also change this
to the windows mobile 6.5 default style
slider and the last option is to give it
the HD mini style so I'm going to do
that and we'll go back go to
applications and here you can basically
assign different actions to all the
buttons on the home screen so if you
want to launch G alarm for the alarm
button or maybe thumb Cal for the
calendar you can assign that he
let's go back and finally miscellaneous
settings so here we can set the
animation style for when we slide up and
down on the Quick Links we can have no
animation simple animation and optimized
animation which I've selected because it
works well on devices like the touch pro
2 if you have an hd2 you may want to
select original animation we can choose
to hide or show the call history button
I have it set to auto so only when I get
a missed call a new feature is this
voicemail button so we can choose to
hide or show that it's set to auto so it
will only show up when I actually get a
voicemail hide or show appointments you
can pick the action for when you press
on an appointment if it takes you to the
calendar tab or opens up the editor you
can check the days to look ahead for
appointments and here we can select to
retrack the slider we can also select if
we want to show the seconds hand on the
analog clock and set the maximum
appointment count to show at any given
time and if you really wanted to you can
change the operator text so that about
does it for this editor I'll go ahead
and press apply changes and we'll come
back and show you what the changes look
like alright so now we're on the lock
screen after applying the changes with
the editor and as you can see we now
have an HD mini style unlock slider
right here we can just slide downwards
to unlock it's very smooth and here we
have a retractable slider for all your
tabs so if you wanted to make your
screen look a bit cleaner less cluttered
you can just enable this option to
collapse the taps another option we set
was to increase
the quicklinks panels from three to five
so now instead of three we have what
seems like an endless amount of icon
grids I don't think you'll have any
trouble with finding slots for all your
programs remember we can also select to
hide all these empty slots here so that
it doesn't look as messy so this was a
look at cookies Home tab mod version 1.7
