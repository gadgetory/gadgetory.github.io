of iphones sold so far FaceTime makes it
to the mac though not everything is okay
just yet and it seems rim is not too
happy with Steve Jobs recent sales
results all this and more coming up
right now hello everybody I'm high
Meadow iveta and welcome to the park and
nail I review the show we go through all
this week school and they're not so cold
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start off this week with the cool
now Apple squirrel results are in and
guess how many iPhones were sold in just
that quarter 14.1 million yeah that's a
lot of iphones and give an apples
business model where they only have
pretty much one device being sold on one
carrier and most of the countries that
they work with you could say that's
pretty much enough now one of the
astonishing things about this figure is
the fact that rim only sold 12.1 million
of their gazillion types of blackberries
and their ton of carriers in each of
these countries which is pretty much a
lot this is pretty much the first time
that Apple has such a large number of
sales and it's pretty much the first
time that they sell more than smartphone
king blackberry and according to Apple
rim is not gonna catch him anytime soon
no numbers are Android because you know
there are a lot of carriers and a lot of
OEMs that sell smart phones with android
and they only reveal the amount of
phones that they sell but they don't
tell you how many Android devices were
sold so given the fact that Google
didn't really mention much about the
results you could say iPhone and Apple
are right really cool now if you
remember our old rumors about an iPhone
3.2 and a 3.3 being rumored to be
existence somewhere it seems that it's
been confirmed that these devices are
already out on the blue being tested now
nothing's confirmed just yet works
gizmodo and a guy in a bar when you need
them but it seems that it's already out
there and a lot of the possibilities are
that this is the cdma iphone that we've
been waiting for and verizon now
considering on with the iphone verizon
news it seems that this iphone will also
be a world phone why because apparently
it'll also carry the SIM card and the
city of a radio from qualcomm that it's
been rumored to be out there somewhere
we'll see what happens in the end now
apples backs
the mac event happen this weekend you
guessed it it had everything to do with
the mac but one of the cool things that
happened for iOS devices was the fact
that apple just released a version of
facetime to work on the mac so you could
call iphone 4s and the new generation
ipod touch now the only problem with the
application as it's curly on a beta
there are a couple of flaws so we're
going to talk about in the not-so-cool
section but you know the cool thing is
that it's happening you know you can now
facetime with Max and probably the only
question left is view FaceTime I know I
don't really do facetime that much
because there's really not many people
to face time with just yet but features
there now as we mentioned last week it
seems that the rumors are true the dev
team has just confirmed of snow breeze
and the pond aaj tool i hope i
pronounced that right are going to be
able to jailbreak your iOS device for
life as long as it carries an a4 chip
now we're not going to confirm this just
yet because you know this is Apple
hardware and it can be you know changed
at any time but according to the duck
team the only way that Apple can fix
this is if they recall hardware and
change the chip because it has to do
with the firmware well if they say it
they're the experts I'm gonna believe
them let's hope it's true and let's hope
that the iphone 5 and any other releases
in the future keep the a4 chip and being
jailbroken any app you're a big fan of
angry birds just like millions of us are
I know you'll be happy to know that
rovio just released the special edition
of the game for Halloween with new
levels and more difficulties really cool
it only cost a dollar and it's available
in the App Store as of now so aside from
the news that EA bought the developer
let's see what happens with angry birds
in the future
okay so that does it for the cool let's
continue on with a not so cool the
facetime beta version that apple just
released for the mac is really cool but
the problem is there seem to be some
security flaws with the application it
seems that your security questions and
everything you have on your Apple ID
which is this year same iTunes ID that
is available in plain sight and in plain
text for everybody to see in the
application which is really not cool
let's see and let's hope Apple fixes
this on future releases remember this is
just a beta but definitely something we
have to report now it seems rim CEO is
not too happy with apples recent claim
that they sold more iphones in a quarter
then rim sold their gazillion versions
of blackberries in there tons of
carriers that support him now why is
this not so cool well we don't mind the
comment he said that Apple live in a
distorted reality and that they're not
really close to what really happened but
I put my money where my mouth is how
about avram CEO brings their results and
really tells Apple that the wrong that's
the real thing that should happen that's
it for today's I review thank you very
much for watching any questions your
comments you have about this video let
us know in the comments on the post door
in twitter.com slash parking out tweets
or youtube.com slash pocket now video
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
