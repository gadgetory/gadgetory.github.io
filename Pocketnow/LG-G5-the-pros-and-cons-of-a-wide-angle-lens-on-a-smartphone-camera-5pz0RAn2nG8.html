one of the most interesting aspects
about that phone is going to be its dual
sensor camera and a lot of you have been
asking what those different sensors and
different lenses might bring to the
table
I'm Quan Carlos bag nail for Pocket now
and we're gonna take a quick look at why
it's a big deal when a smartphone camera
has a wide-angle lens we're approaching
something of a brick wall as we look at
how we might improve future smartphone
cameras in the past we've been able to
increase sensor size but as we approach
to the half inch smartphone camera
sensor there's not really a lot of room
for us to be able to continue packing in
larger sensors while still keeping the
overall phone shape fairly slim moving
from a 1/3 inch sensor to the roughly
1/2 inch sensor territory that we see on
phones like the galaxy s7 and the Lumia
950 we see terrific improvements to
things like low-light sensitivity
there's just more surface area for that
sensor to soak up more light but we also
see improvements to the more
photographic elements of our photos
things like depth of field blur we get a
prettier bouquet as we blur out items in
the background and in the past we have
played with even larger image sensors
this is a 2/3 inch sensor on the Lumia
1020 but it also comes with this Oreo
lump on the back of the phone which
consumers seem to have not really
particularly enjoyed so the next trend
in smartphone camera evolution seems to
be multiple image sensors now there are
a couple different ways that we can go
about cramming multiple cameras onto the
back of our phone we can have two of the
exact same image sensors on the back of
a phone that still helps with low-light
sensitivity as we are still adding
surface area for more light to be soaked
up for each individual exposure and with
two of the same cameras on the back of
the phone we can also play with other
photography depth-of-field blur kinds of
tricks the strategy LG is employing on
the g5 however is having two different
camera sensors on the back of that phone
there's the primary 16 megapixel sensor
which is going to be very similar in
terms of performance to what we found on
the LG v10 and there's also an 8
megapixel sensor with a very wide field
of view and if you've ever played with
an interchangeable lens camera system
like a DSLR or mirrorless camera you've
probably noticed these little numbers on
the top of every single lens that number
is your focal length on a zoom lens that
focal length
can change the lower the number the
wider the shot the higher the number the
more zoomed in your shot is what makes
LG's experiments so interesting here is
a focus on focal length flexibility a
phone like the iPhone 6s or the upcoming
iPhone se uses a 1/3 inch image sensor
that means the background blur produces
won't be quite as nice as the larger
image sensor from a phone like the LG
v10 so LG figures they probably have the
background blur effect pretty well
handled just from the optics in the
phone now the iPhone might benefit from
having to image sensors of the same
focal length as one lens can blur out
the background and the other lens can
focus on your subject LG is probably
figuring they don't need to mess with
that as much as this larger sensor and
wider aperture already does a pretty
good job of softening elements in your
background
however smartphones do have an issue in
changing up the field of view especially
pushing wide as long as you have enough
resolution you can use that image sensor
resolution to crop the image as you're
cutting away at that image you're
essentially zooming in and of course if
you cut away too much the image quality
will eventually degrade is we do need
some resolution to display details in
your image so we have zooming in pretty
well-covered for most consumer
smartphone photography applications but
up till now if we wanted to get more of
the scene in each photo our only
solution has been to zoom out with our
feet literally walking away from the
subject so we can see more of what's
happening around that subject and in the
past we have played with a couple
variable focal length zoom lenses bolted
onto the backs of phones but if we
weren't willing to put up with the
larger Orio sensor on the Lumia 1020
there are very few consumers who were
really gravitating towards the idea of
keeping a point-and-shoot camera in
their pocket all the time yes one guy in
the comments who's complaining because
this phone fit great in your cargo pants
for the rest of us this was a bit much
so instead of bolting on all of that
additional hardware LG's just popping on
a secondary image sensor and swapping in
a wider focal length lens so the primary
16 megapixel image sensor on the g5 is
gonna have somewhere around a 28
millimeter equivalent lens which equates
to around a 78
degree field of view the secondary image
sensor is going to open that way up
somewhere between a nine and ten
millimeter equivalent lens and a 135
degree field of view that's huge
so the G Phi is gonna have a respectably
wide field of view standard it's going
to have enough resolution to provide you
a decent crop zoom and then if you
really want to open the frame up you can
and we're able to cover all of that
range without having a huge lump on the
back of the phone and before we wrap
this video up we have gotten a couple
questions if having a wide-angle lens is
so cool why not just use that as the
primary camera lens and that comes down
to the way that optics will distort the
image as we start pushing wider and
wider and wider a 135 degree field of
view is just at that border between a
super wide angle lens and a fisheye lens
once we start pushing that wide it's
really difficult to compensate for
barrel distortion straight lines in your
photos will bow out and that effect
continues to exaggerate as you get to
the edges of that lens we can also test
this out using the front-facing cameras
on the LG v10 if I take a picture of my
face I've got kind of a chubby face but
switching over to the wide-angle lens
and then also matching sort of how my
head fits in the frame that wider angle
lens is stretching my face out even
further I mean my face is chubby but
it's not that chubby it's just as a pro
tip if you're ever taking photos of your
friends keep the women in the middle of
the shot especially if you do have a
slightly wider angle lens no women enjoy
being stretched wider than they really
are we're just starting to dig in to
review coverage on the LG g5 and the
camera videos on this thing are gonna be
brutal it's gonna be an intense amount
of content for us to shoot because we've
got two different image sensors and a
bunch of fun features that we need to
take into account when we're actually
reviewing that whole system but we
figured we could start the discussion
off here just taking a look at the
differences between those two camera
sensors those two different lenses and
we know we're gonna be in for some
really interesting dual-camera sensor
fights as phones like the Huawei p9 come
out I hope this video has been able to
help illustrate some of the differences
we're going to see as we start comparing
the optics on different smartphone
camera systems as always folks thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to this channel for future LG g5 and
future smart phone camera coverage and
make sure you
that thumbs up button for a little extra
positive reinforcement for pocket now
I'm Quan Carlos bag now you can chat me
up on Twitter and Instagram as some
gadget guy and I will catch you all on
the next video that's huge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
