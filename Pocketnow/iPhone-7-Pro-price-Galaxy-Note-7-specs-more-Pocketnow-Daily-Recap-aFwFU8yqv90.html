one ad on your videos LOL they're out of
thank you they are any porque esta
jodido no respondes a los comentarios en
tus vídeos y mucho menos on de los
comentarios en español decree superior
o algo que pasa uh nothing really this
is just an english video it's kind of a
given buddy I'm every letter hi mera
mera hai marina never gets old yeah I
know and I love that that's right it's
that time of the week I am hi meta meta
this is pocket now and this is the
parking out daily recap for last week on
Monday the topic was iphone 7 possibly
pro we talked about a dual sim variant
256 gigs of storage and no headphone
jack I asked you what do you think about
duels and smartphones we had 755
comments f dual sim we need a 64 gig
base model if I phones which started 64
gigs that would be awesome but it's
Apple it's not going to happen I think
they'll have their own sim card in one
slot an apple sim card what is it for I
don't know I know what Apple plants to
do with that sim card just baffles me
but if they would make something really
cool just for data it would be awesome
now give me one sim and SD card slot
better oh my god if Apple would ever
provide an external sim card on the
iphone it would just go crazy for them
their whole business model of selling
more expensive iPhones would just die
with that on Tuesday the topic was the
galaxy note 7 the possibility that there
will only be an edge variant and I asked
you if you care about their only being
an edge variant we had 781 comments I by
an ode to write with the S Pen having
curves mixed with their would make it
difficult you know you're probably one
of the few people that actually uses the
note for the S Pen but pay I would want
the regular variances I don't feel it's
sturdy enough to withstand the fall on
its face or on the edge I do agree a few
people that have owned the hotsy s7 edge
or the Galaxy Note edge back of the day
and a lot of trouble with that so ya
know I wouldn't mind what's there not to
like about curved edges I don't even
care about the edge features because I
wouldn't willingly by a notes of an edge
just for the gorgeous curves alone i
partially agree mainly because i love
that show real effect where the edges
make the phone look like if it doesn't
have any bezels what I don't like us how
you hold the phone and how uncomfortable
it is on
things like taking the photograph for
example i wish that samsung would
implement some sort of palm rejection in
certain modes because it's pointless for
you to have the edges activated when
you're trying to take a photo for
example oh man then Wednesday the topic
was iphone pro we heard possible price
points ranging from eight hundred and
twenty bucks to thirteen hundred dollars
and I asked you what do you think about
the price tags we had 1056 comments
thanks a lot guys Apple fanboys it's a
pro so definitely its price is justified
I cannot wait to see apples quarter
results and see how the ipad lineup is
performing with that whole Pro thing I
don't think it went far even though I do
love my ipad pro I'll admit whether or
not you like Apple products you can't
deny that they're a bunch of greedy
bastards ninety-nine dollars for nothing
pencil and the 16 gigabyte base model
with the next one up the 64 gig so you
gotta pay even more yes they make the 16
gigabyte model so difficult for you to
want to buy that you're forced to go for
64 gigs I hate it too and it is
definitely a ski 1354 an iphone who's
pumping LSD into the air conditioning of
the Apple headquarters oh man I don't
know but yeah I do agree i would pay
that much amount of money for a phone
seriously then on thursday the topic was
the possible HTC nexus we had some
leaked specifications and i asked you
what you thought of them we had 689
comments seriously for caiga bytes of
ram is way more than enough I don't
think everybody agrees if your device of
RAM yet android still lags heck see I
told you don't really care about
anything else at the moment Ram is
enough but no expandable storage with 32
gigs in 2016 no definitely no I got yeah
I do have to agree 32 gigs is cutting it
really short and again just forcing
people to buy more stuff because
apartment Android is even if you have an
external storage card there are certain
things you really can't baffle around to
that storage card I wish 64 gig was just
the topic I mean phones are not cheap
storage should not be a problem and
finally on Friday the topic was display
technology I asked you if you cared
about that when buying in a smartphone
because we hear that Apple has a new
supply of 40 LED which is sharp after
foxconn acquired it we had 580 comments
OLED is simply the best technology for
screens iphone screens look terrible in
comparison I don't agree they're not
terrible but definitely OLED is far
better today than it was three years ago
after using a note for from an iphone 5
I can't go back to LCD and here I'm
listening to people saying how good
Apple is in camera and screen oh my god
yes if you look at OLED displays this
year you can definitely tell it the
iphone is outclassed I do agree that
I'll let has come a long way but you
have to remember that back in the day
pentel displays are the last thing that
you want it and then LCD just made it
better so I think that it's cool to see
technologies transition from one
technology being inferior to going
superior clearly Apple needs to do
something about it now I really don't
care about the spy technology as long as
it has good viewing angles and gets
bright I love this comment mainly
because of that IPS LCD displays are
great on LG phones but then the LG g5 is
not so great and then we've got OLED
displays on turn smart phones that don't
really have good angles or have screen
burn issues so I think it's just the
matter of time I mean technology is not
there yet there are cases where phones
have OLED displays and aren't great
phones that have LCD displays that
aren't great so it just that's the
coolest part about reviewing phones that
we get to tell you which ones do a good
job in which ones don't that's it for
the park and out daily recap thank you
