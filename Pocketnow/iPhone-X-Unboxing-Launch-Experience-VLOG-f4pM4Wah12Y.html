so I'm in the Apple Store and Matt hasit
that I was doing the pre-order at 3:00
a.m. this was the only one available in
addition to Williamsburg in Brooklyn but
the line is insane reservations are here
oh sorry about that I actually coming
here to pick up the iPhone that can do
the job do you have enough iPhones for
all the people that are in line
style yeah carrier options Memphis note
down nice
I've got it yes oh man yeah I got it man
yeah let's go back to the apartments
coffee
I'm hi meri behna with pocket now and
yes this was my first experience ever in
ten years of making a line and getting
an iPhone and I think I really got lucky
definitely the difference between making
a crazy line or walking right in is
pre-orders so I'm not regretting waking
up at 3:00 a.m. at all but let's cut to
the chase we are here to talk about
iPhone 10 and we would like to thank D
brand for sponsoring our content the
packaging like in previous years looks
pretty much like every iPhone unboxing
since the iPhone 6 we have a thick white
cardboard box in the design of the
iPhone year buying front and center the
protective plastic includes a flap for
easy access and then we slide the box
from the top to reveal literature first
as we've seen since the iPhone 7 though
this literature is now definitely
completely different focused on a
complete new paradigm shift on how you
operate a new iPhone took the lohit we
have all the goods but I'll come back to
that in a second most important is that
for those of you investing an insane
$1000 for this iPhone you'd think that
this box would include a neat pair of
air pods or a fast charging brick but no
we get the same standard 5 watt charger
the same USB to lightning cable the same
ear pods with a 3.5 millimeter dongle I
guess the price is all about iPhone and
that's something we'll be checking
extensively through our review period
first let's remove this plastic covering
oh yeah off the bat what I'll say first
this Wow
this is one heavy phone and second is
again wow I thought that this phone
would be larger but it's actually
smaller than I thought the stainless
steel finish on the sides of the Space
Gray model is actually a darker tone in
the silver model main reason why I chose
to go Space Gray in the hand and at a
distance it follows Apple's legacy of
feeling like a piece of jewelry and
looking like it as well now the most
important question to answer as a segue
to our future coverage is this this
phone feel like a thousand dollars and
well I will tell you that it does feel
premium now is it worth the amount of
money is something we will be testing
over the next few weeks as we compare it
to other contenders make sure you shimon
in the comments as to which comparison
you'd like to see first and while that
happens I will tell you this is probably
one of the most fingerprint prone
iPhones I've seen yet deep brown skins
will eliminate those fingerprints and
add some grip to your upcoming iPhone 10
