bringing some major internal changes but
not the standard ones LG might still
launch a new flagship soon but you could
not really call that a new phone we've
got news of our project Linda as it
might actually launch this time I'm
Jaime Rivera back in the studio it's
refreshing but yesterday's travel was so
crazy I couldn't get you this video
let's do it today this is pocket house
daily let's speakin today talking about
oneplus if you remember a couple of days
ago we talked about the whole
probability of a security breach in the
company's credit card system the fact
that it was only accepting PayPal as of
today the company has confirmed yes it
did have a security breach of 240
thousand users could have been affected
not necessarily affected so yeah the
company is taking its precautions and
hopefully this will get fixed soon now
let's talk about LG we were expecting a
g7 to be announced
we got the company's CEO claiming that
they were gonna do a completely new
strategy MWC might still see an LG
flagship be announced but the problem is
it's not necessarily going to be a g7
apparently there will be a refresh to
the LG v 30 being announced that will be
more powerful if LG would come up with
the same phone and the snapdragon 845 I
would be happy I want to see if that
happens now let's talk about iPhone 10
believe it or not even though the phone
sold really well during the holiday
season it didn't really sell as much as
Alice were predicting they were claiming
between twenty to thirty thousand phones
and the number is more like eighteen
thousand even though Apple hasn't really
provided figures just yet and even if it
does it won't provide specifically for
the iPhone 10 most important according
to analysts they're not expecting this
to improve because mainly in major
countries like China this phone is just
too expensive so the rumors are that for
the 2018 iPhone 10 over ever that number
will be apparently this phone will sell
like hotcakes mainly because Apple is
apparently planning to drop the price it
has to drop the price let's see if it
does happen though and probably one of
my favorite products from CES 2018 was
project Linda the biggest problem is
razors track record every single project
the company has shown of and passed CES
has ended up becoming the vaporware just
a concept that never gets launched we've
got some trusted sources claiming that
we will be getting a project Linda
it just won't happen now Natalie we
should expect the Refresh to the razor
phone by later this year and in that
later this year I'm talking around
September October probably and it seems
that this phone will have project Linda
you know I hope they keep the design I
hope that keep the speakers and they
bring us the Linda that we saw butter
screen probably razor a better camera
let's see
in the end what happens and finally in
today's most interesting news let's
discuss the s9s 9 plus we've got more
trusted sources pretty much double
confirming what we had heard before on
specification so no changes when it
comes to processor Ram cameras variable
apertures apparently that's a given and
we're three weeks away from MW sees what
makes sense most interesting are the
changes that users won't really be able
to see like for example new OLED
technology that will make the screen
slimmer to a certain degree and other
more interesting changes come in the
substrate like PCB that will be used
apparently it'll take less of a
footprint within the chassis which could
enable a larger battery but the rumors
are the battery is not changing so okay
in today's comments let us know what
would get you most excited about the
galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus in my case I
hope they come up with some new camera
improvements I mean I have a hard time
not using the pixel to excel just
because of how great that camera is it
