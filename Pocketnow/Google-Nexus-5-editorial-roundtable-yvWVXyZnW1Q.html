case we are good afternoon to everybody
a good morning to some people somewhere
in the planet and get something to
everybody else it is 234 p.m. in my
timezone 434 um in eastern time and we
just got a nexus 5 just out of the blue
just like that we've been waiting for
this phone for the longest time and yeah
google just decided to make the phone
public today uh without letting anybody
you know no events nothing official we
were kind of expecting this for tomorrow
so everything that's happening now we
kind of had planned for tomorrow but
anyways we will just decided to spoil my
lunch so in order of appearance we have
a great team here to talk about our
thoughts of what just went on we're
gonna cover the news and now we're gonna
go through what we think of everything
so in order mr. Taylor Martin hello to
you sir how are you hello I'm great and
I've got a pumpkin here just for the
Halloween festivities pumpkin kinda
reminds kind of reminds me of somebody
but I can't say until like about a month
from now probably Michael understands
I'm talking about because I had
certainly don't I'm contending mr. Joe
Levi who does not have a pumpkin and I'm
trying to figure out where you are Joe I
am on location in the parking lot at my
day job but you know i love pocket now
and i love my Nexus so I'm ear you're a
trooper Joe thank you very much sure you
got a good hairstyle going on today I'm
really like what's going on there you
got like smell cubit that cuckoo clock
yeah this is my 7 8am podcast hair I
think that's his Michael Fisher look
what's kind of familiar I don't know
careful its trademark mighty of George
Michael huh Oh mr. Michael Fisher how
are you hi i am well I feel like we I
was just broadcasting from this very
booth the second ago we're at the park
and I weak-kneed this morning Joel evite
and Kayla Martin and Anton Dino and I
talking about the nexus 5 Sheila's
Taylor Wharton here Atlas Taylor Martin
we were why
whoa man let's better beat and I was
like there's no way there's no we're
just going to have another day where
it's not happening and then it happened
I feel constrained to point out before
we move on to the last person to
introduce I mention that we google gave
us a nexus 5 was I think the phrasing
that is not great we do not have a nexus
5 yeah yeah google gave the world an
exercise if you're expecting to see one
on the show you should not be expecting
to see one on the show yep except for
wait I don't know just low class I knew
that I can you did miss my shadow for
you hi say I was half expecting Keller
to pull out like a piece of cardstock
yeah just printed the official press
render on for like glued on to I don't
know an iphone 3gs or something that i
am well well is that funny how like just
get literally like two hours ago if one
of us even had one of the in store dummy
like units like that would have been
huge news Agron we would have done crew
he over the past knows somebody's
unpublished somebody published the video
over lunch of the phone and they were
just playing around with the phone and I
was I was trying to understand why the
video got so many dislikes and as it
turns out I start reading the comments
and everybody's like the phones already
live funny they already announced what
are you trying to maintain youtube
upload times yeah ok so to disclaimers
number one google has just totally
destroyed us with this new hangout
interface um everything looks weird oh
and if we look weird or if we haven't
figured something out or you know sorry
about this guy's we're trying to figure
this out just as much as I'm sure a lot
of people at Google are and number two
my connection is terrible this is the
third time we've tried this so in case i
drop off for any reason the rest of the
team will continue covering and i will
try to hop on like i always do so
anyways without further ado and i know
certain people hate that phrase let's
start talking about this we have a
little bit of a schedule amount of
things that we want to discuss so we'd
like to start with Stephen we'd like to
discuss the Nexus 5 what have you
learned about this phone what what can
we well what can we expect no because a
lot of the day the 16 gig model
already sold out so tell us about it
yeah luckily we heard a lot about this
phone you know coming up to the actual
launch so we knew pretty much what to
expect and I don't think there have been
any big surprises the specs have largely
been exactly what we were looking at you
know the Snapdragon 800 the 1080p nearly
5 inch display and like I said the 16
and there's also a 32 gigabyte model now
it does look like the availabilities a
little better than it was with the nexus
4 and while there have been we saw the
neck the 16gb model drop out google is
showing its not available anymore it did
come back and i think now it's gone
again is this for just the US um but it
seems to be holding out better than the
other Nexus 4 it didn't disappear
instantly and last I checked the 32
gigabyte model is still available and
shipping november eight so if you want
to order one still you can have it
within just a little over a week i think
they're completely sold out now by now
okay probably half thousand likes to ask
check yeah it does keep coming once
they're out they have been coming back
so keep checking if you really really
want one also like we saw last year
remember with Nexus 4 when it was sold
out if you kept hammering away on it
sooner or later sometimes you got the
opportunity to buy one so do keep trying
if you won't look black and white are
still available by a november eighth and
32 gig white 16 is done yeah so just
comes there just a little note there
when i got mine in i was told that it
would ship by November fifth so this is
the second batch theoretically that's
going out on 8 and I presume we'll see
those batches continue to go forward so
keep an eye on the dates the the ship by
dates now we'll be doing an update on
the actual specs we're into a rundown
later on today showing you the phone
versus all the other flagships I just
want to quickly mention about the g2
since that's what the Nexus 5 is based
on it's very similar to the chi 2 but
there's a few little differences Nexus 5
has a smaller battery only 2300 milliamp
hours google says you can get I think
eight hours of web browsing on it or 17
hours of talk time I believe was the
figure so L something like 60 hours of
straight video music playback it's
something crazy like three
hundred hours standby so maybe they'll
be able to pull it off even with a
smaller battery that does let the phone
slim down a little it's about half a
millimeter thinner than the g2 and it's
also a little bit lighter I think 13
grams lighter but while also the
front-facing camera a little bit of a
downgrade it's bigger than this you're
kidding that's what they say but you
won't be able to notice it it's so tiny
and it's 130 grams which is exactly as
massive as the galaxy s4 was right but
then there's that the difference
material run back which is interesting
where it's where it's like oh this is as
light as the s4 but it's probably going
to feel a little bit better in the hand
thanks to the soft touch versus the
glossy stuff if you're looking Nexus 7
and you think that soft touch is gonna
be you know for those of you that
ordered the black model Michael do you
think that's gonna be a fingerprint
magnet you know this a smudge magnet
would you recommend the white model
better well I'll tell you what I've got
a white one coming too and I know we're
gonna see a black ones like I think
we're gonna have to see I'm more
interested in knowing whether the
material changes in the tactile you know
a responsiveness not that's not what I
mean I want to see if the material feels
different between the black one of the
white one because like this you from a
note 3 exactly Taylor yeah I reviewed
the black note 3 it felt great this one
feels man yeah yeah yeah yeah I like the
black one a lot better trust me yeah the
same thing with this and look for don't
wear those colors there's a number of
different case options there's a red and
a yellow official bumper there's also a
black and grey bumper and white and
black cases with a little folder to
cover the front as well Stephen don't
know cause I was gonna ask us that
folder of mek mek has does it have a
magnetic latch to turn the display on
and off or is it a difficult I was
wondering about that I haven't seen
anything mentioned about that and I
couldn't tell just by looking but it
seems like the sort of picture we would
expect so I don't know just yet usually
the mechanics of it I don't know but it
is an active color cover so when you
open it it will skip the swipe to unlock
it'll automatically turn on and off
whether that's by proximity or by a
magnetic clasp they didn't say and it's
no window this time like we see on the
you know the note
with the g2 it's just a little cut out
for the speaker does he do anything to
affect the Qi wireless charging ability
of the Nexus 5 do we know that it says
that it's officially compatible with the
the Nexus wireless charger they're just
calling me in the Nexus wireless charger
at this point no than you and the device
itself is I just wonder if the case is
effect Adam yes the case one of the line
items they said on both the bumpers and
the flip cases is that they are still
compatible with kee kee very good eeek
wireless charging cool good now for
those interested in buying Stephen we
remain in the same policy right it's
only available in the Google Play Store
uh no carriers have picked it up just
yet and you can just get it for the same
350 or 400 right I know t-mobile mention
they're definitely going to have it in
stores I don't think they get a date hey
there's a lot better band support this
time around and we saw cdma support not
wcdma for 3g but cdma like Verizon and
Sprint which is weird because we're not
used to seeing those sort of phones sold
separately from the carrier so I'm still
waiting to find out exactly how sales of
those are going to work but this looks
like we're gonna have a universal while
it's going to work women in the US with
the exception of verizon it is not it is
not prefer oh yeah yeah yeah okay so
more information sake I've hands for
sprint and I think nine LTE bands total
yeah yo you wanted systems yet so
looking at the release notes we're going
to have the stock version just like we
have the nexus 4 available through the
Play Store they went on to specifically
say that the they're going to be
additional places for resale coming this
holiday season or before the holidays I
think is the wording that they used and
they listed places like Best Buy and
sprint as a separate item so I assume
that we're going to be getting a
separate Nexus 5 that has the separate
separate version of the Snapdragon 800
chip like we talked about in the weekly
this morning that carries the cdma stuff
that you will get in the sprint stores
so it's not 100-percent confirmed but
that's how I'd assume based on the way
it was
unfortunately it's not going to be like
one universal device the missing Mike
the listing in the Play Store now does
say it has that cdma band on it that was
that's weird i don't know i could be
wrong and you know it wouldn't be like
the first time that it's done obviously
the iphone 4s wasn't an LTE capable
phone but it did it was one universal
unit for cdma and HSPA+ it was one thing
um where a change in the iphone 5
obviously because of how complicated LTE
is so yeah we most probably will be
getting a separate unit which I hope not
I hope that it's one universal phone and
that people will be able to swap around
their networks as much as they can
because just think about it I mean you
right now have to pay three hundred
dollars on contract to get a node 3 with
the snapdragon 800 processor and most of
the specifications that you get ondas
Nexus 5 and for fifty dollars more or a
hundred dollars more you can get a nexus
5 off contract this is crazy this is
just crazy I mean it's beautiful it's
it's a no-brainer that mean these people
Google is really like they tried to
disrupt the market for so long but this
is like the best way you can't disrupt
the market with a with a low end or mid
to your phone you can do it even if it's
priced right you can do it with a
top-of-the-line high-end phone so much
so that the phone has already sold out
well the Nexus horse hold up just just
as quickly if that faster but I mean
answer but it's a different beast
because last year Google wasn't trying
to create the most impressive and highly
SPECT phone it was trying to prove that
you don't need great specifications to
have a great fall sure and I think they
got the message across very well and so
has motorola a lot of others but that
doesn't mean that you don't need or
maybe want high-end specifications in
now google catering to that as well so
until you took the first photograph yeah
shut up yeah yeah the nexus for the Moto
X are two examples of terrible cameras
and well the Nexus 5 is supposed to have
a better camera but uh yeah reports is
someone we shouldn't gloss over that
because this this camera does take a
step down a resolution but as I
mentioned just published of our
go as optimal not to ask you Michael
yeah go ahead yeah I mean the fact that
it has 0 is is great because OAS is kind
of the new buzzword of the new year and
or the year that's about to close out
and it's in contrast to the resolution
war it deserves to be there like oh is
brings real advantages and it can as
we've seen with HTC One it can even take
a really low end a low resolution camera
and make it do allow it to do wonderful
things so I think just note well being
Brennan right I think this may well be
the first Nexus we see that delivers a
pretty good camera experience we'll have
to see you know in concert with the hdr+
stuff and all the stuff that the
software stuff that Google is packaged
in there now and I think like for
example both uh Taylor you Michael and
myself we all three of us had a jeep at
g2 yeah and we universally agreed that
that was the Android camera to beat it
was will really have much experience
with it no yeah cuz Taylor's was busted
yes no that's a good point I man that's
that's actually really directly related
to what we're talking about here because
the Nexus 5 you know as we've said is
kind of the g2 in excess ified and like
besides the resolution duck there I
think we're going to see some pretty
impressive stuff from from this sensor
there was some speculation i think brian
klug at an antec was speculating that it
might be a sony sensor based on the
specifications that have been published
and if so it would be very interesting
to see as that Sony sensor made it to 0
is so yeah we heard that earlier we're
talking about that confusion over a mems
component but the one point that stuck
was so nice answer right well that the
iphone 5s has a sony sensor and so far
it doesn't have 0 is and it pulls some
very amazing low-light photos so i think
we should expect something good i mean
if we get the same or probably same of
sensor matched with OS this should be
like probably the camera to be as well
we will say I I think at this point it
would just be it would just be who've
Google to shoot par you know it's like
as if they can deliver a good shooting
experience on a nexus that's that's fine
for this year that's all they need to do
decent passable um yeah I've seen some
sample photos from people at Google
and some of them are so great so I'm not
I'm not gonna throw on one throw all
those eggs in that one basket I'm
probably going to buy a nexus 5 but uh I
think the phone for me is as much as I
love stock I think that's the phone for
me yeah so now well anyways any anymore
any other points to discuss about the
nexus 5 steven anything else that we've
forgotten to cover um no I think we've
seen where we've covered a little
everything that we wanted to so far the
only question I've still had in my mind
is what this new wireless charger is
going to sell for other than that the
stuff is out there the hardware is going
to be arriving in just a week or so
we're going to finally get there a lot
of hands on reports from users letting
us know what they think about the photo
they think of a battery life and finally
be able to get a full assessment of what
the Nexus 5 is going to mean don't
expect a cheap price of those
accessories though because Google always
jacks up their prices on accessories
because the hardware sold so cheap like
like the case for the nexus is 140 bucks
yeah all seven days and the flip cover
is 60 I believe well the nexus 7 k's i
mean it's no she i've taught in the
nexus 5 stuff they're coming soon but
they're spendy and the the wireless
charger for the nexus 4 was 60 or 70
bucks stops not gonna be cheap but you
know more than makes up for having a
phone that this cosmic fraction of the
cost of another phone at least with the
compatibility you can always pick up a
cheap you know nokia charger or like
close by buck no no no no don't do that
don't do that don't do that if anybody
wants my nokia charger i would gladly
sell it to them so there's a reason
they're so cheap well there's a don't
tilt also has that wonderful line of
view chargers there's a lot of cheek
compliance stuff out there that's
actually really good so what killed yes
everything else that I've used that
streak of light is great just the Nokia
one now sorry I decision Michael just a
fault just to follow up Tom with a
schedule that we have here um how about
if we run things down comparing the
Nexus 5 against the neck
for Taylor I mean you had the nexus 4 it
was probably your favorite phone Joe had
the nexus for steven has a nexus 4 yeah
joe killed me with that back thank you
very much I really agree morganii for
this for those of you that have a nexus
4 right now is it worth the upgrade
Taylor oh yeah that that's a pretty much
is pretty much a no-brainer I mean if
you're happy with your nexus 4 then fine
don't buy it no but if if you're not and
you're thinking it's feeling a little
dated because a lot of people felt the
nexus 4 was a little underpowered when
it came out at least in comparison to
other high-end phones and you know this
this is a major upgrade this isn't like
iphone 5 to iphone 5s or galaxy s3 to
galaxy s4 this is this is big you know
it's it's a leap because google went
from kind of i'm getting a call on my
computer but i can't answer that anyway
but um we're going from something that's
kind of you know a moderate spect phone
to something that is in line with all of
the highest in specs that you can get on
anything so yeah it's definitely a big
upgrade in and it's definitely worth the
price because you could probably offload
your your nexus 4 for maybe half the
price of a nexus 5 yeah i was on
craigslist ithaca what I could get for a
mind if I cuenta de said I sold mine a
few weeks ago and I'm sure that it makes
Brandon it probably didn't make Brandon
too happy because he's like hey you're
gonna get you to compare the nexus 4
Nexus 5 and I'm like all right you know
I think this for me particularly this
brings us back to the time of the nexus
one when the nexus one was announced it
was the first one gigahertz processor it
was I'm trying to remember what how many
firsts this phone it was the first
Snapdragon it was the first step dragon
processor in the market um I remember
this phone being so it was the thinnest
android smartphone of the day that light
of trackball you i love that day yes
bring it
oh yeah and you know this is this is
we're finally back to that the nexus s
was not a big leap compared to the
phones that were out there the the
Galaxy Nexus wasn't a big leap in
innovate there were already 720p
displays in the market the nexus 4 was
we could say a little bit of a step back
to what was already in the market by the
fall of last year and now when we see
the Nexus 5 this is just a no-brainer
this is really a no-brainer I you know
unless you want to shell out more money
for a non-contract you know deal or
something there's really no reason to
not buy this phone meaning it's probably
one of the most attractive devices in
the market and yeah I wasn't listen I'm
I've been sitting quietly listening it
listen I'm not saying it's an ugly
device okay we talked a little about
this in the pockets this morning it's
not an ugly device but it's also does
nothing to stand out and the argument in
favor of that is well let it get out of
the way of the software the stories
about the software it's a Nexus device I
hate that sounds like what I said yeah
well no no no III don't i don't like
that story i mean it should be a unified
experience and the hardware should lend
something to that of course you get that
in terms of the internals you get the
Snapdragon 800 you do is in the camera
that i like but if you look at the
casing and we know we'll get one in the
office and we'll either confirm this or
I'll be like I was wrong it almost looks
like reference hardware there's nothing
really special about it you know it kind
of reminds me of the z10 a little bit
where it's like oh I mean yeah this is
fine i guess you know the nice for was
super fragile you had to have hit gloves
on the whole time but it was pretty yeah
right exactly at least the next four
said something and I as I said in the
podcast this morning the nexus s even
till like reviled and access that nobody
wants to remember is like at least that
was doing something cool with a curved
glass over the screen with a little bulb
on the bottom like at least was
different this nexus 5 the next vibe is
just kind of like it look I'm here and
yeah I'm hardware it's okay look at the
software like that's what it's doing
adds up now tell me something Michael
tell me something so if you if you had
the choice and I mean I mean let's
disconnect ourselves from our pocket
rolls yeah let's see ourselves as the
average person out there if they gave
you the option to buy okay how many
phones do we have right now there are
snapdragon 800 powered and that have
most of the specifications that the
nexus 5 has all we have are the galaxy
note 3 the LG g2 what else the s4 has a
variant with the 800 but you can't get
in the United States so let's talk to
United States right now all you have is
the g2 and the Galaxy Note 3 and now you
have the nexus 5 so if we were to
compare you know getting these two
phones on contract two hundred dollars
for one three hundred dollars for the
other or pay an extra fifty dollars to
get this whole package off contract do
you think that that won't make you
consider it you know you think that if I
big enough if we're confining ourselves
to this world in which the Snapdragon
800 is some kind of like boundary that
we give a crap about you know what
I mean it's like because I don't
necessarily like we remember Jaime I
carry the Moto X more often than I carry
any other smartphone and this has been
like you know in the spec sheet people
are like whatever I don't know how to
make of this because they made something
custom and it's like oh it's not high
spec now f off like I don't care about
that you know I can't be the only one
that likes this hardware though I can't
be the only one that likes the Nexus 7 I
like the Nexus 7 I love it I love the
heart until seven like Michael doesn't
like the design of the nexus 5 but i
actually do i find it simplistic my meal
I find it kind of says turn out well i'm
not i would never argue they're gonna
find it today get around this way with
everything oh you don't like the day on
that I don't and I don't know about the
case they kept the cutout just as big
why not just shrink it down to the size
of the length because because the lens
the lens is conveying a message at
saying 20 is saying it's saying look
this camera isn't I'm ugly maybe
sangamon depends depends on your hearing
I suppose listen I think that that bulge
was is there simply because fitting the
OIS and that casing was too difficult
Apple did it with the ipod touch that
they made it so thin that they couldn't
fit the lens in there and so it has this
comp on top of it
lens and I feel that that's the reason
why they did it with the Nexus 5 that
could well be yeah and especially the
Nexus 5 is thinner than the g two
because the g2 they manage to fit OAS in
there in quezon lines but if it's better
than you that makes it it's mainly
because of the curve in the it's mainly
because of the curve in the chassis
because of that bump that's what allows
for Roy at 40 I has to fit there but
overall you know I guess we have mixed
feelings some of us like the phone some
of us don't like the phone I personally
you know this is like I do i do like the
phone for me it's like why not at that
price why not ya see I'm I'm probably
gonna buy one either way probably
because all I'm on the fence too yeah
I'm gonna buy one but it's probably
gonna sit more than anything I mean
that's kind of how my nexus 4 was I
bought it because it was so cheap and
then I would pop my sim card in it when
I got tired of jenna is there something
else it expensive watch it's just a
cheap so that's bad ya know in your Chi
ok we all value low-cost foam and we all
talk about ourselves and we were using
many devices we're a very different
different set but like time I get your
point inexpensive is a powerful
motivator particularly we talk about
specs like this the Nexus 5 is not a bad
device and I don't dislike it I don't
want to convey that impression but I
it's just interesting because the next
this is we're no longer in the same
world as we were where you can you can
now get the stock google experience on a
moto x on a play edition s4 on an HTC
one you know it's more expensive yes but
you can do it the Nexus Nexus device is
not your only route to just talk android
so I think that's interesting you know
and we're going to discuss the
competition a little but go ahead Joe go
ahead yeah so let me jump in and answer
the question that you asked long ago
there if I not a robot I went from a
Galaxy Nexus which I thought was a
really really good device and i bought
the nexus 4 and honestly I could have
done without that upgrade because
there's not a lot of difference between
the two they're both solid devices now
going from that again from the Nexus
we're up to the next one the Nexus 5 and
having that held in hand but just
looking at the raw specs that's a huge
jump we're talking about what would have
been a two-year jump before in in this
one year jump from the full or to the
five part of that is because the four I
feel was under SPECT it was lower than
what it could have been and lower than
what it should have been but it is what
it is the five the five is the latest
and greatest hardware it's the best that
you can get so if you're if you've got a
four a five is definitely going to be
worth it for you it's worth it for me I
I went out spent the money and
ironically i'm getting the white one to
michael so it's on its way the first
batch so and i was i was actually gonna
segue towards you Joe in our topic list
mainly because of two things number one
you know and I'm just gonna set it out
there I even tweeted this like about a
week ago where you know the Snapdragon
800 has been so big for me it's like the
Haswell processor on laptops it is just
so powerful and just so powerful on its
own that it it dares me to actually
recommend the phone that is rocking it
even if I haven't tested it just because
of how reliable it's been for me on the
g2 and on the note 3 that's my thought I
mean just because it has that processor
I'm like okay just because of that i buy
the phone but you know you know aside
from processing power we also have to
talk about android 4.4 so how do you
feel about these two things Joe you know
obviously the spec bump plus what can we
learn from 4.4 what do you tell us ok so
the spec bump is important but not as
important as it may be it's important
for the nexus 5 but not as important for
android 4.4 kitkat so first of all we've
talked about the Moto X a little bit so
let's segue right into that a lot of
people have been wondering are we going
to get the same kind of ambient
listening stuff that we have with the
Moto X in the Nexus 5 and with Android
4.4 and the answer is sort of if you are
on your home screen you can now say ok
Google and tell it to do something play
music navigate to somewhere do a search
whatever you
do that now from the launcher itself you
don't have to launch Google now and then
go into that it doesn't sound like it's
going to be ambient as it is with the
Moto X so we're not going to quite get
that and that makes sense because we
don't have the dedicated processor like
we do in the Moto X with the the nexus 4
but it opens the question might we have
that with other devices down the road
look with qik app and that question is
is unknown going back to where we were
it's going to be faster not just because
of the hardware make it fun of Steve in
there but because it they've gone
through Google's gone through and made a
lot of optimizations to memory usage not
just in the operating system but in the
core apps so everything is going to be
quite a bit faster multitasking is
faster it's got a lighter footprint so
what that means is you're not going to
need the latest and greatest hardware to
be able to run this OS it should run on
older hardware every bit as good as the
current versions of Android do on those
hardware and even better on up level
versions like what we have supporting
the 800 processor whatnot in there and
other high-end processors and other
devices when we eventually see those
running running KitKat someone is saying
you can say ok Google when the screen is
off I don't think that's true now I know
the Snapdragon 800 does support the
ambient processing sort of capabilities
where you can do that kind of stuff but
uh and as I say that Joe drops off sorry
next time Joe the next time joe says
that t-mobile 3g doesn't just find he
doesn't need l to eat let's all remind
him of this moment shall we I don't know
I I think that well 44.4 is just a minor
a minor point upgrade Joe just joined us
again Joe we made fun of you at your PT
minus PA plus buddy people hspa+ man
what are you talking about I'm Wi-Fi to
the building a street so snap oh alright
it's either that or LG G our exes for
right so yeah all right so tell me the
last I heard
was somebody saying that you can say ok
Google when the screen is off I haven't
heard that either everything that I've
seen has just been on the home screen on
one of your home screens you can say
that that's what I think i read on
google's description of it yeah little
blog post here is what I got from them
quote you don't need to touch the screen
to get things done when your home screen
or when you're on your home screen or in
Google now just say okay google launched
voice search send a text get directions
or even play a song there's an Astra
stored over that which says currently
only available on the Nexus 5 so that
doesn't sound cool but we'll see how
they how they do to integrate that any
more questions there or do you want to
go on to other gusta what else do we get
from kid can what other enhancements
okay so core apps they've done a lot in
the core apps one of the main things
they've done is making the whole
communication sweet a lot more
integrated better more intelligent so in
your let's start out with a really cool
thing you now have integrated color ID
with your dialer so if you get a call
from somebody that's not in your address
book it's going to try and figure out
who is calling you so it can show you
that caller ID most of that seems like
it's just business stuff rather than
personal but it'll be interesting to see
how they do that not only you can you
can enter the contacts app and if you
don't have a number entered you it'll
like you can do reverse lookup as well
right and you can do you just start like
type in pizza into your contacts app and
it will find a local bit like that's
awesome oh yeah that's that is that's
the other side of that so the outgoing
stuff when you're making a call I it's
going to automatically prioritize your
contacts based on the people that are
most important to you but it's also
going to search for nearby businesses
and even people in your Google Apps
domain so if your company your school
whoever it is like pocket now we use a
Google Apps domain it will search for
people in that now as well so it's it's
do a lot to make that contacting people
a lot nicer and smoother next we've got
the big hangouts google voice
integration that we thought was coming a
long time ago is a google voice
integration I thought it was just as a
stock SMS I didn't see anything about
google voice because if it's google
voice that means I'm incredibly excited
I'm worried if it's always its moist I
thought it was hey nah it's just stuck
at SMS unfortunately it's dark as me is
it yeah it doesn't know how man now that
that paired with and I read that one
they worded that trickily but you can
even sync your google voice to your
messages app so can you still do that
with the hangouts update you should be
able to I would believe and I'm going to
have to double check my other source
because the one that I'm reading right
now confirms what you're saying but the
one that I was reading before implied
that this is the same type of update
like we saw on iOS so I've got to go
back and confirm that i will have an
article up on this later today hopefully
within the next hour or so so we'll have
all of the information there if any of
this is incorrect but you now even can
send animated gifts they include that as
a feature so that feature the immunology
don't forget the emoji no I'm not going
to do that and the last but certainly
not the least power feature if you will
is being able to print whenever you want
wherever you want this is a feature that
employees google cloud print which is
something we've been able to do through
an app in the Play Store but now it's
built into the core OS so all kinds of
neat the main thing the main babies
raise your hand if you have a printer
everybody know you know where i go for
new parents of my videos are we like are
we yeah he now like what's going on how
do we carry but print on a dick but
that's that's just it Taylor if this
will let you print to wherever you need
to so if you need to print that hotel
reservation or need to print that ticket
or need to print a map for somebody and
you're at Kinkos or you're at someplace
else that has a google cloud connected
printer like those places will you can
send that information directly over
there and get an old-fashioned cut down
the trees version of that information no
cable is
it was likely not the little cloud
connected either it's all know it's
totally worthwhile like everything Joe
is saying is absolutely useful I just
can't stop laughing whenever somebody
talks about printing as a feature like
it's just it's hilarious it's like
putting a diesel engine on a horse-drawn
carriage way no Troy why not just did
you widen it right Ron deadly wrong
decade voice calls a big feature mm
there you go so ultimately the big take
home behind behind kitkat behind the 4.4
version of this is the new launcher it's
the the new streamlined apps and making
them all very very lightweight so that
it's going to be able to run on a lot of
the not only current hardware Nexus 5
notwithstanding but the stuff that you
have in your pocket today but also the
older stuff and the the kind of lower
end stuff I think they're doing this
kind of to combat the whole Android is
laggy thing that before complaining
about with the the lower end devices and
I think it's probably a really good way
to do it yeah but I think it's very
optimistic of Google putting this 512
megabyte support in now I think the mind
if I release a lot of phones with them
which ram have moved on and aren't
issuing updates anymore yeah guys that's
probably so yes but this is a question
that I have Joe I mean we have a report
from from the verge that says that
Google is not going to be upgrading the
Galaxy Nexus to android 4.4 why less or
all of that by the way I don't
understand why that would be I mean it
clearly if they're making an OS that can
run on lower spec hardware nexus one can
run this yeah so basically and I'm glad
you brought this up because the irony is
thick google has a habit of upgrading
the one down version of of their devices
so the nexus 4 they've already committed
to we're going to see Andrew 4.4 on the
Nexus 4 quote in the coming weeks so
whether that's two weeks four weeks a
month and a half I don't know but we'll
see it the next version down we won't
not officially and that's the same thing
they did last time but the point you're
making is they are making this version
of Android specifically capable of
running on very very relatively low end
hardware so you think they would break
that rule and go ahead and publish it
and I like what Jaime always say it go
down and do it on the nexus s just to
show that it can be done for all 12
people who still have a nexus s show
them you can do it and it runs great
wait bottle 12 people who have a nexus s
whose devices weren't braked by a google
update in which if they weren't half of
them were probably would be right with
this one but sweet done this is just an
irony I mean even the the nexus one that
was left behind with Gingerbread even
that phone can Marcus yeah according to
what they say it should be able to and
it was designed specifically to be able
to do that now to us or not as a as my
favorite driver in Grand Theft Auto 5
says this don't make no effing sense
yeah and Joe to finish up with android
4.4 probably the biggest rumor I guess
didn't happen that so you can't that
Android launcher is not made available
for everyone yes not yet at least they
said it's not going to happen yeah they
specifically mentioned that well they
specifically mentioned the launcher by
name they're calling it what the Nexus
launcher I forget what it is but I can
know that that's the first time I think
I've ever seen them a note the name of
the launcher it's always just been part
of Android so I think they're setting
themselves up to be able to do that but
as of right now no it's not and I
wouldn't do it if I were them because
I'd want people to go out and buy my
latest hardware before I release stuff
that makes old hardware look like my new
hardware they're sold out so they can do
it now all right what okay go out thank
God that's in the fly story okay so that
would be Android 4.4 I guess but the
takeaway that we've got left here is
compared to so we have our resident
number one reviewer who's pretty much
reviewed absolutely everything that's
gone through our pocket now laughs mr.
Michael Fisher everything ever every no
I ok so you've pretty much reviewed
everything out there Michael how do you
see this phone stacked up we go back to
the conversation of your thoughts on the
design and how does it stack up to
everything else out there if there's one
thing I've learned it's that not a lot
of the people in the populace and the
general populace outside of gig circles
care all that much about hardware
aesthetics which is why we have this
landscape of very very similar-looking
hardware so the Nexus 5 is not going to
have any trouble because of that I mean
it's it's not and Google is never really
positioned the Nexus line as this is
this flagship class that needs to sell
millions and millions of units to be
considered a success even though we'll
sell quite a bit and I think it'll
probably sell more than any other units
but I mean there's a lot of competition
out there and not least of which is from
Android and I'd you know it's I don't
know I because you don't need to sell so
many Nexus devices what needs to be you
know why do why does it need to compete
effectively you know I mean you have all
these phones out there that are selling
for less on contract not off contract
certainly but nobody in the u.s. buys
phones off contract so I don't know I
don't know about that anymore the titles
on a big big big rise yeah rise yes they
don't do contra now this is like the big
break for t-mobile I mean if t-mobile
would set it upon themselves to buy all
the Nexus 5's for themselves and having
tonight they're actually you can't
happen so you know like I have a I have
a pretty good pulse on the your finger
on the pulse of what normal people are
talking about because I have a lot of
friends who are Luddites and who are not
in our business and they often ask me
things but they're not really your
friends Michael about cellular telephony
and you know what you know what they ask
me how about a lot of stuff you know
what not a single one of them has ever
asked me about ever what's t-mobile
doing these days they be
none of the people in the Northeast in
my experience know that tmobile exists
so I don't know I baby may not ask you
for gigabit t-mobile what's a tree yeah
they know you hate it and they know
you're not gonna say anything nice and
you can't say anything nice don't say
anything at all you know no i like i
like i like what they're doing but so i
don't know you know the the t-mobile
destiny is not tied to the nexus 5
destiny i mean this thing is gonna is
going to do some interesting stuff I
don't know there's so much out there is
joel eva is fond of saying there's so
much out there on the market it's such a
great time to be alive because there is
so much out there um the nexus 5 will
stand out thanks to its google backing
but i don't necessarily see it lighting
the world on fire outside of the circles
of people who really appreciate it oh
it's not supposed to it's absolutely not
supposed to whole thing the kick whole
thing off so i was trying to say before
is that i don't know if i can answer you
because i don't understand the purpose
of the question because when you have a
product that doesn't need to succeed
what the hell is it the point is the
success is measured by showcasing the
latest version of Android and doing so
at a price for the in this case the
top-of-the-line hardware that is almost
half the price of what everybody else is
selling their top-of-the-line hardware
for they're showing that it can be done
and they're showing that you it
eventually you're going and I have to
keep your prices low to be able to do
this and if you look at the strategy
it's working google is taking over the
world who else can do this who else can
like google with the samsung good it has
its own content what I wouldn't want to
know yet Microsoft Google can lose money
on this and Microsoft yet has shown that
for three years they've been burning
money on windows phone because they can
but like how long how long are you going
to do this and what does it ultimately
matter y su showcasing Android yes
you're you're driving prices down in
your own ecosystem but I don't know if
that's gonna if that is going to create
a competitive impulse and everyone else
to be like oh god we'd samsung we got to
lower our price in the galaxy s4 from 7
49 50
five it doesn't make any sense I'll give
you a couple of examples do we all
remember when you all remember when the
first iphone was launched Michael you
actually made the line to buy the phone
now the 3g i bought yeah you made the
line for the 3g okay so when the first
iphone was launched obviously it was
five hundred dollars on contract but
back then you had you had four if you
wanted to get a blackberry pearl or a
razor I think those phones were between
300 and 350 dollars on contract there
were some crazy pricings back in two
thousand seven for you to get phones on
contract and then the following year
after all the success of the first
iPhone Apple comes out of the blue and
says this is the new iphone 3g and now
it's going to be two hundred dollars on
contract and that ever since that launch
of the iphone 3g the the market price
for high-end smartphones has been two
hundred dollars two hundred dollars on
contract twenty dollars on contract and
it's remained that way um so we could
say that that was an example of a
disruptive you know a great phone that
was so disruptive that it made everybody
drop their price the same thing happened
with the first Nexus 7 you know we had a
market of five hundred dollar tablets
and when when they least expected you
know amazon tried to do it with the
kindle but it wasn't strong enough so
comes out pool with their nexus 7
everybody's like okay $200 is the price
for the small tablets let's do that and
everybody's doing that I think you're
downplaying the Kindles effect on that I
think Amazon really had a big impact
when the kindle fire came out I mean
that was it was a big deal he was a very
good rough but it was it was a big deal
I don't think tala tablets are analogous
to smartphones in this sense i mean your
iphone example the very good one the
difference is the iphone was a
groundbreaking shift in how smartphones
operated the Nexus 5 is not that good
one hood of improvement good point good
point now now that that being said I
feel that sure I mean it's not it it's
not disruptive enough when it comes to
technology I just feel that the phone is
so future proof that you know the only
problem that I see right now and this is
probably my perspective is the
distribution of this phone if this phone
were available on every
barrier today and if this phone were
available on best buy target and just
about every store today and Google
really focused on distributing this
phone hard kind of how they did with the
nexus 7 at least on certain retailers
then I would feel that this phone would
be disruptive enough to drop the price
of the market I feel that the problem is
the distribution um Nick Nexus 5 headed
to sprint t-mobile amazon best buy and
radioshack in the coming days that's
todd haselton of TechnoBuffalo bitch a
second realities and to somepony okay so
sorry i just saw that it i want to take
michael in the Wayback Machine just for
a minute yeah I love that machine
Michael D do you remember way back when
there were rumors about Google coming
out with a google phone or dunkin 3g one
yeah and google denied it we are not
making a google phone there's not going
to be a google phone blah blah blah way
before and then people started thinking
wait a minute google does everything for
free everything they offer is free so if
google comes out with a phone it's going
to be for free action people were
thinking free cell phone free service
free hardware free everything which we
all know wasn't true right but everybody
was kind of getting stoked about what if
it's free what if it's free passwords
today we have something where you said
they're losing money we're still paying
for it not but not as much as we could
be or could otherwise event so are we
getting to the point now where we're
starting to realize the fact that Google
is making enough money off of us and
selling our information to other people
that they're really not losing the money
on the devices they're making a whole
boatload of money on that well we're the
product that's being sold not both yeah
so do you think that's where we are now
if we finally realize that free phone
mentality that we had originally yet we
would be if if the Nexus line was what
was driving Android sales but it's not
you know it's what's driving Android is
is skinned to tell Samsung devices that
do not resemble anything like the the
nexus 10 model
we go back to the distribution topic
Michael why is the galaxy s such a
popular phone in my country it is simply
because I've already seen four people on
the street with a galaxy note 3 I was I
pulled it out of the box i was like oh
my god i'm gonna be like the first guy
here with a note 3 this is gonna be
freaking awesome and i just go to the
mall to go look for a case a note 2 case
for this phone and i walk into the store
and they're like oh you got it do you
bite at the other store because we
already have it and then I see three
guys they're sitting down buying them
and they're like and we've already got
the cases we that's a Confed me and and
I've only seen one HTC one ever since
April in it launched so for me it's a
distribution issue the galaxy is popular
simply because it's the biggest
smartphone that's available everywhere
it's not a better ability i'm at large
market arcing work on our policy
marketing marketing and availability
fine let's let's join those two things
together sure move your 9010 yet yeah
let's try those fun things together but
you know don't go back to the topic I do
feel that if what joe just said sorry
Taylor just said we just lost Joe
goodbye Joe New Mexico any carriers no
more driving to do hang out okay you
know if this phone is going to be
available on these carriers and think
about it if sprint would do the bull
thing of offering this phone free on
contract I would be bold that would be
very deep pockets now that they're owned
by softbank's so I mean that's that
would be a really interesting move on
their part absolutely I mean think about
it this would be the first google phone
literally that would actually it has the
capability and the pricing from google
to be a free on contract phone yeah that
would be amazing i mean that sounds a
lot more like something t-mobile would
do but that would be cool if sprint took
the opportunity to usurp them to just be
it's not gonna help them though so great
people dozens have contracts I can't do
that yeah no temptation saying that this
would be big on sprint I'm saying that
if AT&amp;amp;T and and Verizon and the rest of
the carriers would pull this phone free
on contract now that would be disrupted
what I want to know is what t-mobile is
going to sell this thing for as you know
like in terms of installments because if
they're selling it at the Google price
so 350 or 400 dollars on your your
installments are gonna be like fifteen
dollars a month I really think that's
unlikely though I mean no I mean last
year with the nexus 4 they sold it for
what five hundred bucks yeah I mean
anything whatever 5f get up over the the
base price yeah but that was it that was
a different that was a different
t-mobile remember that well so I mean
that that's that's compelling if you can
get a phone and finance it for ten or
fifteen dollars a month no contract
unlimited LTE patient's a great camera
LTE I mean why not it's t-mobile and it
will sell in very respectable numbers it
will never sell it will never take over
the the driving force of Android unless
it's marketed as well as there are two
Joe's in the ribbon and unless its
record as well is ready I need to say
before I give up the floor I there are
three things that are happening one
we're all having great time talking to
we all need to be writing something and
three I was he so we could go soon yeah
this was supposed to this thing guys
sorry I guess the the conversation just
got so carried out regardless we've got
some opposing thoughts up some people
love this phone I do some people are not
really surprised by this phone like
Michael which is great for that that's
that's the way the market behaves I
guess the biggest takeaway is that if
Google would figure out a way to get the
carrier's involved with this phone and
sell it and give this phone free on
contract or for three hundred fifty
dollars off contract this could be again
you can buy an iphone 5s 16 gigs for 650
unlocked and then it's it's two hundred
dollars on contract so there is no
reason why a free on contract would not
work for this phone if carriers would
jump on prepaid or even a lot 49 or
prepaid get some big assumptions about
what Google would charge the carrier's
though and I don't think it's selling
the phone at a loss to begin with I just
think it's not making any profit if it's
going to sell to the carrier
involved I think it's going to want to
profit off this well $350 is already
rocketing but what we'll see we'll see i
guess i don't friends with some bracing
breaking news here i'm a hit dad
according to HTC USA's Twitter account
customers who love candy LOL kit kat is
coming to the HTC one in the u.s. in 90
days how big magazines I mean we need it
up guys having nestle your rather
thoroughly about the upgrade process
that manufacturers that the dance that
goes you're using the galaxy phone
expected by the end of next year sure
whatever hip into the Android partner
program or whatever it was called yeah
that didn't marry it's terrible but
let's wrap this gentleman because
michael is not the only person that
needs to go to the bathroom right now
final class mr. Martin I have a lot to
right are you buying I will buy probably
eventually not right now i'm probably
i'm enjoying the note 3 still so not
immediately but i will eventually buy it
i bought 2 nexus fours and two galaxies
nexuses and a nexus s and to nexus ones
so odds are i'll probably buy one or two
eventually it's not if but when you can
buy two so they're not lonely mr. jolie
my final thoughts are you you're
definitely buying your online is yeah
mine's already bought it was in the
first batch it's yeah it should be here
soon it's the 32 getting quite for all
who want to know but ironically i
already have that spy junne ultrafit
case which is black alright alright mr.
michael fisher you have my galaxy nexus
my friend so and you know you after
you're done with your review of the
nexus 5 and since you don't like the
phone I'm sure you're gonna put it in
the box and ship it cylinders that
chance okay so you already have a phone
ordered because you're gonna review it
but yeah that's not having the review
you know will come in now listen I don't
want it I don't want to say they're not
happy I'm excited to see what the hell
this thing is all about and to get
inside it and use it would I buy
personally probably not any
everything that it does my Moto X
essentially already does except for the
whole picture thing which are crappy on
this but no I'm very much looking
forward to get inside of it i'm sure
that 1500 commenters are already
preparing their their rebuttals to any
negative thing I have to say about
anything about it but no arrest assured
I am maintaining an open mind and I'm
actually really really jazzed for it
show at my door and there was something
else I was going to say but I forgot oh
yeah the Moto X is going to get kik head
as well soon according to motorola i
will tell you Michael that I will
require ransom and I for your ad 3 so
something happened to either my or your
you were suddenly like Daft Punk I don't
know what you were saying it's awesome
to miss anessa five is the ransom for
your iPad 30 you know you can go ahead
and keep that brother alright Steven
final thoughts I'm really curious st you
Steven because you're not like oh I'm
crazy to get the newest latest phone I'm
on the fence about this fact while we
were talking here I a muted my mic I
went back over check if they were in
stock I almost ordered one I'm on the
fence though I love the hardware it's
just I'm not completely sold on android
4.4 and this ever encroaching
everything's google+ I I got to try it
out first of my nexus 4 I think before I
commit to a new phone that's going to be
4.4 from the start but i'm really
tempted to the bust em know something
went wrong there no but nobody knows
