tipped to happen earlier than expected
rather show us what to expect for the
design of the HTC One and 10 and
Qualcomm has finally decided to take
wearables a little more seriously I'm hi
I'm Adam iveta and given the fact that I
am in sub-zero temperatures I hope you
don't mind if I drink this friday and
weekend off this is parking out daily
the official news today start with ebay
again the company continues to bring
very compelling deals now we have the
ipad pro as much as a hundred dollars
off just good and if you're interested
in getting yourself a new Nexus the
Nexus 5x right now starts at doing our
native dollars which is rather
compelling likes description full
details on what you're getting and
speaking of deals valentine's day deals
continue samsung is now joining the
crowd with AT&amp;amp;T if you buy yourself any
samsung galaxy flagship on AT&amp;amp;T right
now you get the option to buy either a
galaxy s6 or galaxy s6 active for free
along with it meaning you'll leave with
two phones a rather compelling deal
obviously you're not forced to go in
with anybody again just buy a new
flagship you get another one again more
information and links in the description
may be joined some of us and complaining
over the size of Android wear devices I
don't I actually do like it I just don't
like the battery life Qualcomm has
finally decided to take Android wear
processor seriously they've just
launched their new Snapdragon we're 2100
chip and you'd think of the chip got
smaller you'd get a smaller name but you
won't now other things still get smaller
starting with the footprint it is going
to be thirty percent smaller than the
snapdragon 400 which should mean a lot
when it comes to how much space it will
take up on the device that's great but
what most important for all of us is
twenty-five percent more efficiency and
battery life the Huawei watch is already
very efficient as a watch and so is the
watch urbane so this could just mean a
lot of good stuff going forward let's
see when this processor reaches the
first wearable household the spotlight
over to the HTC One m10 we are still
curious over the design we gotta hand it
to HCC they've kept some of the secrets
really well kept and even though we have
seen that the device looks
lot like the 189 one of the users at
xda-developers just published his own
renders over what he feels will be the
design mainly because of all the leaks
that we received and in addition to the
cool color that he chose I do consider
that this render is probably the closest
that the Vice we're getting it looks a
lot like the one I'm intended then again
this won't be the first time that HTC
surprises with the final design and we
cannot wait to see what we are getting
hopefully at mwc and finally the very
hot news that they have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy s7 we have seen all the
league's possible design-wise spec-wise
benchmarks we've seen everything the
question is exactly when are we getting
this phone and apparently Samsung is
going to pull an interesting one here
again it seems that the Galaxy s7 will
be ready for pre-order right at the
event meaning prepare your calendars
februari 21st and your wallets if you're
interested in the galaxy s7 apparently
this will be the date but it does lead
me to the question of today would you
order the galaxy s7 on pre-order day or
would you wait for our review and then
order the device we're talking about the
fact that you'll probably have to wait a
couple of months for the device to
actually launch and further the review
to be available but I would wait for the
review in my case leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know what your
opinion would be friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
nose earlier before this video was
