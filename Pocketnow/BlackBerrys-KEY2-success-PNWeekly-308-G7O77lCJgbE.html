near you today all right welcome into
the pocket now weekly when it comes to
the need for speed
I'm not talking about blackberry here
we're talking about oneplus then again
we are talking about blackberry because
this week black guy thinks it has
introduced a new interface paradigm that
removes one Android scrape from this
experience interior also will this new
hardware a combination on the key to
really still deliver to day battery life
as its predecessor did we have our
questions we'll try to get some answers
for you plus WWDC 2018 happening on
Tuesday so we'll give you a quick
lowdown of what we think the biggest
takeaways are ZTE is out of the front
pan and into the fire but Qualcomm and
right I've had their own Squatch was in
the pool this weekly chat with Jaime
Rivera and our good friend of the show
Andrew Wallace on this episode episode
308 of the pocket and weekly recorded at
7:04 p.m. Eastern Time on June the 8th
this podcast is about all the mobile
technology that you can care to dream
about ever since we were kids
smartphones tablets smartwatches tablets
everything that you can ever like it may
be benign like a button or two that just
magically proves out whatever you want
and one has already or 35 buttons or 35
your we're talking about keys though
keys are different from buttons anyways
I am jules Wong or the hosts of the
pocket math weekly also news editor here
I am joined as you can probably tell by
Hyman Rivera multimedia manager who is
sitting about what 10 feets I have a
three-year low I do
we're gonna sit where in the town 49
which is a wheat workspace and she has
the party let's open area kind of my
favorite spot and it's great I mean I'm
kind of a little worried about them
Jules is right there yeah well I mean
look at my content it's just like it's
dingy there's this light over here that
this is Nick's house for some reason
anyways putting it all aside for just a
second we have our friend as we have
said for the past couple of years
Andrew Wallace produce on Twitter hello
to you hello guys boy you get this is a
heck of an exciting week for for news
and hardware and software yeah I'm
pretty excited to be here with you guys
thanks for having me no joy intentions
that'd be a problem
I'm just trying to make up words as we
go along here as we have a quite a bad
show in itself I'll try to get through
it as quickly as possible because we
like conciseness here I think the best
way to start this off is by explaining
to people how that they you the listener
the viewer can participate and all of
this craziness and I think Jaime Rivera
you should be the one to do that job why
should I be the person to do that job
Jules started an Instagram story but
Instagram stories on Android this is all
in vivo folks yeah no I can't even tell
this thing is recording already but for
those of you that don't know you can
join the podcast start the conversation
at podcasts at pocketnow.com use the
hashtag key and weekly as well have I
forgotten anything Jules and I apologize
yeah we're also on Instagram pocket now
and Instagram is on
Jaime Rivera je IME RVers today
everyone's here
everyone's on Instagram everyone's on
the socials but we're all here right now
to talk about the BlackBerry key to the
launch event was just yesterday I was
there how it was there and we actually
got a little pretty put on care about to
notice so let's get into the specs of
this thing you're talking about
snapdragon 616 here with six gigs around
standard a podcast big deal to bring
that up from the three gigs on the key
one 64 128 storage for now I'm
overlooking important points here
because we're talking about blackberry
phone we're talking about a p1 successor
and that means bring back that 3 by 2
display or is that 4 by 3 4 by 3 yeah
get that aspect region right and then
you make room for all that with the 35
keke or is it 36 now 35 is it still 35
yeah 35 we're not not mean I'm trying to
get in the speed key I'm trying to
reference that is that is that like a
bonus was that last year's 30 I'm trying
to remember what it was before I I'm
just the spec sheet says 35 what go for
it I was looking at it and didn't the
key one have the shift on but either
side I don't have the t2 the t1 with me
cuz I thought it had to shift on both
sides but it looks like they replaced
the shift with that second button that
will get to you because I was sure it
had it on both sides I thought so so
David Cogan hears from their lockers
here by the way just he's looking at the
spec sheet of GSM arena and it's a three
by two aspect ratio according to to a
good guy didn't get my freaking math
right okay scared for a second I don't
remember what the other key was but
I don't know for me regardless of what
the usage was the concept with the speed
key is probably what I like to post and
so if we're talking key to probably one
of the main reasons ahead I've read a
lot of the comments over at the hands-on
over why is the key to the the phone
that I'm looking forward to using the
most and it's funny because most people
are making the concept of oh it doesn't
have a call come snapdragon 845 or this
and that and it's priced not very
aggressively but the main reason is
because i guess it's the phone that I
can make mine the most of you think
about it like that called concept of
being able to program all the keys on
that keyboard
I know particularly what the letter A is
gonna dial what the letter G is gonna
dial and yeah and that speed key
allowing me to be able to do it from
whichever app I'm in because I'd that i
fat I found that really annoying with
with the key one yeah to the home the
home screen go for it yeah let's explain
what the speed key is so it's on the
bottom right of the phone I wish I could
show you with a screen capture or it
depends to me we had them yesterday
just watch the hands-on it's there yeah
but in any case the speak key locator
lower right and instead of have until
they go through the home screen more of
a multi task pane to like scroll through
and find whatever else or maybe again
like you haven't even so you have to go
through the afterward to get to that app
well if you already have assigned the
app that you want sure cut via just for
the keyboard and whatever you can hold
down on the speed key and a tap on the
key that corresponds with that app and
then you get in any save yourself a
couple screams a lot of swiping and
there sit there talking about this is a
shift in paradigm in terms of they had
reviews experience yeah so I wonder yeah
go ahead
for me it's crucial I you know I I mock
how much it takes for you to make a
phone call on an iPhone
i mocked the whole concept of how
difficult it is you can't program
widgets to to dial phone numbers so
literally what you're left with is you
have to go into the dialer look for the
contact and then dial go into the
contact card and then dial we're asked
what the key to all you'll have to do is
speed key and whatever letter you've set
for that particular favorite contact of
yours and it just makes the process so
easy I care about those things it's
funny it's funny when you know many
manufacturers are using phrases like oh
but nobody makes phone calls anymore
like I'm sorry the fact that the smart
phone demographic has grown so much over
time and that most of that demographic
doesn't make as much phone calls doesn't
mean that people make less calls it's
just one of the things that the majority
of smartphone users do the least but
bear in mind if you grab the graphic and
you left the same amount of people that
were making phone calls 10 years ago to
the ones that are today obviously there
was a lot less population using smart
phones so many years ago so phone calls
wasn't a thing so sorry phone calls was
more of a thing but I make as many phone
calls today as I did before so I like
the concept of having an easy way to
jump in and out to whatever I wanted
there's and there are so many clients to
so many mentioned messaging clients that
we get between what's happening out of
all these things because they're ones
growing up in a different ecosystem and
everyone else is just like okay so how
do we do that it's so hard to switch
between these things I'm just even
having the apps installed that's all
that's already a hobby the process
Andrew I'm wondering about you and how
you feel about the speed key I really am
excited by it because potentially I mean
I'm a guy where I just have a pretty
much a bare-bones
home screen layout where I just have you
know the home screen with my icon you
know with my icons and apps that I
wanted the second one is the second page
is just a giant widget from a calendar
at this point you could pretty much
conceivably
not even have to use your home screen in
this traditional way that you would
because you have if you aside you're
really methodical and you assign
everything that you're going to normal
use everyday you've pretty much got that
at your fingertips
and then you can just kind of have that
as an additional display for whatever
extra stuff you like a concept phone
imagine like you start off with just a
browser and then you find a setting
zapman you just have to sign everything
a key of course like the uphill
challenge is going to be hard but I
think at least some people are gonna be
very very happy I like the concept of a
home screen because for me it's a
bird's-eye view to the things I care
about
so I care a lot about things funny but I
care a lot about things like the weather
thank care a lot about my calendar
people make fun of my home screen and
video reviews but it's just not gonna
change I've been using that layout since
back in the HTC touch days you know that
whole and that's if people don't
remember but that was like the first
phone that came up with the whole
concept of having a large widget with
your combined widget and then and then
if you remember back in the days of
Windows Mobile you could put your
calendar below that in your home screen
you can put your tasks after that and I
love birds I've for me having a quick
for me having an icon for quick access
to a particular app is actually these
are things that I actually avoid that's
the reason why I have them all in
folders I I'm it I force myself to have
an extra stuff to go into these apps
because a lot of these apps are desiring
to suck me in and not let me be
productive and so I even ask these guys
from blackberry I'm like guys can you
guys just bring back the old homescreen
concept that you had where if you
remember the days well you probably
don't Jules but back in the days of the
blackberry pearl you were you were - you
have to stretch your arm but I loved the
concept of that having my calendar
having the things I care about so I
asked them is there a way for us to I
mean who says that the current launcher
on Android is necessarily the best idea
like instead of having widgets I would
love to have like a sort of like today
like a today street
which is what Windows Mobile had mmm
that's what Windows Mobile had it wasn't
a homescreen it was called it today
scream I love that concept and for me
that was like the easiest way to remain
focused on the things that I cared about
and not focused on apps right well on
speaking of the homescreen I know on the
key one this was the case and I don't
think they ever really addressed this
you can't you still cannot you can you
can you still not use the shortcut keys
if you're using a custom launcher then
because that's that's one thing where
like you know I'm the guy who quit
always has Nova Launcher on everything
yes oh and that's one of the unfortunate
things that they were saying about the
key one as far as the software you
couldn't really do that and and I even
reached out at the time to the Nova dev
team and they said that they weren't
really what they weren't they had a lot
of other things on their priority than
making you know compatibility for that
he wasn't sold more than Blackberry
expected but it didn't sell like hide
what it was very mission is it's a very
niche product I mean I wasn't expecting
it to self crazy but it's funny I mean
the other day there was in Google i/o
last year it was Joshua Vergara Michael
Fisher Neerav and I'm trying to remember
two other people that were at that event
and they were all carrying a key one
mm-hmm
it that just gives you an idea of how
big the key one was at least for us
reviewers because what do we reviewers
care about we care about we have we have
to lead to a lot of email sadly we do a
lot of content consumption sure it
wasn't the best for content consumption
but the battery life was just so epic it
was the perfect phone for tradeshows
mmm-hmm it was the perfect phone for
tradeshows well it's probably good too
because being a product a Productivity
focused device like as far as contacting
sumption it kind of with that small it
with that type of screwed that small on
the screen and that offset like it's
kind of nice for not tempting you into
just being in the phone forever yeah
basically yeah I you know we've even
noticed that
what is that
[Laughter]
so I I even like like for example
concepts are on Android II and that
began on Android B and now iOS 12 where
they're trying to push for users to be
aware of how much they're on their
phones I like that whole concept of
having a product that's actually not
necessarily about being away from my
phone
but to a certain degree in facilitating
strange asks for the phone to be
available to me but for me to focus on
other things you know not to be just
about playing candy crush yeah
Andrew says like on the Twitter's here
not champion weekly autohotkey prepared
direct haha no I know how to do that
this is a window spirit that basically
allowed you to do the shortcuts for any
key press that you do on Windows and I
know that youtuber Tom Scott was able to
manage like doing just an emoji keyboard
where it like he plugged into 12
keyboards and every one of them put out
for king emoji at the time that was
available and they had you know skin
modifier so you know just press the like
whatever tone they have along with the
person you need them like I mean there's
a whole bunch of stuff that Android
could be using business and it's a new
form factor tools it gives people choice
I said it in my review who active sorry
in my review of my hands-on video
actually what I said was act was
actually repeating what the presenter
was saying during our briefing the fact
that they're not rushing to follow the
the same trend where everybody's adding
not just to their phones and everybody
is stretching 18 by 9 aspect ratio I
love that we have a counter product that
gives people a choice because a lot of
these design choices like the case of
the knotch
sure I will say it and I will repeat it
I prefer notch over bezels I agree with
it if that's what I have to deal with
for right now fine I'll deal with it
what I but it that doesn't necessarily
mean that that's the only corn-factor we
have we have an operator
system designed to be moldable to
whatever you want people even boast over
the fact that Android is free AAA and
whatever and yet the OEMs are not being
unique they're actually just following
each other like seriously you get the
iPhone 10 launching with a notch and
then how many phones have launched with
a notch all year yes one plus six the
you're one of the you're one of those
examples yeah one it seems like we have
four kind of like I'm there's the well
there's the mainstream that we always
see which is what everyone's kind of
going for we've got the gaming
enthusiast sort of devices we're sitting
on the razor phone in the yeah Asus one
and then we've got the key with the key
one and key to sort of blackberry you
know and caduceus ones and then we've
got you know that ZTE axon the dual
screen sort of thing but those are such
a bad phone it was bad yeah it was such
a bad so it was good when I saw it in
the briefing I was looking forward to it
and then they sent me in the unit and
they sent me two units actually there
were issues with both and I was like no
so yeah no I like for example the cases
of gaming phones in the case of the key
to I might okay so my biggest complaint
with the key one aside from The
Machinist of the keys was because it was
just such a steep learning curve to go
back to the concept of using an actual
keyboard that for me was difficult than
its own and then the keyboard wasn't
really comfortable to use but then the
second thing was that the unit that I
used was the three gigabyte of RAM it
wasn't until eventually if they sent me
the the four gig black variant and so oh
my god launching that camera or taking a
photo was very slow it was good for
everything else but I do care about my
photos I do care about taking good
photography and so I mean now that we're
gonna have the snapdragon 7 7 Series I
would even wonder if the company would
be willing to launch another variant
obviously I have to test this one out if
the camera launches fast then I don't
care you know I'm not gonna do 4k at 60
on a phone that's just that I do it for
certain particular usage scenarios and
then I it's very hard to find a good
Android phone that does that and so you
know those are the things where these
are the things that I care about I care
about a phone that's all that I that I
don't have to worry about battery and
anxiety yes I mean you talk about
battery anxiety let's just face it so
we're dealing with a new processor the
great thing about last year was that
that Specter at 625 which we think was
already proven even before the key one
to be a great battery efficient
processor all the stuff in it just
happened to work out so that thirty five
hundred million battery really did last
weekend oh it was the best phone for
that like it was the tradeshow phone it
was literally the tradeshow phone one
thing I was wondering because I was one
thing I was a little bit disappointed
with the key one and I don't I'm not
sure if this was a processor limitation
but the lack of raw support on the
camera because you know you'd think that
with was especially something with a it
gives you a little bit more wiggle room
I would feel like when being able to
make your photos look nice especially if
you're doing something in and something
that's not quite gonna be great lighting
for something that's like a mid-range or
sort of camera you think did you are you
able to speak to or just I think it has
a lot to do like for example you have to
understand a lot of the capabilities
like super slow-mo is a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 thing and it's actually
not even the 960 frames per second at
720p the clock the Snapdragon 820 5 is
only capable of 480 480 frames per
second at 70 the rest is a play they do
with with with Ram RAM interlacing yeah
it's the reason why in the case of the
one plus six you can only do what the
processor can do but you can do it for a
full minute whereas on the galaxy s 9
plus you can only do it for 20 seconds
and so a lot of those things like 4k
video at 60 that type of video all of
these things are actually a processors
thing
I am not I would lie if I would say that
raw photos are as well it's I don't know
I but I believe that will most likely be
the case and now this this phone has a
ton of RAM so who knows because the ISP
does help me it's vastly improved from
the prior generations in the six series
with that new cryo an architecture that
they're using but again I'll have to see
with that battery because this is our
first time so she with that cryo
architecture instead of like that year
magic that was brought about yeah do you
want to bring up software while we have
the chance with a lovely - I'm a hero
maybe um we were making fun of odd
because you know like all my friends
that were on TV ever got and now how
many active users there still are with
EDM and what the demographics of where
in the world they are there yeah again
they're talking about internationals are
talking about Latin America or even
Eastern Europe as well so it's those odd
places that they keep up the service for
it's just well I mean we've all other
buzz we've all moved on to facebooking
in surgery to more data intensive more
hot like you know stickers and look at
those things
I mean bbm served its purpose I've been
talking about this with that Danny would
use Time Square rooftop but and it was
like BlackBerry's success in the
consumer market between 2005 and 2009
was purely accidental
we still had QWERTY keyboards that
actually went with the familiar layout
instead of like a cute thing with the
key one where it's all squared out and I
was I was not able to get along at all
squared don't get me wrong man but
phones were really good about
communication yeah exactly and that was
when the communication was being you
know being made accessible to every
unto more teens and those people at a
wider you know basis and with more
features BPM and get more features at
the time so yeah and now it's pyramid
we're kind of past that age for me I I
guess this would be the speaking of
software again I had a good conversation
with people or blackberry inari you know
I made the comment this would be like
the only phone that I would actually
like for a nut manufacturer to skip
because it it's not designed to be an
Android phone to a certain degree it's
designed to follow on on a different
mentality but you know there's a lot of
disconnect between the whole user
interface that's touch oriented and the
keyboard and so it was one of those
things where I was like shoot like I
would actually like if you could if you
could again if you could give me
something like a today screen where the
home screen is different I get the
option if I want to switch back to your
typical a screen then fine whatever the
case you know it's it's I like the
software because it's minimalistic I
like the software because it's nearly
stock I love the fact that I could
launch applications by simply sliding up
for me that's great but then I feel that
there I still feel that there's a
disconnect concerning features that I
wish were better well what what's gonna
happen when it with Android P and all
the gesture support and the new thing at
the bottom because that's one big
question Mastiff Keys doesn't it yes
that's gonna be a nightmare I mean
especially with the fast-track support
from Hong Kong but it's optional that
gesture layout is optional on Android
that's the thing that's good that's
that's good mmm well I'd love to see
just more that gesture baked in just
because I mean gosh if I was gonna be
using it I'd probably just be using the
keyboard to swipe around I don't know I
don't know I feel that I feel that a
third iteration of the key probably the
key three I would love for them to
tinker a little with the software a
little further and come up with
something unique or that's just me
well I mean there's always hope that
Blackberry will clean things as much as
the cleaner outside
our facilities here is clearing things
up good out here doing that right now
want to give some dude notice to the
software for the enterprise side because
of course this is an Android interpret
recommended for enterprise I don't
remember the freaking it's like it gets
here yeah I think the average consumer
doesn't care I care but I mean but I
just like things like for example the
fact that if the camera launches or the
microphone is listening the phone will
tell you right now Android doesn't and
we've had so many cases where the other
day we were with Cogan we were I forgot
what we were talking about but it was
like a Star Wars movie that's very old
nothing in theory was listening in and
then the first youtube video that I
loved that when I launched the YouTube
app the first video that popped up at
the top was a video of that movie that
we were talking about that was creepy
that was really creepy
and so for me it's like okay yes give me
that key to now yes you know if it was
one of those II walk movies then it's
gonna be even more creepy oh my god yeah
he has found many of these movies
[Laughter]
secured folder we're talking about
securing certain apps or files with a
passcode I don't know what took them so
long I mean that's a simple well I mean
wow wow I did the software was I think
the first company to do that and you
know the galaxy's since the note a do it
I think or notes no no seven in some
ways they're catching up in some ways
what they're already I mean again hardly
top there's a hearted last whatever that
particularly means but
doing their pulling up all the stops to
make sure that's this is something that
a business person or someone with trade
secrets or whatever can use safely and
securely and just feel like it and also
I don't know about the price of a fairly
affordable price I mean we're talking
about now healing deployments 649 us I'm
sorry that price is off
yeah well it's like they did didn't they
you know know the key one was priced
that like five hundred something by
fifty and so and so here's the thing
when I was briefed on the key one one of
the premises for the price tag had many
had a lot to do with the fact that these
phones were bought for by enterprise
companies and so enterprise doesn't buy
just one phone they buy a hundred and so
they were pricing it at that segment
mainly because they wanted they wanted
to make it easy for the enterprise to
buy the phone if you remember a man back
in the old days no you don't choose but
probably you Andrew back in the day of
the blackberries that the old ones like
there were all prices from 200 bucks up
until like if you wanted to get the full
bone blown Bowl there was no yeah $7.99
do you know the identity thief I mean
one ya know they had the curve they had
the pearl they had so many different
variants that made it easy right now
blackberry doesn't have any entry-level
option so that it's a tough sell I feel
650 is too much for this one well would
you say that some of the older I guess
there are over a little over a year and
hold now the older D tech ones would
count as their entry but like their
blackberry motion is not being sold here
in the states actually have a unit and I
you know it's one of the main reasons
why I didn't do it so I know the problem
is hey we've I mean the keyboard should
be they should come up with like a key
they should they need to post something
out that said that the four hundred
dollar price tag honestly I think they
should still sell the key one that's it
that's a good that's a good point if
they could save money on retooling if
they keep the key one the 4 gigabyte
variant I don't recommend the three
ladies but the 4 gigabyte area was good
that that for me would be it yeah agreed
yeah indeed so with all that I think if
I think that's a same conclusion do you
have something a little bit more to
share in terms of wrapping this up I'm
good yeah all right well then hi Marie
Rivera thank you for joining us for the
time being I mean I could stay for ten
minutes more knowledge it okay all right
well and if you want to learn more from
my member air about this key to then you
can totally check out our YouTube page
for the full Hensarling well alright in
the meantime and I think it is time to
get to some more news from the week and
here we start off with ZTE coming out of
a long three-month long tunnel getting
through to that imports man being
crushed and well they're now green tubes
on the strict orale strictest
settlements from seven terms with the US
Congress the we'll start off with
they're paying an extra billion dollars
in addition to four hundred million
dollars as collateral for just being
able to source parts from the US again
lock out the market for about three
months because they were found of growth
of the terms of a previous Sultanate
that was made over concerns of traits
actually violations doing business with
Iranian and North Korean firms and then
we're talking about compliance measures
we're talking about a second cult
Elliott smart monitor to the first one
that they already have and also the fact
that they have to change up executives
really really fast like within 30 days
and that has people that has investors
as company on edge and people are kind
of scared so I think you and I were
having this conversation about CT and
we're like the company is doomed and
wasn't mad I'm like that doesn't work
that way legally every company's
entitled to fight back and figure out a
way to make things right and legally
that that's the way
system works you are guilty until proven
otherwise or I don't know here in the
United States it was especially keen in
this case because we're talking about a
Donald Trump presidency talk and this
conservative you know officials that are
trying to make deals and again it was
Donald Trump that was bringing up the
trade war with China that he could win
and this move could be seen as a
tit-for-tat kind of deal especially as
other things like agricultural goods or
even just steel steel has been the
biggest thing about it is I mean ZT is
one of the major suppliers for 5g so
it's not just trust me Z T's business is
not about phones
well yeah European networks Asian
networks not particularly in the US
which makes this enforcement action kind
of strange but I mean it's partly also
the sphere of Chinese authoritative
actions because they have been censoring
their internet very heavily making
territorial claims around the world and
just making sure that they exert their
influence on what kinds of policies that
thing well one thing that I think a lot
of the damage that's good a custom from
this seems to be just reputation as far
as part of the settlement isn't that
they had to have like a board that's
directly it that's directly answerable
to entities in the United States it is
yeah and I'm wondering how that's going
to affect their business their business
relationships that they have in China
right now currently if that's going to
cause bad negative perception of the
company one because they're turned
they're going to be changing around all
of their management and they're going to
be having kind of insider like a US
presence in at a high level in the
company and is that going to because as
much as we
the word train in itself means dual you
know in each way so trust me ZT is a if
oh my god like so I did I did a media
tour with them a couple of years ago got
that company's huge they're huge
like they represent a huge part of
China's Commerce so trust me it's not
just the if the reputation towards et
it's the other way back they consume a
lot of what's produced around here and
around everywhere so it's it's one of
those things where you know I felt that
this is what was gonna happen of course
the company did to make changes but
legally they were entitled to get a shot
figure things out and particularly as we
get closer to the launch of 5g that was
something in that was one of the things
that was in the United States biggest
interest like what other company is
going to make the the cell tower supply
for 5g like Irene Nelson provided
provided part of it but not not as big
as as the footprint that ZTE was
providing DTE doesn't even have that
much of a footprint again it doesn't
have in the u.s. so doesn't want to go
up to four percent silver stairs we're
not talking crunch buddy we're talking
Network we're talking network 4% sewers
like that's the number and and we
continuing that be to rely 25 to 30
percent of their components are us-based
like that for that kind of impact I
don't you data to say yes that I was
portion well I mean that's the truth and
that goes at the phone that comes into
their networking components as well so I
mean we're talking about this as like a
justice for all system but it really
wasn't because they weren't given an
official appeals process to do to the
contest all of this they were trying to
get behind the scenes and you know
negotiate under the table and make sure
that you know they had at least a fair
shot at you know protesting this and
well they didn't it ended up having to
be this sort of high-profile tit-for-tat
kind of between Beijing Washington and
well we're getting somewhere at least
but I'm not sure this was the right
thing on a lot of the news on this you
know I kind of feel like especially the
mainstream news is just because of the
current administration a lot of it too
so you know there's a lot of extra stuff
that's something that's kind of around
on the peripheral of this that kind of
adds to it so I mean as long as we get
an axon 9 and it doesn't see maybe it
has lopsy in the meantime I am going to
shift the order of what was written on
the rundown here just a second because
Jaime is coming up on his deadline and
we want to talk about something that he
is somewhat knowledgeable and the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 so one of the
biggest comments in in the video that we
did about the the Snapdragon 835 and
they always connected PC was wait the
age 50 just got announced and you're
doing the video about the 835 it was
funny but we we actually made that point
like why are you announcing the age 50
now and you when you just started
selling the 835 another thing is we're
still far from the first product that
will launch with 850 it's not something
that's gonna happen right now just to
give you an idea one of the major
reasons why it had to be the 835 and not
the 845 is because this process of
creating the whole concept of the always
connected PC took a year like it
literally took them a year to be able to
do all the changes in Windows that
weren't necessary and obviously each
processor is a different architecture
that's the thing about arm arm
complicates the process a little more
and so no so yes there is the 850 it's
pretty much the 8 4 it's like you know
when you talk about the a 10x or the a
11x processors for iPads it's like it's
it's got some extra components that make
it better for a larger display and a
more robust operating system but I'll
tell you this much like out of my
experience using the the always going
- PC with the Snapdragon 835 uh listen
you would have to like grab two
computers like one of them running an
Intel chip whichever you want Core i5 or
i7 and you set it beside the always
connected PC and launch anything you
can't really like the difference in
Apple Oh times is meager if a second at
most and then it just works you know for
me that was like a big shocker when I
saw this product for the first time in
Hawaii because back then these were
still prototypes and back then you could
fill up an excel sheet just fine and I
was like damn like really this is a foam
processor running Windows but it's a lot
more to do with how Windows was
optimized and the whole emulation that
Windows does for these applications -
we're talking about Windows 10 s mostly
I mean there are people that is a major
thing like my review is gonna be live
soon I did read a lot of the comments
for people who are like yeah this really
just that I'm like it's not a review I I
don't I I had only had like four days
with the product I can't really kind of
so - I can't review a product in that
amount of time we simply we simply did a
test like okay is this thing always
connected and is it real or not that the
battery life lasts this long
and we tested and we went through
different places and if you do the time
code we literally spent a span of about
eight hours in different spots and it's
hilarious because people were like yeah
but but you all you did was open the
computer and run speed tests I'm like
what exactly you think we were doing for
the rest of the time or would you have
preferred a video where I'm just sitting
in front of this table and just you know
eight hours of me just sitting in front
of the table and that's what you want is
a video really like TV between Norway
like seriously if you have any idea that
these were a hundred and twenty two
clips a hundred and twenty two clips for
that video to be produced and that
doesn't include and that doesn't include
the fact that we spent the prior day
also filming and I didn't use any of
those clips because I yeah we I didn't
like the angle that we were going to
with the video at the beginning and so
to be fully honest do I could okay
things about the HP Envy x2 particularly
I feel that it's not priced and so when
we heard about this product we were in
in Hawaii for the Qualcomm summit and
they were like yeah the price is gonna
be between six to eight hundred bucks
and I'm like okay that makes sense and
you get a full year of data up until the
end of the year so that makes a lot of
sense and the product deliver is like if
all you're looking for is like a MacBook
like you know a MacBook style you're not
editing video you're not doing AutoCAD
you're not doing any of that you're just
you just have a computer to fill your
spreadsheet or go to college or this and
that or just typical office work respond
to email this is a I'm shocked I was
like alright this definitely looks like
the feature of computing like this is
the way it should be because you don't
worry about the battery life like that
thing has been off the charger for the
past two days like obviously I use it on
and off and it's great the only problem
is with Jools was mentioning Windows 10s
so things like Chrome don't work you can
and here's the thing I installed Windows
10 Pro you can launch probe and Pro work
90% of the time but then there are
certain things like if you want to
authenticate for your Gmail doesn't work
it doesn't work so if you want to use it
for those particular things you have to
be you have to start liking Microsoft
edge which is probably one of the
downside so I wonder if things are gonna
get better with now with the snapdragon
850 or what the plan is gonna be we'll
see it's an exciting time that's for
sure it is an exciting time but
obviously there there are there are
growing pains uh you know like in the
example that we were portraying right
now with the key one and Nova Launcher
it's very difficult for a company to
start are creating a particular
architecture for for this new mentality
that's coming with the always connected
so it's gonna take some time it's not
gonna be something that's gonna launch
immediately
I'm gonna say is I have been early adopt
an early adopter for a ton of Apple
products and I have never had such a
good experience adopting the product
early as with this HP Envy x2 oh man
well that's just a testament yeah to how
polished it at this point really even if
it's even if there are some growing
pains with a tell you like Jules was
filming me of the whole all throughout
the shoot and I'm like damn dude this
thing is still at this battery light
like it's pretty impressive yeah is like
dude like look at these data speeds man
and you know sprint is not that great
here in New York City I was the first
one that I was like alright I need to
test this around a city well at this
point do they have any they're any good
Windows apps for for video editing or
anything
that not this point oh no in general
Windows apps for video editing is
Premiere Pro and that's this is not your
computer for that yeah I didn't know of
like 9 be possible with that prot with
that mobile processor now yeah yeah yeah
try me adobe creative class with you yes
so whatever's in the Windows Store we'll
play with it then that's that's what
should that's what I tell people like
you can upgrade to Windows 10 Pro I
don't recommend it right now I did it
and it's it it says that it does work in
the app doesn't load but then a lot of
things don't work with him and so it's
like all right it's still a work in
progress
yeah but it's a step in the right
direction though I think so too man I
think so too I just hope that there's
not getting 1000 coming up for next year
that you know is comparable to like a
dual-core Intel that would be definitely
cool I mean again I could give you so
many examples of I it's funny how I you
know I know so many people in our
industry that used the MacBook from
Apple and you know when that product
launched all of us were like really like
a like a core em on this and
and so expensive because a MacBook is
crazy expensive and just one port like
seriously and so it didn't deliver on a
lot of the things like for example you
do need to charge that thing every now
at that and so if you have a computer
where you actually don't have to carry
the charger because by the way the
charger on that and the x2 is horrible
it's huge it's like really this thing
just completely defeats the purpose of
the product that's gonna be part of the
review but yeah I feel that just like
we've got this appeal a lot of things
need to evolve into because I'll give
you an example that that Envy x2 is a
little too big I was like why is this
product so thick if this is a food
processor why didn't they make it
thinner I mean I would rather you give
me 15 hours of battery life and not 22
haven't proven them yet the I haven't
reached 22 hours yet but instead just
give me 15 hours and give me a thinner
computer and I would be really happy
with that I could it could be part of
the thermal processing that the TPU that
they have to do and also I'd like to
design that because there aren't any
fans on that computer so yeah I see yeah
I'd be worried about having it on my
coffee table and then accidentally
throwing it away with with magazines or
something so it's just for example I am
a big icon user I am a big I pad user
like I I rely heavily on it and for me I
like that Bob shoot let's not go too far
like my voice my audio recorder right
now is the iPad and like seriously like
this for me this form factor is just so
cool
like I would rather they give me like an
iPad pro design like really slim that
also has LTE that runs Windows 10 that I
could snap a keyboard when I want but
that's just so small and it feels like a
note pad because the stylus on that HP
is really good really really good and so
I'm like god this is just too big for me
to use it as a note pad but it would
have been so cool and I am but I feel
going back to to your point it's a step
in the right direction it opens the door
for the east type of products to to
exist at some points so I'm all game for
whatever
India India and will be game will be up
on it with reviews and all the hands-on
that we need so and hopefully we have
you to join us mom
I'm Rivera of the Bach now Bailey as
well on YouTube multimedia manager and
before I forget we have an HP Envy x2 to
giveaway we do have an extra one we were
wondering what to do with it it's gonna
be a giveaway so stay tuned we're gonna

awesome man but the problem is this
shirt was only available for 24 hours

mean I think this shirt is about a year

$300 gift card with purchase visit them
microsoft store near you today and we
are back with more news of the week i
want to jump back in see the stories
that we might have miss occluding the
one that was actually pointed right
after ZTE kind of in the same vein
Huawei absolutely here so we've seen lot
of political pressure in the US and kids
to follow right we talking about
ten Pro being denied carriage by 18t and
Verizon Best Buy was said to have
considered or may have actually taken
quarters away from Huawei so they might
not be stopping them in the near future
and there's just a whole litany of
recommendations against using a ZTE
product or a long way product but I
think this is kind of taking things a
little too far yeah well maybe
especially because this kind of mixes
into like the privacy conversation we're
having in the dance right now and that
is reaction last week yeah go ahead
well just like it's it's almost seems
like there it seems like it almost sort
of I comes across to me as kind of
vindictive base from the from the US
government towards Google and Huawei you
know because of this whole because of
the fact that well I guess we'll let
everyone kind of know was at Google so
the US government is not very happy with
Google because of what happened with
their Department of Defense drone like
they were sitting essentially helping
the Department of Defense develop some
better you essentially make its software
that helps scan footage Intel for
subjects identifying them used a lot of
the Google's artificial intelligence
capabilities and it was called Project
maven and it was reported that Google
had taken its name out of the race for
the next contract for that at big for
running that support for a long time but
now it seems like in retaliation the
Wall Street Journal is reporting that a
few Republicans like Republican senators
at the moment three of them I know well
very long it's there were there was
internal strife at Google because of
this like people people quitting over it
as I from what I was seeing in lots of
just internal commentary of how it's not
what they signed up for you know they
didn't want to sign up for
to develop weapons for the US government
which you know and it's it's I can
understand them on that and with the
current it's I mean let's be honest it's
a super toxic political environment in
DC and and just in the United States
right now and so it's hard part of it
makes me wonder if it's sort of a an
ideology bipartisan sort of move I mean
we're looking mean I hate to get too
deep into this sort of thing but we are
looking more for it's ideologically
driven policy these days those periods
but you know besides that point like the
whole notion of this being a just a clap
back to Google by perhaps pointing out
its relationship with Huawei because you
may not remember you may do a meso
robbery is hard and that back in January
it was announced that Google and while I
would be a teaming up to provide Android
messages as a semester RCTs capabilities
that bring it somewhat closer to more
like an AI messages with more fanciful
text processing media higher upload
limits and whatnot and that while we
would be serving up servers to
participating networks if they so choose
and of course where people started
getting the little shrug little fearsome
fearful excuse me next of course
wallowing being founded by former
People's Liberation Army officer and
also just having a lot of the government
money poured into it and just that
Specter Xi Jinping just oh yeah it's a
culture difference that makes people
kind of an easy but you know as far as
did they ever aside from just that
general relationship there's I don't
think then correct me if I'm wrong and
everyone in the chat correct me if I'm
wrong there's been no real
hard evidence of wrongdoing leverage to
get schwa way like there was again CTE
is am I correct
oh well I mean there was there's been an
ongoing investigation about what it did
in terms of trade center violations
just like CTE and right that was proven
or at least found that the yeah II did
but in terms of the cyber see it's more
nebulous it's more of a issue that gets
completed with others such as well I
mean in the current environment trade in
current private North Korea with the its
relationship to China and whatnot so
like there are tons of conversations
that we could be having at many
different levels that kind of right into
this and yet you know just having it
right back to Google I'm this I'm for
for of all things being able to
determine who you're killing from
tending I mean I don't want to be like
okay Google and then and then a like a
drone strikes my house you know but I
think well the system you know there was
that fanciful um you know funny little
video or you see it dystopian video that
clip of Google assistant being taught to
fire a gun hadn't even seen it
you know my god that's terrifying little
coding and you just and make sure that
the servos are there and then both but I
mean you could do that with echo if you
wanted and echo you could argue has had
much more creepier tendencies with
random bouts of laughter and it's just
like buy more toilet paper on Amazon or
else or be sure to press that button if
you really want to continue living and
you'll get a whole bunch of Tide
detergent and in the process so yeah I
mean we're going down rabbit holes here
but yeah this is this is a tough topic
that at least I thought it deserved to
being mentioned below
oh absolutely villain it's it's because
it's part of a non developing story
interlinking story because it's a part
of a it's part of a bigger
bigger overarching umbrella we are all
these things really true it's true but
especially something that's just
political and so linked to what's going
on with our government you know whether
it's weather weather or whatever side
you're on as far as that you know it's
it's something that's hard when it makes
it into the mainstream media like it is
people who are less knowledgeable about
are starting to actually like get
exposed to this and it's important to
talk about it it's well I fully
understand cuz heck a lot of members of
our Congress doesn't don't really
understand how this stuff works
so I mean a couple years ago we've been
you know that's it was Kickstarter and
IndieGoGo and kind of things that gave
us kind of well somewhat justified about
outrageous more kind of ha it were
mocking it and it's nice to mock things
that we don't have much involvement in
but nowadays it's well you get a little
more piss and vinegar in your drink so
yes everyone kind of does these days
without is but I digress
you want to talk about Sprint's again
sure yeah yeah I mean they're doing
something apparently about a $15 per
month plan and then I need interesting
to people who are switching over so this
this plan it's called a limited
kickstart and it's a very elusive offer
because first of all you have to be
pointed over your number to it to the
network you also have to well you can't
buy your own device or you can bring one
over from a previous situation that you
had and in that case the device
portfolio would be very limited so yeah
it sounds like it's a very well written
it sounds like a shot across the bow for
MDA knows that rely on Sprint mmm-hmm
well and I mean they've been kind of
doing similar sort of things for the
past few years I mean the don't even get
me started about that family plan stuff
that they had for a suit period of money
that I was that was an act of branding
that real
the devil oh yeah I used to work I
worked at Best Buy at that time and
every single time somebody walked in
with with whoever that they've met on
their way into Best Buy going let's put
us on a family plan I was hoping I could
can't set them on fire with my eyes oh
my god well and it's it's interesting
though because I've always wondered
house because Sprint's half is I mean a
big chunk of Sprint's business is comes
from the MVNO sort of stuff that they
end up doing and it's it's I've always
been interested to see how they balance
that you know it's kind of like how well
I mean yeah it's more it's more intimate
of a relationship for them like say with
Virgin Mobile isn't it then say ATT and
cricket I mean yeah they have so many
partners that they kind of you know rely
on them to keep the subscriber numbers
at a little bit but it's especially
become a jarring I could say that we're
looking at this in the context of Sprint
and t-mobile can do to the merger or
looking at a department of justice
that's finally seeking out the concerns
of smaller carriers such as those MV
owners that rely on Sprint t-mobile
wholesale access to their networks and
worried about rents going up as a result
of this merger so there's that happening
and there was also if we go back just a
couple of weeks ago freedompop that runs
on spreads network and watched another
virtual network
it's called unreal mobile they're kind
of going through beta phases right now
and but the thing was that the headline
was $15 per month so where does a
limited kickstart get this $15 per thing
probably from a real mobile so yeah this
is a it's interesting of course so yeah
I'm curious if because of course I you
know we don't I don't really have you
know to have any line of sight into
where they're at and they're all of
their negotiations but do you think that
this could potentially be a move to to
get more more subscribers in and
leverage that in the in the deal
possibly perhaps I mean it's a very
short term for sure
so Sprint's value in relation to its
stock price mentioned in the deal is
about 10 percent lower than it should be
so just meet the gap
people have been investors have been
very worried about this deal nowadays so
yeah yeah I mean it's having a look
having a look at Sprint for a long time
they've made a lot of short-term
business decisions I feel like
especially with like their pricing
jumping around all their probably their
promotion promotion happy any can dip it
down to $50 per month for it a little
bit $500 blond name never like their
last big long-term decision they made
well it's probably not their last but
one of their major ones that they made a
long time ago ended up blowing up on
their face and that's why Max and they
never really fully recovered from that
as far as you know they just because
coverage and you know I mean the Sprint
Nextel Mercure was in itself just that
boggling to have because of the
conditions because you know I'm gonna
put him in a hole as far as their like
the the V the the commitment to to that
technology that they were using and then
basically that was just a bunch of money
flushed down the toilet and is you know
so they have the physical towers but
they gotta put the new emitters on there
with with 4G LTE instead of WiMAX and it
just it prevented them because you know
getting building more towers is
expensive and they poured a bunch of
money into this technology that was kind
of a dead end
yeah he said it was four years of just
having that around and even like latest
last year there was a lawsuit by edge I
think education on it that worked to
keep some of the WiMAX
towers up because they were still using
some really how are they using them on
like because a couple of that is Galaxy
S to Epic 4G Touch is out there around
Wow
well there's probably you know there's
not many people using it so maybe
they're using all that bandwidth exactly
just all that free space that they're
using it's just oh man yeah it's it'll
be I'm interested to see how this is
gonna turn out especially with how I'm
interested to see how the prepaid side
of things are gonna turn out for for all
sprint prepaid stuff and t-mobile's
everyone is Boost Mobile's founder is -
oh yeah I mean they're they're gonna I
mean either they're gonna mean they're
they're all gonna have to eventually
switch over to GSM I would hope well
I've been well at least it's a matter I
have unlocked devices it's a matter of
routing backhaul in so I mean yeah I
mean you can have all the towers you
want but in the end you have to provide
the servers to interconnect with each
other so yeah that's true I just know
either way for where I live I can't be
on team over Sprint so I was on t-mobile
for a little bit and there I will say
they have been doing a great job of
building out you know it's just it's
just happens to be you in places some
places where I need to go that it's it's
pretty much the edge of the earth where
you can shot the edge here if we can see
it from there
so yeah totally totally Adam Lane was
just coming in was about hey you wanna
come in our next story about did you get
the Evo that's because I'm on an Eevee
right now if you don't remember the EP
this was the key not only that a
crowdfunded thing but also the
crowd-sourced specs for the whole entire
Windows 10 convertible laptop surface
clone thing
that was started up and I have one here
he has his unit you want to show it off
right there lovely it's like oh and
tell that oh come on a chalkboard and
everything yeah it's a kickstand there
maybe it's a big lump of Awesomeness
because it's fanless but it has an Intel
dual core processor for laptop so great
for that yeah and well you've been
hearing and I'm here
yeah but the evened how do you plan on
going forward into your experience
re-release oldest what's the next one so
they're planning on a backpack because
they've got of course you have to have
swag but also know hey bets gonna be one
is premium things and they also have
like a full-blown laptop that they want
to try and do you know they're just inch
this over here the split screens but I
missed down on the 8 inch tablet that
they made Eve t8 and I never got to see
that it was it was impressive piece of
hardware just for the value proposition
it was a particularly heavy thing
because it was no yeah most at least
when Artie was still a thing most of the
eight inch devices that I was that I was
whenever I was at Best Buy were the for
the full windows once cuz pretty much
the only some of the only art some of
the only RT devices that I remember
seeing were pretty much the for the most
part this sort of the official marketing
you know surface yeah just the surface
are to use like we don't want to touch
this
no I mean every every single
conversation I would have to have with
customers would be at will be at least
10 minutes of me explaining a difference
and making sure that they understood it
because inevitably every 90% of people
who bought the RT tablet just runs
Windows lovely hardware yeah if you put
if you put the over here so you're gonna
get this podcast has become a train
wreck in the best sense back on the
topic back on topics it's a it's just
the rumors for this Paul's iPhone and
that the LCD model which was supposed to
be almost affordable and you'd be the
mass appeal type apparently is going to
be delayed by a couple months because
apparently the people over at Japan's
way I'll do this player having a hard
time trying to up those yields for the
panels which have to be in that iPhone
10 to design where the curved corners
and the edge no not kind of has to be
made for so it's I mean they're having
difficulty just informing that with
healthy eating now sharp has been
working on
kind of thing and you know that you know
a curved LCD or a cord or cut LCD as
possible it's just well like to have
that run into this obstacle and Apple
especially after well I would say it was
a big applause for Apple this year but
obviously investors had their own
estimates for how the iPhone 10 should
have done and well it made record
profits for Apple didn't do as well as
it should have
David across that 80 million iPhone
shipment mark so well we want to you
know so you go ahead and do me know what
I was about to ask for you well and I'm
just wondering with the with the Rd that
they're put there pushing into this to
try and get this developed are they I
mean it comes down to it what are they
saving that much more than just using
AMOLED or at some point the R&amp;amp;D has to
reflect in the price tag but I it could
be one of those rare things they did it
for home pod where they might be taking
a loss on this or they might be taking
of doing a loss leader sort of thing or
at least very smaller margins that they
would have expected well I mean gosh
they're selling it what their it's
estimated to be the the affordable
models of us estimated to be between
he's on twitter at isaiah 88 ad am ze a
yeah give him a follow guys yes yes he's
good stuff alright but yeah like where
was I it was just it was yeah I lost my
train of thought I crazy because it 550
cuz the the so are we thinking the DSL
this LCD iPhone is going to be the like
the se sequel possibly because if it is
its launching 100
two dollars more than the SE was
continuing evidence is that the SE two
or the sequel would be the iPhone sequel
would be a different model it's been
said that this would be a summer or
launch or at least some time around
double you know DC may launch and they
were further delays so you could see
four freaking little iPhones this well
now though they're gonna have to they're
gonna happen to the this one my
prediction is that they're going to
basically sunset the success and the
seven I mean I mean they're still
supporting the 5s in 2018 which is true
well there's one point I want to make
look will say that for the WWDC section
yeah I've got a point too regarding
Apple watch on that one okay
at the same time with with like a timber
and a harmony baritone in any case
finally one story left in this rundown
and that is essential in the twists and
turns that Academy has had to make those
the past couple weeks
we finally have a headphone jack adapter
the freakin audio adapter mod for that
2-pin connector thing
where was the 2017 Bruce well it was it
was the freaking dongle that was cost
$15 it didn't have to cost them what's
the number here for getting so much
money I don't know i didn't see pricing
on this ya know i would assume it's over
50 bucks though i would assume so most
well because our talking were including
ESS ESS say produc because what LG uses
in its g-series feast areas they have
that contact thing going on and then
there's also master quality
authenticated technology that they've
been heavily pushing that basically
makes more of experience sort of sound
like lossless Sam so that's what they're
promoted at this of course you could put
in a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
our headphone just headphones and listen
an edger well despite that being I mean
if you look at that picture it's it's a
pretty thick burger right there one like
I'm gonna have a case on mine if I had
one and so that's that's my problem with
these mods the way they've designed it
is you pretty much have to go without a
case to be able to use them and in it
for me that's kind of you know I'm
sweating right now just having my mate 9
out of a case right now so oh no I think
it's a little too little too late right
now with it I mean it's really cool
they're doing it but I mean it was in
the pipeline already they said they were
going to do something more with yeah it
was on tracks but especially Sting's
after you read the statement from the
company that said oh well we cancel some
projects and people are kind of
inferring that it's the central phone -
but we have more integral successful
projects that we are working on and then
what comes out is a 3.5 millimeter
adapter so yeah I mean it's it's good
that with at least they're acknowledging
and that's nice if they have that it's
just I mean if it were me also that'd be
the one of the first things I'd lose
because just thinking about my magnets
be nice right that's true that is very
true and I mean I would be interesting
it would definitely be interesting to
see how it performs compared to the the
donal that they that they included with
it so yeah I mean it's I'm I'm excited
I'm glad to see that essential is still
putting out broderick
despite all the really horrible press
they've gotten within the last month I
think it's at some point it could be
just cut bait and let loose but right
and it's just who knows how many how
many accessories are there products that
they have it that's already in the
pipeline that they committed I mean
nothing's guaranteed a any moment Andy
Rubin just clap his hands don't try it
slurry and talk about WWDC 2018 get
excited for software I know that you you
were a hardware junkie and you're not
too excited about first of all Apple and
Tiger all software and third of all
Apple software what let me put this way
my family is excited about Apple are
very software but you know it's to be
honest though in all honesty it's the
the types of things that we're starting
to see cuz I mean it's a nut I'm just
gonna say for me it seems like another
year of them kind of catching up with
Apple Apple but I Android and
functionality for a lot of things and
it's good I'm glad that that that the
the Apple users and iOS users are
getting this are getting are getting
these features now that we've been able
to enjoy for a long time and you know
cuz it's it's just good to have that
because Apple tends to push things
mainstream you know it could be it was a
fingerprint scanners all the way to the
knotch
so and getting rid of the headphone jack
so if we're good or better or worse you
know in this case a lot of it seems to
be for better cuz they're like gosh
we're going down here there's iOS 12
where where there's performance they're
fixing with performance especially with
older devices so they're taking
advantage of what they did do a little
better than the Android and is
supporting older devices and actively
making them in theory faster that's a
really good thing especially as they
know now that they're not selling as as
much as they were like at that same rate
as they were so they've got it it's even
more important for them to support their
older devices so I really like that I
like that a lot
honestly that part and then just waiting
for them to get the nameplate and to
make sure that everyone's included
everyone can jump off the finest bus
site some point like I don't think such
a clean break will happen yeah there's
on see your uncle unit down to like one
release it's not this three or four
releases kind of deal we're talking this
and you cover all the ranges it's just
one release at a perfect price point
like but there have to be a big break
for me yeah there's one I'm also excited
I'm excited to see Siri not be like
getting less dumb yeah that's totally
over these a little improvement so iOS
twelve is all about performance they
were teasing a whole bunch of
percentages in terms of speed faster app
launches and faster camera transitions
also the keyboard displays much faster
and I understand seconds cath when it
comes to saving yourself time hours even
days just by because you use your damn
phone all week all just texting friends
so I understand that's something that
something that should be Iron Throne is
saying in the chat is you know we've got
it we have to wait to see exactly how
iOS twelve is going to perform on the
older devices
you know battery throttling yes that's
exactly what I was gonna be saying
because if they're because they're
they're gonna have the toggle between
which ones you want to do and how is it
is it going to balance ours they're
gonna be the same or worse with once its
throttled thus there is point blank less
code then it's not going to be eight
that I feel like you can they can kind
of again dodge around it and perhaps
speeding it up that way but I'm not sure
how far how far before we get to
diminishing returns yeah I don't know I
will see I mean the thing I'm most
interested to see is how it performs in
the success and
and then we'll just kind of see from
there or well success or the se I guess
where's the six or the five minutes well
it's not it's not getting is the if I
confirm if the six is getting it cuz I
don't think the six is getting it yeah
no they said it was gonna be all I
phones um it was the say it's the same
support base as the Iowa's eleven okay
okay so it was just they the examples
they were giving him the older devices
were just the 6s and not like the sticks
okay okay that makes sense okay
yeah well that cover the damn thing this
was like a two hours of my life that I
have to like sit down and make sure that
I'm looking at for King knock Phil
Schiller's what's-his-name
federighi Craig federighi XY's and and
not make she can make sure that I don't
fall into his gaze yeah it's interesting
I'm glad also bundled notifications oh
my gosh like definitely finally I was
talking to some co-workers who all have
iPhones and we ended up saving so my
co-worker of mine left her iPhone 10 in
the park gas station parking lot and
actually managed to get it get it back
and I was talking them about that and
they're like funneled what like I I like
my long list of notifications and I'm
just like my gosh are you guys and I
feel like I'm talking to something from
the medieval era I think they'll get to
know what bundle of notifications are in
due time and hopefully enjoy it oh I
don't I don't wish anyone of any you
know unless allegiance
any ill will because they need lived
their lives on their phones too so I
mean well I just want to get into some
of the digital health stuff too because
that was a somewhat of a point talking
point at Google IO with Andrew P and I
think it's mostly the same stuff really
like there's a nap time screen time kind
of a deal where you learned her or no
excuse me I'm conflating all these my
screen time is just making sure
you know how much screen you're using
per day five or six hours kind of crazy
and just make sure that you get a report
every week at launching you for your
overuse of Instagram allowances allows
you to set up limits and well it's
really it doesn't really go that far
since you're able to actually go through
with the allowance you can actually go
past the allotments by just tapping on I
want to go in for a little bit more and
I you know I'm a data is beautiful kind
of guy
so I would even so much as even if I
don't use any of the limiting features
of it it would be I love the idea of
being able to go in and just see what my
what my what my personal smartphone
habits are in the long term just because
it's fascinating you know it's cool and
then if I decided I'm like man gosh I'm
wasting so much time on this then you
know that could kind of do that if it
turns out that I'm I need to go out and
you know interact with humans more but
it's nice to have that and I think
that's a feature you know that you know
we talked about Apple star having these
features whether they're good or bad
that the other manufacturers copy this
is something I would not be upset if
other if Android OEM started including
in there remember that qui-gon jinn is
not human
all right let's talk about Siri for a
second it's attempting to be smarter but
really it's just making sure that you
can be faster so the biggest deal about
this is shortcuts and it's already
integrated into some third-party apps
but you can create your own it's it
reminds me of if if there's not that in
terms of just being able to set a hot
phrase and then have the iPhone go
through a whole raft of tasks and
commands we're not telling them at the
time tell your meetings or our
order some so yeah what's your take on
that I mean I think it's pretty cool
just to have that like do we know how
how in the weed you can get with it like
as far as like setting up macros and
because like some of that would be cool
especially you like if you're like I
know that they were talking about
getting into your car and doing some of
this so the more specific thing that
they mentioned is a kayak the travel
reservation site if you go into that app
and then you set up a hot raise like
travel plans you can actually pull up
the information about your reservation
at the time you get the dress
perhaps if you really wanted to be a
little bit more efforts in effort and
you can set directions to the hotel I'm
not sure and so it it looks like there's
there's like a phrase that triggers it
listening to you then is are you just
doing hey Siri travel plans or I think
well well I know they think did this for
that Apple watch where you can just
raise the watch if just talk to it but
in terms of in terms of just iOS I'm not
sure that you just say her yeah do you
have to say hey Siri I think I was gonna
say conceivably you could have you could
have it to where since it's unlocked you
would think oh well you're holding it in
a certain way so that it's directly in
front of your face and you're unlocking
this you're paying attention to your
phone but I mean if that's not a future
now that might mean it's all about that
brand reinforcement right especially on
that iPhone where I mean they did move a
washer West but that's kind of that was
kind of saving their users the
ostentatious kind of gesture of having
to do that raised arm for too long yeah
I know I don't worry I'm like honey I've
got the the gear s three frontier and
it's like I lift up no but not coming up
yep now I see much I just you know you
play around the bezel a little bit and
that you it starts activating most
satisfying thing ever with a watch yeah
ball bearings man yes
there's
yeah that that's pretty exciting there's
another thing that I really like and and
I feel like Apple has been a big big in
the forefront of is is their the way
that they've implemented they are in the
mainstream yeah yeah
so let's well cuz Google actually sort
of preempted them in the sense because
they have that just the line app that
they introduced that they kind of like a
closed beta thing and that it was just
being able to tap phones to each other
and then share the same in our space and
you know do a little what not and it's
kind of extends that this is a you know
being able to develop on and get to and
you'll be able to ignore those
experiences those shared experiences
playing games down you down blocks as
they showed off in their demo in the
same space and just being able to play
games also 3d object detection so I know
this is where I go back to so the
Nintendo 3ds you were able to scan cards
and be able to show have them display
characters coming out of those cards in
augmented reality and I was neat and
amazing but you couldn't really do that
3d objects and I guess well maybe now's
the time now is the time to implement
that so they were talking about Lego
Lego has the it's a assembly square app
and with certain physical labels that
you build them and then you take the app
to it and then oh my god you got
extended sets it's a virtual set you can
see what's happening in there basically
I'm the mayor of the city and just do a
whole bunch of fun stuff and you can
that's coming from a scan of a 3d object
so that's someone impressive on well
it's nice to you because apples they are
stuff like that they've been
implementing feels feels more organic
and it feels less like a tech demo I
feel like you know especially with some
of the games they are having word that
can slingshot
it's where you know you pull back and
you shoot or I mean heck I'm waiting for
whenever they they release they have a
DND sort of thing set up to where you
can kind of if you have some friends
around like it's it's just very organic
and as far as like the types of games
that they're coming out with that are
you know that like as opposed to say
tango where they're like we just want to
have we want to have this terrible
lenovo project tango phone and lows and
it's good to be there so you can you
know you know kind of searching it was
like a whole project that went to not
because you know they had that one
camera solution for a bouquet and all
those other features and then also which
is just what camera for all the
augmented reality because you have
tensorflow you have all the AI to
determine some of the other intangibles
factors that you need to place objects
so it's like it's like the little things
like a measuring app where you measure
physical space yeah it's crazy to see
just seeing how quickly we we've
advanced and tech in the air and just
technology and sensor technology and
algorithms and software technology an
approach and sense because what that
because tango kingi like started or what
2014-2015 so I'm not sure what the IP
you started four years ago though like
it's the first product that we saw that
was that was able to be sold and to pro
yeah and then they're then like what was
it six months a year later they a
sustained go from excessive amount yes
yeah and it's it's really I mean it's
nice to see that it's fascinating just
watching this advanced so much like what
I mean heck we ever if ik wise was a
friend of mine just got with the windows
mixed reality headset and and it using
me and the way that the controllers on
at work is like what was it for like you
can detect where you're at as far as
like like the tilt but as far as like
or Ford you are and back it basis a lot
of that off of algorithmic estimation
yeah it's just amazing that that all of
this we like we don't even need to have
all of those sensors and that's an apple
is coming back toward to a pond that
that's where they're capitalizing and
make it mainstream because you don't
have to buy a specific niche phone to be
able to do that and they're dealt the
the software that there's this the games
and software that they're showcasing is
really polished and compelling and
that's one example of where you can say
Apple kind of comes in and brings in a
little bit more polish the sword isn't
the pencils mightier than the sword well
you have the code that's mightier than a
hammer or the sensors so I mean it's
great for those purposes especially when
the stakes are pretty low now if we ever
get to a more riskier territory or more
kind of maybe even like surgical they've
been talking about implicate that's in
the medical field that's where we start
to you know ask more questions but I'd
want I'd want them to be able to be
slightly more accurate with the
measuring before I had a surgeon they
are you know V are like into my chest
cavity because like we saw the real-time
changing of the measurements it's like
three quarters five eighths the record
is five eighths mortis records so I mean
they're gonna get better as time goes
long and and you know I wouldn't be
surprised if in a generation or two it's
it's hyper well more even more accurate
I'd give it I give it like a hundred
generations until well hey big enough to
measure like if I'm moving someplace and
you know trying to do with that project
tango try and try to do with lows I mean
I think it's generally pretty good for
that you know anything else you're gonna
want to be getting proper carpentry
tools and proper tape measures so but
yeah I think I feel like one of the big
trends coming up as just making sure it
isn't you know in sexting you gotta have
that eggplant emoji really back backed
up by science
and then don't worry then you get them
emojis with it
yeah the MIMO oh no no what didn't you
find it so ominous that they're like now
we can track your tongue and I'm like I
don't know about this I think everyone
everyone after they said that they were
just kind of like and everyone you know
so moving their tongues around after
after that man and Charlie Brooker got
into his next episode of yes boy yeah
and I mean aside from okay they're
they're they're more emojis emojis
speaking of those emojis and whatnot
that's uh talking about face ad for a
hot second looking at alternate
appearance and potential iPad adoption
of this thing so I mean it would be
practical to say that face ID Woodman
was coming for that I did know this has
been so I guess good on them but you
still need the hardware out yeah and now
there's there are two different ways I
think that they might do this and
honestly and this is it's crazy and I
know it's blasphemous but I on an iPad I
wouldn't mind a ma a notch because it's
such a huge canvas on there like if it's
the sale I mean you wouldn't even leave
it not because you already have the
bezels there well if they want to make
it business fully bezel us that would be
really interesting
it would be hard to grip I would have to
have a pop socket on the back would you
really piss off that many tech fins from
just because I mean they don't really
actually use not too many of them use
tablets do that well which is the most
popular tablet around well it's like I'm
thinking morally just like someone like
my family using it cuz like my mother
loves her iPad just loves it we got we
got her one of the newer ones got she
upgraded from the third gen iPad and
yeah and while and she loves it it's one
of her main computer remain computer
when she's not having to do her course
stuff to get stuff done well with if
they had the notch a bezel is display in
the not
I mean the knotch assuming that the
notch would be the same saw I would hope
to god it would be the same size or
smaller if they had it then what's on
the iPhone 10 because he would be way
less noticeable I I mean I would think
but I don't know I think it'd be really
interesting I think it would be a gutsy
move for Apple to do the knife own 10
style iPad yeah just just for the
engineering standpoint of an
accomplishment of doing that I think it
would be really cool I think I think
they'd sell more iPads that way I think
just because of having that and the
novelty of it it would be a combination
of like Liam Daisy that returns like the
disassembly robots they have for
recycling parts inside and also just a
like a huge middle finger like that
would be the combination of those it'd
be wow that is so intricate and so the
beautiful too elegant and yet why did
you do this yeah you know it's yeah it's
it's interesting I think I think well I
think it would be just it'd be
interesting and it would breathe new
life into the hardware side for them
just because they're there iPads have
pretty much I mean they've kept the same
design for their iPads since what almost
since the air essentially since the air
am I correct
yeah like minor changes and thickness
and whatnot so I you know I kind of like
to see it just I mean I'm definitely
afraid of how much they would price it
at but it would probably just be a pro
that would do that which that's okay
that's something I wouldn't mind so much
cuz the iPad pro is kind of a luxury
device in way I would feel like of the
of the Apple tablet selection so yeah
yeah I don't know I think it'd be cool
and finally we have a watch iOS 5 a few
of the improvements we have there a
walkie talkie just being able to
communicate between Apple watches
through either Wi-Fi cellular you also
have a fancy reactions going on and
interactive notifications so that you
can
if someone's sending you a notification
to be get paid through Apple pay then
you just tap it and already paid so
that's great and then a bunch of the
Fitness features such as competition
making sure that you get this money I
don't know how the point system works
and what it converts to in terms of the
Canadian dollar but I'm sure it's worth
something well and one the one thing
that they that they were talking about
the automatic workout detection I mean
that's cool in theory I mean they're
they have that on the Samsung gear s 3
frontier and every time I'm at work and
I play foosball
it's like dynamic workout you know I'm
like this is I feel terrible if this is
what it's counting is my exercise
because most of my exercise is very good
cardio don't you under no I made cardio
Mike most of my cardio is sucking in my
gut 24/7 so but yeah it's well I mean it
we'll see how it works I'd lie I mean if
anyone's gonna pull it off I think Apple
could could pull off just it working
pretty well kinda like the same way that
they pull off a little bit better the
like what was it like raising up your
your watch and having it turn on
compared to turn on Siri yeah yeah you
can talk to it yeah yeah there's I mean
the sad thing is Siri is still better
than a space so that's good it's the sad
sad truth but hey I mean what can you do
better my main thing about this is that
it's not watch OS 5 will not apply to
the original Apple watches that watch or
Apple watch and out watch edition and
yet it will apply to the Apple watch
series one which is you know you would
say in what the heck's going on with
that well technically it has the same
specs as all those other watches that I
just mentioned but it came out as just a
one model and it was and during the
Apple watch series two introduction so
yeah cares about that and also you
talked about just working iOS just a
second ago about keeping all of your
support
it's intact Rio as 12 and yeah you
freaking just let go of your throat
stopwatch holders what just three years
after you freaking on it and it makes me
wonder if it's just a move to get them
to get people who bought the first Apple
watch onto the newer version I mean that
I can't really think of any other reason
to withhold it to the original Apple
watches unless they're Trish trying sir
I'm just trying to get them to get a
newer device that's kind of what it
feels like to me I think it should be
yeah I don't think it should be a
three-year turnover rate like that's not
it so it's a watch it hit a home watch I
we're still comparing it to like other
watches and you know it's not a phone
that you put in your pocket and it's
like a is more just by the it's form
factor and how you use it
it's yeah it's different i I kind of
gave some you know counterbalance to
that in my write-up on this news by
saying that well to be vertical and it
could be fair because the equipment the
heart the components have stopped being
upgraded vastly per generation so I
don't know yeah I mean here's the other
thing to looking at I guess where were
oh s I'm still is still trying to get
him I wrap my head around saying that's
an Evander to where like I mean at least
whenever the original moto 360 was in
the black because it had the OMAP
processor from the Galaxy Nexus in that
bang and so there are these instruments
yes and yeah they had the they had a
reason to stop this for on that one well
and like Sony stopped supporting their
SmartWatch and that there wasn't really
any reason except for they just didn't
want support anymore
because they was running that stamp Red
Room 400 so it's it's tough that's
that's what makes me think that it's
just pretty much a business move for
them as we as as and more many and
apples not the only manufacturer who's
guilty of this
but there you know they I mean many
manufacturers it's a common strategy to
try and push people to the newer devices
and I mean they didn't sell really that
many as am I in my incorrect I don't
know if I'm incorrectly destroyed
whereas in sold it way there was a well
are off second-placed oh yeah I'm
walking I'm even talking about just the
first generation Apple watches compared
to the second generation ones and think
I think yeah it definitely took another
years for them to really gain steam on
that but still it was it was still an
early kind of outperforming yeah yeah
it's I mean well it's now we'll see I'm
just I'm just glad that I waited to get
my mother an Apple watch until the
second generation now oh my gosh but
it's chance you're gonna give it time to
stew and and not be on the hook for your
mother's technical support from oh no no
no I already am you know I mean you
already have on your freaking laptops of
computing whatever but you don't need a
freaking Apple watch right right yeah I
want it's you know I went through I had
I had both the the first gen Moto 360
and I have an LG watch urbane and so
enzyme and I had a like that was the v10
so I'm like first year I'm tired of
first generation adoption you know yeah
that's just another lesson up basically
to our to our listeners just I would
recommend not going with the first gen
unless you're willing to live with these
risks I mean I'm Carlos says there's a
rule three generations and then well
perhaps you strike out or perhaps you
have you know hit a home run I don't
know I know yeah I'm more of the
adventurous type anyways so even with
like pre-orders for product I'm going to
be really trigger-happy on that return
policy if there's one yeah yeah there's
it's yeah well in its I've been more and
more and more and with Apple doing this
it's with their support at least on
their device on their phones I've been
more of a proponent for having people go
it's like to SWAPO or whatnot and seeing
if they can get it good
previous generation device and Apple's
one of the with the exception now the
Apple watch
Apple has generally been that one of the
better ones to do that for just because
of software support yeah and and I just
wish I hope that we don't see more of
these sorts of moves from them in the
future
also I have another thing I wondered too
is do they do the same sort of
throttling with the Apple watch that
they did with the iPhone because those
batteries are even smaller and more
tightly packed in and I'm selling used
with Series three as well so I mean
that's I think they held out it was
reported that they held out on including
cellular for series two because of
battery issues but again that's
something that more analytical more like
a non tech or whatever would have to
look into and really be able to do that
on nail down so yeah until that you know
yeah well I guess we'll see it's it's
interesting to see I'm just you know I'm
just glad that it's nice to see these
new these new features being brought in
even if there are some a lot of them are
catching up to what other one they're
doing it's nice that everyone are
getting the features and those features
becoming mainstream and it's nice that
everyone is tuning in to our stream to
learn more about these features and yeah
