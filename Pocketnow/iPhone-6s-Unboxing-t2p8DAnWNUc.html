new iPhone season and even though we're
in the off year of the upgrade cycle and
didn't see any major redesign this year
Apple's new every man's phone could
still be a great success
sorry look we've got the new iPhone and
the first step in reviewing any smart
phone is taking it out of the retail
packaging so let's do that
I'm hi out to Houston of the pocket now
and let's unbox the iPhone 6s just like
the phone itself not much has changed on
the retail box since last year it's the
same compact white packaging for every
model but this year Apple returned to
showing you which phone you got right on
the front a decision I'm definitely glad
they made on the back you'll find a
vague list of supported networks but in
typical Apple fashion you'll have to do
some online research for a more
comprehensive spec sheet but hey you're
not here to look at the box so let's
open it up and get to the more important
things just like every other year and
every other iPhone inside you get some
paperwork including Apple stickers and a
health and safety manual but still no
sim removal tool so come prepared
there's also Apple's ear pod headphones
and the standard wall wart and lightning
connector for charging and data sync but
the key word there is standard no quick
charging here on to the main attraction
the phone itself looks remarkably like
the iPhone 6 before it in fact about the
only physical difference is the S logo
and blazoned on the back to let your
friends know that you're packing the
latest tech even if it isn't in that
sweet rose gold finish we won't go too
in-depth just yet with the differences
between this and the iPhone 6 that'll
have to wait for a full comparison but a
few quick things of note the rear camera
receives a bump from 8 to 12 megapixels
and the front camera makes a bigger jump
up to 5 megapixels it makes a huge
difference in detail
the 6s is also the slightest bit thicker
and heavier than last year's model and
if you know to look for it you will
notice the difference
but it's not substantial enough that
anybody should really mind and some
people might actually like the added
heft I think I might and of course the
big new feature that everybody's talking
about is 3d touch and it's one of the
main focus points we'll be looking at
and
full review once it's ready that review
is gonna go live here on our YouTube
channel and also at pocketnow.com so be
sure you're subscribed and bookmarked
and all that jazz so you don't miss it
you can also hit us up on social media
or at PocketNow everywhere and i'm hi a
human on twitter and IRL thanks for
watching everybody and we'll see you
again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
