a leak scandal we get more details on
the Oppo find 7 and it's 2k display and
LG has begun to prepare its wearable
technology one more time I'm primary
vera and this Friday comes to an end
just meditate and think about how wasted
you'll be by tomorrow this is barking
out daily
the sources off with some official news
as we get more details on the Oppo find
7 which will bring us a 2k display and
for those of you don't know what the
resolution will be that's 2560 x 1440
which at 5.5 inches is around 538 pixels
per inch that is a crazy amount of
pixels per inch ill probly i don't know
we're gonna call pixels eventually once
we can't really see them anymore but
anyway stay tuned that's the only thing
we don't have is a date for when you can
pick it up now let's talk about LG as I
know a lot of you have barely unbox your
LG g2 and we're already talking about
the g3 which apparently will be launched
at mwc just a couple of months from now
and well apparently you're getting a
fingerprint scanner aside from a 2k
display as well so we'll keep you posted
on that really interesting and aside
from that apparently LG is also working
on their wearable technology which
obviously means a SmartWatch and for
those of you that don't know we already
reviewed an LG Smart Watch like five
years ago and it was terrible so let's
see how that goes now an interesting
twist is that apparently Samsung is
already working on their sequel for the
galaxy Cameron the reason for this space
is because I thought that was the galaxy
and next to the galaxy s4 zoom but
apparently no apparently they want to
bring us another camera and the others
have already flopped as well I don't
know what Samsung is planning hopefully
they will bring better sensors but our
details links in the description for
details on this and hopefully we will be
seeing this either at CES from the musi
and speaking of samsung apparently we
will be getting more than one pro device
that 12.2 inch Galaxy Note whatever
they're going to call that Bank pro is
not going to be alone apparently we
already have an 8.4 inch galaxy tab at
the FCC and yeah I have a sad face for
the tap thing because I do prefer the
whole note ecosystem but anyways we just
don't know exactly when we'll get it if
it's already at the FCC we could
probably be seeing it by CES will stay
tuned for that and finally for the
dramatic news of the day we do know that
HTC has done a fabulous job in keeping
their devices a secret this year but we
do know that last year in the year
before it was in the same case so we
talked about it on yesterday's video as
it turns out there in dining their ex VP
of design because apparently he was the
guy that was leaking the phones and
that's really interesting because it
obviously did hinder HTC strategy
dramatically but anyways that leads me
to the question of the day
how importance are links for you in the
case of helping you decide what's next
for your purchase because obviously my
particular case leaks are very important
to me that doesn't Shelly just for the
show but obviously because it helps me
decide if I should buy a phone now or
wait for whatever link i find
interesting but leave us a comment down
below what's your case and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is still
mushy follow us on PocketNow comment
