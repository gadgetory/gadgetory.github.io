Michael behind the camera we are here in
Vegas at CES the Sony booth and we are
checking out the Sony Xperia z1 compact
so if you might have seen this period z1
review if you have not I encourage you
to check it out a pocket now as well as
in YouTube this is its compact version
as you can see it's rather compact bone
but the internals are worthy of the
Xperia z1 which is the fraction for Sony
that means we have the same Snapdragon
800 processor which is a speedy
processor 2 days of RAM we have the same
20.7 megapixel camera on the back which
in our review you will see that the
generative mixed results but we'll have
to test this one out for ourselves and
it has the battery of 2300 million
powers which is the biggest in its
category as you can see it's a phone
which come on the large phones of today
can be called a smallish phone
so about the only big difference between
this and the z1 is the screen size we
had a 4.3 inch phone which by today's
standards is a small display but believe
me it is a good size for pocket ability
and in hand feel is that a 720p display
with triluminos technology just like on
the z1 and of course Sony ships with
their screen protector on board side
visibility I'm very happy to report that
it's more improved than on the z1 which
was also much more improved over the Z
just like its bigger brother the z1 the
z1 compact is also a waterproof phone
and we got one flap here to cover up the
USB port but else the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack is treated just the same
way the one on the z1 is so you can have
one flap less now in terms of software
we are seeing the same sony UI which
we've seen on the
one running on top of Android 4.3 ever
go well and as you can see it's rather
fluid because the standard in 800 is
doing an awesome awesome job at keeping
up with desks it's basically the same
experience which you have gotten on the
Xperia z1 which we reviewed again I
encourage you to see it again and we'll
be back with some more coverage on the
z1 compact maybe some comparisons in
future videos so stay tuned for more
thank you very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
