people to listen to get on we're placing
very nicely on zune yeah we're on we're
pretty high on zune where we we're in
the top what watering top 20 I just let
me check one second and we'll take one
second I think we are poor higher this
is podcasts who you can find this under
Science and Technology audio podcasts
and gadgets and we can sort by most
subscribed and it's 349
12 wow that's the filth that's great and
in that particular category though right
yes hey we're still 12 doesn't matter
all right well let's get started a good
amount to talk about this week not a
tremendous amount to talk about but some
pretty big developments we're going to
start off by talking about the white
iphone which finally finally came out
it's very funny because well first of
all have you guys actually seen a white
iphone yet nope only in pictures hmm
well I am as at the king of prussia mall
which is around here they have an apple
store and they had white iphone set up
and my fiance got really angry when I
went inside because she knew what was
going to happen and I was in there for
like 10 minutes playing with the white
iphone and I mean it's it's what you
expect it's getting a lot of attention
in fact there are there was kind of a
line outside of the store people trying
to buy it the issue with the iphone 4
white is that it's apparently a little
tiny bit thicker than the black iphone
and pictures are showing this very well
unless these pictures are being
fabricated but they have no idea why
someone would do that then Phil Philip
Schiller of Apple comes out and says
it's not thicker don't believe all the
junk that you read which is very
confusing because it's not really things
we're reading it's what we're seeing why
do you guys think that the iphone 4
white is is thicker well there are two
sides of the story here as with any
story at least two sides first of all
it's the color I've been a let's say
fatter guy when I was young and people
told me to wear always black because
blacks makes you look thinner and whites
makes you look better so first of all
it's the color maybe it's an optical
illusion number two the perspective and
the angle these pictures are taken my
one might argue that the white iphone is
closer to the optics than the other one
now if I measure the calipers they'll
have it bad yeah that's where I'm
getting they actually measured it and
it's actually points 2 millimeter
thicker now I've read an article
recently that said that somebody had a
white iphone which measured exactly like
the black iphone and somebody had a
black iphone which was actually thicker
than the advertised so it might all
depend on what batch you are using or
owning and it might also depend on which
part of the iphone you are measuring
because i've also read that if you
measure the top it will give you
different results than the bottom so
mixed thoughts here Wow inconsistent
well I will say that if it is thicker
it's probably because the then you need
to put more layers of you know photo
resistant material to keep the to keep
the sensors from going wonky yeah and
that probably why it was delayed in the
first place because I had to figure out
how to have a white coating and have the
sensors don't work that and also I know
that there's been some rethinking of the
camera and of the proximity sensor which
could have added that certain point two
millimeters in thickness true and
another consideration is that they
wanted to make these changes to the
proximity sensor into the camera and
they really didn't have an opportunity
to do so with the black iphone 4 they
didn't want to change the manufacturing
process but the manufacturing process
for the white iphone was still up in the
air for many many months and they said
why don't we just roll these new changes
into the white iphone 4 it might delay
the release a little bit more but people
already have the iphone 4 black and they
should be happy do you guys think we are
facing some fragmentation X
accessory-wise I mean we have verizon
iphone we have AT&amp;amp;T iphone we have black
iphone we have white iphone so if
somebody goes out to buy a case should
they be attentive or careful for what
kind of iphone they are buying the case
for sure but I mean anyone who goes out
and buys a case has to do that you know
if you're an Android owner and you have
a captivate you have to make sure you're
not buying a vibrant or an epic case or
whatever and and you know I think maybe
that that iphone owners were privileged
up and turn around that they didn't
really have to pay too much attention
but as the phone gets more popular you
know they're going to have to do the
same thing else
does hmm and and you know point two
millimeters is like two pieces of hair
side by side so yeah a case might be a
little bit tight but it's not really
going to totally change the experience
and you're not going to return a case
that is made for one slightly thicker
device absolutely it's negligible but
why just why can't Apple just say okay
guys really it's thicker so what's the
big deal they are sending us to
ophthalmologists for those points you in
denying it's just crazy hey something
exciting may have just happened got a
email from AT&amp;amp;T public relations boo
there's a samsung AT&amp;amp;T event May 5th in
New York and I might actually go that
that's funny am i smelling some galaxy
s2 yeah is that what you guys think it
is I would say yeah yeah definitely that
was my guess um let me just make sure
Steven is says this is real-time news as
it happens folks behind the curtain yeah
awesome well yeah I better get a train
ticket anyway all right so yeah so
galaxy s2 possibly coming to eighteen t
which would be exciting we're going to
talk about 80 later in the podcast you
know what's coming up some more angry
ranting from as usual but this time this
time I have a really good reason I mean
previously I was just you know it's all
it's kind of stupid but alright so let's
move on in the last podcast dan webster
and i were talking about flip phones and
how there are no smartphone flip phones
except for a couple of blackberry
devices and we we looked back to the HTC
star trek to the motorola MPX 220 and
that was really the last time we had a
flip phone so we made a poll in pocket
now to see what you guys think and
question was would you buy smartphone
flip phone 2answers yes i love that form
factor or no i don't need to be wrapped
reminded of
razor 71 percent said I don't want to be
reminded of the razor so I guess I rest
my case it turns out people don't want a
smartphone flip after all yeah well I
think one thing is that it's going to
make it thicker you know especially if
you're only getting a keypad with with
the flip instead of a full 40 you know
it's not a good trade-off mmm so I mean
I'd rather have like a galaxy s2 that's
you know just a thin phone as opposed to
something that flips and it's going to
be twice as thick and the only thing I'm
getting out of it is a qwerty keep em
sorry a numeric keypad well I mean you
would have you would have an on-screen
keyboard and if it were weighted
properly that would be pretty
comfortable to use and if they if they
maximize the screen space you could
probably get a you know a 2.8 inch
screen out of it and then you have as
you say the numeric keypad which makes
it feel very very phone like you know
but what is a phone anymore you know a
phone is what what you make of it to me
a phone is that you know one of these uh
these slates hmm exactly what you're
saying Brian headset I good so I was
saying exactly that you were saying a
flip phone form factor will bring you a
maximum of what to point something
inches in diagonal for display and now
as Evan said people usually are used to
3.5 inches plus and having a flip phone
with a 3.5 inches plus display would
give you in flipped mode or in flipped
open mode a huge smartphone so I think
people don't want small screens and
that's why they don't want lick form
form factors yeah I mean has the
blackberry style really taken off I
would say close mm-hmm which blackberry
has taken off recently you know people
still get the the bold the flagship the
9780 um I wouldn't say the torches been
a huge success with a storm but the
curve and the boulder I think are still
pretty solid sellers yeah yeah oh well
alright let us move on so the next thing
we are talking about is adw.launcher to
beta we posted a walkthrough video or
Joe posted a walkthrough video and we're
starting to see a really interesting
trend with these next generation
launchers of course there's a lot of
launchers out there like ADW launcher
pro I'm a big fan of launcher pro and
what we're seeing is that when you tap
and hold on an icon whether it's in the
app tray or on the home screen you get
things like edit application info market
share this makes so much sense i mean in
currently an android 2.3 if you tap on
an icon it just opens you can't action
on it so i really like this trend and i
really hope that the next version of
android sort of inherits this feature
where you get a lot more information by
just tapping and holding on any any icon
you see now the thing is with these
third-party launchers is again two-sided
as anything with me its first of all
it's about customization allows you to
have whatever you want how many widgets
and icons and screens you want it's just
it just comes with the google experience
on the downside i'm afraid that will
reach a point where we will get lost in
the details will we will see that the
trend going from simplicity to something
more complicated i want to launch
something when I tap an icon I don't
want to tap twice to learn something tap
once for for a menu and then tap again
for actioning on that menu so regardless
if we're talking about launcher pro ADW
launcher or HTC sense which i believe
it's the ultimate user interface for
Android it's all about customization and
the good thing is that people can have
whatever they want on their smartphones
but with the downside that in time we'll
get to a point where we will be lost in
the details hmm well I think there are
there's there's been getting lost in the
details and adding features that truly
make the experience better for example
right now on android if you want to
remove a program even if there's a nice
big icon it's not big but whatever the
dimensions are on your home screen you
have to go to the settings to
applications and whatever the other
option is then you have to go to all
applications you've got a tap on it you
gotta click uninstall so why not you
know remove that that that flow a little
bit and just make it a lot easier to
uninstall or manage apps from your home
screen that was at I was thinking
speaking of home screams I gotta say I'm
still loving the LG clock widget oh yeah
is it uh and thanks LG probably thank
them for for taking their intellectual
property and putting it on my motorola
phone you're using it on the droid x
uh-huh view guys remember on how many
phones was the HTC Sense running or the
sense clock because I remember we had it
also on desktop computers to the sense
clock on desk up yeah yeah I think we
also boasted about this I think a year
or so ago hmm i have to say especially
when i see sense blown up on the HTC
Flyer it's starting to look kind of
dated you know what I mean that I don't
think it translates well maybe it's just
to the to the tablet form factor but it
started to look a little bit cartoonish
yeah i agree i mean it it was copied so
many times and you know that it's time
to move on when it's no longer really
unique I mean LG has their version of
the weather clock and all these
third-party launchers have their version
of the weather clock and now it's time
to to get beyond that soon we'll have
the chops on the salsa which will bring
Facebook integration instead of whether
to the clock which will be of course
tremendously valuable just kidding well
let us move on next thing we are talking
about is the HTC double shot and i'm
assuming that that name is sort of
coffee in nature because they have
somewhere along the line they each to
see espresso right yeah you know it's
interesting you bring that up because
the the slide 3g the
touch slide 3g was its code name was
espresso so David from TmoNews his his
his theory is that you know this one is
supposed to be supposed to be you know
have pep cores that are twice as fast
1.2 gigahertz versus 600 megahertz so
that's why they're calling the double
shot because it's you know both a double
shot of espresso and it's twice as fast
as the models replacing that would be
hot and it's supposed to have a qwerty
keyboard are we thinking sliding or
candy bar um well it's got we know it
has a 480 x 800 pixel screen so i would
say it has to be sliding or you know
something where where you give enough
room for those pixels yeah and and
perhaps perhaps this could be the
keyboard version of the HTC Sensation
right or the HDR are at the evo 3d if it
has the dual sort of it it does have a
lower resolution cha thinking L wvg and
I mean it does seem like this is going
to be the first 3d handset with with a
physical keyboard which is kind of cool
because you know there's still some
people that don't want to give keyboards
up and those people deserve through the
image capture just like the rest of us
can you guys imagine how thick this
device would be I mean with the two
cameras at the back I mean two lenses
and the slide-out qwerty it can't be
thicker than the touch pro 2 right I
mean hmm who knows it's gonna you know
if it has the probably have a large
largest large-ish screen sent with large
ish screen 4.3 inches perhaps yeah so
yeah it's 3.7 isn't it I thought we had
that spec too I don't see that are you
looking at are you looking at the far
post with the point where we looked
through the wrong
yeah I am Oh actually no I'm looking in
a different post I was thinking always
since english is not my native tongue
i'm attempting to translate things
literally and when i first heard about
the double shot i had a discussion with
evan and we've exchanged some thoughts
and i was convinced that double shot
comes from when you take a picture what
you shoot a picture and double shot for
double shooting for dual cameras for 3d
and this was the whole idea in my head
that's definitely a possibility and I
stole your idea and one of my posts
actually oh I started the same thing
actually pretty minds think alike well
so the double shot could be a really
cool phone for tmobile it's got to be
significantly different than the
sensation 4g which of course coming to
t-mobile in the summer sort of the
device that I'm probably most looking
forward to this year but this one could
have a keyboard so they'll be fun for
those that still fightin words Oh with
these specs what would be the t-mobile
price tag I guess I guess 199 is a
maximum right see these LTE phones now
at 250 and 300 which ones at 300 I thank
isn't there something to 300 well I
don't know guys but with the 3d with
slide out qwerty with 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor it might go beyond
199 hopefully not I think 249 is
probably the limit unless there's some
dramatic new technology in it and who
knows maybe it could be you know the the
which tmobile phone bumped up to the
14.4 megabits per second data speeds
yeah the 3g Oh is the it was the LG g2x
so maybe you know t-mobile says that
they're going to be bumping their hspa+
speeds to like in the hundreds of
megabits per second so maybe this device
where if we're thinking that it's gonna
be priced much higher could could bring
in I don't know what's what's next after
14.4 it's they're already up to 2 21 and
42 but as far as I know Nina even if the
device was capable of faster speeds
t-mobile's not going past 42 for you
know over 12 months so this could be a
42 phone you can be interesting on paper
on paper right i mean even that they're
they're just you know china try to get
21 turned on in different markets yeah
somewhat of a lag there something we
forgot to talk about which was on the
agenda for today was the HP veer palm of
webos device picture for AT&amp;amp;T in white
and it's actually kind of kind of cute
you know the little little beer mmm that
is that is due out relatively soon it's
almost like it's like you could use it
as a second smartphone one you know like
a lot of people used to get you have
your your regular phone for the week and
then for the weekends you want something
smaller than shorts or whatever and you
know so you would get a small feature
phone but but maybe now you don't need
to get that feature phone you can just
buy the beer and you know switch your
SIM cards oh yeah I'm since it's that
small I like it because it's that cute
and no offense to anyone I'm looking at
it as a girl phone and instead of going
with anyone except half the population I
don't know really so it's it's an honest
thought it's a very cute phone I
wouldn't use it because I'm a more
bigger screen bigger device guy but
maybe they would have gone maybe they
could have gone with some more vivid
colors I don't know some some pink blue
green red you name it but you don't know
that this is just the one the one image
there there may be other Hughes that you
know we didn't see yet which was I think
it was the Motorola flip-out which came
with the different colored back panels
which battery covers which you get the
you could switch out according to your
mood
maybe they could do this with the viewer
to that'll be nice that would be cool or
or you know could come in black and
white orchid come in blue and pink and
red web Louis just doesn't really do it
for me right now I know that there's a
new version of the operating system
coming out but it's not going to be
dramatically different it's just it just
seems lacking comparatively to Android
and two windows phone 7 into iOS even so
let's see let's see how you feel after
you play with the pre 3 for a little
while well I mean it's going to feel
like the pre too but a little faster
higher resolution screen and then a
slightly advanced version of the
operating system so it's quite quite a
bit faster I'm from what we're we're
being told hmm hopefully it impresses
good well let us move on so an android
gingerbread 2.3 point for yes that is
two three four I'm just kind of funny is
going to bring sort of video chat and
there's already some leaked roms out
there you can install it I believe the
video chat has been extracted so you can
install it onto your non two point three
point four device and what it is is
basically google talk with chat
capability it's not native video chat
yet you know facetime like video chat
it's basically a built-in app that can
hook up with the with the video chat
that you can do on a desktop so it's not
the most interesting headline ever the
people seem to be pretty excited about
it it's basically it's safe to assume
that this google talk with video would
be something like Skype because it's it
allows you to video chat between clients
so it's not a normal call as you would
call a phone number and yeah we
demonstrated skype to skype calls from
pc or smartphone and i think google is
trying to catch up with the google talk
with video because skype will be out
there on verizon I don't
when but it will definitely be out there
and they need to do something and
putting this inside a stock version of
the platform might be a good idea
because nobody wants to install
applications if it's not necessary to I
won't install skype just to have a voice
chat with somebody if my gingerbread 2.3
point for smartphone has it natively so
it might be a smart move from google
good because if you want to do the
podcast i'm sorry the pocket cast on the
go you would need to be able to skype
from your phone yeah is it if only the
world could unite around face time which
is has not been sort of released as an
open standard despite the promise of
apple i think that i think this would be
a lot easier and we would stop seeing so
many competing video chat clients i mean
because that's one of the problems
you've got quick and skype and google
talk and maybe four or five different
ways to video chat on on on android i
could even leave live with that because
as it's the case with instant messaging
applications they are inter compatible
you can use yahoo to chat with somebody
on windows live and if they could
somehow make it that skype could chat to
FaceTime users and to google talk then
it wouldn't matter which application you
are using that would be cool some sort
of all in one program and and most of
these chat clients have some sort of
open standard yahoo does and aim does
google so if you're talking about purely
the you know the voice over IP
capabilities you would think that people
should be gathering around skype i mean
you know that that software certainly
has the most experience and in both you
know voice and an nvidia as opposed to
FaceTime which is you know just sort of
one division of apple yeah facetime
reminds me of a party time everything
reminds you a party time oh it's always
party time yeah anyhow let us move on
the Droid Bionic is not going to be out
for a while due to potentially 4G LTE
performance issues and then there's also
the matter of another similar maybe
better device coming out the targa which
we've seen pictures of and looks awesome
and so maybe to release the droid bionic
right now and then three Lyris the targa
in the near future would make the droid
bionic look really bad so maybe the
droid bionic could make a good mid-range
phone come this summer Evan what is your
take on on the droid bionic delay I
think I'm it's still going to be a hot
phone in a month or two I mean it at
this point and correct me if I'm wrong I
don't think we have any any dual-core
handsets that are that are that are
truly 4G meeting LTE or wimax that right
yeah you're you're right about that the
Thunderbolt single core and the stealth
is going to be single core and the LG
what is it called the revolution will be
singapore right and then if you go over
to sprint on the wimax I'd you know you
still only have a you know a handful of
evos and those were single core so and
g2 which is you know which is also
single core so so and that's on t-mobile
but dumb yeah I think I think the droid
bionic would still be a you know an
attractive phone even you know a couple
months down the line I mean if you're
looking on Verizon there's still no qhd
hints that as the case of quite a few
carriers at this point so yeah I think
you know the the resolution plus the the
processor speed unit you've got a real
winner there it's amazing that this was
first announced at CES and we're talking
about six six month lag exactly what I
wanted to say and I'm going to go a
little bit off topic here first of all
because I want to make a short
introduction and second because I don't
want to neglect windows phone 7 i've
been watching in an interview with the
stephen elop one of these days and he
said that the nokia is trying to reduce
the time between
announcing the smartphone and actually
launching it and this is something we've
been talking about I think two or three
or four podcasts ago and yeah and and in
this in these circumstances what
Motorola did with the droid bionic is
from my point of view unacceptable I
mean we saw the smartphone at the CES in
January and now five months later
motorola comes and says okay forget
everything you've seen you've heard and
you sensed regarding the droid bionic
it's still gonna launch but it's going
to be you know another smartphone with
some other case and some other internals
so I don't think it's a smart move to
show up one device and five months later
to not cancel it but you completely
rethink it and expect everybody to go
with this idea hmm yeah that's a that's
a good point I mean it's very easy for
enthusiasm to weighing when that when
the delay is more than two or three
months between announcement and release
I just thought of something guys
regarding this AT&amp;amp;T Samsung event that
we were talking about a few minutes ago
do you really think they're going to
announce a galaxy s2 version on ATT when
they've got the infused coming out soon
which is slowly it's a single core phone
right but it's yeah but I mean still it
doesn't have the you know the cachet of
the galaxy s name that's a that's a huge
seller for for both Samsung and AT&amp;amp;T and
no I I can't see I can't see any
scenario in which it's not going to hit
all four carriers there seems so similar
though and let's not forget that one one
month ago we ran a story with the some
trademarks we found for you for some
Samsung devices and we best ourselves
whether Samsung trademark the u.s.
galaxy-eyes bryant's or not and the
names were the galaxy attain the galaxy
function and the galaxy within and at
that time you remember evan right yeah
at that time we we started speculating
on which one
go to which carrier and I think if this
is about the galaxy s2 we'll find out in
a couple of days very interesting very
interesting I wish they'd give us more
notice for those that have to buy train
tickets how do you have the invitation
was it emailed to you Brianna yeah yeah
for that to me please yeah if I don't go
Adam will go he's a lot closer than I am
see okay or I can no no problem yes you
can take up a cloud our flight dental
Landon ear okay and we've got one more
thing to talk about it's going to be a
slightly shorter podcast than usual and
we're also going to take Twitter
questions in a moment so guess who
released the update for hsupa on the
Atrix 4G and the inspire 4G couldn't
tell what ya dead giveaway AT&amp;amp;T these
devices shipped without hsupa
capabilities so they're uploads were
were really limited to very low speeds
like 200 kilobits per second I'm
actually going to while i'm talking run
another test so we ran the test before
and after the difference was before the
test we got around 1.1 megabits per
second down in 300 kilobits per second
up after we applied the update we got
using a different application we got
download speeds of 3 megabits per second
which doesn't really make sense because
it's a it's an upload update and uploads
of about 1 megabits per second so a
multiplication of three for the uploads
so so why do we use a different program
to benchmark I'm just for reference and
perhaps that led to inconsistent results
i'm running the test on speedtest.net
right now and i'm getting about one
megabit per second down I've got full
bars by the way and here we go with the
upload speed I am getting ok what's
climbing pretty nice about 900 we're
going to one megabit per second so
point is here that this update did in
fact significantly increase the upload
speeds by a magnitude of about three
which is great the phone still doesn't
get on the hspa+ network or at least we
still haven't found it but hey this is
better than nothing that your HS your
inspire 4G your atrix 4g can be a little
bit faster now with this update so make
sure you're over Wi-Fi you can download
it over the air and it's quick and easy
back up your phone even though I would
never back up my phone before applying
an update like this why not I don't want
to take the time I think the chances of
something going wrong are very small and
I I'm impatient and I just want to put
the update through is this major units
so you're going from phone to phone
pretty quick you know you're not you
haven't had a phone for months and
months where you've collected all this
stuff on well I still like to sit you
know set things up so that they're you
know sort of customized but but yeah I
guess you're right it's not as big of a
pain but I think that have you guys ever
run an update over the air and had the
device sort of have problems oh no I
don't care about contacts and email
because I got my exchange it's not a
problem of setting it up and getting
everything in five minutes it's about
the applications and customizations
which I'm making and I wanted to ask you
is this update a radio rom update or
it's something just which tweaks the
existing operating system without
actually flashing anything I really
don't know what it is sure has to be
with the radio right should it should
have yeah and this is where I'm getting
if somewhere along the way I don't know
you're losing power you you drop
connection from USB to the the
smartphone if you're applying via the
computer or if your smartphone I don't
know loses power it could happen that
you might lose everything on your phone
that's besides breaking your phone or
getting it difficult sleee in the state
which in which it was so it's safe to
have a backup at least of your important
stuff
oh don't be like Brandon I think that's
the message here yeah very good all
right well let's move on to some Twitter
questions to wrap things up so Kimberly
ribba duel I really hate it she says
what free iPhone just follow the link
here and it's so funny because on
twitter if you mention us there are
these like Twitter bot swear if you
mention the word i phone you get spammed
so does yeah don't say iphone on Twitter
say like iphone without the e iPhone or
I fo any I don't know Paris Felicia asks
why our blackberries even considered as
smartphones laugh-out-loud wink smiley
face well that's actually a good
question because what do we qualify as a
smartphone what is our criterion for
that a portable computer that you know
has an operating system that you can run
applications on fair absolutely but I
mean Oh first when I thought of the
thing of the concept of smartphone I
really thought about blackberry because
for me a smartphone is a device which
allows me to grab my email on the go
surf the internet use GPS social
networking and so on and with library
system being so well in place and so
secure it was actually my thought when
thinking first of the concept smartphone
right yeah it's a it's a it can be a
somewhat subjective definition yeah we
try to keep it objective in saying that
you know an operating system that can
have apps and can browse the web so you
know that's why we try to limit it to
blackberry iphone android windows phone
webos next question is from the dead CPU
why is Samsung so much more expensive
than HTC newly released Samsung devices
are over a hundred dollars more
expensive and launched than HTC over
here I don't know where over here is but
that's a good question is is that even
true that that on launch samsung devices
are more expensive than HTC oh yeah but
swype contract
yeah off-contract unlocked I think he's
talking about mm-hmm why is toshiba more
expensive than a sir why is a BMW more
expensive than the volkswagen i mean
it's its first of all you have to pay
the price for the components and if you
take all the production aside there's
also the price which you have to pay for
the brand and the regardless if you're
talking about samsung or apple because
Apple has a large part of the price for
the apple logo on the product it's just
what a brand means and I think you have
to pay the bride-price for it it's not
to say that Samsung has a more valuable
brand an HTC or at least it's trying to
look that way that's true I mean Samsung
might be trying to shape perceptions
through their pricing which is not
uncommon I mean that didn't used to be
the case as I recall you know the HTC
phones like the the Titan to which is
the tilt and the Kaiser day I'm there
they were always the most expensive
unlocked phones on the market around
eight hundred dollars and as I recall
you know like the the Omnius of the day
weren't weren't quite as expensive it
was more than like the the six and seven
hundred dollar range yeah I mean it
sounds like Samsung's trying to position
themselves as the premium smartphone
brand and if you look at look at the
device like the galaxy s2 I mean the
demand for that is unbelievable and
there haven't been many if any carrier
announcements so the only way you can go
with that phone is to buy it unlocked
for like a thousand bucks or 800 or 900
dollars and they know that and they know
people are going to buy it at that price
it's not going to stay that high for a
while but you know at least at launch
let's get the galaxy s2 is a good
example is going to be very expensive
yeah those screens are probably not that
cheap relatively than the new the super
amoled plus well that's going to be nice
um to do all right great let's move on
to a couple of other questions this call
recording work on a galaxy s2 we don't
know that we should be getting a galaxy
s2 and this week for review so we'll
have that ants
a lot more um see what else we got here
due to do from slum dinger and it's
funny is the tmobile g2x oh good enough
good enough to switch to I don't really
inition the question do you want you to
X good enough to switch to to go out
with a bang before the inevitable merger
well I don't think that the merger is
going to make your g2x whether you buy
it now or later useless I mean it's
still going to work just as well as it
does today we really don't know if the
merger is going to happen if it will be
approved and we don't also know what
that what that means in terms of product
lines whether the g series will continue
or whether all android phones between
AT&amp;amp;T Mobile will be considered part of
the g series it's kind of too too early
to tell I have a feeling that you know
t-mobile as a brand just like it's
singular as a brand or I'm sorry 18 key
as a brand when when singular and 18t
merged it's it's going to go away
probably and 18 key will just end up
carrying more of a variety of phones but
they they probably won't be branded
under that the older t-mobile brands I i
agree with you and I think that's sort
of unfortunate you know AT&amp;amp;T is a you
know more than just a mobile phone
provider they are a telecommunications
company that provides phone service and
even TV and they're not going to they're
not going to kill the 18t wireless brand
it's going to be around t-mobile is
going to be the one if they choose to do
it to go away yeah AT&amp;amp;T the brand died
and it was resurrected yeah if you ever
try to look at a flowchart of 18t since
you know like the seventies when and
with them when it was broken up it's
just it's crazy how how different
companies are you know recursive and 18t
was then bought by one of the companies
that that broke off from it and it's
just nuts yeah
let's see moving on Dean is e74 said
when will windows phone seven support
dual-core processors animal verizon ever
get mom this is a continue button and
will verizon ever get windows 17 or are
they deliberately not supporting it
because they are not interested so on
and so forth well the Verizon Verizon is
getting the trophy we know that and
getting it very soon regarding the
dual-core processors on windows phone 7
microsoft hasn't made any announcements
that it will provide dual core support
but i guess that when news 17 is one of
the operating systems that would very
much benefit from multiple cores it it's
got a very fluid probably cpu intensive
up you know interface and so i think i
think dole course would help it a lot I
disagree and here is a point in which me
and Brendan continue to disagree because
windows phone 7 has a very minimalistic
let's say user interface the Metro UI is
is not a CPU or GPU eating you I and the
the applications the games which are on
Windows Phone 7 in its current shape are
taking very great or are taking good
advantage of the graphic acceleration on
windows phone 7 so i'm not sure that
there is a certain need for dual-core
processors on Windows Phone 7 s because
if you are using a windows phone 7 you
can see that after at least after the
node 0 update almost everything is is
instant now I'm I'm using an LG Optimus
7 which has nand memory but I'm guessing
that any other windows 47 with the
microSD memory as an extension memory is
acting at least let's say one or two
seconds the same and it's quite fast and
you don't have any lag when you play
games so I just wanted to say that this
is where something where me and Brandon
are disagreeing well don't you think
just for the sake of marketing even if
they don't need those dual-core
processors that they're going to need to
to put them in if windows phone 7 wants
to stay competitive
in a hardware capacity partly true but
partly not because from the way I see
things they brought on nokia just to
bring some even cheaper windows phone 7
smartphones and this is where they want
to gain market by delivering good
quality cheaper smartphones and going
dual-core will raise the price tag on
these yeah but at some point I mean
you're gonna be having these you know
companies like Samsung and Apple with
quad-core smartphones and then you know
how how attractive is a single core
windows what I'm gonna look I mean yes
if it's $39 it's going to be pretty darn
attractive and it's not like you will
board iOS 5 or 6 to windows phone seven
if your proprietary operating system
doesn't require higher end process here
in Cyprus that is just going to
sacrifice the higher middle end and just
make oh no I'm sure I'm sure they will
go do all course somewhere in time I
just don't think that there's a demand
or a need in the upcoming couple of
months maybe a year I don't know what
mango will bring and what will be after
mango but the way things are right now I
don't see a demand for the world course
have you guys ever had Greek yogurt
don't think so when I was in Greece but
does it make it a Greek yogurt they am
up topic you said nango I'm obsessed
with this Greek yogurt it's made by am I
think a fee nose or no some other
company but it's it's so good and
yesterday they had a mango fruit on the
bottom it's just delicious anyway Tony
what time are we at let's see if we can
take more questions that's 2 45 minutes
port on it I just maybe one or two this
is a question I don't really understand
maybe Tony you know he's talking about
its chaz 13 ends and can someone start a
petition to get a password timer on
windows phone 7 entering it every five
seconds is a pain in the arse well i
haven't used the best word lock on the
windows phone 7 but I think I know what
he's referring to and at the moment
there is no native way and I don't even
know if there's a homebrew way to do it
my best and the
broo greatest brightest thought is that
you have to live with it if you want to
best for protect your phone at the
moment in other words suck it up yeah
see well I think that will conclude the
13th Bar Mitzvah edition of the pocket
