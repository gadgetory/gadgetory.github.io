this video was it that obvious monster
hangover two minutes with 30 thanks for
the porn stack LOL and man you guys
don't miss a beat that's right it's that
time of the week i am hime every bit of
this is pocket now and this is the
parking out daily recap for last week so
on monday ask you what features would
you like for the apple stylist that's
being rumored to include as the rumors
are that the companies where you on a
standalone stylist we've been talking
about that for weeks we have four and 33
comments out of which era says steve
jobs 2007 stylist oh yuk Tim Cook 2015
behold the smartest and the first stylus
on a tablet be pleased Fu Apple um you
know it would be the first time that
Apple just completely goes back on its
word what are we back to the palm days
now I don't want to stylus my
handwriting sucks I don't know how to
draw art and I have to the stain that
experienced anything that goes faster
then you use a stylus um yeah my
handwriting sucks as well I can draw but
I do get your point not everybody wants
it and that's the reason why it would be
cool if it was optional roshan says the
start is as good as long as it fits
inside the body of display which could
be a smartphone or tablet but carrying a
separate accessory would be very
inconvenient no matter how useful it may
be okay you do have a point but here's
the thing the rumors are that this ayah
post eyeless I pen or whatever it's
going to be called is actually wanting
to replace your pen and can also become
a stylus but not necessarily just a
stylist it'll work on a whiteboard it'll
work on a piece of paper it'll work on
your tablet and that's probably the
reason why it's cool because most of us
do carry a pen around and that's the
purpose of this product it seems then on
Tuesday I asked you what features would
you want microsoft to bring to Windows
10 for mobile as the event was happening
the next day which was what weeks ago we
have one in 91 comments out of which
rain says actually almost nothing is
wrong with Windows Phone I just really
hope they could keep up with Android and
iOS applications and I guess we all
agree with that definitely yes and Tyler
em says Android Play Store on window
a key bush another commoner says Windows
Phone 10 for me should allow me to
stream games on my Windows PC like Sony
wants to try to sheet with the ps4
xperia phone that's actually going to
sort of happen but obviously that
happened until after the event and your
common was they before so we do
understand your point and yes definitely
a cool feature indeed then on ones they
asked you what was your favorite
Microsoft announcement because yes we
had with those 10 we have the hololens
we had a lot of products at this event
we have ordered comments out of which
dark black 22 says windows 10 being free
that's my favorite I was like oh my god
yes and I told all my friends about it
at that minute uh yeah it is cool uh
what took them so long Nura clang says
obviously being able to effing play
minecraft or 3d printing from goggles is
wild in my mind hope the production
model doesn't suck or never work um but
yeah that's gonna be the deal if they
can pull it off it'll be amazing it's
just really hard to believe but hey
hopefully they can and shama fox says I
think that the windows 10 upgrade being
free is over rated it should be standard
but i think the hollow mixed with
reality products are the future and how
we should interact with our surroundings
i do agree that it's overrated but i
don't agree in the fact that Microsoft
is only a software company they only
began selling computer to a couple of
years ago so I it makes sense for them
to make money out of the things that
they do and then again with the case of
the hollow lens it is cool it'll just be
gimmicky until they figure it out but
that's again my opinion then on Thursday
ask you what would be the perfect
battery life for a SmartWatch for you as
the rumors are that the apple watch will
not be surprising any consumer we have
665 comments out of which David Kaplan
says who the hell cares about smart
watch battery life everyone charges
their phones and tablets every day so
what is the big deal just charging
overnight with everything else not like
you'll be using it while you're asleep
anyways um yes and no if you have a
Fitbit it's got you know sleeping
features that work you would like to
carry your watch everywhere you know
some people like to shower with their
watches some people
do sleep with their watches so yeah this
would change the behavior pattern of a
user one to imagine yourself traveling
overnight or for example having to you
know take a red-eye flight or stuff like
that hey your SmartWatch is going to die
during that night and you won't be able
to use it for you know the rest of your
traveling so it can be complicated but I
do get your point and the week says
everyone is holding back on buying a new
SmartWatch because of three reasons
number one first generation product
number two battery life and number three
no extraordinary use I'm not gonna even
had anything to that that's the perfect
comment those are the reasons yes thank
you and Josh new says the Apple watch is
useless with that much battery life in
the huge price tag I would like it if
the battery would give me at least eight
hours of screen on time and I would have
to charge it once every two days uh yeah
for you every two days for me it would
have to be a week i'm in friday i asked
you what would you ask you will to bring
you as a service provider if they ever
be hey man I'm Leah know as the rumors
are that the company is already striking
deals with sprint and t-mobile to
provide the service we have 387 comments
out of which one of them says google has
the best services in most areas of
business and products are very
reasonable priced yeah I could agree
with that true then ASD 5515 says
there's a problem with google becoming a
carrier privacy whatever you say I don't
trust them and I use their services
anyways and I'll ask you this what
guarantees that the current carriers
aren't doing it also and tim says I hope
Google gets into the cellular business
because competition breeds benefits for
the consumer I do agree with that the
United States has got some terrible for
example prepaid plans are terrible in
the United States some of the contracts
are just crazy what you're paying and
then I live in a third world country we
pay half as much as you do for the same
phone you're using even though we have
the same down payment but our services
are much less expensive and that's the
case for a lot of countries the United
States is definitely too expensive and
then you have something like Google
Fiber showing companies cable companies
how it's done so I feel that Google
could do a really good job at this and
definitely you know bridge the gap
between extreme prices and the fact that
you can have the technology and that
it's affordable too
you I feel that that would be a good
business proposition from google and
hopefully they figure it out that's it
for Pocket out daily recap thank you
