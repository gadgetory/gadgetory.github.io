action especially with hi May and one
doing I phone coverage alright so I
don't text too often but having google
introduced a low for Android and iOS
means that I get to play around with a
few advanced messaging features and even
though we're not exactly close to I
message territory there are a few nifty
features to this texting client first
off a disclaimer even though you're
putting your number into a low any texts
do you send to non-alloy users will be
sent from a virtual number so you've
either got some evangelizing to do or
you forfeit any fun from this app once
you do get into the app you get a few
treats like the chef and whisper feature
just hold on to that send button and
slide up and down to play with font size
and scribbling on your photos because
your imaginative and I'm not an artist
need otherwise say that aloe is pretty
vanilla but there are two core features
will concentrate on the first being
incognito mode chatting as you would
surmise it's encrypted hidden chat
messages can disappear if you want them
to and you can even choose how long they
stay up before all evidence of a message
being sent gets wiped away you can
manually delete messages too if their
time is come and quite importantly
anyway a message preview would usually
pop up say in a notification it won't
show up in incognito chats too bad you
can still screenshot though that needs a
fix them also needing a few fixes is the
preview edition of Google assistant it's
basically Google at your beckon hang
with in your conversation just with an
at mention and to a point it does what
Google promises to do search for things
as you need them businesses and
restaurants all come up in cards and
dots get placed on a map it's all the
works you can even talk to Google
assistant in a separate thread if you
need to it's really saving the hassle of
saying let me google that and crossing
apps to do so two things though well
we're on preview mode what is that you
can't share anything that Google knows
about you with someone else I can't
share deets about my flight to charlotte
with the person i'm spending time with
in charlotte also some of the last mile
third-party features like reserving a
table or buy movie tickets
directly from a low aren't working yet
we'll have to wait until open table and
Fandango link up to see how things work
with the bots and now we can say that it
works like most other texting apps we
hope more coverage on the way from
pocket now stay tuned at our site or on
socials I'm Jules wall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
