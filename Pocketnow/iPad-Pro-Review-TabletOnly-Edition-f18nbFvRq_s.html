out of character for the company who's
fabulous success is due largely to
conservative iteration just as the first
iPad was demeaned as an oversized iPhone
the iPad pro is easy to dismiss as just
an oversized iPad is Apple's newest
tablet big enough to get out of its own
shadow
i'm michael fisher with pocket now let's
find out in part one of our iPad pro
video review
a quick note on this video folks we
tested the Wi-Fi only iPad pro for five
days all by itself without the keyboard
dock and Apple pencil and we did that
because well one there backordered and
we're waiting for them to be delivered
but also because there are people out
there who will buy the iPad pro as a
standalone tablet whether it's to save
money or for some other reason now what
we want to find out here is whether that
purchase is worth it
let's talk hardware most people who buy
the iPad pro on its own are buying it
for one very big reason the display at
264 PPI the screen brings competitive
pixel density with color saturation and
brightness in line with what we've come
to expect from Apple plenty bright in
other words it's IPS LCD so the blacks
aren't as dark as what you'd get on
AMOLED but that's a small price to pay
for such a massive screen at nearly 13
inches everything from web browsing to
watching Netflix to plotting a course on
maps is just better with much more room
to spread out it's also well suited to
gaming and graphics heavy titles like
f-18 carrier landing become more
immersive while board games like SimCity
become much easier to manage or share
with a friend there's probably a market
for multiplayer board games on something
this big come to think of it of course a
big screen makes for a very big tablet
one that's stretching the definition of
portable here's where the oversized ipad
complaint has some teeth because while
it's all very pretty and high-end as
usual apple's decision to retain the
traditional placement of the control
elements makes it awkward to do things
like scan in with your thumb it's also
awkward to change the volume because the
buttons are way up there in the corner
you get the idea without its accessories
the ipad pro's size makes it sort of an
inelegant product which is strange now
it is still much thinner and lighter
than most notebooks but it's aluminum
construction means it's still pretty
hefty at 710 grams and it can't fit into
small bags as well as most other tablets
unlike the Microsoft Surface line
there's not even a built-in kickstand
here the result is a tablet that's
awkward in a lot of situations once you
do figure out a use position that works
for you though you're going to love the
iPad pros virtual keyboard Apple has
used the added space to toss in a
persistent number row the formatting
toggles for bold italic and underline
and other bonuses like dedicated undo
and redo keys it's even brought over a
3d touch feature from the iPhone instead
of force pressing which doesn't work
here drop two fingers on the keyboard
for precision cursor placement the added
width makes typos less common so Apple's
autocorrect is less likely to try to
step in with its ducking suggestions and
while most folks would still prefer a
physical solution for longer writing the
ipad pro's virtual keyboard is probably
the best we've used on a tablet it took
six generations to do it but Apple has
finally given the iPad a competitive
multi-screen experience with iOS 9 that
means if you're reading the local paper
in Safari you can swipe in from the
right edge to bring up a list of
compatible multi-screen apps tap the one
you want to dock it to the side of the
screen like competing solutions there
are limitations only split view apps can
be run simultaneously while slide over
apps are relegated to a more limited one
at a time implementation and right now
the number of compatible titles is
pretty slim but it is expected to grow
as developers build support into their
new and existing apps there's more smart
stuff here too that makes the iPad pro a
little more like a regular computer if
you start watching a movie in the videos
app and you press the home button you'll
find that the movie continues playing in
a small moveable window that hovers atop
whatever else you're doing this is
called picture-in-picture and while we
saw features like it on smartphones as
far back as 2012 it's got a lot more
room to spread out here Netflix and
YouTube support has yet to arrive but if
you're an iTunes user or you make a lot
of FaceTime calls it's pretty impressive
even in its current form
elsewhere ios9 works pretty much the
same there's the multitasking carousel
the control center with its system
toggles the Action Center now with two
columns the spotlight search lets you
search the whole tablet for a contact or
an app or jump right into a Google
search and the center of the experience
as always is that four by five grid of
icons and folders making up the home
screen just like every year we wish
Apple would have done something a bit
more creative here it's pretty dull
compared to what you can do with Android
and Windows you but in exchange you get
all the welcome improvements of iOS 9
along with its outstanding app ecosystem
we've been here before if you're taking
important photos with a tablet you're
doing it wrong it's not just that you
look like a goober though you do
it's that tablet cameras just aren't
very good and the iPad pro is no
different by and large photos taken with
the 8 megapixel iSight sensor are dull
with large amounts of grain and even
moderate lighting about the only thing
that's truly good for is scanning an
occasional document or showing a
FaceTime color what you're looking at
when you switch over from the 1.2
megapixel shooter on the front side we
were honestly surprised to see Apple
settle for a disappointing component
like this which is just so out of place
on a device that puts such emphasis on
being well pro that goes for performance
too to an extent the software experience
is usually pretty buttery thanks to the
new a9 X silicon and four gigs of RAM
but we were surprised to find quite a
few glitches here as well most prominent
that mysterious charging bug which
sometimes causes the iPad to become
unresponsive when it's plugged into a
charger it requires a soft restart stock
apps are also sometimes unstable the
first time we used picture-in-picture
it crashed the videos app and some
third-party titles seem to have trouble
in the switch iOS 9 as well
Spotify needed a quick update to get it
to stop crashing on startup and Evernote
kept hanging on our device when we tried
to update it via the App Store draining
our battery while getting nothing done
on the bright side there's plenty of
battery to drain the iPad pro lasts an
incredible amount of time
single charge starting with a full
charge on Friday night and limiting
ourselves to about half display
brightness we were able to get through
an entire weekend of words with friends
podcasts streaming internet browsing and
untold hours of SimCity before the iPad
finally gave up the ghost late on Sunday
night sure takes its sweet time charging
though the included 12 watt adapter is
only good for about half a percent per
minute this is a tablet you charge
overnight and finally there may not be a
beatsaudio sticker on this thing but it
sure does thump Apple has built in two
sets of stereo speakers at the corners
for a total of four drivers each with
its own volume chamber and they're
absolutely Bar None the best speakers
you will find on a tablet
the iPad pro comes in Wi-Fi and 4G
flavors with two storage options and
three color choices price starts at
$7.99 for the base model and climbs to
over $1000 for the LTE version with
maxed out storage that puts the iPad pro
in the same league as the MacBook Air
and at the higher trims it even gets
close to the base model MacBook Pro and
therein lies the problem if you're
spending much the same money why would
you get the iPad pro instead of
springing for a full computer especially
if you're buying it's solo for the great
speakers the huge touchscreen for the
awesome battery sure all good reasons
but given the limitations of iOS vs. OS
10 and the big bugs that have yet to be
squashed we think most Apple shoppers
would be better served either saving
their money on a normal iPad or seeking
the greater value of a MacBook we'll see
if this prediction comes true in part
two of our iPad pro review but it may
well turn out that in the case of the
iPad pro the accessories make the tablet
be sure to tune in for that review
follow-up folks and in the meantime
check out part 1 of the written iPad pro
review available at pocketnow.com and

time this has been michael fisher

you to keep your sims happy no matter
what device you do it on thanks for
watching everyone we'll see you next
