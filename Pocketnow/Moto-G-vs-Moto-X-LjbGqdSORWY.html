smartphones maybe they're making a lot
of waves but how do the two compare I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is the Motorola MOTO G versus the Moto X
the Moto exa moto G are both very
telling of Motorola's new direction a
centralized focus on user experience
over absurd in excess of specifications
naturally the two needed to be compared
we've already discovered what a pleasure
to use the Moto X is but with the Moto G
out there for a mind-blowing $200 or
less is the Moto X worth the extra cash
let's find out before we do we'd like to
give a shout out to our friends over at
clove supplying us with the Moto G for
review be sure to check out their site
if you'd like a moto G of your own
when we first took the moto G out of the
box we had to do a double take to make
sure clove sent us the right device
visually from the short distance the
Moto X a moto G are easy to mistake for
one another
they have the same general size and
shape with very similar designs both
have the rounded back the same button
camera flash and port placement and the
much-loved rear dimple your index finger
can't help but gravitate towards a few
minutes with both however and the
differences begin to pile up once in the
hand the additional heft of the Moto G
is unmistakable it's one point two
millimeters thicker and 13 grams heavier
than the Moto X you also begin to notice
the small differences such as the
speaker grilles the Moto X is rear
speaker which rests to the right of the
camera is an array of finally machined
drilled holes the Moto G's grille is
also machine drilled but the individual
holes are larger and they look cheaper
further on the front the cameras are on
opposing sides and the Moto G speaker
grille is notably larger and more
visible on the inside the differences
are even more abundant Moto X was never
one of the most impressive smartphones
on paper it's 4.7 inch 720p AMOLED
display bears a comparatively low
density beside other manufacturers
flagships the unique x8 mobile computing
system composed of a Snapdragon s4 pro
chip and two low power cores for
contextual computing is far from the
most powerful and the rest of its specs
are part of the same modest story two
gigabytes of RAM 16 or 32 gigabytes of
fixed storage a 10 megapixel clear pixel
camera and a 2200 milliamp hour battery
no matter how you look at it the Moto G
is a mid-range smartphone it comes with
a 4.5 inch 720p LCD panel 8 or 16
gigabytes of fixed storage one gigabyte
of RAM a 5 megapixel shooter Snapdragon
400 chipset and a 2070 milliamp hour
cell there are quite a few important
things missing from the Moto G's tool
belt as well NFC Wi-Fi AC and LTE are
among the most notable
the displays are undeniably the biggest
difference the Moto X is 4.7 inch panel
stretches from edge to edge touching the
trim on either side of the face the Moto
G's 4.5 inch display does not there's
roughly 1/8 inch margin on either side
of the display size is only half the
story though the Moto X uses an AMOLED
panel with the highest setting the Moto
G has an LCD display the difference is
immediately noticeable side by side the
LCD panel of the Moto G appears washed
out blacks are noticeably less inky and
whites are cooler whereas the AMOLED
panel airs on the warmer side but the
Moto G's color reproduction seems truer
to life
other minor difference the rear cover of
the Moto G is removable unfortunately
that doesn't mean the battery is
removable as noted by the notice battery
not user removable the only reason to
remove the back cover is to insert the
Micro SIM the Moto X is nano SIM tray is
found on the left edge for $500 you're
getting a higher quality product
customized to your liking with a better
display more solid in hand feel and a
more unique user experience for $200 or
less the quality of the Moto G is
impeccable and that price difference
makes these two devices very difficult
to compare directly
at the surface the motox of moto G look
like they might run the exact same
software and coming from the same firm
you would imagine they would be that's
not the case the Moto X is currently
running KitKat or Android version 4.4
our Moto G unit is running Android 4.3
the differences in those versions of
software are mostly minimal particularly
to anyone considering a $200 phone to
begin with for the time being the Moto G
has a legacy dialer not the newer dialer
with business search integrated it
doesn't come with the print
functionality built in and it's missing
the further enhancements for low-end
smartphones introduced in KitKat frankly
those are the least concerning of the
missing software features the Moto G is
missing all of the features which make
the Moto X unique such as trusted
devices active display touchless control
and NFC unlock through skip
there's a reason all of these features
are missing though skip requires NFC
something the Moto G does not have
touchless control relies on Motorola's
x8 mobile computing system also
something the Moto G does not have
active display makes use of the AMOLED
display on the Moto X for saving power
the Moto G has an LCD panel and the
pulsing display would burn a
considerable amount of power other
motorola specific software is included
however such as assist my great moto
care and motorola privacy and outside
those discrepancies these two devices
are running very near stock versions of
Android
the Moto X has more than one advantage
in performance and speed its CPU clock
speed is faster 1.7 gigahertz compared
to the Moto G's 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
CPU it also has double the RAM and a
more powerful GPU an average tasks such
as opening and switching apps the Moto X
is noticeably quicker and more smooth
the Moto G is rather easy to bar down
and the limitations of having only one
gigabyte of RAM begin to show after
switching between just a few
applications all things considered it
still performs exceptionally well and
its gaming performance isn't bad either
we experienced some framerate drops and
some graphic intensive games like
asphalt 8 but for all intents and
purposes the Moto G was not designed to
be a gaming or high-performance machine
it's aimed at the bare minimum user and
for that it's great fortunately the
difference in loudspeaker grille
appearance and location has little to do
with the quality while the Moto X is
speaker produces a little higher quality
sound with more low-end the Moto G's is
just as loud with more emphasis on mids
and highs at full volume the Moto G does
begin to distort some but for all the
listening you'll do for mobile these two
are very close in the sound Department
we've only had the Moto G for one day
now so we're not ready to draw any
conclusions on the stamina Department
just yet the Moto X is 2200 milliamp
hour battery
manages to last up to a full day of
usage though we often have to supplement
the charge mid-afternoon through our
testing today the Moto G has actually
drained comparably to the Moto X
to be fair the camera on the Moto X was
a pretty big disappointment the height
surrounding the clear pixel technology
was great but the 10 megapixel moto X
camera was anything but it produces
lifeless noisy artifact field images
which offer dual colors low contrast and
a serious lack of detail as such we
weren't expecting much from the shooter
on the Moto G which has half the
resolution and it's a good thing the
Moto G camera is horrendous in terrific
lighting the camera can take a decent
image but it suffers from all the same
problems the Moto X does low-light
performance is pretty bad on the Moto X
and much much worse on the Moto G
frankly if you care anything about image
quality your best bet is to look
elsewhere
so what can we make of these two modest
smartphones which are making serious
waves for starters they're not for
entirely different users like the
different price points would suggest
therefore that every man and woman those
who don't need anything excessive
massive or incredibly powerful both the
Moto X a Moto G are about user
experience and the for those who just
need something to get the job done
reliably the Moto G is simply for
someone on a tighter budget willing to
make a few more sacrifices the Moto X
for $300 more is a markedly more
well-rounded device with additional and
very useful features and a more polished
chassis deserving of the extra cash
