showing off the video camera
capabilities of the motorola droid razr
the thinnest smartphone to date now what
you can see here is not the stock
settings the stock settings on this
phone are 720p I've bumped that up to
the smartphone's maximum which is 1080p
I've also turned on image stabilization
to try and take some of the wiggles out
of the video it's relatively early in
the morning so I've got really good
lighting out here it is winter in utah
so I don't have an awful lot of color to
show you but so you can go really fast
around like that up and down overall
pretty good what I'm seeing here on the
screen looks very very nice it's crisp
it's clean the image is stable I'm
holding this about half an arm's length
away from from my face so you can get an
idea about what the the audio is going
to sound like on this overall I'm very
impressed now like I said these have
this is a little bit off of stock I
bumped it up to 1080p and I turned on
image stabilization in the settings so
if you want to see this kind of quality
out of your razor make sure you make
those changes as well also the still
camera defaults to six mega pixels wide
screen and the camera itself is capable
of eight megapixels total do some
close-up stuff so you can see autofocus
is trying to focus in on that let's do a
flower again because flowers have lots
of details lots of color contrast will
do another flower over here you can kind
of see how that is i'm about four inches
away taking it back to about six at this
point so overall pretty good here i'm
interested to see what this turns out
like again this is not going to be
edited at all just a straight upload to
YouTube
so you can see what videos that you
would shoot from your phone would look
and sound like let us know what you
think about it in the comments down
below if you like being able to shoot
1080p from a smartphone make sure you
give the video a thumbs up and subscribe
to our video channel so you don't miss
out on other droid razr videos for
pocket now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
