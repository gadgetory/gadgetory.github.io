one device that brings some crazy
features you really want to love and
just can't which means you'll end up
forgetting that they exist that for a
week
all the while realizing that the device
is just fine without them that's the
story of the LGG a thank you there's so
much I want to love about this phone and
that's really cool and none of that has
to do with the gimmicks I'm how you
matter II that I was pocket now and this
is our full review what interesting
thing about LG is that this company is
not afraid to stand way behind or far
ahead in certain trends and the LG G a
thinkyou is a clear example of that let
me start this video by telling you what
I like about this phone it starts with
the hardware since the g6 LG is good
about building glass tanks that feel
good and look good this devices milspec
810g certified and brings a stronger
Gorilla Glass 6 for peace of mind the
finish might look black at a glance but
the tone of blue that it picks up when
you shift it in an angle is really
elegant it continues with the internals
the g8 includes all the power the 2019
has to offer thanks to a Qualcomm
Snapdragon a 55 60 good bytes of ram 128
gigs of expandable storage a large 3500
milliamp power battery ip68 water and
dust resistance and wireless charging
and since we're talking power the
experience extends to the cameras LG was
the first to introduce a wide-angle
camera to its flagship and now four
generations later it keeps getting
better and better color reproduction is
fantastic with great saturation and
contrast and having the added
versatility of a more epic shot with the
wide-angle is so convenient I have to
say that I'm very impressed by the
updates the company has made to
low-light photography also know more of
the weird color shifting we saw before
and this even extends to the wide-angle
camera given the wider than average
aperture it pulls in light just as well
with almost zero barrel distortion the
company also claims improvements in
video which I do notice I find less
sharpening on the overall result there's
even a video bouquet mode that uses the
secondary sensor
to create a depth map for added realism
now one of my favorite changes with this
phone is the new selfie approach in
addition to an improved camera we now
have what LG dubs its Z camera which
means a time-of-flight sensor and an
infrared light this means far more
accurate selfie portraits much better
results and standard selfies overall and
even the video crop has gotten
significantly better more on the Z
camera later though last but not least I
also love how the company doesn't cheap
out on content consumption LG is still
one of the proud few that still includes
a headphone jack and adds a quad TAC for
a better audio experience match this
with a company's boombox speaker that
uses the entire phone's body as a
resonance chamber and you've got a lot
of punch when it comes to what the phone
can do while you place it on a table
thing is oddly content consumption is
that precise moment where I jump into
the reasons why I'm mixed about this
phone see once you pick the phone up
from the table audio isn't really what
I'd call stellar and that's mainly how
the average consumer consumes content
like a merger between the two that could
be because even if this phone has dual
firing speakers it does in a cool but
non-conventional manner now does there's
no earpiece over the knotch instead the
whole OLED vibrates to produce audio
this is really awesome for phone calls
because you can really hear everything
even in the noisiest environments but
sadly at the expense of not being loud
enough to assist the bottom firing
speaker and everything else and speaking
of the OLED yes LG finally brings an
OLED to the G line we're talking about a
6.1 inch panel at quad HD plus
resolution that's very color accurate
and sports HDR 10
yep the reason why I have it in the
mixed section is because it's not really
the brightest and then there's the user
interface I mean I love things like
having a dedicated Google assistant
button and having far-field
communication for the mics to hear you
even from afar my problem really is that
the UI is as old as the LG g4 if I'm
doing the math correctly with the
iconography looking dated and then
there's the design elements that just
don't make sense like trying to use the
pixel pill to swipe up for multitasking
and then the app tray which is wonky in
itself and then
requires a swipe to the left to the
right for the applications I mean when I
try to reinvent the wheel and not just
continue swiping up like stock Android
does now I won't complain about the UI
bogging down the phone though navigating
through menus is good and battery life
is also good as well about the only
thing I like about the user interfaces
the animated wallpapers that interact
with the lockscreen and I like the
always-on display in addition to how
notifications are invisible unless you
look at your phone which is something
that only iPhones and Huawei phones
could do before and this is the beauty
of the Zee camera the fact that this
phone has a very accurate secure
alternative to face ID but wait there's
more this phone has so many ways to
authenticate with the back fingerprint
scanner being just one of them
the Zee camera also has the option where
it can learn my vein pattern and unlock
my phone using my palm and really this
is where things start to get weird and
we start shifting into the things that I
don't like about this phone the Z camera
enables air gestures and yes they are
far more accurate than what we had with
the galaxy s4 many years ago the problem
is when the phone requires me to make
this crazy amount of steps just to get
it to work and when I have to shape my
hand as if I were controlling a puppet
for the sensor to understand that I'm
giving it a command it even requires a
specific distance and they're just so
much work that it just makes this whole
experience really cumbersome this is no
easier or better than just touching the
screen and getting things done and fun
you can give me the argument that that's
fine whenever the phone is on a table
and you can't touch it but sadly even
that experience is not ideal to conclude
what can I say about the LG G a thank
you if you were to forget about the
whole air gesture mess and just see this
phone as a regular smartphone this is
definitely a great device we have good
hardware a good design awesome content
consumption features and one of the most
versatile primary and selfie camera
combos in the industry I do wish that it
had a brighter display and Load Nova
Launcher as soon as you get it to avoid
this whole UI ms and you'll be fine now
if you were to remove the gimmicks I do
have to admit that it doesn't have many
things to differentiate it from other
flagships at this price point I
we'll admit that there are some better
options out there so just keep that in
mind whenever you decide to take the
plunge or not what about you what do you
think about the LGG a think you chime in
the comments and while you're at it make
sure you follow us on social media
