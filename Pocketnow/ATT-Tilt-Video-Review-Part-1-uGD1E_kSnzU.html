pocketnow.com and this is part 1 of the
video review of the AT&amp;amp;T tilt also known
as the 89 25 since it's got the camera
in the back there
so the tilt is pretty much the same as
the HTC Titan - there's some small
differences for example on the front
here these buttons are chrome whereas on
the Titan 2 they are a kind of a dull
metallic finish to it I'm assuming that
18t thinks that US consumers want to see
more shiny things on their devices and
that's probably true moving off to the
side here we have a push-to-talk button
on the left now I don't know anyone on
the AT&amp;amp;T network that uses push-to-talk
but they seem to be pushing it on more
and more phones so perhaps it'll be a
you know it'll be common commonly used
in the future I don't see a need for it
though to the right of that we've the
scroll wheel which I have found to have
a good scroll speed unlike some other
devices like the blackjack which has an
intolerably slow speed and you can't
adjust it but this is a this moves
pretty well to the right of that is the
ok button on the bottom we have mini USB
for listening to music with headphones
for charging and for syncing I wish they
would have included a standard headphone
jack but seems to be the trend into the
future one port for everything to the
right of that is the stylus it's a non
collapsible that's good and then we have
a camera button and a power button and I
missed over here the micro SD slots in a
kind of interesting place I've haven't
seen it on the bottom of the screen here
on any other windows mobile devices but
there it is flipping over to the back we
have the speaker grille 3 megapixel
camera pretty high for windows mobile
device actually I think the highest that
they offer these days and an external
GPS antenna port now I want to show you
the speed at which the screen rotates
it's been a complaint of mine that HTC
devices have slow screen rotation and
it's it's really annoying so so let's
see if the the tilt is any better so
hopefully you can see it here now there
it goes so I'm gonna flip it over
and let's try to get in focus that's a
little better okay so that was about one
and a half two seconds of studying yeah
it'sit's not that fast unfortunately and
I have I only have ActiveSync running
right now so it's not a matter of
program memory I don't know what it is a
matter of I just wish that these HTC
devices with screen rotation would would
have faster rotations and that concludes
part one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
