scheme there are obviously some
different benefits depending on which
phone you go for you can learn more

hands-on description as well now let's
talk about ZTE I've been a little
confused over the company's approach
with Nubia of the brand still belongs is
easy or what but as it turns out the
company has just announced their new red
magic smartphone and the reason why
we're covering this is because well this
is actually a gaming phone it includes a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 in addition to
other specifications I'm still looking

it is going to be a 1 + 6 infinity war
variant or Avengers variant or what the
case will be but let us know in the
comments do you think that it's a good
