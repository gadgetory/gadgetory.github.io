those interested in a better MVNO the
Samsung Galaxy s6 reportedly disappoints
in sales and the Apple watch sport
doesn't seem to be as durable as
expected
I'm hi I'm Eddie Rivera and the biggest
question is what else is left for Google
to take over the world
this is out daily the official
news today start with LG as the company
continues to tease the g4 I love this
about LG they are not out for rumors or
all this batch of nonsense no they tell
you what they're gonna launch and they
show you exactly how they're gonna do it
and there's this full teaser of the
whole leather process that's being used
for the back covers of the LG g4
interesting video in the links in the
description and disappointing news when
it comes to Samsung it seems that the
company has not been able to WoW its own
homeland it's been 10 days since the
product was launched and well they
predicted that they were gonna sell
300,000 units in that amount of time in
their country and they've only sold
200,000 units and that's probably not a
big deal so far but yeah that is a rocky
start for such a dramatic change in the
galaxy s6 could it be the lack of
expandable storage now let's talk about
Apple and particularly the rumors of the
iPhone Mini we've got trusted sources
that are claiming that Apple will leave
the iPhone mini project until 2016 and
the reason why is because apparently
Apple is selling too many iPhone 5s --is
for their own standards this is the
first time that the company sells
between three to five million units of
the older model and when compared to the
past then we don't blame them I mean the
iPhone 5s is a good device a lot of
people still want the one-handed
usability of the iPhone 5s and yeah
everybody hates the iPhone 5c so
apparently that's what's going to be
ditched for this year and then for next
year we'll see an iPhone Mini with
probably the iPhone 5s is internals we
never know and speaking of Apple let's
talk about the Apple watch as unbox
therapy just the filmed a little scratch
test that it performed on the display
that ion X display of the Apple watch
sport
remember this is the Apple watch that
sold the most by a significant amount
and yeah he tested it with knives and
with other products and it didn't
scratch but then when he started with
sandpaper that became an issue and for
many of you that's like yeah I'm not
gonna be sanding my watch all the time
well sandpaper mimics a concrete wall
best than anything else and it's very
common for people to strike their
watches on walls it happens to me all
the time
so this could probably not be good news
for the Apple watch particularly because
that display is not protected by
anything on the sides and comparison to
other smart watches let's see how that
goes
link to description watch the video and
finally for the hot news of the day
Google has just unveiled its nbno and
it's called Project Phi I'm not sure if
it's going to be called Project five
forever but yeah they've Despard nerd
with a Sprint and t-mobile you require a
Nexus device to test this out meaning a
nexus 6 and it's invite-only at the
moment link to the description for you
to sign up hopefully you get invited and
well the way this works is that the
phone will try to optimize whether your
Wi-Fi connection is better or whether a
carrier connection is better and yeah
you can hop between Sprint and t-mobile
depending on where you are which is
great interesting you paid $20 for
unlimited calls and limited text and
unlimited international text and there
are some prices for international
calling as well but you pay $10 for data
caps for per gigabyte but then again you
get that data back if you don't consume
it which that find that hard to believe
but it leads me to the question of the
day what do you think about Google's
project file would make you want to
switch from your carrier and take upon
Google service in my case I don't know
about the prices in the United States it
does seem very compelling to me
particularly mainly because Google
doesn't bring all the shackles that
you'll get with contracts on carriers
but it all depends on Google and we'll
see how that goes
