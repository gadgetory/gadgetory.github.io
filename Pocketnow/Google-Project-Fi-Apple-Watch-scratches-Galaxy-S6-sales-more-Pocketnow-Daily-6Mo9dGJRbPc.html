those interested in a better mvno the
samsung galaxy s6 reportedly disappoints
in sales and the Apple watch sport
doesn't seem to be as durable as
expected I'm hi Mary vera and the
biggest question is what else is left
for Google to take over the world this
is out daily the official new
suit i start with LG as the company
continues to tease the g4 i love this
about LG they are not out for rumors or
all this batch of nonsense though they
tell you what they're gonna launch and
they show you exactly how they're gonna
do it and there's this full teaser of
the whole leather process that's being
used for the back covers of the LG g4
interesting video in the links in the
description and disappointing news when
it comes to Samsung it seems that the
company has not been able to wow its own
homeland it's been 10 days since the
product was launched and well they
predicted that they were going to sell
300,000 units in that amount of time in
their country and they've only sold two
hundred thousand units and that's
probably not a big deal so far but yeah
that is a rocky start for such a
dramatic change in the galaxy s6 could
it be the lack of expandable storage now
stalk about Apple and particularly the
rumors of the iphone mini we've got
trusted sources that are claiming that
Apple will leave the iphone mini project
until 2016 and the reason why is because
apparently Apple is selling too many
iphone 5 s's for their own standards
this is the first time that the company
sells between three to five million
units of the older model and when
compared to the past then we don't blame
the money in the iPhone 5s is a good
device a lot of people still want the
one-handed usability of the iphone 5s
and yeah everybody hates the iphone 5c
so apparently that's what's going to be
ditched for this year and then for next
year we'll see an iphone mini with
probably the iPhone 5s is internals we
never know and speaking of Apple let's
talk about the Apple watch as
unboxtherapy just the film the little
scratch test that it performed on the
display that I on ex display of the
Apple watch sport
remember this is the Apple watch that
sold the most by a significant amount
and yeah he tested it with knives and
with other products and it didn't
scratch but then when he started with
sandpaper that became an issue and for
many of you that's like yeah I'm not
going to be sanding my watch all the
time well sandpaper mimics a concrete
wall best than anything else and it's
very common for people to strike their
watches on walls it happens to me all
the time so this could probably not be
good news for the Apple watch
particularly because that display is not
protected by anything on the sides and
comparison to other smartwatches let's
see how that goes link to the
description watch the video and finally
for the hot news of the day google has
just unveiled its NBD and oh and it's
called Project Phi I'm not sure if it's
going to be called Project 5 forever but
yeah they've dis partnered with a sprint
and tmobile you require a Nexus device
to test this out meaning a nexus 6 and
it's invite-only at the moment link to
the description for you to sign up
hopefully you get invited and well the
way this works is that the phone will
try to optimize whether your Wi-Fi
connection is better or whether a
carrier connection is better and yeah
you can hop between Sprint and t-mobile
depending on where you are which is
great interesting you paid twenty
dollars for unlimited calls and limited
texts and unlimited international text
and there are some prices for
international calling as well but you
pay ten dollars for data caps for per
gigabyte but then again you get that
data back if you don't consume it which
that find that hard to believe but it
leads me to the question of the day what
do you think about Google's Project fire
would make you want to switch from your
carrier and take upon Google service in
my case I don't know about the prices in
the United States it does seem very
compelling to me particularly mainly
because Google doesn't bring all the
shackles that you'll get with contracts
on carriers but it all depends on Google
and we'll see how that goes leave us a

think friends you know the drill if you
