waterproof improvements the LG g5 gets
leaked in photos but there's still
debate over some features an apple seems
to reign supreme when it comes to where
the money is spent in mobile I'm hi Mary
vera and whoever gets the best joke for
tomorrow's video will get the most likes
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with smartphone market
share spending for those of you
wondering which company makes the most
money it continues to be Apple it's been
the case for years and apple continues
now with 91% samsung is growing now with
fourteen percent but we're still trying
to get that number as there aren't any
percentages left for that to be you know
a true factor but still seems that
samsung is growing and then the rest of
the companies are barely making any
money rather odd is a statistic given
the fact that samsung sells a lot more
phones than Apple don't you thank you
now let's talk about mwc 2016 i am
leaving on thursday for barcelona and we
already get teasers from companies like
huawei which is a showing us that there
is a tablet in the works apparently it's
the make book which includes stylus
functionality and even though tablets
are a dying breed it's always great to
see that companies figure out smarter
ways to use them it's just historically
not necessarily worked we'll be covering
everything live and then when it comes
to unofficial teasers we've got a
website into by already showing us what
to expect for both the Galaxy s7 and the
LG g5 we've got full photos of the
devices and we already know what to
expect for the Galaxy s7 but the design
of the LG g5 is totally different to
what we've seen not necessarily better
it's gonna be hard I really like the
previous design that we had but hey
leave us a comment down below let us
know if you like this change for the g5
and speaking of the LG g5 there is much
debate over its features the photos that
we just saw weren't really good enough
to reveal what is included on the
display famous tipster Evan Blass is
claiming that there is a secondary
display but then we've got other sources
that claim it doesn't we just wonder if
the theory of the past of various
variants of the LG g5 will come to play
here probably there is one that includes
one and there is one that isn't we will
let you know who we're at the event
and finally a very hot news that they
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy s7 we
are debating over what features are
coming and we've got this very
interesting video from Indonesia that
shows as the Galaxy s7 being used when
raining which means that probably one of
the new features that's coming is that
waterproofing returns to the galaxy
lineup we saw it go away with the galaxy
s6 and some of us actually missed it and
it does lead me to the question of today
let's just say you just bought a galaxy
s6 or a galaxy s6 edge+ would you be
inclined to buy the galaxy s7 now and
figure out how to sell your old phone
just because of waterproofing in my case
I would I'd really do value that feature
believe is a comment down below we would
love to know your opinion and friends
