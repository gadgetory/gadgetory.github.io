viewer question this is actually a
question we've gotten a couple times in
regards to smartphone photography we
thought we'd make a video just to
address the issue and unfortunately
we're dealing with one of these
situations where we're talking about
something that's a feature and not a bug
so I got this tweet from a viewer who
writes does your 1+3 overexpose and blow
out areas not in focus when you tap to
focus to demonstrate this issue he
shares a picture of himself in bed I can
only assume that he's been kidnapped by
Kathy Bates misery style and he goes on
to have a conversation with a couple
other Twitter people who are all facing
the same issue on their 1+3
now this comes down to metering and
that's how a camera makes a decision as
to how bright or how dark a photo should
be when you tell it what's important for
you to capture specifically the 1+3 uses
spot metering and that means every time
you tap on the screen to focus you are
telling the camera this is the most
important thing that I want to capture
in this photo or video so I want you to
pull the focus onto this subject and I
also want you to make sure that this
item is properly exposed for now in the
past a number of smart phones used a
different style of metering usually some
kind of average where it didn't matter
where you focused the camera would try
and scan the entire shot and come up
with some sort of happy medium between
the brightest and the darkest areas of
your frame and a few phones used a
center weighted style of metering where
it didn't matter where you tapped on the
screen it would pull its exposure
information from the middle ish of your
frame and say well that was most
important oftentimes when you're
focusing on something you're trying to
focus on something in the middle of your
frame so we'll pull the lighting
information from there
there are certainly pros and cons to
different styles of metering but spot
metering has taken the lead of late
because again we're telling the camera
this is what I'm focusing on so this is
probably what's most important in the
shot of course if you're not expecting
it that change in exposure can cause
some confusion and it's most apt to rear
its head in really high contrast
situations if you're focusing on a
really bright subject with fairly dark
background conditions then you're going
to underexpose that background and vice
versa if you're focusing on a really
dark
object and there's sort of a brighter
area around it well then you're going to
blow out the rest of your photo so what
are some solutions we can point to to
help rein in some of these more extreme
exposure situations well on a number of
cameras we can adjust the exposure after
you tap to focus there might be a slider
where you can make the scene brighter or
darker in that moment the camera is
still basing its exposure off of where
you focus but then you can dial in some
finer adjustments of course you can
always shoot full manual dial in the
exact shutter speed and ISO that you
would want to capture the scene as you
see it and depending on your phone
HDR might be an option theoretically HDR
should take samples from the brightest
parts of your photo and samples from the
darkest parts of your photo and merge
them together for a happy balance of
lighting and color this is also a
perfect situation to look at raw capture
when you save a raw file from your phone
it's saving a lot more information in
brighter and darker areas of your frame
so you should be able to walk back some
overexposing or boost up some
underexposing to help balance out some
of those contrast issues lastly a few
phones will actually let you change the
metering options for your camera if you
don't want to use spot metering you can
sometimes shift over to a matrix average
or center-weighted style of metering
which again the camera is going to make
other lighting decisions for you not
related to where you tap for the focus
on your subject unfortunately for this
conversation specifically the oneplus 3
does not give you that option so folks I
hope this discussion has been able to
help illustrate and luminate what is
going on with your camera when you think
it might be making some wacky decisions
on lighting depending on where you tap
on the screen again we're talking about
a feature not a bug as always thanks so
