pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
review of the LG fathom on Verizon
Wireless let's take a look that is
mentioned in the unboxing this is going
to be one of the last windows mobile
devices to ever be released because
Windows Phone 7 is coming out in the
fall so if you're on the Verizon
Wireless you really have two choices if
you want to slide-out keyboard and I'm
going to show you the keyboard in a
minute and Windows Mobile you have this
and you also have the HTC Touch pro2
we're going to compare them a little bit
in a moment but first let's talk a
little bit about specifications the LG
fathom is running Windows Mobile 6 point
5 point 3 there haven't been that many
phones are released that have that point
3 Edition which means that it's more
tuned for finger friendliness and other
things as well it's running the qualcomm
snapdragon 1 gigahertz processor
compared to the HTC Touch pro2 as which
is running a 528 megahertz processor so
this device feels a little bit more
snappy than the touch pro2 I have to say
but it has less RAM only has 256
megabytes of RAM which really isn't that
much these days compared to the touch
pro2 which is 288 megabytes of RAM which
also isn't that much but the touch pro2
on Verizon came out a while ago and the
LG fathom is a brand new device it's got
a 3.2 inch resistive touch screen the
resolution is 800 down by 480 across and
the screen on the touch pro2
and I'll bring the AT&amp;amp;T version over
here is is significantly large with 3.6
inches diagonal same resolution 800 down
and 480 across it's got everything else
you would expect it's got bluetooth and
Wi-Fi it has no front facing camera but
it does have a camera on the back 3.2
megapixels no flash it has autofocus and
it takes video up to VGA resolution not
720p or anything like that it's got a
proximity sensor or light sensor and
accelerometer things you would expect
and it is a world phone it has a SIM
card slot so if you're traveling to
Europe and you have the right plan in
place you can use this phone overseas so
let's get to the hardware let's move
around the device so here we have a
status indicator
which will blink if you have a new email
we have this sort of brush memo look
which is a nice touch but it really
doesn't detract much from the kind of
brick mists of this device it looks like
a brick compared to the HTC Touch pro2
she has nice rounded edges it has a lot
of Chrome on it and it looks I think a
lot better than this LG fathom the
screen is flush obviously and it is
resistive so there is a stylus talk
about that in a minute so you can't do
multi-touch on here here are the buttons
down here we've call start and call and
it's always handy to have these buttons
a lot of phones these days are emitting
the coughs starting cloth end buttons
then we have a quick shortcut to the
Start menu in Windows Mobile here so
let's go over to the side with 3.5
millimeter headphone jack we have a
volume up and down rocker and here is
the charging port for the microUSB for
syncing and charging and they put a
little soft reset hole typical Windows
Mobile right here so you can access that
quickly without having to take off the
back battery cover going over to the
bottom we have nothing the lanyard loop
over here on this side we have a dual
action camera button which is quite
handy so you can press it down one time
to focus the camera and all the way to
take the picture over here we have a
programmable button it's nice to see
that over here we have the micro SD card
slot no memory expansion is included on
here just want to buy a card if you want
to have some storage then we have the
button up here to take it out of standby
on the back as I mentioned 3.2 megapixel
camera plus the speaker here if we take
off the back battery cover
it's the 1500 milliamp hour battery but
I mentioned it has a stylus and the cool
thing about the stylus that it's in a
really really good location most most
devices that have a stylus like the HTC
Touch pro2 but the stylus on the bottom
right or up here down here this device
the LG fathom puts the stylus right here
on the side so it's just super
convenient to take it out from here
unfortunately it's collapsible and you
can operate the screen like so yes the
Ilir a little bit out of style but it
still provides good handwriting
recognition and a lot of precision when
you're using it now one of the problems
with the stylus over here is that when
you have the keyboard out we'll talk
about the keyboard in a sec
this style is this kind of out of sight
it's behind the screen it takes a lot of
finagling to get to but fortunately
there are a lot of buttons on the
keyboard that make it so that you can
use the screen without touching the
screen let me tell you why
so we even a d-pad over here in an ok
button so you can navigate quickly
around on the screen with that and then
we have some shortcuts over here so we
can jump into email we can turn on
vibrate and some other things as well
over here is a back button and we also
get a way to quickly adjust volume so
again the side of us on the back not
that big of a deal you still have a lot
of ways to access the screen functions
without actually touching the screen so
this keyboard is a little bit annoying
and I'll tell you why it is a four row
keyboard so you get the letters at the
top you don't have to pull down a button
to type a letter like you would expect
on some devices with a QWERTY keyboard
but the letters are not staggered like
you'll find on the touch pro2 which
makes it very ergonomic they're very
much arranged in a grid which is kind of
annoying also hugely annoying is that
the period and the comma are stuck
behind the function key so the most two
commonly used characters you have to
press function every time to access it
it's incredibly annoying I'm sure if
you're getting this phone you'll get
used to it the keyboard feel is
generally nice save for the lack of
ergonomics they are slightly raised so
you get a little bit of a tactile
feedback its clicky cookie enough but
not too quickly so a generally good
keyboard once you get used to the kind
of awkwardness of it and the keys having
to and the punctuation being behind the
keys in terms of the in hand feel I'd
say that the in hand feel is much lower
quality than you'll find on the HTC
Touch pro2
in fact I'm really curious as to why
this device exists of you're on Verizon
you're looking for a good windows mobile
device with a slide-out keyboard you
can't beat the HTC Touch pro2
it has an incredible keyboard it has a
tilting screen it's fast and there's a
good battery life it has amazing hack
ability if you go over to XT developers
not sure why they came out with the
fathom it's kind of a refresh device you
get six point five point three on it but
there are a lot of compromise
it's a really ugly looking device in my
opinion the keyboards not as good you
don't yet enough RAM and as we're gonna
see in the software the software
offering is kind of weak there's really
not much work that LG did to the
interface so in terms of the hardware
I'm not terribly impressed you know I
like the location of the stylus I I like
the thought that went into making the
keyboard very easy to use without having
to touch the screen but I'm not that
impressed I'll be back soon with the
software review of the LG fathom on
Verizon and if you liked the video give
it a thumbs up that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
