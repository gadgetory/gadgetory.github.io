pocketnow.com today we're going to take
a look at some additional applications
on the verizon hub we'll take a look at
the phone application text messaging
verizon relay which is part of their
text messaging feature on the verizon
hub and the photo viewer application
which allows you to create photo albums
that can be displayed on the verizon hub
so let's take a look at the phone
application hit the phone so this is the
dial pad we can locate the handset if we
can't find it we've got an intercom
feature we can also do photo dial so you
can actually upload pictures of
individuals and this works through the
verizon wireless / hub website you can
see who's called you and you can call
them backs and text message and take a
map location I haven't gotten the the
map location to work successfully when I
try to get this number you would think
that I would at least get that this is a
virginia number but it actually tries to
look for an address you have contacts
and the contacts can be managed on the
hub or on the website a voicemail is
visual voicemail so you can listen to
the voicemails on the hub and then text
messaging allows you to send text
messages but you can only send and
receive text messages from Verizon
Wireless customers so that's a bit of a
downside on the unit so let's go to the
menu so now let's take a look at the
verizon real a verizon relay is a way
for you to assign verizon wire
less customers as members of your rising
relay and you're able to see
conversation threads as post-it notes on
the verizon hub as well as the verizon
hub website the big advantage of using
this feature is that when a message is
sent to the hub you will also receive it
on your verizon wireless cell phone so
anything that comes from these members
will show up here as well as on your
cell phone so this is an interesting
application to look at the last thing i
want to show you is the photo viewer and
the photo viewer allows you to create
albums you've got some pictures that are
pre-loaded here but and you can also
create an album from those pictures if
you want to add your own pictures you
actually do that through the website or
through mms messages but you actually to
be able to add it to this set of
pictures it has to be done through the
website i was not able to add a picture
directly from an mms message that came
on to the hub so i don't know if verizon
is working on that or there's an issue
but right now to be able to add to this
selection of photos you actually have to
do that on the website so i added this
picture which i took with my omnia and
now i can create steve's album
can enter there and do I want this to be
a screensaver album and i'll say yes and
then we can preview it here so it's
loading that album
seems to be taking a little longer than
usual and then i can actually so i've
got two pictures selected in this album
and then i can stop it if i choose and
come back and i can say i want five
seconds ten seconds for 30 seconds so i
can add more photos and obviously i can
save it and so here is my little screen
saver album which is a great way to use
this device when it's not in use as a
photo viewer this does it for my
software overview and hopefully between
part 1 and part 2 you've gotten a feel
of what the verizon hub can do i'll be
back with my thoughts on the verizon hub
in my next video bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
