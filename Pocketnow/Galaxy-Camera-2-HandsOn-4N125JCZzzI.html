first FIFA I ever attended back in 2012
and Samsung has finally gotten around to
updating that line I'm Michael Fisher
would block it out this is the Galaxy
camera - so first glance you're not
going to see much aesthetically
different obviously Samsung has brought
the new patterned sort of faux leather
to this device as well but other than
some slimming it looks an awful lot like
the first gen Galaxy camera of course it
is very very much different and that is
in terms of mass I did another speck
next to me here but it is ridiculously
light dudes the first Galaxy camera was
clunky thick heavy annoying this is much
more like the s4 zoom not quite is felt
as the s4 zoom but still significantly
lighter than the first Galaxy camera we
power on the device here we can extend
that lens for you still 21 times optical
zoom still a 16 megapixel sensor behind
there
to know what specific improvements have
been implemented yet but as we hop
around here we can deploy that flash
just for fun because that's a fun thing
to do is know
as we head back around here we can show
you the software and I bet you can tell
what we're going to tell you a lot of
this software is very familiar as well
typical Android interface here we'll hop
on down to the version information and
see if we can find that for you
about device an Android version is 4.3
obviously the Samsung's custom skin
running atop it here if we op into the
camera itself we can see the viewfinder
once again with different mode select
here for smart modes and a lot of these
are very familiar to new ones there's
kids shot which plays a stupid sound to
get the kids to pay attention to you
maybe it's not stupid I don't know maybe
it's cool maybe like it depends on your
opinion I don't know but I love selfie
alarm as I am narcissistic and a jerk so
check it out
you turn on selfie alarm you get this
like box Oh focus area right and then
you bring it up to make sure that you
make yourself look good because you you
know you don't want to show your chins
here when it detects your face it snaps
five shots in a row you know I don't
have to press the button it just took
the shots when it's on my face
and now look at this you're making a
dumb face for everyone in on YouTube
it's not great actually I'm being snarky
but selfie alarm is a really cool
feature considering this device doesn't
have a front-facing camera because why
would it when you have this massive
module up front other improvements
around but this is just a very quick
look at the galaxy camera 2 from Samsung
always nice to see an improvement of a
product that we spend some time with and
it'll be interesting to compare these if
we get the chance I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow at CES 2014
chillin Martin shot this one will talk
to you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
