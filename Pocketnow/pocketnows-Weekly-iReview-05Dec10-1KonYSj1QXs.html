sale or well at least at RadioShack new
apple patents show radial menus and even
time based search for the iPhone in the
iOS 4.2 point one round of bugs now
includes disappearing folders all this
and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi everyone and welcome to
the park and nail I review the show we
go through all this week school and
they're not so cool inside the world of
Apple's iOS devices the summer just
started Christmas is in the air so let's
start off with the cool well I'm not
really sure that will hurt our
complaints about the fact that their
sales for Black Friday really sucks
because you know the only way you get a
sale for the iphone is if you bought a
refurbished device so it seems that
radioshack is now offering both the
iphone 4 and the iphone 3gs for as much
as fifty dollars off so you get to only
pay 49 bucks if you want the iphone 3gs
you get to pay 149 if you want the
iphone 4 16 gigabyte and 249 if you want
the iphone 4 32 gigs so let's hope they
bring that up somewhere else eventually
I mean Apple it's the holidays man a new
apple pan that's out there being
mentioned is the fact that they're
looking for time-based search services
to be offered on the iPhone really not
sure what to make of it remember Apple
wat sri which is a company that actually
offered some sort of artificial
intelligence service that would know
exactly what you were searching for with
voice so we could be seeing some sort of
a new service coming to the maps
application it could be that they're
enhancing their search services for them
or for the device to know exactly where
you are through the gps and actually
offer different services that are around
you or it has to do probably with the
fact that you could i don't know have
something on your calendar with
appointments or probably it's better
time and you're looking for something to
eat we'll see what Apple comes up with
really not sure what to make of it just
yet again these are only pans nothing is
final and it could take probably months
or years for Apple to actually roll
something out with this new services
that are being mentioned and continuing
on with apple patents it seems that
there are new things coming in for the
iPhone 5 or some sort of new release for
iOS the suspensions radial menus which
is you know a different UI interface to
what we're used to with the
you know it's still iconic only with a
different order now or a different
fashion I could say and another one of
the pens also mentions that we could
probably be getting FM radio which is
something that actually got released
with the ipod nanos new generation so we
could see it coming probably with the
next generation iphone and at the same
time it seems that Apple is working on
3d menus that don't require glasses
which is really cool though with the
fact that HD TV 3d you know service is
really not becoming a boom lately we
could see Apple drawing back on that for
the next generation iphone let's see
what happens in the end little
interesting things this week is that
Apple released iOS 4.2 point 1 and they
didn't mention the fact that it now
supports network controlled fast
dormancy which is a new service that
actually allows the iphone to work
together with the cell phone antennas
and give you better battery life and
better performance the service actually
has been offered by Nokia phones for
some time and it seems that seeming run
some tests in their networks and they
figured out that apple also offers a
service but it's really interesting to
see that Apple didn't mention anything
about it is it activated or Apple hasn't
mentioned it really weird to see what
happens but it's out there and it works
out of the really cool deals for this
holiday season is gameloft offering
their app vent calendar promotions
really nice name and what this does is
that all you have to do is follow
gameloft on twitter and just check in
every day because they'll be offering
deals like you know free games free
wallpapers or even discounted games you
never know what they'll be offering but
this will last almost the whole month so
again follow gameloft on twitter and see
what you can find
well that does it for the cool let's
continue on with the not so cool the dev
team has finally released their
ultrasnow unlock feature for iphone 3gs
m3g owners and why is this in the
not-so-cool section well because it's a
pain it's horrible it requires for you
to install the iPad baseband on iphone
3gs and 3g devices so our biggest
advices it's you know really not good
because this base ban is six point 15
points something which means that if you
upgrade to it you will not be able to
downgrade to any other baseband and if
new base fans come up it seems that you
will not be able to change until Apple
reaches that number which is something
we really don't expect for all devices
like the iphone 3g or 3gs the worst part
about this is we don't really know what
to expect about Apple meaning they can
figure out how to block this for future
updates or even software updates carrier
updates that you really don't know about
sir our advice is let's wait for the dev
team to figure another way around
because it's really weird and yeah there
is still no ultrasnow unlock for the
iphone 4 we're really waiting for this
animal continuing on it seems that
there's this facetime bug that happened
with in november 27th and november 28th
when your iphone 4 would wake up somehow
and it would start a facetime call to
somebody whomever we really don't know
and out of no particular reason we
really don't know what happened during
this date or why is this state specific
but let's hope that Apple figure
something out because it's really weird
for you to get a weird call in the
middle of the night and you're not
really knowing what you are getting so
weird and continuing on with the iOS 4.2
point one bug roundup it seems that
boulders are disappearing why well we
don't know why Apple hasn't really
mentioned anything we really haven't
heard of many cases where this happens
or we really don't even know why it
happens but it seems that some iphone
users rarely it's really happening
mostly with ipad owners there you know
working on creating their folders and
somehow they disappear really don't know
what to make of it or what to expect not
really sure of apple's going to
 or do something about it you never
know what Apple can do but again it's
something that's out there so if you see
any folders disappearing just it seems
that people have been able to fix it by
resetting their device so just restarted
them hope that the folders there
eventually that's it for today's I
