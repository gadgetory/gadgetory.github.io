beautiful beasts gadgets which push the
envelope with price tags to match
pitting two of the world's top
manufacturers against each other
comparing two very different flavours of
power user hardware this is gonna be fun
I'm Juan Carlos bag nail for Pocket now
and it's time for a showdown Huawei mate
10 Pro versus Samsung Galaxy Note II
kicking things off with design Samsung
has been a consistent favorite this year
adopting a taller form factor thin
bezels against hard rectangular corners
Samsung is one most of our design fights
in 2017 but not today
Huawei has dramatically cleaned up its
act the may 10 delivers a wonderful
blend of familiar accents with a shiny
new backplate and against Samsung Huawei
delivers the more symmetrical handset
you gotta love that fingerprint scanner
position but switching to the tech
inside few companies can face the
onslaught of hardware crammed inside the
note and everything in the kitchen sink
approach to building a phone both
devices have top-tier internals and
enhanced water resistance Samsung just
has more stuff wireless charging iris
scanning security upgradable storage and
of course the Mighty S Pen Huawei fights
back with dual SIM card support stereo
speakers and the niche favorite IR
blaster but Sami just plain packs more
in with fewer hardware omissions display
size and resolution just reinforced that
debate there's nothing wrong with
rocking a 1080p screen it's more than
adequate to get you through your day so
much so that Samsung ships their phones
down scaled to 1080p out of the box both
are rockin juicy amyloids sporting that
fantastic contrast ratio and very good
outdoor readability when you need more
dots though like say you're firing up a
VR headset Samsung has that quad HD
panel at the ready these two companies
aggressively customize their hardware
and that philosophy extends to the
software running on each device neither
would ever be confused with stock
Android Huawei ZM
why has evolved nicely over the last
year providing some great under the hood
performance and optimization but the
design is still a bit rough around the
edges samsung's aesthetic manages to
land closer to stock Android but on top
of those more familiar elements the note
also tacks on two additional
customizable interfaces edge controls
for one thumb interactions and the s-pen
air menu for stylus control anticipating
three distinctly different usage methods
it's flexible but that means there's
more stuff running on your phone at any
given time and we do have to give them
eight props for arriving with android
oreo out of the box samsung not known
for delivering the fastest updates even
on pricey devices both phones are
top-tier performers comparable raw power
between the cura 970 and qualcomm 835
when looking at benchmarks though in my
experience Huawei manages to age better
over time marketing machine learning
optimization and better garbage
collection after using the mate nine
nearly every day since its launch we're
inclined to believe those marketing
claims and I'm already experiencing the
occasional concerning twitch or stutter
on my note that I might need to wipe it
out soon and just restart fresh one of
the more nuanced aspects of this
comparison both phones sporting dual
cameras on the back but the philosophy
behind those cameras could not be more
different
Samsung opting for their first standard
lens plus zoom option Huawei further
evolving the Leica matched lenses with
color and monochrome sensors sami
delivers the better all-rounder in our
tests lightning fast autofocus smoother
video and crowd pleasing color
saturation huawei solution by contrast
is the better specialist camera the more
photographic solution and with a more
camera like layout for controls and
settings the mate ends matched sensors
can deliver some significant benefits
for the fun features we all demand on
flagships now a portrait mode for
example Huawei doesn't crop in the photo
and the effect can be applied from a
broader range of distances the Samsung
followed Apple's lead here using the
smaller zoom sensor
with the smaller aperture which is
pretty terrible at soaking up light when
indoors or at night Huawei has no
problems using these software blurring
features in any lighting conditions
where the cameras would work normally
the audio conversation is also something
of a split decision we certainly
appreciate the dual speaker setup on the
mate / the mono bottom firing speaker on
the note
but the note easily wins for headphones
Huawei is playing the dongle game in
Samsung's built-in Jack produces higher
quality output
not to mention Samsung includes a better
set of earbuds in the box the battery
comparison though is an easy win for
huawei we don't fault Samsung for
staying conservative with the capacity
and fast charging on this year's note
but the mate packs a bigger power pack
and this year's Kirin is more power
efficient than last year's you'll just
plain get more runtime on the mate and
Huawei charges faster one plugged in the
Samsung's wireless charging is an
excellent convenience feature and we
wish the mate included it well when you
only have a couple minutes to top off
Huawei super charger will deliver
significantly more run time per minute
plugged in so let's wrap this up where
does that leave us between the huawei
mate 10 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Note
8 we're missing one key point in
comparing these phones in the United
States and that's the price the note is
the more feature complete device but
we're not entirely sure how to judge
those extra features against any
disparity in cost is an s-pen worth $100
premium might the price gap be even
wider looking at European markets
Samsung still lists the note 8 unlocked
for 999 Euro against the 799 euro may 10
pro that's a pretty significant margin
but it's also not that difficult to shop
a little online and find closer prices
that puts Huawei in a more difficult
position for a recommendation even when
prices are closer I still believe there
is an audience for the mate empro but it
makes the huawei more of a niche player
rather than the terrific value
all-rounder which was last year's mate 9
now we're all waiting to see what price
tag this phone arrives with when it
finally lands in North America and which
fun would win your cash drop us a
