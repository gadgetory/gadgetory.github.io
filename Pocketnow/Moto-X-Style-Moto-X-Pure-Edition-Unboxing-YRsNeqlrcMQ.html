Motorola's predictably a few civ take on
its 2015 flagship smartphone but how
does it really look and feel well we've
got to get into the box to find out and
hey that's what I'm here for
i'm michael fisher with pocket now
welcome it let's unbox the Moto X pure
edition
one of the great things about unboxing a
phone you designed yourself is that no
one else is having the exact same
experience you've customized it and told
Motorola what you want emblazoned on it
it's entirely wholly yours and that's
awesome let's save the best for last and
check out the accessories first the
turbo charger that we know and love
now rebranded as the turbo power charger
whatever you want to call it moto says
it'll give your phone 10 hours of
battery life in 15 minutes and we'll see
then there's the free bumper case we
read about on the outside of the box and
well you know what they say about
getting what you pay for it feels like
pretty soft plastic and it's pretty
flimsy but once it's on the phone it'll
probably do an okay job of guarding
against scratches and dings from drops
and kicks
we'll see if I put it on which I won't
onto the phone ever since our hands on
in New York a few weeks back I've been
waiting to pick this up again wait
there's more stuff under there and
there's still more stuff under that okay
well there's no surprises here this is a
sim tool which is nice to have when your
sim doesn't come pre-installed in the
device because it's pure and then
there's the usual warranty and product
literature which I'll read later I
promise
on to the phone itself picking up the
Moto X pure edition or style if you're a
European I'm again struck by how meaty
beefy heavy it is at 180 grams by mass
alone this thing is a monster as you can
see we went with the silicone rubber
finish and we did that for a reason it's
because it's the stock option while it
only costs 25 bucks to upgrade to the
leather or wood options I think many
people will probably stick with the
silicone which offers a wider range of
color options it's also nice and soft
and grippier than most anything else
check out those ridges this being our
house phone we had to make it
ostentatious with the yellow metallic
trim and we had to get it branded it's
weird that Motorola reduced the
character count by one since last year
but that's probably so they could make
the letters bigger hardware wise I'm
just as impressed as I was at the
hands-on but I am seeing some slight
misalignment in the casing of our review
device here it's so minor that it's
tough to catch
sure even an extreme closeup and it
doesn't bug me that much considering the
reasonable price
but it's one of those things that might
get on your nerves if you have an
extreme eye for detail anyway let's pull
that screen protector off of there note
to parents of young children who may be
watching this might get sexy quiet
please
the Moto X pure edition is catching a
lot of flak from longtime moto fans
because it's so big but those who think
it's out of control big like the Nexus 6
well it's not it's better designed with
reduced radius corners and it's also
much narrower a much friendlier device
for one-handed use it does represent a
huge blow up from the two year old Moto
X Pathfinder device so fans of the
family as a whole do have a legitimate
gripe we'll see how this bears out in
real world testing time to give it its
first taste of the network remember this
is the pure edition so it'll work no
matter what u.s. national operator you
choose and also remember that this isn't
just a sim tray for the first time in
the lines history the Moto X has a
microSD card slot actually forgotten
about that that's cool
so anyway I'm gonna forego that and just
pop my nano sim in for now I'm using a
t-mobile SIM not that it matters boot it
up and bam there's that big bright 5.7
inch quad HD LCD screen blinding our
camera and there's our custom greeting
we lacked some imagination on that one
I'll admit a few seconds later we're
inside the near stock Android build and
getting ready to get to know it which is
exactly what we'll be doing in the
review period right in front of us and
guess what if you're watching this
unboxing on the day of release from
