innovate fully with the galaxy s5 and
we'll let you be the judge of that but
so far one of the biggest comparisons
you are expecting is the Galaxy Note 3
so let's talk about it okay look at this
galaxy s5 galaxy note 3 5.7 inch 1080p
display 5.1 inch 1080p display both
displays are super amoled it is pretty
much the same technology I can't tell
you that one is more vibrant than the
other because honestly they're not the
UI's are very very similar if not the
same this is the new version of TouchWiz
this is the old version of TouchWiz this
phone is running on Android 4.4 KitKat
this phone is running on Android 4.3
still until Samsung bears with us and
gives us the update but honestly there
is really not much of a big difference
here if you're currently rocking a note
3 we'd say you have a good phone first
of all this phone is talking a 2.5
gigahertz a Snapdragon processor we've
got the two point three gigahertz
Snapdragon processor on the note 3 in
certain cases some people have the
Exynos octa but then again we got three
gigs of RAM on the note 3 you've got two
gigs of RAM on the s-1 remember this is
kit kat so it's a much more efficient
smartphone than in case of the note 3
then if we look at the other differences
for example they are pretty much almost
aspic obviously the note 3 has to be a
bigger phone but we've got this sort of
like rubbery backing on the case of the
galaxy as far we've got the faux leather
back on the note 3 and then again it's
really hard for me to tell you what
other differences aside from the fact
that yes we do have a 16 megapixel
camera in the case of the galaxy s5 not
optically stabilized we do have the
13-megapixel camera in the case of the
galaxy note 3 and yeah we do have the
heart rate monitor in the s5 that you
don't
have in the case of the galaxy note 3
other hardware differences is yes the
fact that you can unlock your phone with
this with a fingerprint scanner on the
display in the case of the galaxy s5
which we sadly had to disable because it
wasn't really working in the case of the
note 3 you don't have that option other
hardware differences is obviously the
Wacom digitizer in the case of the
galaxy note 3 that detects the S Pen and
allows you to do different things that
you debt can't do with the galaxy s5 yes
you can't buy an S Pen and use it on the
s5 this does not have the same digitizer
aside from that when it comes to
software going back we have this new
sort of I don't know icon you I in the
case of the s5 we're in the case of the
note 3 it is still the typical different
selection options we can't tell you
which one is better honestly depends on
you so far this is fancy it looks good
looks minimalistic we just don't know if
it's better it's going to be up to you
but other than that hey this is pretty
much almost the same phone galaxy s5 is
not really the wow factor that we're
expecting but this is a work in progress
the galaxy note 3 is also a work in
progress and if you still have a note 3
you probably should stay with it hi
