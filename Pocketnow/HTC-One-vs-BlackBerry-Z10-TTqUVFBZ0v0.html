saying goes don't judge a smartphone by
its bezel if you're still with us after
that awful joke stick around we're going
to be putting one of the best of Android
up against the best of BlackBerry 10 I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is HTC One versus blackberry z10 we
like to narrow our focus when we're
talking about devices on two different
platforms so we'll keep this comparison
limited to five categories build UI
camera ecosystem and some test notes we
praised the BlackBerry for the sturdy
quality of its hardware in our full
review and that looks to have been
well-earned praise the rugged plastic
z10 has held up nicely in the months
since we reviewed it though in all
honesty that might have more to do with
how often we've used it than how durable
it is the HTC One with its aluminum body
certainly catches the eye more easily
than does the blackberry z10 part of
that is due to the silver color on our
one here but the difference extends to
material choice as well which has a big
effect on feel in hand dimensionally
speaking these devices are nearly
identical in thickness around the nine
millimeter mark and at 137 grams for the
blackberry and 143 grams for the one
they're nearly the same weight as well
but the ones aluminum unibody is smooth
almost too smooth in the hand while the
BlackBerry's soft touch back cover
clings to the skin
that means the BlackBerry feels a little
less premium a little more common than
the piece of art that is the HTC One but
it also means you're less likely to drop
it and less likely to care if you do
unlocking the screens which we have to
do with a button on the one but which
the z10 lets us do with a gesture we see
another big difference in terms of
displays the screen on the BlackBerry
z10 is a 4.2 inch IPS LCD at a
resolution of 1280 by 768 that makes for
a pixel density of 356 PPI while the SLC
d3 on the HTC One is a 4.7 inch full
1080p panel kicking out an absurdly high
468 PPI that doesn't mean we can make
out Jaggi lines or other evidence of
pixelation on the BlackBerry's display
not at all
it does mean though that we have much
more room to work with on the one and
colours also appear much more vibrant on
the Android device the z10 s display is
also much warmer with White's appearing
much closer to beige than the pure
White's on the one though each displays
blacks look equally deep at full
brightness you have to look past the
pixels and delve into the software to
get the full picture of how different
these smartphones really are each of
them is packing a pretty unique user
experience of course we're familiar with
the Android jelly bean load on the one
but HTC's new sense 5 layer brings a lot
of newness to the experience in the form
of a massive aesthetic overhaul and the
addition of the social and news heavy
blinkfeed while using the one is a
familiar experience it's not without a
slight learning curve as you adapt to
the way sense 5 does things if you
haven't used BlackBerry's new BB 10
platform on the other hand the z10 zzyx
perience is not a familiar one
blackberry takes the homescreen app
drawer notification area model and flips
it on its head the app drawer is off to
the right a context-sensitive settings
shade is accessible from the top
notifications live off to the left in
the BlackBerry hub and the home screen
has been converted into a canvas for
what blackberry calls active frames
which are half icon half widget hybrids
representing currently running apps the
whole shebang takes some getting used to
but after a while you start to
appreciate the value of the constantly
accessible hub with its peak gesture as
well as the home screen with its webOS
like cards for buttonless task
management there are some similarities
here to HTC wasn't about to be left out
of the somehow still popular cards
metaphor so its redesigned the task
manager to include 9 app hosting cards
for sense 5 and each of these software
loads also features a very usable
keyboard sense 5s stock keypad is easily
the most usable we've seen from an
Android OAM and we also enjoy the holo
like highlights on each button as we
type BlackBerry's keyboard appears much
more conventional until you start typing
on it the predictive text software
allows you to flick words right from the
keyboard up into the typing field
resulting in a much more efficient
one-handed typing experience once you
get used to it
finally blackberry has implemented some
specific optimizations to the z10 in
order to play to its strengths while
differentiating itself from the
competition specifically we're talking
about the enterprise centric features
like the server dependent blackberry
balance work and personal dividing wall
on the z10 as well as its blackberry
protect security software these features
can be replicated to a degree on the
Android device but they're available out
of the box on the blackberry each OS is
snappy and responsive and neither feels
prone to crashes or excessive lag app
launch times are consistently faster on
the HTC One which is either a
consequence of its quad-core Snapdragon
600 being more advanced than the
BlackBerry's dual-core Snapdragon s4 or
better optimized software or both it's
not the RAM which stands at two gigs on
each device but while we're talking
memory we should mention that the z10
features a microSD slot for storage
expansion up to an additional 64 gigs
while the HTC One is stuck at 32 or 64
gigs depending on which model you buy
there's no expansion slot here not that
you have much opportunity to fill up the
BlackBerry z10 storage unless you're a
media hound blackberry got off to a
great start filling its new BlackBerry
app world launching the c10 with over
70,000 available apps but many were
ported from older versions of Android
delivering a less than stellar
experience and the app world was also
missing some major titles big names like
Angry Birds and Kindle were there but
they were few and far between a few
months later we're still essentially in
the same place though the app world has
grown to include over 100,000 titles big
gaps remain to fill even Windows Phone
finally sports Pandora and Spotify and
of course they've been on Android for
ages but they're absent on BlackBerry
Instagram of course isn't here the
Facebook and Twitter apps were built by
blackberry and have received awful
reviews on the App world due to their
bare-bones nature
Shazam isn't here stitcher isn't here
etc etc that doesn't mean there's no
hope for blackberry quite to the
contrary the app selection is exploding
and hopefully that growth rate will
continue as blackberry puts out more
devices and keeps landing million unit
orders for the time being though the
bb10 app ecosystem is still flat
and without apps offerings like content
matter a lot less for a new smartphone
user or someone upgrading from an older
blackberry the z10 still makes sense for
someone used to a wider array of apps
like an Android or iOS user though we
can't recommend the new blackberry over
the HTC One and its powerhouse Google
Play Store not yet blackberry was pretty
good at the fundamentals of mobile
phones
that is to say phone calling in its
heyday and we found that to extend to
the z10 as well
calls were clear enough and the
speakerphone was even a mite louder than
we've come to expect from smart phones
that is to say until the HTC One came
along the one trounces not just the z10
but every other smartphone in recent
memory when it comes to voice calls part
of that is the boom sound speaker phone
setup with its dual amplified front
firing speakers the one is a much louder
and clearer device and loudspeaker mode
than the z10 but the earpiece on the one
is also clearer and it's noise
cancellation is better there are plenty
of variations in camera performance to
the ultrapixel camera on the HTC One is
lower in resolution at 4 megapixels but
its unique approach to mobile
photography means it's low-light
performance is astronomically better the
one also uses a wider angle lens to
capture more of a scene than the
BlackBerry's 8 megapixel shooter and
colors are cooler closer to life than on
the z10 the image is also markedly
sharper and given a steady hand the
BlackBerry's battery life disappointed
us in our early review but a subsequent
software update is said to have improved
that situation gravely we haven't run
extended comparisons but this is truly a
mixed bag on paper the BlackBerry's 1800
milliamp hour battery pack is a full 500
milliamp hours junior to the battery and
the HTC One but the latter's is embedded
whereas the blackberries is user
replaceable software update or no you'll
probably still want a spare battery with
you if you're a power user carrying the
BlackBerry z10 and it's nice to have
that option
one phone is an eleventh-hour last-ditch
effort from an enterprise company trying
to liven up its corporate image and the
other is a Hail Mary attempt at
introducing a premium feel to the
commoditized Android space from a
similarly beleaguered manufacturer these
devices have creators with a lot in
common but the products themselves would
almost have to strain to be more
different it's not every day a consumer
will be weighing these options together
but when it does happen the choice will
be between two strong products hailing
from two very different territories
which choice the buyer makes will
probably be determined by whether he or
she needs to wear a suit or a sweatshirt
to the office but maybe just maybe these
devices will start blurring those
traditional lines just a little bit
