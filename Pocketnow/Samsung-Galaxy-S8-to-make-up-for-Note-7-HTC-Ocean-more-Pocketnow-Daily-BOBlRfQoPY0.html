forced to launch a galaxy s a powerhouse
and it's on continues to sweeten the pot
for Prime members and it seems that the
galaxy note 7 switchers have decided to
stick with Samsung I'm hi Mary vera and
is it just me or has a 2016 brought us
the best smartphones and also the most
controversial ones this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
the deals to a certain degree of you're
an Amazon Prime customer like I am you
now get the new family vault service and
the way this works is you get unlimited
storage for your photos 5 gigs per user
for videos and you can add up to 5 users
and the other users actually don't have
to be Prime members so long as you
remember everybody else gets that
particular feature that's really cool
and for Prime members it is free now one
of the major questions we received
yesterday is hey when are we getting the
samsung gear s3 I am waiting for it
definitely was one of my favorite
smartwatches this year or at least the
one that I want to try but well it just
launched in Korea those of you waiting
for it in the United States there will
be a couple of variants obviously with
carriers and we should expect them late
November stay tuned for that one I'll
spill the spotlight over to the HTC
ocean yes we've covered the bolts it
looks a lot like the HTC 10 but the
ocean is a rumor that was coming and
going now Evan blast confirms that it is
something that's going to happen and if
we were to assume what we're getting
judging by the photos it looks a lot
like the Google pixel it's got the huge
shin and there are a couple of things
around it that make it look like this
were the HTC variant of the pixel and
that would be really cool let's see if
we do get it and think about it HTC
ocean and then the pixels had the names
of fish and for those of you that are
wondering just how bad is it for samsung
right now with the replacements of the
node 7 actually not that bad according
to trusted sources an analyst only
between ten to thirty percent of users
are switching from a galaxy note 7 to an
iphone or anything else pretty much
every other user is switching back to a
see a seven or a galaxy s7 edge
obviously the s7 I just preferred but
yeah it seems that people actually want
to stick with Samsung seventy percent
this actually a huge number good for
samsung actually and finally the very
hot loose today have to do with the
samsung galaxy s 8 and Sam SIG's
strategy to fix the whole mess with the
galaxy note 7 why because you know that
the company had commitment with
suppliers so for example the suppliers
of the IR scanner just about every other
technology that's on this phone
obviously Samsung has a contractual
commitment to order X amount of units so
apparently the consolation prizes the
galaxy s 8 all this is reaching the
galaxy s 8 but then again we wonder if
all of it is actually reaching it
because we're hearing rumors that the
Galaxy Note will be no more so could it
be that the galaxy s 8 will be
everything about the s pen and that
really leads me to the question of the
day do you think that Samsung should
provide this functionality to the galaxy
s 8 turn it pretty much into a note at
least the phablet in my case I think
that that would be a really smart idea
and it would make it really easy for
users that weren't able to get the note
7 to get a note at some point
particularly me for example I prefer the
Wacom digitizer but we would love to
know what you think in the comments down
below friends you know the way it goes
