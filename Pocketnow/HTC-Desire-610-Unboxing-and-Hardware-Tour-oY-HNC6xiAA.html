February HTC announced two new additions
to the desire line up the 816 and 610
Joe has already reviewed the 816 and now
we have the 610 on hand and Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is our
unboxing the HTC Desire 610
so back in February HTC announced two
new phones they've been over the years
trying to cut back their product lineup
we used to see dozens of phones from HTC
every year this year we've seen just a
few we have the HTC One m8 and it's
smaller version the One m8 or one Mini 2
and that Mobile World Congress it
announced two new phones the Desire 610
which we have right here and the 816
which are on Joe Levi has already
reviewed that is up on the site and you
can see it but yeah this is it's
basically entry-level phone it's a
smaller little lightweight version of
the 816 I'm very similar I guess on
paper to the one mini two but this one's
all plastic whereas the one mini two is
aluminum so without any delay let's get
inside the box see what it's about of
course we always have knives on hand for
this sort of thing handy unboxing tool
get the cellophane off move to the side
and I actually looked around this box
for another 30 seconds trying to figure
out what color it is and it's actually
up on the bottom this is a navy blue
handset we're gonna set this thing aside
if we can get it out of the box while we
go through the other things okay
unboxings are hard clearly inside the
box we're gonna get some reading
material of course your desire 6/10
limited warranty User Agreement and
whatnot here is a power brick this is
not a US power brick this is for
overseas so that's not gonna do me any
good here this one is a microUSB cable
and it does look like with this one you
get some fancy little earbuds
I'll have to check those out I'm sure
they're not as great as some of the
other in box headphones we've seen over
the years but inside the box there
really isn't much to get excited over I
always say that but really all we ever
care about is the phone you guys seem to
care a lot about what's in the box but
it's always the same thing the phone
itself feels really
lightweight and small we're gonna get
the plastic off of it here really
quickly so we can actually see it and
this actually has some instructions for
micro SD card and your SIM so we'll look
at that again in a minute looks like
they're behind the volume rocker no I
lied they're right here domi so as you
can see we have the navy blue version of
this phone right here and it looks a lot
like the desires
8:16 has a very similar the boom sound
speakers with the grilles at the top and
bottom above the display are both above
and below the camera around back is an 8
megapixel camera that is not optically
stabilized it's just a standard 8
megapixel camera and you don't get a 5
megapixel camera on the front this one
is 1.3 megapixels if I remember
correctly the display is 4.7 inches and
it's a qHD resolution so you're not
getting a very high resolution display
especially not by today's standards but
as you can see also there's a lot of
bezel around the display on this phone
so it's clearly not one of HTC's most
high-end handsets this is basically your
entry-level
HTC handset for 2014 and the internals
are really an indicator if that is well
inside you're only going to get one gig
of ram eight gigabytes of storage though
you do have that micro SD card slot
which supports up to 128 gigabytes of
additional storage it also has a
Snapdragon 400 SOC and that is a
quad-core CPU clocked at 1.2 gigahertz I
believe so you're getting basically
bottom of the bucket specifications but
you're also gonna save and cost as well
so you don't expect too much out of this
phone also the battery inside before I
forget is 2040 milliamp hours so that's
2040 milliamp hours really not a very
high intense that will we I think we
have some devices to compare to but
really quickly we can do a little size
comparison this is the 5-inch one m8
which a lot of people are saying is too
big for a 5-inch phone it's really tall
this one's 4.7
it's almost the same exact size as the
one m8 so that's something that many
people will be happy about we also have
the Moto X here which is also a very
small 4.7 inch phone and you can see the
size difference is pretty substantial so
the build quality and in the hand feel
is really not that great so far I mean
it's it feels cheap and that's partly
due to the slick plastic which we're not
used to seeing typically on HTC phones
but yeah it looks nice around front
where it's matte finish and everything
despite the bezels but the back is very
very shiny and glossy and just doesn't
feel that great in the hand so we're
gonna put this thing to the test we'll
compare it with some phones we'll do a
full review and maybe some other
coverage I don't know so stay tuned for
that
