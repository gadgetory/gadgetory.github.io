photographs apparently the best ever
Moto X deal is about to burn a hole in
your pocket this Monday and Apple puts
your dreams of a merger between OS 10
and iOS to rest I'm hi Mary man I and by
now I should be drinking the only reason
why I'm here is to get this video out
for you guys this is out daily
let's first say off with the official
news as this is really interesting a lot
of Apple executives like Bill Schiller
and Craig federighi just came out an
interview and while asked on the
interview what their plans were for OS
10 with this whole thing of OS 10
looking a lot like iOS lately the blunt
answer was that it was a waste of time
and a waste of power for them to merge
both operating systems meaning that
apparently we won't be getting this but
that being said think about it iOS 7 is
a new deal but it's still based on the
same thing and OS 10 is pretty much 10
years old so given the fact that there
is a need for an OS 11 and a lot of
patents out there it could just be that
they're not merging them they could
probably just be working on something
new stay tuned now for those of you
using HTC one of the United States on a
US carrier there aren't good news for
you and this is the first ever if you
need android 4.4 kitkat on your HTC One
which I'm sure every one of you does the
good news is that apparently each
carrier is already testing this and the
testing period should end in a week
meaning you could be getting Android 4.4
KitKat on your one in just a couple of
days from now so stay tuned as we don't
know that a lot of you are waiting for
this update and yea even we are and even
though we didn't consider the rumors of
the Nexus 5 yesterday to have color
options to be real well we've got some
more leaks today of a red nexus 5 in
photographs but if you look at these
photographs they kind of look like
photographs that came from a video and
since we don't really consider this
video to be real it's kind of hard to
know exactly if this is not just a dummy
or just the phone that got it back
coloring or something so many options
are available but then again we are
wishing that this is true even though
apparently the leaks say that we
wouldn't be getting this phone in color
options until probably March or April so
let's see you never know now every one
of you set your count
watches for 3 p.m. on monday the 27th
eastern 3 p.m. monday the 27th eastern
if you're interested in the Moto X
Motorola is gonna have a sweet deal for
you it's a hundred dollars off but it's
only going to last for one hour and it's
only gonna be again for a couple of
phones they don't really specify how
many phones are gonna have in stock but
apparently there's a limited stock so if
you're interested in a Moto X this is
probably your opportunity to get a $300
phone which is great so let's see if you
can get one because I'm sure I won't get
it and finally for the very nostalgic
news of the day HP has just sold 1,400
tens and a thousand patents abroad from
the United States to Qualcomm and most
of these pens are actually palms and
other patents are from the ipaq lineup
that was originally from compact and
that HP ended up killing obviously and
this is just happening a year after HP
sold webos to LG for TVs so again this
is really sad nostalgic news but it
could be I don't know what Qualcomm
plans to do with these patents but that
is the question of the day what do you
think about HP actually killing all
their mobile space and killing all the
Pens that they owned that was really the
purpose why they bought palm and compact
in its time but leave us a comment down
below because in my particular case I am
really disappointed in HP this was my
favorite mobile company years ago and
now they're trash and friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news
