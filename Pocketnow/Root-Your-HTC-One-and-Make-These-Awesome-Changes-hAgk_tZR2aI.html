but developers are doing what they do
best I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and these are a few mods that you can
apply to your HTC One the HTC One as
well as its biggest foe the galaxy s4
are the new kids on the block and any
Android developer who's somebody is
halting or slowing development on older
devices to focus on the newer hotness
however both of these devices are still
comparatively new and on the rom and
modification front there's not a lot
going on devs are getting their bearings
waiting on units to arrive finding
exploits and building new mods for the
new hardware but fortunately for those
early birds there are some quick and
easy mods lingering in the forums for
tinkering right out of the gate of
course there are some prerequisites to
these mods you need to unlock your
bootloader which can be done at HTC dev
comm and you will need to root your one
a how-to is linked in the description
below once those two things are done
you're ready to begin modding one of the
best advantages of rooting a device is
the ability to remove any bloatware that
comes on a device that helped
application you don't need desktop sync
software or in our case 7 digital we've
got enough music stores as it is a quick
and easy way to remove and disable this
bloatware is to install titanium backup
find the application and uninstall this
can be done with practically any
pre-installed application just beware
what you uninstall as removing some apps
might break other services as always
make it backup before making any changes
just in case one aspect of the one that
we found a bit odd was the unique button
configuration Android devices a few
years back had for navigation buttons
now most have three the HTC One however
has only two back at home this means
that all mini functions are our own
screen and the recent apps are accessed
by double tapping the home button a
drawback to this is that when an
application that has not been updated
with androids action overflow button the
Menu soft button takes up a large
portion at the bottom of the display the
one recently received support by Motor
Co toolkit and the xposed framework this
is installed by downloading and
installing the xposed installer apk
launching it and pressing the Install
Update button you then download the
accompanying zip file and flash
using a custom recovery then download
and install the motor code toolkit app
and find the enable button options in
the HTC one submenu reboot the device
open settings navigate to display
gestures and buttons and check the back
button field now long pressing the back
button acts as a menu function and
removes the black action bar for the
soft Menu key also by installing the
Moto co toolkit there are several other
mods that can be applied among those is
the ability to enable app buttons or
enable the disable button and
notification toggle in app settings why
this is useful to one owners is because
the power saver function on the one is
always displayed in the notification
shade and the status bar
by checking the enable app buttons mod
and motor code toolkit and rebooting the
device you can disable the always-on
power saver notification and clean up
the status bar another useful mod in
moto Col toolkit is the ability to hide
the battery meter this is helpful if you
use an application like battery widget
reborn which displays a small battery
leader with a number percentage simply
check the box in the Moto code toolkit
app and reboot you also have the ability
to add a blink feed icon in the
application drawer why would anyone want
this exactly I for example use action
launcher Pro from my default launcher
but I do occasionally find myself
reverting back to the stock since
launcher to browse blinkfeed by having
the blink feed app in the application
drawer it sort of turns blink feed into
its own app instead of a full-on
launcher pressing the home button takes
you back to your default launcher the
final mod is the ability to apply a
customized advanced power menu which is
the pop-up menu that displays when you
hold the power button this mod is simply
applied by downloading the Associated
zip file and flashing it through a
custom recovery during the flash process
you can choose from two types of
advanced power menus full or compact the
full menu shows options for power off
reboot kid mode airplane mode mobile
network screen capture and sound mode
compact hides the mobile network and kid
mode toggles if you press restart you
are taken to a submenu that lets you
choose how you want to reboot either a
normal reboot hot reboot safe mode to
the recovery or boot loader these mods
are rather simple but they definitely
improve the since 5 interface and
cleanup shop a bit there are also sure
to be plenty more mods
after the device has been around a bit
longer so that's going to wrap up this
