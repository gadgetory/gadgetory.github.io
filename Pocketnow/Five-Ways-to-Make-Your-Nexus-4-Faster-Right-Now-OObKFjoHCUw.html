pocketnow.com the Nexus 4 has been out
for a very short amount of time and
already we're asking are there any ways
to make it faster with a quad-core 1.5
processor in it there are a couple
things we can do let's go take a look
first up is unlocking the device most
people I know have their androids
pre locked so you have to put in a
pattern or type in a pin well face
unlock is out it's been out since Ice
Cream Sandwich it's just been kind of
slow check this out
just like that my device is unlocked and
opened up because this processor is just
so fast so you can have a fairly secure
login and still be able to get into your
device really really quickly using face
unlock that's tip number one tip number
two don't unlock if you don't need to
what do I mean by that well over here
your power button can instantly lock
your device so that the next time you
turn it on even if it's 2 seconds later
you have to push that button again so
uncheck that now you don't have that it
will default backup to this it's going
to automatically lock how long after it
goes to sleep
5 seconds 15 I've found 30 works really
well for me so whenever I turn off my
device or if my device goes to sleep
when I wake it back up I don't have to
unlock it because that threshold wasn't
hit only lock when you need it to that's
tip number 2 a lot of times when we're
turning on our devices to check on some
information like the time your calendar
the weather whatever it may be well you
can do that now with lockscreen widget
simply turn on your device and before it
unlocks you can now go in and look at
date and time you can swipe to the side
this is a plug-in called beautiful
widgets yes the same beautiful widgets
that we've shown you in the past now has
a lockscreen widget you can even add
more stuff to do that you've got to
unlock your device so I'll do that with
face unlock now down here we can
through in our calendar digital clock
Gmail messaging even sound search for
what that to find out what that song is
let's go ahead and put Gmail on there
and we'll put my Priority Inbox
so now my priority inbox is right up at
the top one other thing that you can do
that's really nice is from here swipe to
the side and you can get to your camera
very fast very easy it's just right
there you can take a picture of the
floor or something more interesting
that's our next tip next up take
advantage of Google now although it did
come with Ice Cream Sandwich jelly bean
and newer versions have added some cool
features that are really helpful that's
a whole different topic but just to show
you how quick and powerful it is send
text to Alfred test the game has been
cancelled and just like that I have a
text message for Alfred test at his
mobile number saying that the game has
been cancelled very quick very easy
really really convenient you can send
emails calendar appointments all kinds
of stuff just using Google now so up
until now these have been usability
speed enhancements ways that you can use
your Nexus 4 to save time to make it go
faster in your everyday use how can we
make it actually go faster for that
we're going to need root and we're gonna
need a custom ROM the one that I've
chosen here is CyanogenMod let's go into
settings and our first option is called
Z RAM and it's in the memory settings of
performance going to that except the
disclaimer and memory management zrm
compresses memory for increased virtual
capacity and yes it does require a
reboot I've got it set at 18%
which is the default you can bump it up
a little bit more though I haven't seen
any speed improvement by going up to 26
and I'd seen that much by going down to
10 now this is leveraging the fast
processor that we have in here to
compress stuff as it goes into and
decompress stuff as it comes out of RAM
the processor is fast enough to handle
that this
makes it look like we have even more it
helps a little bit but your mileage may
vary try it out just remember you've got
to reboot between settings for the
settings to take effect
our last tweak for you is to allow
purging of assets which lets bitmap
memory assets be purged to free up more
RAM whenever it's needed toggling this
on or off does require that you reboot
for the changes to take effect but once
you do that especially in combination
with Z Ram you're going to notice a
significant improvement in benchmark
scores when running with these two
things setup so there you go we've got a
couple tweaks for you to use to help
actually speed up the performance of
your nexus 4 along with a couple things
you can do to speed up your experience
with the nexus 4 that's just a handful
of things we know so now it's your turn
head over to pocketnow.com and leave
your favorite way to improve performance
on your nexus 4 over in the comments on
the article follow us over on twitter we
are at pocket now if you want to follow
me I'm at Joe Levi make sure you head
over to pocket now and of course give
the video a big thumbs up if you liked
the tweaks and the optimizations that
you saw here today for pocket now
showing off how you can get more speed
out of your Nexus 4 experience I'm Joe
