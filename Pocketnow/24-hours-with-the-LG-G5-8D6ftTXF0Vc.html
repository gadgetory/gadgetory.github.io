are everything but just like certain
relationships are more complex some
smartphones should never be judged by
just one video I'm hi Natalie that I
with pocket now when these are our first
impressions of the LG g5 after 24 hours
the LG g5 is unlike any other smartphone
we've reviewed in years the last time
modular design was popular was more than
a decade ago with a compact eye pack and
at a time when smartphones have begun to
get boring the g5 is really a breath of
fresh air instead of having you choose
between great design and expandability
LG tries to solve both with the g5
though that really has proven to be good
and bad when you pick up the phone for
the first time it doesn't really feel as
cold as the average phone made of metal
there's much controversy over LG's
choice for materials but it's really
hard to complain about the micro dice
treatment used on this metal as well
antenna lines have never been popular
and LG has found a way to hide them
within the treatment and also in certain
corners that make it hard to detect
within the Sham fer my real only
complaint is with the manufacturing
finish the shaffer tends to feel rough
when held with one hand and elements
surrounding the release button are also
rough given the lack of alignment we
praised LG for being creative but wonder
if more polish was needed in the
manufacturing process we'll dig deeper
into the topic in our full review
setting the g5 up for the first time as
standard LG spewed animation remains
unchanged restoring from our existing
phone applications was a breeze and this
is one of the few phones that allows
setting up more than one fingerprint
during the setup process
147 applications loaded in record time
thanks to the Snapdragon 820 processor
and four kegs of RAM and then we're
greeted by LG UX 5.0 this is probably
one of the most polarizing changes and
mainly because the implementation needs
work I actually don't mind not having an
app tray but I wish
were smart enough to restore my folders
along with my applications UX 5.0 even
lacks an easy way to select various
icons at a time to move them around or
to even add applications from within
folders like Samsung does I also haven't
found a way to switch which screen I
want to default is home making it more
iOS like than I really would want it to
be and for those of you that just want
to restore the after a given the LG
video we saw recently well it seems that
that's not part of this AT&amp;amp;T unit yes
there is an easy mode and that does
include an app tray but at the expense
of looking like a phone that was owned
by a senior citizen I will just rather
boov on seriously on the positive front
this is probably one of the most
cohesive you X's I've seen from LG in a
long time icons and settings now match
and there is still some of that
flexibility that makes LG famous if you
don't want the tab menus on settings you
can switch that into ListView if you
don't want that sliding animation
between home screens you can choose
other ones and if you don't want the
arrangement of your navigation keys you
can also switch them however you want
and even add more navigation keys as
well the keyboard continues to be asked
customizable as always but I had to
revert to Swift key because sadly
multilingual support on this UX is
rather funky the keyboard now always
suggests words that are from the wrong
language oddly the screen is a very
interesting change as well if you judge
by comparing to the LG g4 you'd say that
it's dimmer because at 50% it does seem
to be so but this screen is actually
able to go up to 900 nits when fully lit
notice the blacks on the border of the
screen make it seem like if this was an
AMOLED panel so it might seem that you
just need to boost up the brightness a
little bit more when compared to
previous phones from LG
and speaking of changes there is this
new always on display that actually
brings a very interesting approach to
notifications through icons yeah it's
not Nexus like with details nor as
elegant to Samsung but I do find the
icon approach to be more usable I'm also
really liking the power button mounted
at the back with the fingerprint scanner
at first we thought that you would
require to press the button to actually
activate the fingerprint scanner but no
the button is actually capacitive
meaning that once the phone is powered
on all you have to do is touch the
button and it will unlock your phone and
turn on the display so far battery life
has been decent to averaging around 3.5
hours of screen on time and with the
peace of mind that I have a battery
waiting for me in the charging cradle
that came bundled in the box this is
actually one of the coolest features of
the g5 given the fact that even though
there is fast charging there is no
charging that's faster than just
swapping out your battery now keep in
mind that this is without gaming
optimization features turned on by the
way which are set by default so you
might want to disable these in case you
want to actually use this phone for
gaming and as for the camera well this
is an LG and camera performance is
awesome amazing photography during
low-light and also during the day and
this wide-angle camera has become my new
favorite feature
you can even start recording a video
with one camera and then switch to the
other without stopping the video you can
also take photographs using all cameras
at once if that's your thing overall
there is just so much to talk about with
the LG g5 that again one video would not
do it justice I'm probably a bit
disappointed with the fit and finish but
the uniqueness and convenience of this
phone just make me want to continue
using it obviously there is a lot I
still need to test before I could sit
here and tell you to buy it or not and
you can be sure that there will be a ton
of comparisons to back that up as well
