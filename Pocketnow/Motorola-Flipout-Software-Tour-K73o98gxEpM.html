packing.com and this is a software tour
of the Motorola flip-out MB 511 on ATS
network so the first thing you'll notice
is that this devices course is running
Android 2.1 like I said in the previous
videos and we have a motoblur user
interface and a lot of people either
like it or they don't like it so it's
dependent upon your own personal choice
I find that it's kind of integrated into
a lot of social networking so it makes
it pretty easy to update your status and
get other information so if I wanted to
all I have to do is click down here on
my little picture and I can either
update my status directly to it Facebook
or Twitter and I can also do it to all
services so I can just go home and if I
go into the applications here I'll have
to do is hit the home button or I can
hit this is your a circle right here
click that and I can view all of my
programs so I can check in to my
motoblur account and view all my
settings and stuff I can get alarmed
timer so that's just a simple alarm on
this device I can get AT&amp;amp;T family map
which allows you to locate any device on
your family plan
I just cost either $9.99 or $14.99 and
we've seen that before so we can also
view AT&amp;amp;T Maps which is integrated into
the AT&amp;amp;T navigation service it does cost
money per month I think it's about ten
bucks a month or something like that but
with the Android 2.1 you wouldn't really
need that if you're out venturing
because you already have the Google
Navigation program on this device and
you can also of course download
third-party navigation applications from
the market
so we'll just go back we have AT&amp;amp;T
Navigator which is kind of like the AT&amp;amp;T
map so that we just saw they're able to
speak to you the streets and
intersections and where you're going in
turn-by-turn directions stuff like that
AT&amp;amp;T radio which does cost a nominal fee
per month depending on which channels I
think you have let's see we can also go
to our FM tuner
and view radio stations on the FM radio
so that's great that this device has an
FM radio built into it but you will need
to have a set of headphones plugged into
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack in
order for it to use the FM radio because
it's using the wire of the headset to
convert into an antenna so there's okay
we'll go back and we can get AT&amp;amp;T Wi-Fi
hotspots which is great if you don't
have an unlimited data plan which a lot
of people don't know it is because AT&amp;amp;T
has changed their data plans to a Tier
two plan so community to search by venue
service types and zip code or city and
state so it works great if you're out at
a coffee shop or like McDonald's or
something because all of those
establishments have the AT&amp;amp;T Wi-Fi hot
spots we can go to our browser which is
just the basic Android browser and we
can just go back unfortunately this
doesn't have flash on it yet because
this is the only 2.1 version not the
Froyo we have our calculator calendar
camcorder camera the camera works pretty
decently and it's 3.1 megapixels and the
camcorder is rather mediocre contacts
easy to search through our contacts just
like the basic Android contact list and
go into our dialer unfortunately this
device doesn't have a speed dial in the
sense that if you start typing a word or
a contact name or number it doesn't
automatically come up which is one of
the downfalls in Android and also in
Apple so we can go back and go to email
if you had that set up file manager
which is pretty great if you want to
check the files on your device to work
with the quick office so we can either
search the memory card or recent
documents just go back into our gallery
I don't think there's any photos on here
right now so fortunately that's not
going to work you go to happenings which
is integrated either into Twitter or any
other contact a social network out there
we go back Help Center I am we have
Google Maps the Android Market messaging
mobile banking but it only has a few
banks on there
mobile video mobile TV which is a pay
for service that we've seen before
music which is the music player if I had
any music saved to the SD card you can
see it here and it'll show you album art
and all that great stuff news Pandora
phone portal which is actually kind of
cool because it allows you to share
files and pictures and media over a
Wi-Fi connection so if you haven't this
install on your computer all you have to
do is turn on the phone portal and share
your media so we go back quick office
which we've seen before
settings Google Talk text messaging
voice tile and so we're it gives you all
these points of interest around your
area that you can find let's say that I
wanted to search for gas names click
here and choose my grade of gas will
choose 87 and hit select we'll just wait
for it to load and it will show me the
price per gallon and the proximity to my
location so just go back and wipey
mobile which is just Yellowpages mobile
and this is partnered with AT&amp;amp;T so of
course it's going to be installed as
bloatware on their devices so this has
been the software tour of the Motorola
flip-out MB 511 which is running up on a
tMT's network if you like our videos
make sure you give us a thumbs up and
also leave some comments down below we'd
like to hear it you're saying and thanks
