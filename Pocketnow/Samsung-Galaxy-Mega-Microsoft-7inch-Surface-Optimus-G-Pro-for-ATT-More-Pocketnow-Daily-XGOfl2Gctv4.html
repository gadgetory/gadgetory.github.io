and 6.3 jumbo phones microsoft is
preparing a 7-inch surface tablet and
the LG optimus g pro is now being
rumored for AT&amp;amp;T I'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter
and yeah you guessed it all my polo
shirts are in the laundry this is
 out daily let's talk today are
talking about Google as they finally I
mean finally launched their screen cover
for the Nexus 10 I mean think about it
the Nexus 10 was launched almost 4i it
was the fall of last year it's been so
many months as this product was launched
and we finally get an accessory we hate
the fact that Google does this but links
in the description in case you're
interested then let's talk about Nokia's
the company has just announced that
they're bringing some software updates
for their current Lumia lineup for a lot
of stability performance improvements so
stay tuned this will be rolling in the
next couple of days but aside from that
we also have some leaked videos of the
tap to wake feature that's coming to the
Lumia 920 as a software updated it's
kind of interesting because well ever
since blackberry brought that on the z10
it's now the new things so hopefully
it'll come soon to the Lumia 920 now
let's talk about Microsoft the wall
street journal is now predicting that
the company is working on a 7-inch
tablet and given the fact that the
popularity of 7-inch tablets ever since
the Nexus 7 was launched it does make
sense to finally see this coming in
smaller form factors as it's also
rumored that Windows 8.1 will include
the ability to fit on smaller displays
now that being the fact let's just hope
that this is not a Windows RT thing or
that Windows 8.1 really merges RT with
windows 8 and we don't have to put up
with a meager features but we'll keep
you posted the LG optimus g pro is up
next as well it's rumored that this
device will reach AT&amp;amp;T on May tenth so
if you're interested on an alternative
to the Galaxy Note 2 this is probably
your device but aside from that there is
a value pack that's landing to current
customers of the optimus g pro that will
bring new features and guess what these
features are everything that you saw the
galaxy s4 can do well that's it in a
nutshell i mean if you're looking at a
video for example and you turn your face
away from the device it'll detect that
you're turning your face way and i'll
pause the video you can also take a
photo and actually add yourself into the
frame so Samsung like
right and finally for the funny news of
the day Samson has just unwrapped their
galaxy mega 5.8 and 6.3 jumbo phones and
that's the designator for the screen
size by the way 5.8 and 6.3 as if the
galaxy note 2 wasn't already big enough
but wait here comes the punchline these
are not high-end devices I mean think
about it the 5.8 inch display galaxy
mega brings a qHD display that
resolution I don't even want to
calculate the PPI I think that's even
worse than a typical computer that is
just terrible but that leads you to the
question of the day do you think that
Samsung is releasing too many galaxy
phones that are not necessarily high end
products i mean people think of the new
galaxies as the new high-end Samsung
product but then you get all these cheap
galaxy aces and now we get the galaxy
mega and the galaxy s4 mini and all
these products that just I don't know
they just wither the whole branding I
feel that they're not really doing
something good for Samson especially
when you think about a big phone like
this that won't really add any value to
curtain galaxy customers but anyways
leave us a comment down below I believe
they're doing too much of course it's
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone example robe which you follow
