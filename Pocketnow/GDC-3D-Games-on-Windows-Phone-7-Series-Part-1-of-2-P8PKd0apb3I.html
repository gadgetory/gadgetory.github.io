business microsoft and i'm here to talk
about performance the games on windows
phone 7 series so performance starts
with hardware and in the design of the
hardware business phone we have the two
sets of environments their overall
overarching design Delta this button was
to do the right thing in the end user
and when we talk to end-users about what
they want to see the phone device the
thing we hear time and time again only
one choice they want variety it was a
number of option about sizes and colors
or practices but the other thing users
say is that they want a great selection
of apps and games and to get those great
action games we need you guys to go make
when we talk to developers about what
they want to see in a phone they say we
do not want any choices at all because
everyone to be exactly the same so that
we don't have a reputation in the system
so what we've done is we've built some
consistency in to the hardware across
different phones so the over the same
processor the same top speed 70p unique
abilities the one thing that can vary is
the screen resolution at launch all
photos are going to have an 800 x 480
resolution but later on we're going to
be adding a second resolution 480 x 320
the good news here is that's just two
resolutions it's not
every possible slices great and we have
a kind of land and exporting both of
these resolutions really a little
farther province anyone is that it's a
balancing act there are three competing
practiced at a love triangle you get to
pick any two can't have all three if you
want but at least you go up on the
bigger ones has to go down to compensate
the things that matter of what bravery
what you getting to relax how many was
it cost you to rather every mix-a-lot on
the screen and how many of these pixels
in planning a very sweet fragrance in lo
the phone progress is busy lives 30
frames a second there's the PLC wasting
time
when the war ends of matter in the
excellent breaker game Little Miss
Kercher's when you said that the kind of
target elapsed time you can set it where
at lunch will call but leg factory
service something aya but you're only
been actually be able to draw graphics
to the screen that says you can also set
it lower in there are some games waitin
you really don't need you want to draw
simple lunch thing the second is good
enough of your game design pixel cost
important to understand is how much each
item must meet the two things that
really determined they sell what
effectively using I just take another
quick trip through the five attacks that
you have to play with and share how they
will announce that moves differently
than affect performance be careful
turning on extra lighting your whether
you wore bones and using character
always below decks anon is you're going
to be a pixel cost if you can get
results from changes in the lower left
that's always going to be vaccinated and
then the other thing that affects this
is how many times to my draw page next
year if i'ma story one that is that most
games have it sky and for building and
have another big mythology
that building so you can end up doing
the same pixel doesn't I'm hundred
ninety that other name is a new come
through the roof you get out of control
so you need to watch the stuff there are
many algorithms reducing over drill look
at these other simple things like
mystical things in a very far away use
custom color use hierarchical illusion
systems like the s in trees and a very
simple level just sort all your object
from front back from the close ones
first and then the graphics card
agreements to draw something further
away very efficiently reject that not
bother to correct a very useful tool to
build into your head is an open door
x-ray mode change all your every moment
is known to drop in the texture turned
off editing of the landing and set your
colors and a duck ray if you do a scene
using this every time the pixel gets
quality will get brighter and you can
look at the screen there's something
white that mean you into a lot of times
but we love changing your art work
something out the Bible slider you have
acknowledging these three factors is how
many pixels you read them and this is
what it do some things about the Sun
hard way we have a one where scalable if
you have a control over this choice the
screen display currently is 800 x 480
that's what mother pixels the comparison
the xbox one had twenty-five percent
less pixels and this bonus doesn't
awesome screen rendering tags browsing
the web of singer chris candido very
very nice for intensive 3d games
Texas see my pic something a little
lower different related requests for X
instead most everyday 600 x 360 that's a
neat half is my exes twice which program
network rather a maximum resolution
Robin Christmas but if you want rich to
rename before external more layer the
graphics you may need to reduce
resolution doing this book in too many
GQ it's literally critical piece of
hardware that runs in parallel with
everything else instead of damage to
build up a casa it's a really nice high
quality scale it's not as defined
earlier example instant noodles with
many packs the only thing that this
building is he is extracted from the
device screen resolution I talked about
how they're going to be couple of
different from normal women four factors
with different sized screens you need to
care about that you want to make a game
that renders affected by for action do
it you don't because the phone screen is
smaller we'll use the scalar to shrink
down buildings by and we'll update all
in quite touching work to madness of it
you will need to know that the screen
size change like I didn't maybe 660
will scream let's look at the sched so
here at having multiple system if you've
seen these big before you're probably
wondering why there are no cats in buy
them they are my touch the screen
indicates tax simple little particle
system if I tell have this one right so
I didn't automatically creates lots of
gas which ended up going to the right
it's going to create the ridiculous
number attacks and you'll see the
Frederick's part of the drop description
too many labor and time all scream man
in a little basic x 480 resolution too
many cases so if I click here now it's
running 360 x 600 feelings pretty much
the same the Texas slightly blurry
finish till same inputs the words
between London to 40 my partner testes
blurrier it again but not too bad see
more blurry thing you guys have seen
ever
natural devices later it's it's pretty
good attend the spawn right now this is
a touch is still working even though I'm
rendering a quarter resolution now when
I touch cat still appear in the same
list as I touched on the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
