mid-range market spending a couple
minutes checking out the g5 plus and it
delivers the solid first impression
where we were fans of the g4 Moto's
aesthetic touches and material
improvements are a welcome change the
competition in this market segment is
intense and consumers at entry and mid
price points shouldn't suffer cheap
feeling phones metal construction
shapely sides and some appreciated tech
upgrades the Qualcomm six-to-five has
been impressing a speedy little chipset
that easily provides high-end features
like 4k video recording and surprisingly
quick camera focus the software is also
refreshingly clean the same organization
and layout as a pixel for the most part
under lenovo the g5 continues to
reinforce what we like about unlocked
Moto's with a lack of bloat and
extraneous UI elements customizations
like the twist gesture camera launch
remain and new for this year is expanded
navigation control using the fingerprint
sensor this implementation similar to
what we recently demoed on the huawei
p10 though is finicky in operation moto
might be trying too much from one key
home button back multitasking search and
turning the screen off that's quite a
bit of muscle memory to retrain the only
deal-breaker here might be the lack of
NFC for folks looking to use mobile
payments and we maybe recommend a watch
to fill in that gap but and he's smart
watching my own will likely cost more
than the phone itself the g5 plus will
launch for 229 for 32 gigabytes of
storage two gigabytes of RAM and full
support for all major US carriers
well done moto well done indeed as
always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe for all of our MWC
2017 coverage now that with some sharing
on your favorite social networks for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag now some
gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram and
I will catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
