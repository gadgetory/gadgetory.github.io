hey everyone Daniel Webster here pacu
now calm and today I'm going to show you
an application that's going to help you
conserve battery power while using your
windows mobile Wi-Fi device so the
program is called Wi-Fi monster and
we've slowed here in a second and it
will give you a warning it says it's the
early stage preview so some features may
not work out all that correct and this
program will run in vga and cue vga but
i found that actually runs in WV g as
well so you can select to have this show
up on startup or not so i'll just click
ok and it says says the Wi-Fi is turned
off so if i click right here on this
little world button click there it will
turn the Wi-Fi automatically on and it
says it takes about 10 to 20 seconds
depending on your device so as you can
see it'll show you the networks in range
so it'll automatically connect to this
network which is mine my Wi-Fi router
here at home and i'll show you your
current IP address as well as your
signal strength which is a minus eighty
two decibels and it will give you an
indicator over here kind of like the
bars on your cell phone up here it'll
show you your current speed which is
fifty four megabytes whichever your
speed is it also you bytes received
invite sent if you can see that ok so
cool thing about this is that show you
your current battery power and your
threshold which is mine is set to forty
percent I'll show you that in just a
second ok so if I go into settings it a
lot it'll give you an inactivity limit
so after two minutes or whatever you
select can be three minutes four minutes
whatever you want to be want it to be
it'll automatically disconnect the Wi-Fi
to help conserve battery power and your
battery limit right here select this as
well it's set at forty percent for my
device but you can go all the way down
to ten percent so that means that act
forty percent battery life Maya Wi-Fi
router our Wi-Fi chip will automatically
turn off and help conserve battery power
okay so if I click on the arrow I can go
to options or I can select the tab and
it will show me the welcome screen here
which I can select confirm exit which
will give me a secondary confirmation
whether or not I want to exit the
program you can also select to have the
Wi-Fi turned off on exit and
it gives you a button vibration just
kind of like a touch response if I if
you can hear it it's you can hear the
vibration sound ok so I click over here
to network browser and the signal
strength threshold which is at negative
95 decibels and that means that at
negative 95 decibels the Wi-Fi router
will actually disabled on disconnect it
won't show that network that's in range
so you can also change that to whichever
you want as well I'm Daniel Webster with
pacquiao com thanks for watching i'll
post a link after I've known this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
