is starting to roll out to supported
devices over the air I'm Joe Levi with
pocket now and this is how you can
install android 4.3 on your Nexus 7 or
other Nexus device right now so if you
want android 4.3 on your Nexus 7 or
other Nexus device you can go into
settings all the way down here to about
tablet and then to system updates you
can see here that my system is up to
date well no it's not so we'll check it
now we'll see if there's an over-the-air
update available for me and says as of
right now there is not but if we come
back and look I'm still running Android
version 4.2 point2 and we all know
there's Android 4.3 available so what do
we do well we come in here and we tap on
I believe it's build number several
times until you enable developer mode
I've already done that so it says
there's no need to do that we'll go back
now and you can see here in my settings
that i have developer options so we're
going to go ahead and open that once
we're in here we're going to find USB
debugging well check that we will say
okay it is for development purposes we
know that we don't need to do anything
else and up in the top we see that there
is now a little debugging icon to remind
us that we are in USB debugging mode now
you do want to make sure that your USB
cable is firmly secured because we're
going to be doing a lot of work to this
actually we're not going to be doing a
lot but the software that we're going to
be using is so let's go back home we can
now do whatever we need to we're going
to shift gears over to our computer and
run some stuff if you don't already have
USB drivers installed you'll need to
download those I got mine from the asus
website and i'll have a link to that
down in the description so i've gone
ahead and pointed to it now i'm going to
install this software will install it
it's installing the driver software
which takes just a couple minutes once
that's done this little ! next to the
nexus 7 should go away now switching
over here to our command prompt i'm in
this and
folder in this android folder if you
take a look I've got a DB I've got some
DLLs I've got fastboot and that's where
I put my drivers so we're going to
switch over to a command prompt with
administrative access and from here I'm
going to run adb see if i can get that
better on the screen for you i'm going
to run adb space devices to make sure my
Nexus 7 is being properly seen by atb
and the way you can tell is you can see
up here I didn't have the drivers
installed so it says list of devices
attached and there was nothing ran it
again now that I've installed my driver
and there is a serial number next up we
need to reboot into fastboot mode do you
do that by turning the device all the
way off then rebooting with the power
and the volume down buttons pressed
simultaneously until you see this screen
you can tell it's in fastboot because
right down here it says fastboot mode
once that is done we're able to go ahead
and run some fastboot commands the first
fastboot command we need to run is
called fastboot OEM unlock and then run
that and what it's doing now is its
unlocking the bootloader this is
something that's required if you want to
flash the factory images but it's okay
you can fastboot OEM lock again
afterwards so depending on what version
of nexus you're using you're going to
need to download a different a different
package I am running a nexus 7 that's
the Wi-Fi version only not the Wi-Fi
plus 3G and that is the nkosi code name
I don't know what it means but there you
go so I've downloaded that it's about
three hundred and five min to download
and about 320 Meg once it's extracted
once I have it extracted I just need to
grab all of this and I'm going to copy
and paste it over to the directory that
I have my fastboot executable and I'll
just go ahead and paste those in there
you've got to do that because you've got
to have fastboot in eighty be in the
same folder to make this all work so
once that's done since i'm running
windows i'm going to run this flash all
now this is going to flash everything
it's going to flash the baseband it's
going to flash the the recovery
everything so if you haven't backed up
you two
already you're probably already too late
but now would be a good time to make
sure that you've got everything you need
backed up so flash all we'll run that to
racing boot erasing cash erasing
recovery erasing system racing user data
you can see this is all going through
relatively quickly so I went through and
I ran this again because i was running
into a failed boot one of the downsides
to shooting videos sometimes you don't
read everything that you see on the
screen and i run into a problem with a
loose USB connection while i was sending
system and writing system overhears you
can tell that should take about two
minutes to do all together and i didn't
wait that long and the USB cable got
loose so i went ahead and flashed it
again just reboot up into fastboot mode
again I ran flash all again this time
everything looks like it's coming across
just fine and I'm booting up into
Android 4.3 now if you'll recall first
boots always take longer than other
boots so if you get stuck here at your
Nexus loading screen don't be terribly
concerned it's setting everything up for
the first time and this is going to be
completely fresh and stock just like you
had purchased it today you'll notice
we've got a little bit of a new screen
here at least new by my recollection go
ahead and set up our Wi-Fi okay once
that's done it wants us to set up our
google account we aren't going to say
yes to this right now but we're going to
try and skip this if we can and it won't
let us so we'll just say no and not now
this point we want to go ahead and share
our Google location stuff way we can
have gps and other type of information
here asking for our name so i'll go
ahead and put in my name really quick
that's one of the things that would have
probably pulled across if we do advise
signed in with our google account and
setup is complete just like that we've
got android 4.3 running on the nexus 7
so let's take the quick wat walkthrough
we've got our google play library okay
great we'll say
a we need to login to be able to see
that of course along with these other
widgets but while we're here notice
we've got pretty quick scrolling back
and forth browser that comes pre-loaded
with is in fact chrome so let's fire
that up you can see here we're actually
pretty snappy zooming works pretty well
okay said pretty well come back over
here and see what we've got panning
around also seems relatively fluid a
little bit nicer than what we had with
the the last version but speaking of
versions let's go back and double-check
and take a look at what we've got so
over here in settings will come down to
the bottom I no longer have developer
mode because this is no longer a
modified if you will set up so let's
change that while we're looking at it
here's Android 4.3 our build number is
JW r 6 6 v so in fact we do have the
latest version of android on here will
tap this several times we now have
enabled developer mode so it's going to
our developer options from here we could
do USB debugging we are going to go
ahead and do that a lot of you have said
i don't want to be om unlocked so this
is how you go about changing so that
your OEM locked again so of course with
all fastboot commands we need to reboot
into fastboot mode by holding the power
button and the volume down button
that'll boot you up into fastboot from
there we can run fast boot OEM lock
press ENTER it waits for just a minute
while it's doing it thinking on the
device it says locking now I don't want
to to mess it but info bootloader is now
locked and let's go ahead and reboot and
you can see that our unlock symbol is
now gone away so we'll go ahead and
choose start and that will reboot it no
more unlock symbol down here at the
bottom so now this is as stock as you
can get while still running Android 4.3
so those are the instructions on how you
can get android 4.3 the official rom
direct from google onto your Nexus 7
device now if you've got something other
than a nexus 7 that's just fine the
instructions are exactly the same all
you've got to do is make sure you have
the right USB drivers and the right
software from the developer section and
again those links are down in the
description down below once you actually
get into Android there's not a lot of
differences on the surface we didn't do
an awful lot of walkthrough to show you
all the new and fancy things because
there really aren't any a little bit
early right now for us to tell you
whether the battery life has improved as
drastically on the Nexus 7 as it did
with the leaked version that we showed
you on the Nexus 4 got a link to the
video of that at the end of this video
but stay tuned to pocket now and we'll
let you know if you liked what you saw
here please give the video a thumbs up
make sure you subscribe if you haven't
already and why not share it with your
friends on your favorite social media
networks we're at pocket now on Twitter
and I'm at Joe Levi from all of us
thanks for watching we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
