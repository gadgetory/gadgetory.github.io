stabilization has been around for a
while on the nokia lumia 920 and 928 on
ATT and verizon it's finally t-mobile's
turn to get a nice high-end Windows
Phone this is Adam lien from pocket now
and this is our full review of the
t-mobile version of the Nokia Lumia 925
let's check it out let's start with the
specs it's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM
8960 dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor
with one gig of ram and 16 gigs of
internal storage front-facing camera has
a resolution of 1.2 megapixels and the
rear camera has 8.7 megapixels with
1080p HD video recording and optical
image stabilization 4.5 inch pure motion
HD plus ClearBlack AMOLED screen
features a 768 v 1280 pixel resolution
I've also got Bluetooth 3.1 Wi-Fi
assistant GPS and NFC the answer it's
weight is 135 grams and thickness is
eight point five millimeters Cardinal is
a two thousand milliamp four hour
battery which is not removable key
wireless charging is not built-in either
so to need an attachment to add that
let's take a closer look at the hardware
design of the Nokia Lumia 925 has made a
pretty big departure from the older
Nokia Lumia 800 900 920 and 928 no
longer bought a single poly carbonate
shape with flat ends at the top and
bottom nor is camera flush with the body
instead the Lumia 925 is a completely
new design with an aluminum rim all
around the edges these middle pieces are
the antenna but in practice the
reception seems a bit weaker than
previous Nokia Lumia phones on t-mobile
in hand the Nokia Lumia 925 feels very
thin the rounded middle edges are
actually a bit too thin and slippery to
fix this I added the wireless charging
shell which added some thickness as well
as increase the grip area for a more
comfortable whole wireless charging
shell covers the back and corners of the
device giving a bit more protection to
the corners which could be very
susceptible to being dropped on the
other hand the extra thin profile makes
the phone very comfortable in the pocket
now let's talk about the software
most of our Windows Phone 8 coverage can
already be found in our full Windows
Phone 8 review and we've covered many of
the Nokia customizations in our review
of the international version as well
however there are a few differences in
the two molla version which we'll look
at here the t-mobile audition is
probably the most useful is the Wi-Fi
calling feature this lets you connect to
t-mobile's network using your own Wi-Fi
infrastructure as opposed to depending
on the cell towers that means you can
make phone calls and send text messages
from areas with no reception at all
unfortunately the reliability can be a
bit lacking so I'll keep this feature
turned off when not needed you can do
use it be sure to make the Wi-Fi calling
live tile on your Start screen the full
width size so that you can see the area
messages in my account app is good to
keep around for tracking your usage
though the live tile no longer shows
data usage which is the only aspect of
t-mobile accounts that isn't unlimited
these days they'll have to dig into the
app to find that next let's look at the
camera the Lumia 925 is for the most
part the same camera as the innovative
Lumia 920 that's already been available
on 18 to you for quite a while there are
a few minor improvements but for the
most part the 925 is simply bringing
Nokia's optical image stabilization and
8.7 megapixel camera to t-mobile in the
US the image stabilization
makes video recording movements much
less shaking harsh you can see the
exposure changes are smooth and
autofocus works very well in the
brighter areas but understandably not as
well in low-light audio recording
quality is pretty impressive as well
in terms of battery life I found my
Lumia 925 to be satisfactory that is to
say after I got the Wi-Fi calling cept
correctly before I did that the battery
was dying very quickly of course the
battery life depends on what apps you
are using and all the options you may
have turned on or off but for the most
part I've been able to get through about
eight to ten hours without issue I
should do a k4 device that doesn't have
a removable battery after buying a
wireless charger shell I've become much
less worried about battery life since it
recharges every time I set the phone
down so for those long weekends in the
wilderness I wish I could keep a spare
battery in my wallet
our final rating is going to be in 8.3
out of 10 the hardware the metallic
design the screen the camera the sound
quality the video stabilization and no
keys custom apps are all extremely
impressive the only negatives for me are
really the lack of user replaceable
battery and excessive thinness
everything else on this phone is
top-notch be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
