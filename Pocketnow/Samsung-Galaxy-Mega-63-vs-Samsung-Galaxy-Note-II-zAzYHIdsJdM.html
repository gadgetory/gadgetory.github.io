smartphones go toe-to-toe we're about to
find out I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the Samsung Galaxy
mega 6.3 versus a samsung galaxy note 2
smartphones are bigger than ever when
Samsung announced the original Galaxy
Note we were left scratching our heads
asking why would anyone ever want a 5.3
inch phone in fact we were slightly
confused when smartphones began
exceeding the 4-inch threshold now it's
rare to see a high-end smartphone with
the display smaller than 4.5 inches
enter Galaxy mega Samsung's latest
smartphone brand that's built for Giants
or people who simply want to use a phone
two-handed the mega variant we have on
hand is the mega 6.3 which as the name
alludes sports a giant 6.3 inch display
across its face naturally we have to
compare this behemoth with what used to
be the largest smartphone on the block
now the mega 6.3 is smaller sibling the
Galaxy Note 2 from the instant you look
at either you know their Samsung
smartphones
there's no denying their uncanny
resemblance and there's no deviation
from Samsung's now standard design
language at all we are familiar with the
Galaxy Note 2's build it features last
year's pho brushed metal design with a
classic chrome trim around the edges the
galaxy note 2 is a practically a larger
galaxy s3 with slightly harder corners
and different internals and lest we
forget the S Pen tucked in the lower
right corner the defining feature of the
Note brand the Galaxy mega 6.3 towers
over the galaxy note 2 but if you
weren't looking too closely you might
mistake the mega for the note 2 and the
note 2 for a Galaxy s3 or s4 it's not
exactly easy to portray how large the
mega truly is so here's a size
comparison from left to right iPhone 5
galaxy s3 HTC One Galaxy Note 2 Galaxy
mega 6.3 and the Galaxy Note 8.0 on the
outside the mega more closely resembles
this year's galaxy s4 the edges are
harder the chrome doesn't blend into the
edge of the device and instead gives the
device a distinguished edge and the
pattern beneath the hyper glazed finish
is the same dot pattern found on the s4
around back it has the same camera hump
as the s4 the same flash placement and
the same large speaker
side-by-side the difference in
dimensions is tremendous the mega 6.3 is
sixteen point five millimeters taller
seven point five millimeters wider but
1.4 millimeters thinner than the note2
it's also sixteen grams heavier the
note2 is 5.5 inch display makes it
difficult but still possible with some
practice to use one-handed the mega 6.3
is practically impossible to use
one-handed even with my large hands
there are also some pretty major
differences between the two under the
hood the galaxy note 2 comes with a 1.6
gigahertz quad core Exynos chip set 2
gigabytes of RAM 16 32 or 64 gigabytes
of inbuilt storage with a micro SD card
slot Wi-Fi b/g/n and a 30 100 million
power battery the galaxy mega 6.3 ships
with either 8 or 16 gigabytes of storage
expandable up to 64 additional gigabytes
by way of microSD a 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon 400 chipset 1.5
gigabytes of RAM a 3200 milliamp hour
battery and an IR blaster it also has
Wi-Fi b/g/n and AC both come with 8
megapixel cameras NFC and LTE
capabilities though both are Note 2 and
mega 6.3 or HSPA+ only models both
devices coded in Samsung's so-called
hyper glaze finish or also fingerprint
magnets and they're certainly
lightweight for their size despite being
so light both devices feel fairly solid
and we can't finish the topic of
hardware without addressing the display
differences at 6.3 inches diagonally the
Galaxy Megas display carries a
resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels
mounting to 233 pixels per inch the
Galaxy Note 2 also features 720p
resolution at 5.5 inches for pixel
density of 267 pixels per inch
the note 2 uses Samsung's famed
supersaturated Super AMOLED panel unlike
other AMOLED panels however the note 2
does not utilize the pentile matrix sub
pixel layout making its relatively low
pixel density more bearable the mega 6.3
for a change does not use AMOLED like
the Note 8.0 the mega uses a TFT panel
that's noticeably less vibrant and
saturated than the note twos but it's
certainly not dull yet its blacks are
not nearly as inky and it offers wider
viewing ankle's the low PPI is offset by
the lower dpi setting which manages to
squeeze more information on a single
screen rather than simply stretching
more information across a larger display
in other words interface elements
display more tablet light than with the
note to the meges display is noticeably
brighter than the note twos and although
it isn't the most crisp display ever
there are a few things to complain about
point-blank if you can deal with the
note two's display the galaxy mega 6.3
screen likely won't bother you either
software is an area these two giant
smartphones differ as much as they're
alike they're both running TouchWiz but
the Galaxy Note 2 is still running
Android 4.1 with an older version of
TouchWiz the top while the galaxy mega
6.3 has Android 4.2.2 out of the gate
with the latest version of TouchWiz
comparing the software on these two
devices save for the S Pen features is
almost identical to comparing the
current galaxy s3 software with the
walkthrough of the leaked 4.2.2 firmware
last month the software on the mega 6.3
is similar to that of the s4 software
but it's lacking many of the s4 s buzzie
features like smart scroll smart Paul's
air gesture S health and more however it
does allow air view with your finger
smart stay lock screen widgets and the
updated quick settings in the
notification shade many of these
features are also on the note 2 air view
using the S Pen and smart stay for
example being extra large devices both
also offer one-handed operation settings
and the multi window feature and oddly
enough the mega 6.3 does not offer smart
rotation while the note 2 does outside
the changes brought in the 4.2 version
of TouchWiz and the note twos S Pen
specific software the wears on these two
devices are quite similar though they
have the same icons and widgets TouchWiz
looks the same as it always does and
there's no denying you're using a
Samsung smartphone running Samsung
software in day-to-day operation both
the note 2 and the mega 6.3 are pretty
snappy yes even on the mega 6.3 s
dual-core Snapdragon 400 chipset in fact
the Snapdragon 400 is no slouch the mega
6.3 clocked at 1.7 gigahertz versus the
note 2's 1.6 gigahertz is just a bit
snappier when you're turning home
opening apps switching apps and pretty
much all lightweight tasks and both of
them seem to handle gaming quite well
running synthetic benchmarks tells a
different story however and n22 the
Galaxy Note 2 ran circles around the
mega 6.3 consistently scoring over 17
thousand while the mega scored in the
11000 range every time
the two were closer using the quadrant
standard test both averaging around 6600
and in Geekbench to the Galaxy Note 2
scored over 2,000 every time while the
mega 6.3 hung around 1600 as per usual
with TouchWiz there are some small
instances of lag here and there and
thanks to X voice there is a constant
hesitation when pressing the home button
but that can be disabled in s voice
settings
we haven't really had the mega 6.3 long
enough to talk too much about battery
life but there are some quantitative
means of at least roughly estimating how
battery life will be the galaxy note 2
has a 3100 milliamp hour battery and
large display it usually manages to last
all day through some heavy abuse with
relative ease the mega has a 32 hundred
million power battery but a much larger
display and a more efficient Snapdragon
400 chipset at the very worst the
battery life might be shorter than the
note two's but we imagine they will both
be in the same ballpark about a day's
usage the note 2 in galaxy mega 6.3 both
come with LTE connectivity but both of
our units are HSPA+ only and both are
running on AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+ network in the
Charlotte metro area the Galaxy Note 2
averaged just over 5.2 megabits per
second down and 1.1 megabits per second
up the mega 6.3 average 6.6 megabits per
second down and one point five megabits
per second up the mega proves to offer
faster speeds but negligibly slow
considering both Samsung devices have 8
megapixel cameras we were hoping the
differences between the two would be
very slight in fact since the mega is
running a newer version we hoped it
might be even a little better and would
include all the s4 camera features
unfortunately this is not the case the
camera software is missing pretty much
all the galaxy s4 s new camera features
such as drama shot and dual camera it
does use the new york-- cleaner
interface but as far as software goes
that has a little more than the Galaxy
Note 2 the camera apps only look
different and the output from each is
definitely anything but disappointing
but the Galaxy Note 2 seemed to handle
various scenarios a little better
both were pretty poor at low-light
performance offering images full of
noise and artifacts but in well-lit
scenes the cameras performed on par with
one another providing the same balanced
tones and rich colors where the note 2
managed to edge out the mega 6.3 is
exposure the mega was quick to
overexpose and blow out whites it's also
worth mentioning the mega 6.3 like the
s4 comes set to a 16:9 shooting mode out
of the box instead of being set to 8
megapixels as advertised it's set to 6
megapixels and crops vertical pixels to
give the illusion of a wider shot of
course this can be changed in the
settings both the Galaxy mega 6.3 and
the Galaxy Note 2 will be too large for
comfort for most users they
without a doubt gigantic phones but for
those willing to carry a smartphone
which rides a line between phone and
tablet both are great options despite
the differences in specifications the
two devices are on a fairly level
playing field if you can come to grips
with using the note 2 a primarily two
headed device the jump to a 6.3 inch
phone as absurd as it may seem is not
all that difficult if you're even
considering the Galaxy mega 6.3 or
Galaxy Note 2 both are worth checking
out in person but true power users may
want to err on the side of the note 2
with more RAM to more processing cores
