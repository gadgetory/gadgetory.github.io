pre-order and launch dates for the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 rumors continued to
hint on 3 2018 iPhone variants and what
the changes will be and once source says
that the Trump administration wants that
nationalize 5g and another debug set I'm
Jaime Rivera and believe it or not I'm
already out of my daily dose of coffee
and Monday is still not over
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals as well
Android wear smartwatches aren't
necessarily having their best time we
haven't really seen any new watches we
were expecting at least one or two at
CES didn't happen and now
Verizon's of you know they're weird 24
SmartWatch it's currently available for
up to $50 if you follow the link in the
description with the coupon code that's
down there 50 bucks is crazy it's worth
it now let's talk about some very
interesting news that developed today
this morning we had some leaked
PowerPoint presentations of the Trump
administration wanting to nationalize 5g
over a whole concern about national
security and then by the afternoon we
had FCC chairman already chiming in
saying that there were no plans to do
that that the administration would even
not you know follow up or even to a
certain degree support any sort of
nationalization of the spectrum let's
see what ends up happening over time now
let's talk about Apple as we hear that
the company is not having a good time
with iPhone 10 sales up to the point
where we heard the rumors of the company
was way below the predictions of
analysts and also the company's
predictions up to the point where we
hear that Cupertino might even be
cutting down production up to 50% and
why do you think that is I think it has
everything to do with the price tag but
that's just me now since we're talking
about iPhones let's discuss the recent
of rumors coming from kg iseman chic
whoa
whatever he shines in on anything these
things usually happen we're talking
three iPhones and you know the whole
detail of the post includes who's going
to manufacture what
and that I'm not gonna bore you with
that specification and let you know for
example screen sizes we're talking about
a phablet at six point five inches a
regular sized iPhone 10 whatever that's
gonna be at five point eight and then
the mid the middle one is the 6.1 inch
iPhone that's apparently going to be of
an LCD display price tag of that one is
apparently according to many quo going
to be between seven to eight hundred
bucks so that follows on other rumors
that we had heard all right don't
understand exactly what the ideal will
be of this mid iPhone that's not
necessarily mid-range in price but then
again apparently according to the rumors
the other iPhones will cost more than a
thousand bucks still so that's gonna be
kind of crazy and finally the very hot
news today I have to do with the samsung
galaxy as night and as nine plus yes
this phone is going to take over the
hottest news for as long as we probably
get close to MWC and you know what makes
a lot of sense that usually is one of
the hottest phones of the year this time
we hear possible launch dates at least
for Korea March 2nd pre-orders March 8th
to launch and this is a little later
from the previous rumors that we had
heard which is kind of odd usually
Korea's first and then everybody else
gets the phone whatever the case may be
in today's question let us know I mean
there are a ton of deals right now for
the Galaxy s8 are you using these deals
to get a new phone or are you waiting
for the Galaxy S 9 in my case you know
the differences between the s 8 NS 9
don't look that significant but I could
be wrong we'll keep you posted on the
news and let us know what you think in
the comments down below
