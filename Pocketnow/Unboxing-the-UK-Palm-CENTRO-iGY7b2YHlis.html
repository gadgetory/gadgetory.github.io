and this is the unboxing video for the
UK sim free palm centro so let's take a
look what's inside the box when you get
your palm centro first of all you come
to your usual collection of manuals so
what have we got we have a quick
reference guide which is a complete user
guide showing you how to use the Centro
hardware itself and the software that's
contained on there there's a CD which
allows you to install software onto your
desktop or your laptop this allows you
to copy files music files and video
files from your desktop to your palm
centro and also synchronize things like
your contacts and your diary there's a
leaflet which shows the accessories that
are available for the palm centro and
i'm sure these will grow as the launch
takes off there's a list of support
numbers should you need it for America
Asia Pacific Europe across the world for
all the contact details for support and
a reedus first it's a quick user guide
which shows you how to go about charging
your charging your new central and the
accessories that you'll get inside the
box now just bring the device itself to
one side for a second let's see what
accessories we have inside here so the
first thing we come across is this
distinct cable which is one end this is
the USB for going into your into your PC
and the other end is a proprietary
connector which will synchronize and
charge the the Centro when it's
connected to your PC the headphone that
this supply is a single mono earbud
which acts as a hands-free kick you can
also listen to music but obviously it's
still only going to be mono on that now
this is just a pre-launch release
version so then that they may be an
intention for them to put a set of
stereo headphones in there because it
does play music and is aimed at that
young market so that there may be a set
in there this is yet to be confirmed the
charger is a proprietary charger which
fits into the bottom of your
of your your palm centro and a standard
block charger that plugs into your wall
now the thing that I like about this
which is quite clever is you can
actually eat gummy you can see here it's
got the UK standard fitting on there but
if you just pop pop this off underneath
it seats late like on date on the ipod
charges it's got the u.s. fitting there
as well and it also comes with with
Europe and Asian fittings on here so
you've pretty much covered for most of
you travel throughout the world for
charging your sentra wherever you go so
that's what's in the box now moving on
to the device itself as you can see it's
quite small it's as they call candy bar
sized fits nicely in the hand it's got a
320 320 touchscreen it's fairly slim
just running around the device
underneath there you can see there's the
the connections for synchronizing and
your proprietary charger slot there and
just underneath there is the microphone
hole as well on the side here you have
volume controls of down volume controls
and there's also a button there which
you can program to be kind of a hot
button that you can use for any
accessories that you want on the top and
as familiar with parm you've got the the
button that allows you to switch from
ringa to vibrate which is handy if
you're in meetings you can slit you hand
in your pocket flip it across and the
sound goes off on the side they're still
there still keying in there with an
infrared connector and just below it
only if you can see that there is
actually a little door there and that's
where your your your micro SD memory
card goes and there's also a little look
just on the corner there which allows
you to connect the lanyard if you like
to pop it around your wrist just for the
Nexus extra security looking at the
front of the device below the screen
we've got the power on and the standby
button and then the receive calls button
and you've got quick access to to to
your
your applications through through four
independent key buttons there and you've
also got the d-pad control with the the
central selection key with the palm logo
on the sensor there i'll leave the
keyboard to last because I'll just flip
over to the back here now it's got a 1.2
megapixel camera which does video and
still shots unlisted there they're very
good quality considering it's only 1
point 2 megapixel but they're very good
and and it's it's got the speaker there
for playback of your video now if i look
at the keyboard i was i was when i first
saw this keyboard i was a little
suspicious of it shall we say because it
looks it looks a little bit fiddly to
use but i don't know if you can see in
there in profile this actually got
beveled keys and they're rubberized so
it's actually very easy when you're
using it to feel which key you're on you
can you your thumbs tend not to press
three or four keys at once it's very
accurate and quite sensitive and i'll go
through that in the demonstration that i
do later so there is the UK version of
the sim free palm centro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
