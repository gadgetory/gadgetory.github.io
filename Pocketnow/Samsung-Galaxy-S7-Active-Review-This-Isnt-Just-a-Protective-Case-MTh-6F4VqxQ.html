was either a step into a sturdier device
for the clumsy or a rugged device for
the brave but never a device that was
made to be a true flagship 2016 is a
different animal it's time for our final
verdict on Samsung's latest iteration
I'm Jaime better with pocket now and
this is a review of the galaxy s7 active
we spent the last 10 days testing
comparing and to a certain degree
beating up the galaxy s7 active this
being my first experience with the
lineup at first I followed the opinion
of many commenters in wanting to torture
the device but the more I use this the
more I'm convinced that this device
serves a very different purpose to be
fair the name active doesn't really
stand for rugged instead of competing
with the cat or Kyocera smartphone that
you'll see at a construction site this
device is meant to serve a niche of
active users like the case of the GoPro
cameras be it a runner hiker or the
average fishing trip this is the
flagship phone you take through the
great outdoors from the soft touch
plastic on the border so the metallic
trim to the textured back the feel is
premium all around and even warm to the
touch the 5.1 inch AMOLED panel at the
front follows the high-end results of
its siblings even providing support for
the always-on mode that we enjoy and the
polycarbonate layer protecting it along
with the protruding borders doesn't
really determine the experience for the
first time ever even the spec sheet of
the active matches that of its siblings
pointing to a device that was made
without compromise the software
experience follows the same mentality
we've discussed this more in detail in
our recent comparison with the galaxy s7
but in a nutshell if you've seen one
you've pretty much seen them all from
the launcher experience to the smooth
navigation of its menus to the almost
stutter free experience of everything
except the Flipboard menu this is pretty
much a galaxy s7 in every way whether
you're pushing the limits of a favorite
game doing simple tasks like email or
pushing data speeds or the average phone
call the active shines in every way a
flagship should I would have really
loved to see more active features
focused specifically on the niche that
it intends to serve but that's really
just in the software department if
anything the differences that come
bundled in the active actually lead to a
superior experience features like the
active button it's customizable
shortcuts and it's active
you are extremely convenient the choice
for hardware buttons instead of
capacitive is more practical in
day-to-day use in addition to improving
the experience when trying to use the
camera underwater the device continues
to be ip68 water and dust resistance
along with milspec 810g specifications
which bring benefits like withstanding a
fall from 5 feet and surviving a swim in
salt water and then the larger 4000
milliamp hour battery just takes the
cake and landing a solid battery life in
addition to supporting fast and wireless
charging even essentials like the camera
on the s7 active are a true delight for
the most demanding of users all galaxy
s7 variants have proven to offer some of
the best camera experiences of 2016 and
for the second consecutive year the
active variant follows the trend great
color saturation and deep contrast
amazing low-light a great wide-angle
selfie camera and one of the best video
stabilization experiences of the year
this is definitely the phone you want to
take outdoors for that perfect shot the
only thing we really need to clarify yet
again is that the active does not mean
that the phone is rugged a few test
drops have left a couple of dents on the
corners and even the fingerprint scanner
has faced some significant signs of wear
along with minor scratches on the
polycarbonate layer of the display but
no you don't really need to strap a case
around it as the soft corners do a great
job at hiding the scars but that doesn't
really mean that the phone will go and
scathe after a fall to summarize the
experience the galaxy s7 active may not
be an indestructible phone as many might
think but this could easily fall on the
list of the best smartphones of 2016
you've got all the benefits of the
galaxy s7 but killing the anorexic trend
of flagships by going thin and light and
instead offering a substantial bill
that's far more usable than just
strapping a case around the phone really
if it wasn't for this device being an
AT&amp;amp;T exclusive it is definitely the
smart phone to beat in everything else
for the same price tag of the galaxy s7
edge I would even be inclined to
recommend that you go active instead of
the edge and that applies even more of
your daily schedule includes a hike a
run or a trip to the beach
