pocketnow.com here at mwc in barcelona
checking out the first HP tablet of
notes in a while the HP slate 7 let's
take a quick tour so as you might
predict this device is running Android
but let's take a look at the hardware
first we take a little spin around here
the back is coated in a sort of a soft
touch material that is actually a whole
lot more like it feels almost like a
composite or something like that it's
very difficult to describe but the
weight feels really good in the hand is
not the thinnest tablet ever as you can
see but it's also not the thickest feels
a lot like the google nexus 7 the camera
on the back here is not present on the
Nexus 7 but this one is quite low as in
the resolution at three megapixels you
can see the HP logo called out here as
it would have been on the touchpad go
and as it was on the pre three back in
webos days notice the Beats Audio
branding here which gives this device
some form of distinction on the software
side we come around to the front you can
see just volume rocker on the side power
button on top microsd expansion up to an
additional 32 gigs you're going to
probably need that if you get this
tablet because internal storage is
limited to eight gigs so you're going to
definitely wanna pick up microSD card if
you do pick up this device here's your
headphone jack let's turn on this 7-inch
display which has a kind of a strange
resolution at 1024 x 600 and it is an
LCD technology side viewing angles are
pretty ok 44 an LCD obviously you're not
gonna get the deep blacks of an AMOLED
panel and this displays running very hot
right now we had them turn up the
brightness so we could actually see what
was going on this is running stock
Android jelly bean actually for 12 as I
recall and it you can see so we're not
going to show you a skin HP didn't throw
anything and kind of exciting on here
front-facing cameras 1 megapixel unit
there's not a whole lot going on with
this device that is entirely remarkable
it's going to go on sale sometime in
March for around 149 euro HP is saying
which equates to live by the low 200s in
American dollars we should have some
more insight on this on this device it
kind of expecting something maybe a
little bit more
blockbuster ish from HP on their first
android tablet attempt in a long time
but once again it's just initial
impressions over our first couple
minutes with the unit michael fisher
with pocket now with the HP slate7 stay
tuned for a lot more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
