company's latest and greatest flagship
and a successor to one of our favorite
lineups the V has always been about
embracing creators with amazing tools
that are hard to find in other phones
and this time it has spelled at an
insane amount of cameras I'm high metal
even up with pocket now and this is our
full review
LG has always been a brand that I'd
consider misunderstood in the smartphone
world they've launched some of the best
smartphones that we've tested over the
past few years and yet I feel that they
don't have the popularity that they
deserve take the hardware for example
this phone has five cameras yes and
insane three at the back and two at the
front sure the v40 looks a lot like its
predecessor the b35 but once you hold it
you'll also notice differences there's
an interesting beveled finish in the
glass and a slight curve that was absent
in its predecessor and it also seems
like the weight distribution was changed
the result is a phablet phone that feels
very light and pleasant in the hand this
seasonless black color variant has a
nice shade of blue when you shift it but
boy does it love fingerprints we've got
a gorgeous six point four inch quad HD
plus full vision OLED display with HDR
10 capabilities color saturation is on
points with deep blacks and I really
just find this to be an overall
beautiful display yes it has a notch but
it compensates with one of the smallest
Chin's I've seen on a phone yet like if
you notice the bezels at the top of the
bottom this phone looks symmetrical
everywhere again except for the knotch
I also love that this is probably one of
the coolest always-on displays in the
market with awesome ways to tailor it to
your heart's content to assist with
content consumption we have LG's
signature boombox speaker at the bottom
the series for yes it is not dual firing
but just like in the case of the g7 you
can try covering it all you want
the phone is still using the body as a
resonance chamber to provide audio
regardless so of my advice give it a try
placing it on a wooden table and notice
just how loud this phone gets when you
unbox the LGB 40 we have a shammy for
those of you wanting to keep your phone
clean then we have the v40 front and
center and the usual literature that
most of us will ignore we have a fast
charger along with a USBC cable inside
and even if we don't get B&amp;amp;O headphones
in the box there is a pair of LG
headphones that can
the 32-bit quad deck that LG devices
have been famous for for those of you
that are really into audio quality
because yes there's also a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on this device
aside from that tucked inside we have a
new Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor 62
bytes of RAM 64 gigs of expandable
storage there's a 3300 milliamp hour
battery with fast charging capabilities
through USB C wireless charging in
addition to ip68 water and dust
resistance and milspec 810 durability
standards now as much as I'll praise the
hardware package for the most part my
complaints begin with the software and
sure I will admit that there's really
nothing wrong with LG's UI from a
usability standpoint I just find it to
be dated and really just unnecessary
it's really kind of odd considering that
LG is already launching variants of the
g7 with Android one out of the box you
do have options to use the app drawer in
case you don't like your icons scattered
all over the UI which I use primarily I
do hand it to LG for this being a very
fluid UI regardless I love that the
Google feed has now replaced the
company's useless dashboard to the left
I do prefer the setting and I also love
how LG embraces the Google assistant
with a dedicated button as every phone
should and then one of my favorites is
the fact that you can extend the
navigation buttons at the bottom to make
one-handed use more practical on such a
large phone the UI is also good about
handling day-to-day use with zero lag
since I began using the device and with
gameplay being the least of my problems
design began using it and sure I know
that a lot of you don't have a problem
using the UI as it is my biggest
complaint is really the fact that this
phone is still running Android 8.1 Oreo
at a time when Android Pi has already
reached devices like the oneplus 6 now
probably what I do love the most is that
regardless of my complaints about the UI
the smaller than average battery on this
phone has zero problems when it comes to
endurance I've been testing the LG v 40
thank you for about more than a week in
new york city and i seriously
haven't had a problem this phone ends
the day just fine and always has enough
juice left to spare and then when it
comes to phone calls I'm honestly not a
fan of the offset earpiece but the sound
quality is plenty loud regardless and
when it comes to data speeds like this
phone has no problems whatsoever which
is one of the things that I praise about
devices with Qualcomm modems now when it
comes to cameras more lenses is great
but not necessarily better when it comes
to implementation and the back we have a
standard 12 megapixel F 1.5 aperture
camera at 78 degrees of field of view
and 1.4 microns there's also a 16
megapixel wide-angle camera at F 1.9
aperture and 107 degrees of field of
view and making its first appearance for
LG is a new 12 megapixel telephoto lens
at F 2.4 aperture and 45 degrees of
field of view with 2 X optical zoom at
the front we have an 8 megapixel
standard camera at F 1.9 aperture and 80
degrees of field of view and a 5
megapixel wide at a 2.2 aperture and 90
degrees of field of view I know not much
of a difference and the reason why I
mention implementation is because the
only place that I find lag on this phone
is at how long it takes to launch the
camera and how long it takes to
transition from one lens to the other
I'm hoping that this is a software bug
as other enhancements like manual
controls for photo and video are still
the gold standard for smart phones and
pretty much only provided by devices
from LG but when it comes to photography
really I do praise the results from this
phone I love the company's approach to
saturation and detail sure they might be
a little oversaturated for some of you
but I love color so for me this is great
and then the flexibility of the
wide-angle lens makes the option for
epic photography so cool whenever you
need it
low-light photos are also impressive as
we do have some sort of a night mode
that uses pixel binning here the amount
of detail is great from the primary
shooter thanks to the larger microns in
addition to the pixel binning and then
there are also some fun modes like
letting you take three photos at a time
and different angles and even make a
small zoom video in case you want to
keep a moment from different
perspectives I find that to be genius
portrait photos are not necessarily my
favorite on any phone and LG does a
decent job I would say though I'm not
really a fan of how it handles lighting
and it does offer portrait lighting
options that I haven't really cared
about much and since we're talking about
portrait photos I have to say that
selfies on this phone are also good
given the flexibility of the wide-angle
I'm not really a fan of the dynamic
range even when HDR is mentioned but
they're good in most scenarios I would
say LG is also finally taking the jump
out of the box in providing 4k video at
60 frames per second and 240 frames per
second video at 1080p with HDR
capabilities there is no digital
civilization being mentioned at 4k at 60
if you go down to 4k at 30 or 1080p at
any frame rate you do have digital
civilization being provided and I love
that LG has done away with all the fake
sharpening that I didn't like in its
previous phones video is warm balanced
and pleasing you can also switch between
the regular and the telephoto while
recording which I find to be great
though if you want to do that with the
wide-angle you'll have to record a
separate video
fair warning the digital stabilization
is kind of warm P when you walk but
that's usually the case with most
smartphones today and then in the case
of the selfie video recording Department
sadly you cannot switch between cameras
but at least you can pick the crop that
you want
what's the belies a ssin being provided
on both
to conclude I have to say I am honestly
very impressed
and that's actually a trend when it
comes to LG phones I've been a huge fan
of their hardware choices since the g6
and this company really knows how to
make a beautiful phone that's well SPECT
and that's what I would really call the
full package when it comes to features
like seriously I have no problem in
recommending any LG phone so far
obviously not everything is perfect
I wish the software was better the
camera software definitely needs some
tuning and I'm having a hard time
swallowing the nine hundred dollar price
tag depending on your carrier or options
still I mean let's face it there are
other phones that cost more than the v40
and give you two less cameras and far
less granularity and controls in
addition to awesome features like a
headphone jack and the quad deck like
seriously if you're in the market for a
great phone that's plenty capable and
want to get creative about photography
and video I would say that this is it I
would definitely recommend that you give
the LGV 40 thank you a try so far this
is definitely one of the best phones of
2018 folks let us know what you think
