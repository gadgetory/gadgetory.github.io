new one mini 2 miniature yes but with
the fit and finish meant to make it
impossible to ignore its flagship
ancestry so if the larger one m8 caught
your eye but proved too big for your
hand is the one mini to a viable
alternative or has HTC made too many
sacrifices in its quest for a smaller
footprint it's a good question let's see
if we can answer it I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow and this is HTC One mini
2 versus HTC One m8 if you're wondering
why HTC didn't just go ahead and call
this the One m8 Mini well from a
physical perspective that's
understandable the one mini 2 uses the
same planform
the same aluminum housing the same
speaker configuration and it even comes
in the same colors as its larger 4runner
in the hand
despite being significantly lighter it
elicits nearly the same feeling of
quality to look a little closer you
start to notice where corners have been
cut just like on the last one mini a
plastic border takes over from the
aluminum at the phone's edges and the IR
transmitter at the top has been ditched
replaced with the relocated headphone
jack the buttons on the mini don't have
the satisfying click they do on the m8
the screen size is of course smaller on
the mini but it's also a different
display technology at a lower resolution
it's tough to see the pixel density
downgrade unless you're getting an
eyeball right up against the screen but
the m8 s--
richer colors definitely pop more in a
side-by-side look we don't like it's
much warmer whites much but the
higher-end phone does offer slightly
darker blacks onto the hood one of these
is a muscle car while the other is well
a respectable compact there's a gigabyte
worth of difference in RAM here and
while each offers microSD expansion up
to 128 gigs the One m8 comes in a
version that brings roughly double the
internal storage and at the heart of it
all the one Mini 2 brings a snapdragon
400 to the table quad-core yes but no
match for the raw power of the
Snapdragon 801 in the One m8
the important question is how much
difference does that make on a
day-to-day basis and the answer well not
much at all
with each phone running sense six atop
Android 4.4.2 the software experience is
almost identical and that's true of
responsiveness to multitasking doesn't
seem impaired by the reduced RAM on the
one mini to the only way we could force
an app crash was to juggle two memory
intensive games and app launch times are
about the same from blinkfeed to
browsing to media to gaming these phones
both deliver like dominoes now that
being said there's no question that the
one I made is the phone we'd choose for
high-end gaming the beefier GPU in the
Snapdragon 801 enables better graphics
in some games and results in a smoother
framerate and others plus the larger
more vibrant higher resolution display
is a real treat on the m8 and you've got
a bigger battery and better boom sound
to boot also the m8 s-- sensor core
allows for conveniences like gesture
based unlocking of the screen while the
one mini two makes you hunt for the
mushy standby key still frustratingly
situated up top plus the m8 s larger
size allows for a more spacious keyboard
it's the little things that remind you
which of these is the flagship and which
is the tag-along you might think that's
not the case in the camera department
where on paper the one mini twos 13
megapixel camera handily beats the four
megapixel shooter on the one m8 but in
low-light those ultra pixels and the
larger phone proved their worth here's
the USS excelsior shot by the one mini
two in a very dim room even with night
mode applied we're not seeing much here
now here's the same fine vessel shot by
the One m8 boom and let's go darker
here's a subway tunnel photographed by
the one mini two in automatic mode and
here it is with night shooting enabled
here's the One m8 stake of the same
scene is there any doubt which one of
these you'd rather have in a low light
situation turning the light up a little
bit we still mostly like the m8 s photos
better
no you can't zoom into them as much as
the nine or 13-megapixel shots from the
one mini but the one who mates slightly
wider angle captures more of a scene and
just look at the color differences here
the experienced I might call the one m8s
photos oversaturated and over sharpened
and our own Adam Lane goes into detail
on this in a photo shoot out between
these phones over at pocket now linked
in the description but on the whole we
think the m8s photos sure do look a lot
less washed out you also have a wider
range of options on the m8 including the
unadulterated Zoe experience and the
bouquet effects enabled by that special
depth finding sensor but some of that
can be approximated on the one mini to
buy for example apps like Google camera
in video it's more of the same brighter
colors with better mid-tones on the m8
we even prefer the One m8 for selfies
despite the front-facing cameras here
being the same resolution and ostensibly
situated behind the same wide-angle lens
again check out our full photo
comparison at pocketnow.com for some
deeper thoughts on how these cameras
compare for now we'll just say that
despite the resolution golf we'd take
the One m8 pictures over those of the
One mini to any day of the week same
goes for the boom sound speakers which
are quite impressive on each model but
the one mA it's larger chamber size
gives it an oomph that the littler
device can't quite match
it's tougher to find a difference on
earbuds though if it's there we can't
pick it up and callers are similarly
circumspect when it comes to identifying
which of these sounds better they can't
pick a winner and neither can we each
device performs quite well on a TTS
network in Greater Boston and New York
City in speakerphone mode of course the
One m8 still enjoys a slight edge and
it's larger battery means it usually
lasts longer as well we have more on
these points in our full review of each
device physically there are many
advantages to the one mini to those who
love the look of the m8 but ball cadets
pockets training size may fall right in
love with the smaller sibling and people
who hold resolution above all else in
the camera front will also be pleased
the 1 mini 2 doesn't measure up to the
one I made on the spec sheet but then it
wasn't designed to and it really doesn't
need to day-to-day it performs
excellently
despite its mid-range processor as heavy
users we'd of course prefer the m8 for a
daily driver and we continue to hold out
hope that someday other manufacturers
will follow sony's example and bring top
shelf specs to a reasonably sized
chassis until then those who want the
look and feel of a flagship without
splurging on the extreme high end will
definitely appreciate the added choice

thank you so much for watching this has
been michael fisher with PocketNow we'll
see you next time
that's a question worth answering and
this is HTC One mini 2 vs. HTC ma'am it
bit me m8 One m8 I'm Michael Fisher with
pocket now with HTC One mini two versus
it against HTC One m8 HTC they let me
Nene Nene I'm Michael Fisher with pocket
now and this is HTC One m8 Mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
