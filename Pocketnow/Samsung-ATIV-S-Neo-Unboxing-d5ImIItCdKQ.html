also with one exception the first
Windows Phone 8 device to come to sprint
and it's also the first Windows Phone
we've seen from Samsung in a little
while so let's unbox it I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is the
Atia s neo from Samsung for Sprint let's
see what's in the box so right off the
bat here folks I can tell you that
Sprint has changed its packaging
approach this is still a 100% recyclable
box as its called out right here but as
you can see it is not quite the dingy
cardboard packaging of your it is still
cardboard maybe a little tough to see on
camera but they've taken the grain out
this is a much more khaki colored smooth
packaging and it's quite nice gets a
colorful phone image up front they're
calling out the 1.4 gigahertz dual-core
processor we'll talk about that in a
second the HD display Windows Phone 4G
of course covered up the barcodes there
and a couple contact bits let's see if
we can get inside the box I believe
Samsung beat us inside to put a sim in
but they should be the only people
who've been inside beside us we'll open
it up there's that device front and
center looking a whole lot like the atif
s that we reviewed Wow back in December
I think I don't remember I reviewed it I
really enjoyed the attea ves so I was
excited to get my hands on this one
we'll take a look at the hardware in
just a second we'll put it aside see
what comes in the box should be
something a little bit more than the
typical power cable here these are
hitting started guides and envelope to
send back your old device if you so
choose
sprint big on the green thing even as it
concerns phone recycling USB cable power
adapter we're used to seeing probably a
1 amp version there now headphones I was
momentarily excited I don't know why I
expected headphones maybe because they
were included with the 8 XT as I recall
feels like the battery is in this device
it's a little weighty see if we can move
the mic for a screen protector removal
well we've maxed out the gained on the
mic and we are ready to pull the screen
off silence please
anyway back to business on the front
side here this is a slightly bluer
device than the the Atif s which we
reviewed a while back looks like that
back protector off of there now
underneath this cover I'm guessing we're
going to find a removable battery much
as was the case on the progenitor device
yes there it is SIM card under there and
there's our microSD expansion expandable
memory removable battery Samsung you are
an old reliable manufacturer of
customizable mobile phones and we
appreciate it that covers gonna go back
on power standby key should be on the
right here that's where it is two stage
camera button all this feels a whole lot
like it did on the achieve s which
shouldn't surprise anyone volume rocker
on the Left headphone jack up top from
Qualcomm sticker USB port down below
with the microphone there this is a big
I believe a four point eight inch panel
probably a malevolence press and hold to
get power on hoping there's some juice
in there
this device is powered by the device as
an SOC in the Snapdragon 400 family it
is an MSM 8938 a which doesn't seem to
differ too much from the standard MSM 80
930 but we'll get into that in our
comparisons and in a review if we make
it
the only thing Samsung is going out of
its way to call out with this device in
terms of features is the achieve beam
feature which is a lot like s beam you
know that looks like an LCD which is a
lot like s beam as featured on its
Android devices welcome to your TVs new
there's our Windows Phone startup screen
and will just let you have a look at the
device here
and during the break folks I was able to
confirm that this is an LCD panel on the
front not the AMOLED as we saw on the
classic TVs it is a 4.7 7-inch display
at 720p the battery capacity is 2000
milliamp hours under the cover there and
the weight is 144 grams a little heavier
than we are used to so we're gonna take
a look at this device as I say we're
going to have either a comparison and a
review or just a comparison we will have
coverage on this coming up in the days
ahead for now that is your unboxing of
the achieve s neo for sprint by Samsung
as I say folks even if we don't get to a
full review of the achieve s neo which
we might but we might not we will at
least do a comparison video with the HTC
8x T so you know what's going on if
you're a Windows Phone buyer on Sprint
in the meantime please drop us a like if
you enjoyed the video follow us on
social media so you don't miss future
coverage on this phone and every other
one we can get our hands on and make
sure and subscribe if you want to see
future videos leave a comment down below
if you have something to say and we'll
see you next time thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
