on AT&amp;amp;T the 5ge symbol has started to
roll out a new picture of the galaxy s
tenant pearl white color has been
published by Evan blast and t-mobile is
promising to maintain prices and they
merge with Sprint for three years I'm
Jaime Rivera and well definitely
Tuesday's are better than Monday's
Monday's are not better than anything
but news are great today this is a
bargain out daily the official news
today begin with the gift that keeps on
giving which means Apple's bad results
as we've seen the iPhone se being sold
as refurbished now we have the iPhone 10
back at it again from the grave
currently for 749 and $8.99 which means
I mean come on Apple like seriously
that's your discount for refurbished
products you get better discounts on
Best Buy I believe right now for the new
ones but anyways now let's talk about
the Moto Z for play I mean we're hoping
that this phone launches soon and you
know that this has always been the
premium mid-range Urfa moto that I
rarely cover the reason why I care is
because even if it has mid-range specs
apparently it'll include a 48 megapixel
camera provided by none other than the
same providers that make the cameras for
some of the best Huawei cameras right
now I believe it's called cue point
that's the name of the company so uh
stay tuned that's actually gonna make
that mid-range err interesting now let's
talk about the Samsung Galaxy S 10
obviously the rumors that we keep
covering every day but today fremen
blasts we have a color option that I
actually like it's pearl white we assume
that's the name we've been dubbing it we
don't have an official name yet
but it looks a lot like the pro white
that we get on the Huawei p20 Pro so
yeah maybe that's the case I love that
color option now let's talk about the
feature of Sprint and t-mobile their
merger in the FCC as one of the biggest
concerns from the government entity is
for prices not to go up the less
companies you have there to compete and
so t-mobile is promising that they'll
keep the prices for three years but the
interesting part is when if you remember
a t-mobile and Sprint said that the
reasons
they wanted to merge us because they
wanted to have a more robust company to
provide 5g and we're not expecting 5g to
be at the same price as anything that
currently exists so let's see how that
ends up
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with a very interesting twist and
you have iOS 12.2 beta you will notice
that now the signal bars indicate 5g es
for 5g evolution on AT&amp;amp;T and well it's
official pretty much from companies
right now AT&amp;amp;T claiming that you will
get that indicator if you're in a 5g
evolution capable area and guys I've run
all the tests you can think of showing
that the iPhone 10 has has trouble even
providing the same gigabit LTE speeds
that you get from devices like the
Galaxy Note 9 or even the oneplus 60 so
in today's question let us know what do
you think how would you call this that's
happening between Apple and AT&amp;amp;T I would
call it the seething marketing because
we know that even the 2019 iPhones won't
have 5g so what are we gonna call
gigabit LTE 5g now you know that's not
the way it works leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
