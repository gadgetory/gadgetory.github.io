pocketnow.com this morning Google
started rolling out the Android 4.2
update to their Nexus 7 and the gsm
version of the galaxy nexus phones of
course that means you're going to be
getting the update whenever you get the
update unless you want to go ahead and
get the the manual update and go through
a whole bunch of interesting stuff to
make that work so really quickly I'm
going to show you how to do that on your
Galaxy Nexus and then i'm going to show
you roughly what it looks like in some
of the new bells and whistles and a
little tip that you won't want to miss
out if you get into the developer
options at all near the end of the video
you won't want to miss that let's get to
it
now for this to work right you're going
to need to be running a stock rom not a
custom rom however if you're running a
custom recovery image might make things
a little bit easier however if you're
running a custom image a custom rom like
cyanogenmod or AOKP it's going to make
things a little bit tougher in fact
you're probably going to want to revert
to stock before you do this the next
thing all this is going to be done at
least through this method through adb so
you want to make sure you have your
device all hooked up and recognized with
the drivers loaded in in device manager
for a DB how do you make sure you got
that well simply come over here to your
SDK folder type in adb space devices and
enter if you've got a device listed in
here you're good to go you're connected
now you're probably noticing this side
load what is that well a lot of times
you can get a kind of a slimmed down
version of fastboot with ADB I haven't
had any luck with that I had to go to
the full version of the SDK to get this
to work your mileage may vary but it
doesn't work in the slim down version
try the full SDK next thing you're going
to boot up your device and essentially
you're going to boot it up into
bootloader and then do a special key
combination essentially the volume up
and the power button at the same time
and with enough monkeying eventually
you're going to get to this it is
essentially a side load version of a
flashing utility so kind of cool it lets
you slide load OTA updates very cool so
let's go ahead and do that the command
to do that is a DB space side load now
the the slim down versions might not
have this side load function and give
you an error if that's the case go with
the full version the next thing is I
need to put in the file name of that rum
and of course it's a dot zip and at that
point I'm going to hit enter and it's
sending it over nothing's changing their
on my screen so you can tell just going
through the percentage once that gets
all the way down it's going to run
through a whole bunch of different
things
doesn't look all that pretty or
entertaining on the device itself now
this is the gsm version of the galaxy
nexus you're probably going to need
another version for the cdma versions
however this should work in both the
yahoo and talk jus varieties however
this is specifically for talk to so now
it's done I just need to reboot so I'm
going to hit the power button to tell it
to reboot got a little vibration wiggle
on my phone I've got the google logo
notice it's not unlocked this is
completely stock going on from here so
it's going to go ahead and do the setup
just like you'd normally see pretty
boring to save time we're going to skip
over to the nexus 7 that i have already
done and i'll show you what what you can
do there and some fun stuff with android
4.2 so remember so what we've got first
of all you're going to notice that we've
got a nice new clock up here and some
panels that we can apparently add stuff
to so let's go ahead and drop the
calendar in there there's my calendar
let's come over and let's drop the sound
search widget in there and now we can
flip between them and we don't even have
to unlock the device really kind of cool
let's go ahead and unlock will do that
now i'm over here at my about tablet you
can see that this is version jo p40 see
and it is android 4.2 the new flavor of
jelly bean now something that you might
not see in here is developer options we
like doing all kinds of stuff with
developer options connecting by atb and
whatnot debug mode so how do we get that
go in here into your settings i'll show
you how to get to settings in just a
minute hit about tablet and then down
here just tap on the build number a
bunch of times so ready let's go
123456789 okay you see that told me that
I was just a few taps away from being a
developer and now i'm a developer so i'm
going to put that on my resume now
google says I'm a developer because I
pressed that so now we should be able to
get into developer options just like we
were before it's just kind of hit
so that the typical end user can't get
into it accidentally so how do we get
into settings you'll notice when we pull
this down there aren't any settings in
here just my normal little slider thing
there's no more lock on the top like
there was before if I try and do a two
finger pull down I don't get settings so
hey what's going on to get into settings
and that nice fast toggle screen just
grab on your menu bar up here I don't
know what we call that and slide it over
to the side and if I do it right sure
enough it pulls down with this other
shade that says who I am this is the
logged in person of course this is a
tablet so you can switch users now and
it gives you your quick toggles and of
course lets you go into full-blown
settings right there go ahead and try
the multi-user here's me I apparently
don't have an icon associated with me
but there I am maybe that's not having
anything to do with switching users just
showing you who the currently logged in
user is of course we'll get to play with
this quite a bit our auto-rotate has
moved down there so you could see just
pull that again so we can lock rotation
there rather than just getting to it
from from there all right so lots of
other cool stuff obviously inside this
let's see if we can find some stuff one
of the things that everybody's been
wanting is the the new gmail stuff
where's my gmail there's my gmail so
here in gmail let's go ahead and open
this up and from here we can show
pictures and this doesn't have an awful
lot to show but we should be able to
pinch to zoom you see if I can find some
some spam for us over here in marketing
that's always a good place to find it
and go to Google Offers show pictures
and this isn't letting us pinch to zoom
but that's because there is a new
setting if we go in here to settings I
believe its general settings
we should be able to see something do we
see it do we see it auto fit messages
right there check that let's go back and
now all of my rich HTML messages are
automatically fit on the screen and if I
need to get in and see more detail I can
pinch to zoom just like that so very
cool there is your second tip now of
course things are going to be just a
little bit different over on the phone
version rather than the tablet version
but overall it's very nice you can see
all of the cool stuff right in there
we're going to go one last place and see
if we can find where to set up that
multi-user stuff and this is the first
time I'm seeing this guy so if you're
wondering why this is first hands-on
first look it's kind of hard to swipe
that when you're when you're doing it
left handed off camera so you know so
over here on their device we have a new
option called users will open that up
and here is me my nickname my owner info
and I can add a user just right in there
very simple like you'd expect all kinds
of cool so if you want to get the files
that you need to either do this on the
Nexus 7 or the Galaxy Nexus head over to
pocketnow.com will have links there will
have some rough instructions on how you
can do this based on the method that you
saw here will also give you some hints
on how to do it if you are if you're
still stock but you're rooted and have a
custom recovery image installed as well
if you like the video make sure you give
it a big thumbs up if you're eager to
see Android 4.2 on your device give the
video big thumbs up for pocket now
showing off Android jelly bean the new
flavor I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
