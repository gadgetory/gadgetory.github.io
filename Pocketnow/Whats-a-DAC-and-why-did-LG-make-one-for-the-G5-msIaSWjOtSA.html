playback on their smartphone of course
they do what a foolish question I'm Juan
Carlos van nelle for pocket now and
we're going to take a quick look at
smartphone audio quality just as a quick
introduction I've worked in audio for
well over a decade I got my start
working for a voiceover talent agency
and then moved over into voiceover
casting and throughout that entire time
I was also regularly found on film sets
working on documentaries as a sound
supervisor or as a location sound mixer
audio has been really good to me and
this is why it's such an important topic
for me to discuss when we start looking
at the newest advancements in smartphone
technology recently if you caught our
coverage of MWC 2016 you probably saw
quite a few videos on phones like the
galaxy s7 and the LG g5 specifically the
g5 bringing a number of really
interesting accessories to the table
we've got that really nifty grip to help
turn your phone into more of a
point-and-shoot style camera but the one
that was most interesting to us audio
geeks is the new DAC that clip-on piece
on the bottom of the phone which is
supposed to radically improve headphone
audio quality and of course we've got
top-tier audio manufacturer branding
through Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen but what does
that actually mean what does this thing
do and what benefit will that actually
serve consumers and for the purposes of
this video we are going to focus on
headphone audio playback when you say
things like the one m9 has terrific
speaker playback you pretty much always
need to add the suffix for a phone now
LG is far from the first company to
champion higher quality audio playback
Apple still has a tremendous reputation
for headphone playback built largely on
that legacy of iPod devices HTC as we
mentioned before has these boom sound
front-facing speakers but that boom
sound branding also talks about the amp
which is built into the headphone jack
on phones like the m8 and m9 even
Samsung starting around phones like the
galaxy s5 each successive generation of
galaxy device has taken steps to improve
upon the headphone playback over its
predecessor but until recently LG was
something of an audio outlier and not
really in a good way last year's phones
like the G flex 2 and the g4 both
suffered from hissy or tinny somewhat
brittle audio reproduction from
headphone jacks this was likely a cost
savings measures we get phones like the
LG g4 which could handily undercut
pricing on phones like the galaxy SX but
that all changed when LG introduced the
v10 we got major talking points not only
about content creation but also content
consumption and one of the shining crown
jewels of this phone is its high quality
DAC what the heck is a dak dak stands
for digital to analog converter chances
are probably pretty good that if you're
watching this video now on the youtubes
that most of your music collection is
not on vinyl or on reel-to-reel or some
kind of audio tape but exists as a
series of zeros and ones in digital
files on some type of hard drive or
flash drive but at some point we have to
take those zeros and ones and convert
them into waves of energy which can
travel through the air and interact with
the two manic membrane in our ear which
we call sound now between zeros and ones
and acoustic force we have an
intermediary step where that digital
information is converted into an
electrical signal and that tiny little
electrical signal is what's responsible
for wiggling the magnets in our
headphones and speakers the digital to
analog converter in any device is what's
responsible for babysitting that
transition now the v10 actually has two
different digital to analog converters
one of them is the DAC that's just built
into Snapdragon chipset so when that
Qualcomm provides for all phone
manufacturers and that's what's going to
handle most of the heavy lifting on your
phone when you're taking phone calls
you're utilizing the built-in phone
speaker you're not really using the high
quality DAC the secondary DAC only kicks
in in specific audio situations and only
when headphones are connected to the
phone which makes sense because you
don't really need super high quality
audio playback all the time and having a
separate piece of hardware dedicated to
converting a higher quality audio signal
will result in slightly higher battery
draw as a lazy analogy the DAC that's
built into the Snapdragon processor is
probably gonna be fine but that's a lot
like the onboard sound that you'll find
on the motherboard of a laptop or a
desktop if you need different or better
audio capabilities then you need to
invest in a different piece of
stand-alone gear and that's what the ESS
DAC built into the v10 and included in
the accessory clip for the g5 is going
to bring to the table it's not going to
have all this stuff it's just going to
have higher quality
back there's a little confusion on the
v10 because when you plug in headphones
you'll see a high quality DAC icon at
the top of your notification tray but if
you're running a stock phone it's only
going to kick on when you're using the
LG supplied music player app or if
you're utilizing some kind of
third-party tweak from a site like
xda-developers now the DAC is
responsible for managing that transition
from digital file to audio signal but
along the way we have to boost the
electrical output of that signal and
that's where an amp comes into play
short for amplifier as in we're going to
take a tiny little electrical signal and
amplify it so it can properly drive
audio reproduction hardware like
headphones and speakers and it's those
two pieces which are responsible for
higher quality or lower quality audio
output not only does the v10 have a
really high quality DAC when listening
to music it also has a very high quality
amp to make sure that it's properly
driving the headphones that we plug in
by comparison and someone please correct
me in the comments if I've got this
wrong but I don't believe HTC uses any
really special or separate DAC in their
phones but they do utilize extremely
high quality amps to make sure that that
headphone playback is loud and punchy
and vibrant so why is this important I
mean you're probably only going to be
listening to music on your phone while
you're sound tracking some other
activity like you're focusing on your
workout you want some sort of movie
soundtrack background sound to motivate
you through a run and you're probably
only listening on really low quality
audio files right like the mp3s you
ripped from your Napster's on your
Pentiums back in the day man I'm old
drizzly for a lot of people out there
maybe it's not that important if you're
just using the nearly disposable earbuds
which came with the phone or if you're
using some kind of bluetooth solution
then you're already crafting a music
listening experience which circumvents
most of the hardware built into these
devices and that's what's kind of
interesting about LG strategy here on
the g5 versus the v10 the v10 has this
Hardware built-in you can't unbaked that
pi you're going to pay for that higher
quality audio kit whether you use it or
not but the g5 is giving us an
opportunity to handle a majority of
smartphone users out there well I'm sure
the headphone jack and the g5 is going
to be fine but for those of us who want
to take that experience to another
level we now have an audio accessory
which builds into the body of the phone
in a much more seamless fashion and some
of the other standalone DAX that we've
seen in the past that connect through
some kind of USB port then have a lump
which sort of dangles off the phone and
then you have to manage that not unplug
it and then plug your headphones into a
separate piece of hardware but it's
absolutely delicious once all of this
comes together the headphones that you
really enjoy wearing paired with the
device with a nice amp and a good high
quality digital to analog converter
everything opens up and we get more
nuance the highs of your audio will
Sparkle and shimmer as opposed to
sounding piercing or tinny or brittle
the mid-range is going to have far more
clarity you'll be able to pick out
instruments in space you won't lose
distortion on guitars and speech will
become far more clear and the base is
going to Rumble but you're not going to
lose out on the clarity of an instrument
like an upright bass or a cello and it's
not going to overshadow the mids and the
highs and that's why we Audio geeks have
been so interested in what LG is trying
to bring to the table this year not only
have we seen rapid improvement in audio
quality from the g4 to the g5
but this also introduces the idea of
building more modular pieces into our
phone Android in its current state does
a pretty terrible job in general of
managing USB audio connections even
though the g5 requires you to reboot the
phone when you pull out the battery and
you use those accessory clips it should
bring greater stability when actually
using the device to playback audio
hopefully there will be fewer instances
of that hardware locking up or flaking
out because LG is designing specifically
the interfaces by which those components
will talk to the phone and to Android
and of course we're just barely
scratching the surface on the wonderful
world of audio as it pertains to mobile
devices and not the least of which is
just getting better support for
recording and hopefully we'll be seeing
more traction on that in the years to
come while this video has taken a very
general track on explaining terms like
DAC and amp I hope we'll be able to
expand on that conversation in the
comments below get a little more
technical get a little more nitty gritty
and hopefully get into some really fun
audiophile debates as always folks
thanks so much for watching be sure to
