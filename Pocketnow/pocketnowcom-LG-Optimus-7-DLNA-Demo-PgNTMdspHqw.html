pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a look at a great feature of the lg
optimus 7 which is branded point 2 it's
basically an implementation of DLNA and
it will allow you to playback music
videos or pictures from your handset to
any DLNA enabled device so let's take a
look
DLNA is the technology which allows you
to playback multimedia from one device
to the other wirelessly so let's say
you're out for the day and you go visit
a friend you want to show off the
pictures you've taken so you hook up
your device with his big-screen TV and
you playback your pictures music or
video wirelessly what you will need is a
DLNA enabled device now the
implementation on the lg optimus 7 is
one-sided meaning that it's only
server-side you cannot stream from any
other device to the Optimus 7 but you
can use the optimus 7 to stream to other
devices what we have here is ABC running
Windows 7 and Windows 7 pcs are DLNA
certified as they combine into in
Windows Media Player 12 which allows
streaming what we need to do is start up
the Windows Media Player application and
go to stream and check allow remote
control of my player that's all you have
to do on your PC on the other end you
will need the lg optimus 7 which we have
right here and you need to start the
play 2 application for this to function
the handset has to be on the same
network as the device receiving so let's
say we want to stream pictures we are
taken to a screen where we can select
pictures either one by one or we can
select all we can select by album or we
can select by favorites and all we need
to do is push this little button here
and it will start streaming there you go
and it already appeared on the screen
let's make this full screen and
navigation is as easy as pushing the
next button
and as you can see pictures are streamed
to the big screen
let's say we want to stream some music
now as far as music is concerned DRM
protected files cannot be streamed but
all the rest can let's just select one
artist here one album and one song and
it will start playing you can then
select the next song so it's easy as
that and if you want to stream some
videos it's the same thing you have to
do you have to go all the way back and
select videos and we have a cameras
camera test here let's try to play that
back yeah it's playing that beautiful
hey everyone this is anton the united
front pocket not have come and today
we're taking a look at the camera on the
lg optimus 7 so this was a short
