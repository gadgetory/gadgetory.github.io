smartwatches that seem almost
universally designed for men Huawei
might have something for you I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow here at CES 2016
in Las Vegas with a quick look at the
Huawei watch for ladies if you read our
news story at pocket now you'll know
that there's basically nothing new here
in the basics on the inside this is the
same hallway watch we reviewed a few
months back from the 42 millimeter
casing - the OLED display - the Android
wear platform that means it's just as
thick as the other versions which might
still keep some away but the rose gold
casings have been specifically designed
to appeal to the female demographic at
least from hallways perspective and
while I'm not a jewelry critic I have to
admit that these actually look pretty
good in person new leather bands flank
rose gold plated stainless steel casings
adorned with either a knurled texturing
on the bezel or if you're really fancy
embedded Swarovski cubic zirconia its
flashy but again in person it's not as
overwhelming as it sounds and the
different band designs and available
custom watch faces make for a pretty
alluring wearable I think $4.99 and
$5.99 are still way too expensive for
any Android wear watches even if their
names are elegant and jewel which they
are the platform's still got some rough
edges to be ironed out as I said before
the watch is still pretty thick but if
you're a lady or a dude who likes his
gemstones shopping for a SmartWatch in
2016 your options are still pretty
limited and Huawei has built one of the
prettiest ones out there we've got a lot
more from Huawei and everyone else in
Las Vegas so stay tuned for more at CES
2016 rolls on until next time has been
michael fisher with high out of houston
behind the camera thanks for watching
I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
