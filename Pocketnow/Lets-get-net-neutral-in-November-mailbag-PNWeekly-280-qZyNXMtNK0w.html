mailbag answering your questions this
week we're also gonna have a quick chat
about net neutrality because a lot of
news went down there and we've got the
top stories from pocketnow.com plus a
special guest straps by to help his ring
in the holidays at OU human will join
the conversation we've got a lot to talk
about so make sure you're charged and
ready for episode two eight zero the
PocketNow weekly recorded november 26th
at noon pacific this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables and
the industry surrounding them it's all
the stuff you wished existed when you
were a kid and Thanksgiving wasn't just
an awkward shopping speed bump on the
way to Christmas I'm Juan Carlos bag now
editor at pocketnow.com joined as always
by plucky podcast producer mr. Jules
Wong has gone buddy boy I mean I just
relaxed over here at hiatus house which
we're both in different rooms and and
it's nice to be what in the same realm
as someone and you know we'd have a real
time conversation just as we had with
Rhydon last week well and it's hilarious
you guys are actually like owing the
bandwidth to try and keep two streams of
Google Hangouts Google thinking of a
streaming video service going which is
amazing but the spoiler that that Jules
just delivered in that little intro is
that dude hi Otto is on the show how's
it go man it's going good I'm still
tired cuz yesterday we took an impromptu
trip to Chicago to visit another
PocketNow alumni but doing all right but
some good travels and again I just have
to ask you guys all well fed from from
last week you guys get your your
stuffing your turkey all that fun stuff
overfed nice good that's the way to be I
in our family Thanksgiving is a
week-long celebration of cooking and
eating through all our favorite
restaurants and all of our favorite
recipes so yeah that's cool yeah yeah we
spent the weekend in Albuquerque and had
a really full house and Lex was bouncing
off the walls like every every well
sugared and well-fed two-year-old should
be well I mean
that's the only way a two-year-old
should be so the only way it's your
fault should be is again you're so
grateful for manual modes on smartphone
cameras otherwise she would have just
been a blurry streak in every photo not
being able to lock down that shutter
speed so yeah
good times for all and we hope to
continue those good times into the
latter part of this weekend when we're
trying to get ready for the work week
and we're just trying to stuff this show
in so that you can have a little bit of
excitement after all that shopping and
whatnot if you want to participate in
this show would gladly have you want
hash tag P and weekly on Twitter would
be the best place to leave your comments
leave your questions leave whenever
you'd like tech related and as always we
have this end of the month mailbag that
we're doing now and if you want to
contribute something to that too you can
do so at podcast at pocketnow.com that's
podcast at pocketnow.com as well as the
pn weekly hash tag all for you and we
certainly appreciate it
ya know this is a this is the the new
structure of the month is making sure
that we're getting to that mailbag and
having listeners take the wheel more
frequently than we used to where it
would just be sort of whenever was a
slow slow news week you know people
people wanted to actually talk about
things that's where relevance but hey
you know good times we already have a
lot of chatter we unfortunately our
schedules just got crisscross so we we
put up a tweet yesterday saying we were
gonna go live so we already have a
number of great tweets Jules you've got
the actual emails but I think we do have
a couple news stories that we want to
chew through from the the top posted
stories at pocketnow.com yeah indeed so
let's just choose through them because
we only have a few of these through them
the week of Thanksgiving like we're
eating them like their food I know but
speaking of that if you're trying to get
to Grandma's or to your son's house or
where but you're trying to
run through the through the woods is
that yeah the woods over - I don't know
but if at least if you if that house was
in the 48 states the lower 48 as well as
Alaska you had some tested you know the
roads they are kind of tough in the salt
air I don't know it's like it's like
this is how they're testing the thing
but anyways like this group did a
testing of highway reception on all the
major networks and they found that AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon basically traded first place
in terms of coverage and in terms of
speed and then the bottom two Sprint and
t-mobile of course we're still kind of a
you know where they're at and you know
we've been hearing a lot of narratives a
lot of a lot of yelling from John ledger
of team oh oh hey we're improving our
network or more people and we're getting
more speed and we're actually faster the
Verizon now so it's kind of this may be
that might be true and maybe you're
getting all these tests in Alcala
conditions or whatnot in terms of just
having a good old-fashioned you know
high budget you have to go through all
these roads and all this network to find
you know empirical results I think the
global wireless solutions is the firm
that did this did a pretty good job in
terms of covering all their squares so
there you go there you go thank you
so we're loosely structuring this week's
podcast I thought you were gonna hit the
news block and then we'd go back and
talk about the carrier's I don't know
how I know what's going on with t-mobile
man they keep saying they're like super
good and stuff and they're still not
super good so you just get like a like a
team oh guy on the phone and say hey six
months ago I was throwing this to you
awkward
let's save our choice it was great in
Indianapolis still but we went to the
one plus event in New York last week and
that was all of Manhattan t-mobile was
really rough for me so it's the same
experience I've been having was to print
out here like in the valley sprint took
a long time to get there there cell
tower reduction initiative underway
where they were at one point supporting
five different wireless technologies
between Nextel their actual CDMA LTE and
WiMAX and it's still out here in the
valley you'll hit one block where it is
it's almost literally block to block
where you'll hit amazingly fast
downloads and then you're on like 0.8
megabit per second CDMA 3G and then
you'll drive a little bit further in
your backup - what's like we sort of
expect from an LTE speed it doesn't it
doesn't surprise me that the humongous
infrastructure that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
sort of had subsidized early in the
carrier game has now grown to a point
where they're more ubiquitous when it
comes to some kind of actual usable
coverage and there's always that figure
of oh that Sprint breaks out of we're
within 1% reliability of Verizon and
even you know forget the fact that the
difference here is more like maybe 10%
or something like that
the what we're really trying to say here
is like what's the difference between a
98% reliability rating and a 86% that's
it's a 12% difference but what does that
actually mean for you know completing
downloads and completing streaming and
you know if one if one tests gets moved
from LTE back to 3G back over again does
it stop does it fail at some point or
does it just actually go through I mean
there's still a lot of new ones that
could be had I think the network
analytics in terms of global wireless
solutions they said that Verizon had
much more network load and that they had
older technology
so even with those second-best speeds
and best coverage so well in high is
this kind of data the kind of data that
you think actually moves the needle on
consumers doing business with the
carrier I'm sure to some extent I mean
when I was working at t-mobile pretty
much everybody would come in and ask you
know hey I'm on Verizon I'm on AT&amp;amp;T and
everyone look I've a look of a coverage
map but I don't know if numbers really
mean all that much to the general
consumer as much as you know just just
an infographic or even Network out a
good pretty picture will go for her to
be about myself too I'm pretty I'm
pretty sold on a picture before yeah you
just throw numbers at me like what those
excuses where they jump on to a
different network just because there's a
phone on sale and oh wait it's on X
network I'm not gonna go on X network
because anymore I don't even think that
having special deals on phones really
moves the needle much on carriers I
think I think the dollar amount is now
becoming one of the primary factors and
yeah that's where I think t-mobile was
was really making their headway on 18
T's investment in their business a
couple years back from that failed
buyout that's to me I think has been the
biggest play the fact that they have
been improving their network in city
centers that's obviously a benefit but I
think subsidizing their their packages
whittling down their options and making
their plans as simple as possible for as
many people to kind of figure out a
family smart phone plan has been the
biggest win for t-mobile and that's
obviously an area that it took sprint a
long time to even start competing
against they don't have quite the same
panache as John Legere does whenever he
does these uncarrier announcements yeah
and when ledger and like just goes at
that there's still just marketing it's
still just you know saying that we're
the best for and just really when it's
our job to really this
okay this is the best for this kind of
easy this is the best for that kind of
user and with these you know parameters
so vague and you know we can't cover
them all in the best way possible it
just makes it harder for us to really
say okay this is the definitive network
for you and Renata Laporte using the PN
weekly hashtag on Twitter just showed
his t-mobile download and upload speeds
using a speed test well but 257 Meg down
45 Meg up you got a love small countries
that's t-mobile in the Netherlands and
because that's faster than my home cable
connection because that's why they're
competing with actual data services and
ISPs and carriers in the United States
in a capitalist country when you can
just have two facto monopolies instead I
mean that's fine that's totally great
we'll get to that in just a minute now
because we got some more news and this
one a little bit more on the developer
side but we'll just I think we can get
through this so Swift we know it has an
open source code of apples choice but
Google has apparently been working on
this more and more as the founder the
creator of Swift has joined Google on a
software engineering capacity but in any
case we've seen a Google make its own
repository for what it wants to do with
the code and there's also this new
branch towards the mysterious fuchsia OS
that we've been hearing about on and off
and used to be this like Andromeda a
kind of operation that we were talking
about it was being rumored where it
merged Android with Chrome OS and now
the main speculation about fuchsia is
that this will get Google off of Android
off of the Java base that it's on
because it's still fighting horrible
after what eight nine years almost a
decade now for you know just copy
pasting some code
of saying it's fair use so that debate
we're still rages on in the meantime
we're not even sure if this will get
past all the hoops and barriers it needs
to to survive so there you go
but Swift's at Google they're really
trying to branch out into more languages
we have seen we've seen that with
Cortland for Android recently and I
think people say that it's the best time
alive the best time around to be a
developer so yeah so what key word do
you use hi Otto since Jules isn't gonna
throw too high there of us and he's just
gonna say that there you go I have no I
don't know what the lineup is guys I
can't help you segue if I don't know
what the stories are what what keyboard
are you using on your phone right now
you're using I'm using the Apple
keyboard on Google keyboard all the way
yeah I kind of stopped playing I like
Swift actually Swift was the was the
keyboard of choice before Google sort of
made there's more easily accessible but
anymore the combination of Nova Launcher
and Swift is kind of just what I turn to
one thing that I think it's kind of
interesting did you guys catch the story
this is sort of tangentially related to
this do you guys catch the story about
project treble as we go with Oreo
forward that because of treble and
because of the way that updates are
going to be rolled that this might
actually deliver an easier pathway for
developers to do custom roms so that
when updates are pushed that they can
utilize the services of project trouble
to keep custom roms better up-to-date I
was wondering what you guys thought that
if that might move the needle a little
bit more on some of these non Android
one but less expensive or mid-range ER
phones that always seem to sort of die
on support after a year or so
yeah definitely code I mean that's but
that's sort of kind of like a like a
user done sort of Android one on their
own you know like like it like a DIY
Android one program may be hosted on XDA
I'm sure the other hands I mean if
you're talking about official support
which people are just it comes with the
box it comes with the phone so if you
want comfort support from the company
you can get it but if it's only going to
last a year I don't think they still
have to dedicate a person to dealing
with the Galaxy j5 prime king edition
you know those kinds of things so it's
it's getting to the nuts and crannies of
all that it having to dedicate even one
bit of labour to that you know her to
support just well thousands of people
but it's it's certainly not it's
certainly not the way that project I
mean project rebels great in general
that's in terms of us that I think will
be kind of tricky is Google is putting
the crackdown on the implementation of
their api's like how accessibility
options were being used very creatively
for example is a more recent kind of
shut down or crackdown so they're
looking at stopping apps from miss what
what I think Google would consider a
misuse of the API
so if project trouble only extends into
the developer space as a way to kind of
create custom roms I wouldn't be
surprised to see a Google backlash
against something like that that's not
really what the intended use of trouble
was unless these developers can make
sort of a good faith argument that
they're keeping their base of users well
supported using these Google tools but
again they're not going to have any kind
of certification process through Google
for a custom ROM building because if
they want to work with Google's whatever
assets they have to serve both sides
they have to do software and hardware
and it's just because yeah it's not
really this really makes sense for them
to not
I'll do that so we just got another
tweet using the P n we I mean we've
gotten a bunch of tweets using the P n
weekly I don't want to make it sound
like you guys aren't talking we're
seeing the chatter here like what every
seven minutes but um this is from Andrew
Wallace just kind of commenting back on
speed test runs so with Renato getting
what is it 2:30 2:30 down and 45 up in
Central Missouri right now I'm cricket
well you can have the fast high speed
data download 4 megabits per second and
4 megabits upload
that's some Screaming fast data I have
to wonder plan and what whatever is
because already you're topping out at 8
megabytes per second by being on
tricking that's their stated speed cap
if you're on the unlimited like white
plan it goes down to 3 megabits per
second so I mean we're not really that's
the conceit of a teen teen zone like hey
we're gonna you know make sure that
you're serving all these people or we're
going to reduce the quality of the
service so that we can price it cheap
but not as cheap as the other as the
competition because really why would we
want to do that when we can make more
money and have less stress on our
networks so high oh I need you to get on
the phone with John Legere and figure
out what's going on alright David I read
it I read a speed test a few minutes ago
I got 45 megabits down on t-mobile so
Legault 1/5 the speed of the Netherlands
is what you're saying
yeah which is you need to get on the
phone you need to figure this ok I'll
get him on the Hangout right now I know
we need answers to these questions I'm
getting 176 dad what project Phi I don't
like up the wahoo for this but yeah I
mean running that speed test Jules just
kicked you over into your next gig
though so that was an extra 10 bucks no
that's true exactly I mean they prorated
so it's like you know a dollar 86 or
whatnot
yeah great great I'm paying pay more
alright let's get digging to a little
bit serious subject here wondering which
one of you would be more inclined to do
a rideshare or something like that as a
passenger or is a driver
I mean well if Europe I mean in Ebers
case this affected both but they had a
date have reached that this happened
back in October 2016 and it was found
out in November by then CEO Travis
kalanick he has since left the company
but apparently the point man and all
this is the firm's security head who was
now under investigation and basically
they just kept this you know they it was
fifty-seven million customers and
drivers and that information was names
it was email addresses it was not
payment info or anything but into up to
six hundred thousand of those drivers
did get location data compromised so and
also their license numbers to which is a
huge deal and this has been an ongoing
ongoing thing with uber where they've
hit in and have treated customer privacy
security very poorly and have gone out
of their way to run amok and away from
regulators by concealing their
activities so that's one side of the
story and then there's also the second
side of the story that Kyoto might be a
little bit more paged in terms of
Google's activities for Android users -
oh sure I mean let me let me pull up the
story I want to say I'm a lot more
familiar with the uber story personally
oh yeah let's talk about uber I mean
you've you've written it several times
I've used it on a daily basis just to
compute
when when it's like 2:00 a.m. and the
subway systems closed the to think that
you know when you're not aware of what's
being done when you're just relying on
our interaction between you and your
driver and then having the company sort
everything out you know and then you
realize oh it's this giant obelisk that
is uber that's you have to be angry at
because in order to make the service
possible with contractors and all that
you have to unload a whole bunch of tech
supportt stuff that people don't
necessarily have to see and if something
like this got out I would understand
that they would be a little bit more
suspicious of the service so well again
it's it's what it's the public facing
and the customer relation side of this
business so we're talking about Google
powered mobile devices keep tabs on you
and then through Wi-Fi connections and
cell towers they're tracking locations
and they're using that data and we know
that they've been doing this for a
significant period of time to make their
geolocation services more accurate
what's more disturbing about the uber
situation is that this breach happened a
while ago and that there was no
disclosure about what happened and what
information was was leaked and that if
if some of these reports are accurate
that uber was in the process of paying
off hackers to try and keep the story
quiet not in you know disclosing that
they had been compromised making sure
that their users were were safe the
hackers had found a way into this data
and ubers reply was to try and bribe
them to keep quiet about it which seems
way worse than when you find out that
your your Google powered device is
tracking your location which we all kind
of know it is because we're using
services that rely on our location and
Google's serving ads on our location
you're gonna see
very very of that you know you're
specifically opting out of Google's
services and yet happen just live by
Google's you know apps without those
services if you can I think the major
problem with that was that they
outsource all their you know
transactions from out of Google into a
third party and that has been collecting
all the location data regardless of
whatever agreement that you made of
Google anyways what I'm saying is the
difference is that lets say that third
party entity had been compromised by
people trying to get into that system
and get user data and instead of
reporting that to Google or to the users
that third party data collection service
paid off the hackers to try and keep
them quiet that's what that's why it
worse I'm not saying the Google
situation is good I'm just saying the
reason why this uper situation should be
more enraging to the public is again
every single time a company screws up
it's an opportunity to join the
conversation with your users and to try
and engender some sense of security or
good well uber has dropped the ball now
a couple times and this is again a
service that I've ceased doing business
with when I do ride-sharing I do lift
I'm sure lift isn't any better secure
then then uber but they've yet to fail
me in the way that uber has just
demonstrated that they can't keep data
safe yeah and if they can't keep data
safe then I mean in terms in addition to
all the judgments it makes on issues
such as
surge times at JFK when there's a whole
protest going on I mean that's I don't
know why people why investors continue
not on launching money into this thing
but it's still it's still alive it's
still losing money and it's still a
thing so it's still a thing
it's still fun no matter how much we
want to we want to put it away
johaido tell me why is her your favorite
ride-sharing
well I have a treatment of employees or
is it all the data breaches what do you
like better I also only use lift when I
can but I I do kind of wonder what it'll
take to make sort of the general public
turn their backs on uber because no
matter how many things like this keep on
happening consistently it seems like
uber is still yeah is still I think
they're they're still far outperforming
lifts I could they are guys this factor
of maybe two or something like that
there are they're still on Google Maps
as a suggested ride share option and on
several other transit based apps that
suggests right share it's usually uber
that they have it's that name
recognitions that kind of you know name
that's like great or a powerful in
German that's like they're super so and
they're just more sleek they have all
these other options that make it you
know cool they if you want to get a limo
a little bit after uber X are either
black or nine right there they have more
fleshed out options they have more
people and people kind of like they have
they have more leverage to hire drivers
with like introductory bonuses so then
lyft has been trying to start to do that
but it just hasn't been able to match
the pace yeah man this is the person you
want to talk about personal driving for
just a second or not even person driving
let's talk about this country this
startup this this thing that I think
there's a person called Elon Musk
involved I don't know I've heard of that
guy and I sounds like he does the men's
cologne line right yeah yeah anyway so
these things with Tesla going on with
its rock it's able to you know spend
billions of dollars sending things I've
been
space and then we used those Rockets it
doubts a hundred megawatt battery in
South Australia it just got finished
with that - so congratulations to bunker
and I guess but now when we talk about
their electric cars and we're talking
about their charging infrastructure and
their superchargers you would think that
they would have the capacity with all
this technology to make a battery you
know a charger a power bank for phones
that is competent and it's you know
works from not nice and you know there's
also designed properly because Tesla
likes to out its design so I'm wondering
if I'm gonna send you the link in the
thing you take a look at it and I'm
wondering if you're going to be willing
to pay $45 for a powder bag it this is a
you will gladly spend $45 on a power
bank I will complete not spend $45 on a
Tesla branded power bank just because
it's this but it's a whole 3350 milliamp
hours and it has micro not USBC USB 1 to
1 charge like a galaxy s 8 plus I she
pad - that's in Lille charge at that
rate putting it down on a wireless
charging so how fast time I think we
were in I think we were in Vegas
you were you were talking up model 300
is this gonna be the perfect accessory
for your model tree is that this is this
is this is the model 3 of power banks I
mean are you kidding me it's it's an
incredible is that a humongous
compliment for the power bank or is that
a humongous it's the poor Bank monuments
at their studios or offices or something
so this is this is supposed to be a
tribute to their design progress
the thing I like better than this is
they've also been selling a supercharger
station for your desk where it doesn't
actually charge anything it it's a it's
a scale model of a supercharger
but it just holds your cables in place
on your desk there's no charging going
on whatsoever
it could even put in a USB port
something I think it's also about $50
$40 something like that but so I
understand it especially in like they're
trying to build the brand up is being
some kind of lifestyle you know I
understand it but this is the kind of
thing that drives actual tech fans crazy
makes us sound like we're raging against
companies when this is a company I
wholeheartedly want to support our next
car I'm hoping will be a Tesla but these
kinds of moves drive me crazy and then
someone's gonna buy oo Tuzla they make
good products I should buy this like
it's gonna be an actual competitive
product in this marketplace without
doing any research when they're what
ravpower anchor alkie Xiaomi my Xiaomi
battery is badass there's so many other
opportunities to actually fulfill this
need that will be less expensive per
milliamp power capacity and will get the
job done better for actual current
smartphone and portable gadget hardware
look if you had all the technology and
you plugged it in to design a super
turbine design and then price they have
$45 maybe I understand that but it's
it's both pure kind of contempts I feel
for just here's a basic product with our
design that's that our IP is worth so
much that you don't even understand it
and that's why it's $45 all right I'm
looking up on Amazon right now I just
want to get like I mean I like I had a
thing on you know jakhary I thought it
was like the first thing I saw for
Amazon power banks and they had a
similar design like power cord 10,000
high speed compact 10,000 milliamp hour
battery $25.99
oh uh ravpower sixteen thousand seven
hundred and fifty mili amp hour battery
pack dual port so this is bigger it's
not going to be the same size but $23.99
easy acc I actually have an EZ ACC
battery it's badass
twenty thousand milliamp hour charger
for amp two port four point eight amps
smart output high capacity power bank
for iPads and other tablets $33.99 I
mean that's all ok options but I don't
think you'll get the brushed metal and
the nylon and the the woven treat maker
Power Core mini 3333 50 milliamp hour
lipstick sized aluminum premium power
bank if fourteen if it's not black with
that red stripe and a little black
silver stripe and it's smaller than a
lipstick container this is not so bad
it's pretty heavy but it's 20,000
milliamps and it charges my macbook pro
50 bucks well I mean I've got my my
super heavy-duty like actual like gaming
laptop powering battery over there and
that that was closer to 200 so I'm not
gonna pull neck oh oh my god yeah I'm 20
bucks so and that fits nicely into my
backpack and I get to charge my phone
whenever I'm not using it well it's
still in my backpack it's great so um
that's food for fart this week you can
take that run with it and you can also
see full details on these stories and
more you can hit pocketnow.com and look
for the podcast section to get to this
episode's run down you can chat with us
about well you've you've been reading up
on with the hashtag pan weekly and also
be sure to check out how they were there
and the pocket now daily on our YouTube
channel so we've got a bunch of tweets
in here before we get to the sponsor
blocked from Ranade Laporte the power
but this Tesla power bank isn't even
enough to charge a huawei mate lol but
then he does like straight line emoticon
face like not really laughing but we're
thing from David Brown a peon weekly I
take lift because I have an easier time
communicating with their drivers I think
their drivers are higher quality and the
ethics of the company don't match mine I
don't like the idea of them being sexist
and covering things up like this which
I'm sure the second half of his tweet is
relating to uber Andrew Wallace is
considering uninstalling uber and
installing lifts I I personally and
Dakota and as does hi Otto see you've
got the hi Otto seal of approval
so it would be solution not to do that
thing that I just said we've got Dakota
Lovejoy PN weekly I did a speed test on
my iPhone 10 running net 10 cell service
and I got forty three megabytes where I
live I don't know where you live though
Dakota so I can't compare that against
Andrew Wallace's amazing four megabit
cricket connection and lastly Andrew
Wallace with a question did everybody
get the Geekbench pro app for free it
was it was free on Google Play for the
last couple days you guys benchmarking
with the the geek bench is that what
you're using sure am not benchmarking so
hard right now
I'm benchmarking my laptop well holding
this hangouts call I could free I mean
freeze free so I was like hey i actually
do occasionally use this so i'm gonna go
ahead and grab it there you go
so hang fun times for all especially in
during black weekend's black week pluck
some something out other sales holidays
shopping what the most wonderful time of
the year the most wonderful time of the
year this is true but uh what's what's
not what doesn't make for a wonderful
time of the year is when you go in to
visit relatives and they've got the
high-speed internet which you know is
usually like the base model plan for
whatever cable carrier you're on with a
router that's shoved under like a
computer desk behind a planter
surrounded by some sort of Faraday cage
so that the Wi-Fi can make it about six
inches away from the desk and no further
and you're trying to like play games
with people or even just keep up with
whatever fun tech stuff is going on it
was it was a kind of a dicey a couple
hours in the the Becnel household this
year when we were trying to install
cuphead on my gaming laptop because I
forgot reinstall it and I just had to
plug in an ethernet cable until we moved
my parents router out from underneath
their desk you know this week sponsor
actually has a solution that could help
out with that and this this episode of
the pocket now weekly is brought to you
by euro the single router Wi-Fi model
just doesn't work for our increasingly
high bandwidth world what you need is a
distributed system you need a mesh
system you need euro whatever your Wi-Fi
needs euro has the power to seamlessly
blank at your home in fast reliable
Wi-Fi with via ethernet wireless or any
combination simply set it on a flat
surface plug it into a wall outlet and
expand coverage to any room not to
mention with the addition of a third 5
gigahertz radio on the second generation
euro it's now tri-band and twice as fast
as its predecessor which less which lets
customers do more in every room of their
home simultaneously and with the
addition of a new thread radio euro can
now connect to low-power devices such as
locks doorbells and other IOT home
automation sensors meanwhile euro beacon
is half the size but even more powerful
than the original euro whichever model
you choose with euros incredible
customer support you can call and get a
hold of a Wi-Fi expert within 30 seconds
I actually published sort of a long-term
look at using euro in my own home on my
personal YouTube channel that's not like
smartphone and tablet related and mesh
Wi-Fi has finally hit that point where
the plug and play the ease of setup the
the way that the app on a phone will
help guide you through the setup and
installation process all of these things
are now so much easier than the
solutions we used to have with Wi-Fi
range extenders or repeaters or power
line options having to try and figure
out what circuit in your home you could
use for powerline Eero took all of that
away
I now have super fast Wi-Fi even out
into my front yard and it
was again it was a tremendously easy
setup the only hitch was if you're
running a ton of networked equipment and
in that case you still might need to
also have a secondary router to help
with your wired connections but
everything else euro was baller to set
up and it was so painful
going back to my parents house and like
going upstairs and then like well I have

pocket now at checkout and we thank them
for supporting the pocket now weekly
indeed we do and we also thank you for
continuing to support the pocket now
weekly in the ways that you do and one
of those ways is by talking with us
that's right we're gonna open up this
month's monthly mailbag and the first
email that we shall go to comes from
Abdul wah and he writes hello there the
LG V 30 is one of the hottest phones of
2017 and a fair amount of hype is behind
this phone but I saw the LG G 6 in my
area for 400 bucks and thankfully I was
gifted the LG G 6 and it is a great
phone my question is now that the LD g6
is around four or five hundred bucks
does it make sense to get the V 30 at
almost double the price thanks for your
efforts Abdul Wahab so I want to hand it
off to the person who has the most
experience with both phones and that
would be Wan what do you think it is LG
330 I know that you've dug into the
whole range of issues and topics and you
don't want to just distill it down to
price but have that if someone's whoa
it's gonna get thinner by this much so
that's really one of those things so he
was gifted and LG make sure I got this
right he was gifted a g6 yeah
considering buying a V 30 and he's
worried about the price on a g6 versus
the price on a V 30 is because we want
to sell it back on the market and then
right so first of all I don't think it's
super likely you're gonna get $400 for
you yeah
there's so many different sales on this
thing and they're pretty easy to get
like great deals on new ones that you're
probably not gonna get much of a trade
in s so so here's the deal V 32 g6
basically every piece of the V 30 is
better than the g6 except in my opinion
for some of the design some of the
aesthetics I like that the camera sensor
is flush on the g6 I like the g6 has
flat sides which makes it easier to hold
on to I like that the g6 has a flat
front face which makes the screen
protectors way easier to find and fit
and that I personally like that the g6
is a little bit smaller every piece of
the tech though is gonna be a little bit
better on the V 30 here in the United
States we didn't get the the g6 with a
DAC I'm not sure if he got gifted the g6
Plus which I believe does have the the
quad DAC if it's not that version of the
g6 then the V 30 easily has better
headphone audio screen tech you might
like the screen tech better if you like
Oh LEDs / LCDs the processor is
definitely a nice improvement if you're
trying to do some gaming on your phone
although if you're not doing any gaming
that welcome 821 is gonna do you just
fine and the camera on the V 30 is a
nice step on even though it's the same
sensor size moving over to that glass
lens element definitely delivers
improvements to photo quality I just
posted a photo of my daughter from the V
30 we were riding in a bumpy shuttle to
LAX
she was backlit and I was able to use
manual focus to nail focus on her
eyelashes and it's sharp it's a great
look so you know backlit toddler and I
got crystal clear focus on eyelashes I
could not have done that from any other
phone that's a V 30 trick right there I
would say take the free g6 and run it
into the ground that's my opinion
use that
save up for next year's phones and then
you know you I think you will be in
store for a much more substantial
upgrade going a full year cycle rather
than the half you know the six-month
cycle of g6 2v 30 what do you think hi
Adam
I'm kind of in the same boat I mean if
if we're just talking more general and
just assuming that maybe you know he's
not even talking about himself having
the free g6 maybe just saying you know
asking in general is the g6 still or I
guess is the V 30 a better buy than the
g6 at almost half or twice the price for
twice the money it's really hard for me
to recommend buying almost any phone
because the g6 is already g6 is already
a pretty good phone and I agree with you
the p30 is better in almost every way
the 30 is one of my favorite phones of
the year I really really enjoyed that
thing but for double the cost unless the
unless manual video controls are really
really a high priority for you I don't
really think it's it's worth spending
twice the money on what do you think
Jules would you take the the g6 in hand
or would you try and flip it and grab
that V 30 I mean if I had the so if I
were to assume made me like a 200 $250
trade-in value then maybe I would go for
just biting off 600 bucks and just
trying to see art well yeah 600 bucks or
so and playing around with something
that might last me a little bit more
because I you know I tend to think of
these days as games it's zero-sum so
that we're already starting off at a
base level by just having the g6 you
know in our hands for free and if we
don't if I don't feel that I'm getting
the most out of it if I'm not feeling
that this might get the most the best
supports come two years down the line
then I might just figure that I've been
hearing great things about the be 30 and
write the vacuum I agree with you Jules
that like if you were buying the phone
and you had the g6 you were looking the
V 13 you
the best sort of upgrade path and I
think the v30 would probably fit that
bill but but you have a free g6 in your
hand right now
do you go to a phone
that is a small step up in every tech
bullet-point this year or do you wait
for a g7 or a v40 next year having
ridden out that free phone for a little
while you don't care about like the
operating system upgrade over one year
you can flip it then probably still get
close to 150 $200 for it and look at
next year's tech instead as you'd be
paying closer to full price for all
those things after even more
depreciation the sceptre point the
depreciation is gonna bottom out you
know like you you can still find like
note for gonna retain its value that
well but you're still probably gonna get
around 150 200 for imagining is just
gonna keep on going exponentially down
in one day the g6 like next to you know
just be like 20 bucks on the suavo it's
it's like a limit curve you know it just
keeps increasing approaching zero but it
knows her as opposed to this opposite
limit limit curve that everyone else
seems to be on lg's like this so I mean
it's I mean it depreciates fast from the
beginning and it just seems to barn up
earlier than everyone else so yeah
that's a chart on from swap that G sixes
are currently going for 245 if they're
t-mobile 250 if they're sprint 285 on
Verizon and 300 for the AT&amp;amp;T variant so
why I would be willing to say I would
eat 50 to $100 of current value on the
g6 to shop next year's phone that would
be my recommendation interesting
recommendation
of course Abdul it's yours to design
hopefully we help you just a little bit
here I want to move on to Wilson on next
who has a question about the HTC you 11
plus and I feel like we're gonna have a
very quick answer to that but I think
this give us some opportunity to talk
about the 11 plus I don't think we have
just yet I've been along a venturi says
to the podcast and even an even longer
reader of the pocket now site since the
Windows Mobile days my question is will
the pocket out team be reviewing the HTC
you 11 plus I especially look forward to
quads real audio review of that you 11
plus oh hi Adam what do you think about
pocket now reviewing the I'm sorry
you're on this mailbag where we're not
throwing to you at all on this stuff do
we even have a you 11 plus in-house I
know we did a hands-on with it I don't
have one I think pretty may spare time
occurred here but I think we might be
able to procure one if we had to well
yeah I mean literally we could just go
out and buy one too even though your
budgets fairly well exhausted at this
point I am probably not going to be
doing any special coverage like a camera
or audio review on the you 11 plus first
of all I don't believe it's changed
significantly the audio side of it has
changed significantly since the U 11
which hasn't changed significantly since
the bolt and it's a situation I've been
pretty disappointed when with HTC
formerly I think the top Android
manufacturer supporting audio I think
they've lost that crown and I've not
been impressed with their solutions
hi have you spent any time with au 11 +
no I wish I had because honestly that's
the phone that if I were buying a new
one right now that would be my top pick
I think it's absolutely gorgeous
and really really liked it but now I
alex Dobby the ruk editor / Android
Central got to mess around with it a
little bit for a hands-on but no no no
hands
for me so I look at the you 11 plus and
just especially after spending time with
Google's split pixel strategy and that
looks like the phone that Google should
have released yeah it just it there's
something about HTC manufacturing that
you can't really get an aesthetic like
that anywhere else the U 11 is a fine
phone it's not really a phone for me but
I could totally see where that phone
could have blown up huge in the market
if people had known that it existed and
I think HTC is in the same boat here
with the U 11 plus with a really limping
strategy into getting this phone out in
the market yeah yeah I mean we're
talking about something that is has been
the evolution has been an actual
evolution towards the U 11 and also kind
of the pixel line and it just it's still
stuck under this HTC attitude of let's
just give this to Europe and nowhere
else then that's pretty much it I don't
think I don't think they're taking
America too seriously which is a shame
yeah when I was I was working at
t-mobile I was always trying to tell
people to buy the HTC 10 but they pulled
that off the shelves after three months
or so never got the U 11 over t-mobile
and I mean you know obviously nobody's
getting the U 11 plus in America so us
strategy's been a little weak lately
well and I can kind of understand why it
seems like every major carrier has been
burned in some way by HTC not continuing
the conversation for them yeah for AT&amp;amp;T
it seemed like 18t pulled out of the HTC
game after the one a9 there's a terrible
mid-range err strategy for HTC if anyone
was gonna try and do an iPhone clone it
should not have been HTC and then Sprint
I believe it was one of them the last
Evo or maxes where they started sort of
fizzling on on HTC as as a carrier
solution and I think Verizon sort of had
it with
EGC after the Windows Phone uh m8
sort of didn't do anything either and
and consistently every single generation
of HTC phone has had less user
engagement less fan base less
advertising less conversation and yet
they still keep putting out phones
expecting people to pick them up and buy
them and I I do not for the life of me
understand how any part of HTC is still
functional in North America right then
yeah it's a bummer for me because I've
always had a soft spot for HTC that was
like my very first Android phone was uh
the HTC Inspire my ATT just there
there's sort of Evo port and yeah I
really want HTC to do well but there's
just not well and I can't take it all
the way back to I mean because I'm old I
can take it all the way back to like HTC
is the supplier for every windows mobile
device that I absolutely loved and
there's a part of that culture there's a
part of that DNA that I don't think they
were ever able to truly shake so even
when they started branding their own
devices like the HTC diamond I don't
know they just never put the same effort
into communicating their existence to
consumers they hit a high point with the
One m7 that phone was gorgeous
especially for its time and then since
then they've just sort of been coasting
and you can't you can't grow you can't
build you can't fulfill a market and
compete against Apple and Samsung in any
meaningful way if that's how you're
gonna handle the customer conversation
no not at all which and I you know
leaving them like this I don't know how
long it's been a question that we've
been asking how long did will they
survive another year like that's and how
much does have I've really matter at
this point because we keep talking about
this as this up-and-coming VR platform
for them and they're when the if not the
most popular platform out there but it's
just it's not making them enough money
to keep the balance box alive so so we
have a couple other tweets coming in
backtracking just a bit for
g6 question from David Bautista at this
point wouldn't it be better just to wait
three months for the g7 announcement
from Peter hatin I'm guessing if you
already have a g6 it will probably do
you fine until the next V Series phone
unless you really could use the camera
benefits on the V 30 and Ed maudlin
stick with what you have I'm sure it's a
short time before something not
iterative a bigger jump will show up and
then Eid also throws in a couple other
tweets about HTC you pianned weekly you
mean you as in usual Bowl and it's bad
when even metro pcs stop something HTC
that's because they haven't been
pointing out the desire things and they
only put out one desire triple five and
that hasn't been really good why you're
wrong that the U 11 I will say you know
one of the things that I loved
during this is so silly one of the
things I loved about the U 11 because I
haven't held that you 11 Plus because I
hate selfie cameras I hate them they're
they're terrible lower quality cameras
the good cameras on the back of the
phone get good at taking your selfies
from the back camera it's the better
camera so solely mirror finish was so
simple the line awesome selfie shot the
whole back of your phone was helping you
out that was the nice thing about the
xperia x is e1 premium - yeah it was
maybe the shiniest back of a phone I've
ever seen I mean well the least
practical and and again I have a hard
time
I love Note 4 or v10 style phones I like
metal edges and grippy backs blackberry
the BlackBerry key one that's that's my
like grown-up phone of the year this
year so a jewel tone phone not for me
but damn it was easy
those those rear camera selfies yeah
yeah those selfies well one of those
ways that those selfies gets to all the
people out there through the Internet's
and I feel like we owe Hanson the band
Hanson no sorry Hanson from Singapore
with this tweet here well I'm not sure
if
you guys have talked about net
neutrality yet but if you haven't can
you talk about it briefly please I have
not got the full picture since I'm not
from the US and it's fair to ask this
question since a lot of people who don't
aren't in the US and are more used to
their already existing structures too
pretty for the internet or just kind of
I mean we've been seeing a whole bunch
of examples outside the US from Portugal
and New Zealand where they actually and
Chile where they have a different
structure here we'll get to that in a
second but I well I think I would be the
most versed in do first on this one cuz
I've been known to soapbox on a lot of
this stuff too and I don't know I think
a lot of people are kind of feeling a
little exhausted by this conversation
this is the third republic round of
people trying to support this policy
that the government keeps trying to find
some way of doing away with what are
your feelings on the current state of
the conversation surrounding net
neutrality uh I sure wish we didn't have
to keep having this conversation I wish
yeah it's such an such a ridiculous
thing to me at least that this is still
an ongoing debate um but you know it's
there's all these all these companies
just that keep on telling us you know
don't worry we're not going to you know
the service providers like Comcast or
you know phone providers like Verizon
they keep on saying we're not going to
you know change anything about the way
that we distribute content to you we
support net neutrality and so on and and
you know they've shown historically no
they don't they you know they absolutely
don't they've already pretty much every
company that has said this kind of thing
has been caught in the past you know
slowing down certain services banning
them altogether I think it was pretty
well known that I think was Verizon and
AT&amp;amp;T that that completely blocked Google
Wallet for a while to try and give a
they you know they founded Isis right
don't forget 18t and Verizon are the the
founding members of Isis members of Isis
which became the the nice and soft title
of soft card because I know what would
be a worse name I was talking about the
terrorist organization I was talking
about the mobile payment solution Isis
that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon created they
created Isis I personally think soft
card is a whoa I'm not talking about the
spy organization in the fictional
television show Archer I'm talking about
the mobile payment solution that AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon they created Isis something
I don't want to go too deeply without
just giving one minute wrap because this
person from Singapore is asking the
question here so basically our
legislation the Communications Act that
the FCC has operating under there says
that title 2 if they had this law that
says that no
all connections are equal and that
people pay a single set price for that
connection and for a while under this
2015 open Internet order the internet
internet service was protected under
title 2 and you couldn't throttle
certain traffic you couldn't block
certain sites you couldn't do that it
was illegal and you know there was a
regulation to enforce that and you know
prior to that you know it was alright
you know it was kind of a light touch
regulatory thing that's one of Chairman
IG PI's favorite phrases light touch
regulatory approach which has existed
for a long time but even then one of the
main concerns about this was that you
know the competition has all has always
been lacking in terms of the telco
industry because 18t and Verizon would
have the this market over here and that
Margaret over here and neither none of
the two would meet they would all have
their own market so in many places only
one option for Internet service would be
provided and
for if one of the companies bought sites
or slow down traffic for one reason or
another they would have no one else to
turn to and they would have to live with
that so that's always been the concern
what the arguments against it's a G PI
has always says that oh there we can't
expand our networks and we can't you
know grow into the rural population and
whatnot so this is why we need to kill
title two we need to end this and even
though the Comcast and a whole bunch of
other companies have said that this
title to production doesn't do anything
in terms of their profit lines that it
doesn't deflective affect them
negatively and you know they have to
tell the truth because they're reporting
to investors they this is still
happening this this vote is still
happening the order has been suggested
and now it's going up for a vote on
December 14th
so to kill title 2 or not for Internet
that is the main subjects that we're
talking about here so I think it's
pretty clear we're all in support of
keeping some kind of title to regulation
of broadband in place I've yet to see
any compelling evidence that removing
title 2 regulations will be a good thing
for the internet and this is clouded by
a lot of really pithy and really sort of
overly simplified conversations people
people have left comments on some of my
personal videos talking about how oh we
don't want to make this like net
neutrality is a black-and-white issue
and bla bla bla bla bla we don't want to
make it overly simplistic but when we
look at the the opposition to title 2 a
lot of it is built on at best ignorant
or at worst a directed misinformation
campaign designed to confuse what's
actually happening and so part of the
part of the reason why this FCC strategy
is so successful is the blurring of
lines between the definitions of
telecommunication service and an
information service and at times the
internet will function as both but a
telecommunication service as defined by
Congress is a service which transmits
information of the users choosing to and
from endpoints specified by the user
without making any changes to that
user's information so no email from
Jules at pocketnow.com to quant at
pocket now back to so what I'm talking
about her literally the packets that
form the backbone of the internet now an
information service has a much broader
definition the offering of a capability
for generating acquiring storing
transforming processing retrieving
utilizing or making available
information via telecommunications so
that's why the FCC has been granted I
mean through the courts the FCC has been
granted a lot of leeway as to what
they're classifying as what and there
are plenty of examples of where the
Internet can fulfill both of those
definitions but the regulation that
we're interested in has nothing to do
with the content on the internet because
we are trying to classify the Internet
as a telecommunication service so that's
literally trying to regulate the
on-ramps to the to the Internet not what
cars can go on the internet not what
destination you can choose on the
Internet has nothing to do so if someone
says oh I don't want the government
picking my winners and losers then they
fundamentally don't understand what this
regulation is trying to protect people
from that's that's the major part of
this problem and that's why I Jeff pie
is able to muddy the waters by
classifying the inner the Internet as an
information service solely and not
looking at the FCC's regulatory powers
when it comes to the parts of the
Internet which should be regulated as a
telecommunications service and this is
where we really got to go into the weeds
a little bit and we have to reassure
people the government isn't going to be
able to say oh I don't like Facebook so
let's ban it that the FCC doesn't have
that kind of authority and that's not
the
regulation they're going after but if we
allow the internet to be classified as
an information service then Verizon and
Comcast and other ISPs and other
carriers can decide for you how
expensive it is to go to individual
sites or services on the Internet wise
go to YouTube when you can use our
streaming service on Comcast Xfinity or
Y you know utilize this cloud storage
solution when you can use our our
Xfinity cloud bucket so this is one of
the major conflicts and having a an
organization which controls the pipe or
the road to the Internet and is also
responsible for providing content on the
Internet and that's a huge conflict of
interest it's a conflict of interest
when you have Google Fiber and Google
services and it's a conflict of interest
when you have Time Warner or Comcast or
spectrum or Verizon and Comcast Time
Warner Verizon and spectrum services so
this this is why having some small way
of accountability built into the system
is so vital to the future of growth
because it's the only way that smaller
upstarts can actually compete on the
main stage and not just get completely
swallowed up by every 800-pound gorilla
in the room there's really comes down to
who becomes the gatekeeper of the
internet because at this point it's
still the user it's still you know
whoever they can track your data but
they can't manipulate you to go to
direct redirect sites or whatnot and
they can't walk well this is like why
that phrase gatekeeper of the Internet
is so important because I think a lot of
people take that to mean gatekeeper of
the Internet then Google will tell me I
mean the government will tell me that I
can't use Google and I have to use Bing
and that's not what this what this
regulation will allow the FCC to do and
we also have to take into account that
the AC FCC is a fairly small and fairly
underfunded regulatory agency that title
2 is really only going to be a reactive
regulatory situation so an isp is not
only going to have to violate the tenets
of title 2 but do
so egregiously that consumers complain
and even then the FCC is has limited
resources to actually go after a Verizon
or a Comcast so these fights are going
to be few and far between but we have
real accountability look at this current
administration we elected conservatives
and now conservatives are trying to gut
net neutrality the government is
actually responding to the vote from the
people however if corporations are in
charge of what you can access or how you
can access it what kind of influence do
you have over a corporation you are you
gonna lobby shareholders are you going
to lobby CEOs
how do you how do you actually affect
change at a corporation level when their
main responsibility is to provide value
and profit to shareholders not to listen
to the will of the people using their
services so this is another major aspect
of who do we want having that kind of
influence over the connection we use to
get to the Internet not the content we
consume on the Internet well I want to
go into what the post picture would look
like because if this vote goes through
it's a three Republican to Democrat
board on the FCC so it's likely that
this will go through and what will
happen so they're gonna do a regular
transparency reports and you say what
they've done in the past however many
days that they've done and that you know
and that's you know and what the most
important thing about that was that GPI
says that if there's any litigation that
needs to be involved and you know people
think that's not right then the Federal
Trade Commission would handle it at all
which i think is kind of a sham that's
even with the under you know the reality
of the FCC being underfunded and what I
had the authority to actually go through
and you know it had to find terms of
what it looked out and what should look
out for and why it should enforce we
don't have those terms and the FTC if it
does decide to do act on anything in
terms of a suit we'd have to go through
fact-finding missions and deciding
what's this and what's that and what's
fair is fair so
in terms of protecting the companies
from harmful lawsuits that's you know
but the consumers have a say in what
they want it's just gonna be a more
confusing process than what is already a
confusing process well and also there
are significant different i'm een like
we don't have the the bandwidth or the
the time to get into a deep in the weeds
discussion on the difference between the
FTC and the FCC but there are
significant differences in how they
would handle cases of abuse and how they
can set policy and how they can respond
to the market and their relationship to
congress and the senate and there are
some arguments to be made for the FTC
getting involved in consumer abuse
situations i can i can definitely see
the situation coming from people who are
more libertarian leaning because
ultimately i would prefer having a more
libertarian approach to the internet
however if we just flip the switch today
there will be no more competition in
this space it will be more an exercise
in consolidation especially given the
FCC's recent track record in making it
even easier for media outlets to
consolidate and this was another thing
that kind of flew under the headlines it
was two weeks ago they could bring
forward things two year old rule on
preventing one media conglomerate from
owning like all of the newspapers and TV
stations and radio stations in a local
area so that's gone now too in light of
this move towards gutting net neutrality
this is why the FCC will be more
effective in my opinion in managing the
situation and owing to title 2
regulations and for anyone who's
concerned this would be similar
regulatory practices what we see for
things like telephone companies and cell
carriers it was only through regulation
that we actually got improvements to
competition and that was you know with
divestiture and again you can read up on
breaking up mom ha Bell the the current
situation that we find ourselves in
today I feel is analogous it's a clumsy
analogy but it's still a functional
analogy to the situation we find
ourselves in today so there's a lot of a
lot of stuff that's
but ultimately my prediction is December
14th is gonna roll around the FCC
currently holds a three to two
conservative majority because you swing
the FCC to support the administration
that's in power and I'm pretty confident
that this vote is gonna go their way
because they've got the three to two
majority and then what we'll see
afterwards is a prolonged and costly
funded by taxpayers legal battle that'll
probably take another five years in the
courts just like the original Ohio did
the open Internet order which again
that's all coming out of taxpayers
pockets and we're gonna have to deal
with that all because the the FCC has
been captured by these these major media
companies so that's what I see I'm
hoping that we can get a stay or some
kind of injunction that prevents the
immediate gutting of title 2 regulation
and that can stay long enough to
eventually get the Trump administration
out of office so that's that's my if I
were betting and I were playing Vegas
odds that's what I imagine is probably
gonna happen over the next month so one
of the weird things that is coming out
of this is all the you note of how other
countries do their internet now for what
we've seen on all these are just like
mobile Internet service and not just
wireline internet service home internet
like that but in many places they have
packages for data for messaging but you
can have unlimited access to these apps
to what's up
Skype whatever for $4.99 a month and
that's as access to those services that
apps are free and it's just it'd be
weird to see that if spread out to the
u.s. in you know for home service if
they wanted to if they come if the
companies wanted to charge per app for
access to that site or it's just that's
that's the implications of these aren't
hypothetical there are plans like this
that are in effect in parts of the world
right now
I know a lot of people like to come like
oh well what you're talking about is a
mobile plan and not a landline or
something like that doesn't matter
that's really not the concept spread
across everything that we have yeah so I
mean yeah so that's the fact we're up
against at this moment I mean we're
gonna go down the line I know you talked
about you know it's this is
taxpayer-funded well we run the
government and we pay to live here and
we're kept alive oh I mean I appreciate
the fact that it's taxpayer what I'm
frustrated is we're having this fight
yet again on the taxpayers dime we've
we've demonstrated numerous times over
over successive generations of this
debate that this is the people who are
paying attention and the people that I
feel you should listen to this is what
we want the FCC has actually been
stymieing the ability to investigate
things like Russian collusion or whether
or not BOTS were impersonating real
people during this last public round of
commenting the FCC did nothing to
actually safeguard their commenting
process and claimed they had a DDoS
attack that that hasn't that they
haven't been able to provide any
evidence for so none of this is been
communicated in good faith and they've
been obstructing citizens inquiries into
what's actually gone down so again I
feel the FCC has become a captured
agency in the grand scheme of
regulations made all the more
frustrating by the fact that you know up
until 2015
taxpayers have been on the hook for 400
billion in network fees and subsidies
and charges to the major telecoms that
was originally supposed to go towards
rolling out fiber that was going to be
the backbone of our energy grid and our
future telecommunications network and
none of that's really materialized
except in areas where consumers have set
up their own the local broadband or in
areas where Google Fiber is available to
consumers that's been the only
appreciable roll out on a four hundred
billion dollar multi-decade
investment again on the taxpayer dime
so I'm kind of I'm kind of over playing
this game I I do I do still recommend
that people make their voices heard you
still communicate with your local
elected officials and your state
representatives because it's only
through that kind of support that we'll
we'll see any kind of campaign to oppose
the striking title to in the courts if
they don't hear that conversation then
there's not going to be a lot of a lot
of pressure on lawmakers and on lawyers
to try and fight that fight and III want
to throw this one out there to Maine who
is it senator Collins in Maine was the
first Republican senator to stand out
against removing title 2 restrictions
she's the first one to break from her
party and I want to throw her a big
thumbs up senator Collins and I disagree
on numerous policy but if you really do
believe in small business if you really
do believe in the future of our economy
and you really do believe in the United
States maintaining some kind of position
as a leader in telecommunications there
is no good argument I can find for
removing title 2 protections and she
seems to respect and understand that so
thumbs up senator collins republican out
of Maine I think you're on the right
path and I hope more of your ilk will
join you in this debate hey how do you
want to go to Maine sometime it's not
particularly on my travel list but sure
yeah yeah well total hold New England
together this is very great yes where
I've had the best the best lobster roll
I've ever eaten was in Maine you're
gonna have a great kind of lobster and
clam clam bakes that could be nice well
that was that was fun we should probably
wrap this show up on a few other
comments in question yeah well enough my
first smartphone was the HTC Wildfire
later moved on to the one m7 loved that
phone so much currently waiting for a
signal wire for it since I might have
killed it yeah and that's if if a
company were to do a throwback throne
and with current specs Quan your pic OH
back home the curtain specs this is a
toss-up I would either vote for a note 4
or a moto X 2 with the same kind of like
leatherback customizable moto maker
kinds of additions my Moto X 2 is still
one of my all-time favorite phones hold
my note for it I think it's still one of
the best phones ever made so still so
salty about that one of X 2 not getting
the update marshmallows especially
because I've got the I have that 18 T
version that never did officially get
like any significant upgrades on it such
a beautiful little phone it's like
almost within arm's reach so far but yet
so so close any any excuse to touch and
fondle and molest my Moto X I mean you
could do that on screen well hi out who
tells us more I'm trying to get to you
Maya well I mean sorry not to sorry did
not mix it up much but Moto X T was
gonna be my answer as well that was my
anyway favorite phone design
I think the Nexus 6 was kind of like a
revitalized Moto X 2 but it was just not
the same feel to me at the same level
quality and and it wasn't
yeah it wasn't it wasn't as customizable
and that's that's something that has
unfortunately gone away with the Moto X
series
yeah the Moto X 4 there's no Moto maker
you get 2 color options both the glass
and I loved my mother wax to pure
edition wasn't the same so yeah there it
is I always wanted where you can like
hear me rubbing against my beard oh jeez
this is good that's good shut up Jules
they need to hear me rubbing against my
beard shut up Jules stop breathing tools
it's a smart okay anyone who wanted to
hear like that really great SMR beard
rub you you you don't have it because
these guys are making noise but still I
will say that there's a video ethically
gorgeous I mean it's still a flippin
gorgeous phone today I would love to
have modern internals me think about
like the smaller bezels the
the dual space it doesn't have the chin
speaker this is this is just a dummy
space that could have been functional
but even in this world of 18 by 9 2 by 1
aspect ratio screens like this phone
still holds up phenomenally well in
terms of design and aesthetics I'd love
to have the rear fingerprint sensor put
on a slightly better camera module we'll
get rid of the terrible old moto camera
app for what they're using today and
this would be a baller competitor and I
love how the leather has aged it's
gotten a little darker it's gotten all
marked up and kind of creased and it
just looks worn it doesn't look all
scratched and gross like glass yeah the
leather on the back of the Moto X 2 is
what I wanted the g4 to feel like and it
just didn't quite the same
you know what was close the the brown
leather I had the right hand feel it
just didn't look right but the the
Burgundy there was an oxblood leather
back that look epic on the g4 but it a
JH really poorly which was a shame like
the corners would get worn out and then
you'd see that plastic base underneath
really quickly and then that looks kind
of gross whereas this just looks awesome
as it's gone yeah keeps getting it keeps
looking better and I'm stuck between the
HTC One S and the One m8 because I've
like you want to the first thing I saw
back in 2012 when they had the 1s was
that video where they did the black back
plating and that's like ionisation and
it looked so cool and I just wanted to
touch that thing so and that that's you
know I still 101's just repaired specs
and with the one I made I mean it's just
the standard greats you know metal slab
thin profile and just you know just slid
easily in and out nice brush metal and
it had two camera ports for it's a you
know using so imagine what HTC could do
again with a strategy like you know
they're returning to it next year so
we're gonna have to see what HTC does
next year
but if that works out pretty well I
would want that on the One m8 on from
Renato Laporte he wants the Lumia 920 in
yellow back which to go actually I've
got mine red right there it's almost
within arm's reach I'm gonna go get it
any excuse to fondle and molest my
extending this podcast to new lengths
man if they if they made the 920 again
but with it with with Android Oreo I'd
be all over it maybe a little bigger
they would put to you stud the Silva
Nokia Lumia 1020 but with Android and
microSD don't like it I've got my lumia
1020 right over there it's within arm's
reach just do the blue 920 though was
just what I yeah finished
cyan Lumia 920 is still like one of my
unicorn phones I need to get out there
was an outstanding looking phone so good
so ahead of its time I mean I know the
1020 took it to like a like a crazy
level in terms of camera tech but the
920 camera was phenomenal - it was built
like a tank
you could you could bludgeon somebody
with it well and that it was super easy
it's it's these two Torx screws yeah
everything on the inside of your phone I
mean you know it doesn't have like the
removable back but I bet you I could
still get a replacement battery for this
and refresh it it's not have like
current software to go with it cuz
Microsoft sucks and I hate them right
now um via the IDI model it actually has
a question for us here on twitter using
the pn weekly hashtag hi Otto when do
you think Sony will actually work with a
US carrier again before the apps the
rapture or after like will we have to
have like a significant portion of the
population evacuated into heaven before
Sony will do business with another US
carrier it's you know it's pretty likely
yeah whenever they do it just please
don't put another phone in the US unless
it has a fingerprint sensor please I
absolutely adore the little xz1
compact oh he says the fact that it
pisses me off that I have to use like
some sort of pattern unlock on that
phone yeah yeah ZTE has a thing might
light you might want to try and see if
you can latch on to their patent instead
instead of having to deal with whatever
yes thing that you have to deal with
whatever and I think in terms of that if
it burns that maybe I mean they've been
redeveloping their brand so that they're
targeting more high-end stuff and that's
getting more towards the carriers taste
so I want to hope to say sooner rather
than later we might see something sony
back again although for what it's worth
when I worked at t-mobile was there for
four years and we sold multiple Sony
phones I think in my store as we move
maybe five a year I think you get rating
that number there yeah well so um the
the last question that we've got you're
on the Twitter that I want to get to and
I want to throw this one to you too hi
Otto this is from Andrew Wallace they've
heard me pontificate on this question a
number of times so I'm not even gonna
weigh in on this podcast but Andrews
asking you hi Otto what is your personal
favorite implementation of a dual lens
camera on a smartphone in 2017 do you
like zooms like the match sensor do you
like the ultra wide on the LG the 1 + 5
t no just kidding this yeah oh so I'm
one of those weird guys that I pretty
much everybody else seems to like the
wide-angle lenses and they're fun for
what they're worth but I prefer having
having a telephoto lens the one on the 1
+ 5 that I use is not the best but
especially on the note 8 I really really
loved having and optically stabilized
second camera it was zoom it was really
really nice I had this discussion on a
product on podcast last week where even
if sometimes I mean even with the 1 + 5
even though the second camera is
probably not gonna be as good as the
main camera even when you're zooming in
digitally I feel better not digitally
zooming I feel like even if even if the
quality's worse
feels like it's gonna be better to me
you hipster photographer nerd you just
I've been trained over the years to to
really not want to use the that you know
yeah I like having an optical zoom with
with the lens or I mean maybe not
optical zoom just optical a closer vocal
range I mean you're wrong but it's still
friends I guess you know you know the
nice thing about a telephoto lens it
doesn't bow doesn't bow no I I don't
know I so while we could over the saw
for the wallet if I'd already go ahead
Jules I'm just going to make an argument
for the color like the color mono thing
because more people's more chances to
like do crop in at a high detail and
yeah you don't have to do so or you move
back or do anything you just stand right
there and take your picture like a
normal person I'm gonna realize I'm
gonna revise my statement say my
favorite dual camera setup is the pixel
to that negates the need for a dual
camera setup
it doesn't though but I still I still
like I think I think matched monochrome
and color sensors is still my favorites
first they are sensor implementation
yeah they are very good and so I posted
I'll actually I'll put up the results
now so there's a there was a tweet I
don't know if I still have it pinned
I shouldn't have have kept it pinned for
an entire week that would have been bad
Twitter etiquette on my part but on the
pocket now Twitter I put up two photos
indoors using portrait modes and so one
of them is super sort of close and it
looks super cropped in and
rainy and looks awful and the other one
no I don't have it pinned we have
something else pinned that's also super
old that we probably should unpin by now
if you go to the mocking out Twitter you
can see and so it was the the Galaxy
Note 8 versus the huawei mate 10 and the
difference is remarkable in portrait
mode indoors I mean if it is lit it's
just lit by one lamp across the room
it's so and and it's kind of terrible
like how how much light gets how
restrictive the the little zoom sensors
are when it comes to getting more light
on the sensor so and the fact that it
doesn't crop so the the pixel I think is
is better the computational setup is
better than a zoom sensor if you're
looking at portrait mode but I still
think the the matched color and
monochrome sensors are the best
competitors for that kind of an effect
it's late AF it's Holly actually I've
got them on my desktop I can I can pull
up the photos here give you one second
and I'll go into a screen share pictures
and show us the rainbow swirls of the
Dairy Queen so that's that's the May 10
and again its portrait mode so it looks
all weird and cut out and artificially
enhanced but this is the exact same
distance the exact same lighting take in
less than a minute apart from the note 8
ooh yeah
so the node 8 in good light is gonna do
a better job with zoom because the May
10 uses that sort of interpolated high
resolution it's trying to do the zoom
trick from the Lumia 1020 it just
doesn't have as much resolution to work
with but when you're talking portrait
modes like that's epic especially
considering like all of the vents and
stuff in the background like that's
that's a pretty pretty a pretty decent
representation of that shot and again
from the same lighting this is the best
that the note could pull off I mean the
the attractiveness of the subject
notwithstanding maybe Samsung was just
trying to blah
my face as much as possible oh I'll just
avoid taking selfies well but I mean
it's also like if you're really gonna
use a portrait mode you're gonna want to
use it in other places other than like
perfect sunset lit you know beautiful
background locations you might
occasionally want to try a board recipe
I could freaking take a pic oh boy we're
gonna have a process over here what was
your favorite side dish this this
Thanksgiving season my favorite side
dish you know I made corn casserole for
the first time and it's because I do a
corn and broccoli casserole it was a you
know just corn was a sour cream okay you
went you went that route yeah yeah so I
do I know because we've gotten all
hipstery with it so I do I make my own
creamed corn
I use fresh broccoli we mix that up with
just a little bit of egg some onion I
like a lot of black pepper I just I
don't know how to do you crumbled up
some Ritz crackers on the top of that
you bake that 350 for about 40 minutes
and it's pretty delicious boy I mean
it's pretty look look at look at that
portrait Google Hangouts man we're not
gonna see we're not gonna see you I
don't care it just I wanted to show it
off and I also want post if it's
unflattering he'll post it on Instagram
later I'm sure he's pretty good at that
yeah yeah you can always count on Jules
for that for the photo last last night
at me just halfway through a bowl of
ramen just like mid slurp oh yeah Jules
are we out of mailbag questions we
wrapping this thing up record we can go
ahead and put this thing to bed right on
so hi Otto I this is the part of the
