pocket comm and this is the part 2 of
the Samsung Galaxy S software tour so
the first thing I want to do is actually
go into the programs and we have this
application called mini diary and it's
kind of like a scrapbook for your
Android device and what this is allows
you to do is put pictures and words to
create your own sort of personal diary
or scrapbook so if I wanted to add a
photo here I'll do this tap and go to
images and it will launch the gallery
program so let's see here if I pick some
of these I have some download so if I
just wanted to add this photo there we
go and now I can either create a memo
and I can type it like there we go and
then just save and now I've saved my
diary and it will show the date of the
diary entry and we can just save that so
the next application is music player and
will show you your entire list of music
by all you can also go to playlists
albums or artists and a cool thing about
this program is all you have to do is
turn it into landscape mode and if you I
had album art on any of these songs it
would show a photo of the album but all
I have is a disc and I can just drag
this down to get an entire list of all
my songs there okay so now I can just go
back and another cool thing about the
galaxy essence allows you to view all of
your files so a lot of Android devices
don't allow you to do this you have to
download a third-party application so I
can just go let's see here if I want to
look at my SD card I can either install
applications from here or view all my
photos or the music or video or whatnot
so just go back
now Samsung has included some of their
own applications I've already downloaded
a few of them but they are free and they
work through the Android Market and you
can download certain widgets and
applications through the Samsung Apps
enjoyed some of the settings a cool
thing about this device is as you can
see the font is different than on other
devices so let's see here I think it's
under display where's that at sound and
display and now I can go down here to
font style and if I want I can change my
font to any one of these fonts or I can
get fonts online and each one of them
are about $0.99 on the Android Market
and just cancel and go back we have
social hub which allows you to add
different messages to different social
networks out there such as Facebook and
Twitter or we can also change things to
messaging we have Google Talk which is
just a generic Google Talk application
which comes on most Android 2.1 devices
and you'd see that Chong and Joe is on
there but Joe is away go to think free
office which is a Microsoft Office
compatible application which you can
have your own documents whatnot and you
can either have online documents for my
documents so did you use the online
documents you will have to sign up for
their service I'm not too sure exactly
how much it is but I think it's probably
free so we can go to home since it's
called thing free mobile I'm guessing
it's free so the next application is the
video player and the cool thing on this
device is it has a DivX encoder built-in
so i have a video file here for disney
cruise which i was thinking about
planning on going next year we'll see so
I had risk world or this video files
that I got from a DVD that I got for
Netflix so as you can see it is very
high quality and out video is very clear
audio of course is very clear we just
turn this down here so there you go so I
can just go back and back again
and we have voice dialer call two five
three eight six six nine seven two four
okay well apparently it didn't call that
number but it works pretty well if it's
up to your face go cancel via voice
recorder and we can record some audio
let's see here if it'll go into portrait
mode so hey this is Dan I'm just making
a video here for Pocket now so I can
stop it and once it's saved I can play
it okay so the sound quality is pretty
good we'll just go back we have a voice
search so if I wanted to search for
something it's probably me try to search
for that anyways we'll see how well that
worked okay so I guess its search for
self orange search for something okay so
we'll just go back and we have right and
go which is just a simple documents it's
kind of like a memo pad for your Android
device but cooling out this is you can
also update your status on to Twitter
and Facebook and you can also send it as
a message so if I wanted to say test and
just say send message I can send it to
one of my contacts and it will send them
that message so we just go back okay and
just go back again delete all text yes
so we also had YouTube which is just the
basic Android 2.1 application so we can
search for YouTube videos and play them
on our device and we also have the
navigation application and it's just the
basic Android and navigation application
so although video calling doesn't really
work in the United States you can
activate the front-facing video camera
by just going to phone and we're just
going to test this star pound zero star
pound launches the Samsung utilities
application so you can test certain
features as you can see we can test the
in here and we can also view the
front-facing video camera okay so there
we go we have my camera right there and
there is my head so you go back and we
can also do some other cool things with
this little application this is a hidden
application you do have to dial star
pound zero star pounded to use this and
this is on actually this is actually on
most Samsung devices so if you do have a
Samsung device you can test this out and
the sensor is one a really cool thing
you can view all magnetic information
accelerometer and proximity so as you
can see I have my proximity and light
sensor right here so these are all the
programs and applications that come on
the Samsung Galaxy S and if you liked
the video make sure you give us a thumbs
up and leave comments so we like to hear
pros and cons about the device what you
think about the Samsung Galaxy S what
you think about the other variants that
may be coming to t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T in
the near future thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
