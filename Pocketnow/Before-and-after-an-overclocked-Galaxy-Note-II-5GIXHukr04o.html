slow these days I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow
and this is a before and after with an
overclocked galaxy note 2 some phones
especially those that are over
encumbered with the TouchWiz interface
in any accompanying software tend to get
a little laggy as time goes on you begin
to install more applications and fill
the internal storage and performance
begins to slip and some smartphones ship
with a little lag on the side the
Samsung Galaxy s4 one of the fastest and
most powerful smartphones to date lag
for us out of the box both times we
reviewed it
likewise when it launched powered by a
1.6 gigahertz quad core Exynos chip the
Galaxy Note 2 is one of the most
powerful smartphones around and it was
snappy back then but I've been using the
same model since October I'll be up with
various roms and no matter how much I
try to evade it the lag persists but
like we've explained twice now trying
out a new kernel and overclocking the
CPU can help the situation and stem any
overbearing lag for the note 2 I perused
forums in search of what at least
appeared to be the most well rounded
kernel of course you can never tell just
from a description from its creator
the only sure-shot way to know how it
works is to loaded on your device and
take it for a test drive
the kernel I chose is called Note 2 core
which comes in three variations standard
overclocked and extreme naturally I went
with the extreme version to install
simply download the kernel reboot into
recovery flash the zip from sdcard wipe
the cache partition and wipe the dalvik
cache in the advanced menu before you
start be certain you're using a TouchWiz
based ROM else you could put your device
in a boot loop or worse if you're using
CyanogenMod or an AOSP ROM there are
plenty of kernels for those builds as
well when you reboot it will take longer
than usual to startup and you may want
to use an application such as set CPU to
manage your CPU clock speeds and various
governor's or restrictions for how the
CPU will work in different situations
I set the CPU to the maximum clock speed
for this kernel 1.8 gigahertz and
switched to the performance governor
surprisingly the overclocked Note 2's
performance and synthetic benchmarks was
markedly worse than the note 2 running
the stock kernel in antutu while running
at the stock clock speed the note 2
scored over 17,000 while the overclocked
note 2 at one point
eight gigahertz scored only 12,000 and
it was a similar story in Geekbench to
where the note2 of the stock clock speed
managed between 1600 and 1900 the
overclock note to men it's only 1500 in
Geekbench to the performance in the
SunSpider javascript test was more
telling than anything before
overclocking the note 2 scored around
1100 milliseconds in several runs of
SunSpider
after overclocking it scored 952
milliseconds that could be explained by
the configuration of this specific
kernel but benchmarks don't always
directly translate to real-world
performance and its comparisons like
these that lend credence to that
statement before overclocking my
personal note 2 unit wasn't exactly slow
or terribly laggy but there was
definitely some noticeable stuttering
when opening the covers in action
launcher opening the app drawer and in
scrolling in different applications
after flashing the new kernel and
overclocking the performances ever so
slightly better applications seem to
open somewhat quicker than before and
once inside applications the data seemed
to propagate faster the difference isn't
substantial but it's definitely
noticeable on the home screen covers
open very smoothly when compared to the
stock clock speed and kernel where the
opening animation appears jittery and
hesitates just a split second switching
between applications was never an issue
before and it happens very quickly after
the fact as well in chrome scrolling
appeared snappy on both as did pinch
zooming and swiping between tabs there
was no noticeable checkerboarding on
either overall the performance after
overclocking is slightly better than
before it's nothing major however it's
just a small improvement in all if
you're having trouble with performance
on your Galaxy Note 2 overclocking isn't
going to turn your phone into some
powerful super phone but it will
certainly help iron out some of the
kinks and improve overall performance
the numbers may not show it but the
real-world performance certainly does
