it sold on pre-order day and the number
is crazy Verizon kicks off its voice
over LTE on some popular handsets is
supported already and Microsoft's new
press invites in windows 9 i'm high
netting that I am that you can hear some
noises from the back that's because it's
pouring rain outside bear with me here
this is parking out daily today is
almost official news day in every way as
Microsoft has just sent our
presentations for an event to happen on
September 30th and even though the
company is not ending anything the only
thing that we do know that the company
needs to launch right now that is
planning to launch is windows 9 allowed
some changes to Windows Phone 9 or
whatever new name they will be giving to
Windows Phone we're getting some other
leaks of the windows branding on
Microsoft phones in the future so this
could be really interesting September
30th is actually very close how sorry
about verizon as the company has made it
official that they are launching voice
over LTE something that we didn't think
was going to exist so early it's not
work again it works on the galaxy s5 and
the LG g3 you can opt into the service
end it's actually free to do so the only
problem is that it only works on a
peer-to-peer way meaning you need to
call somebody that has a voice over LTE
compatible phone for the service to work
and there are some benefits obviously
through voice over LTE so stay tuned
then hopefully you will be able to test
it soon now one of the most anticipated
films of the year is the new Moto X
which we're currently reviewing but if
you want to get your hands on one you
can get one with moto maker service and
everything starting tomorrow on
pre-orders you get the pure version or
the AT&amp;amp;T variant as well and in addition
to that you get the moto gente you know
bluetooth headset along with that
powered charger that can get your Moto X
charged almost eighty percent in 15
minutes it's crazy and the price tags
aren't actually that bad so link to the
description for full details now this is
odd we are expecting for HTC to announce
a new camera or something on October but
then again we also get more hints off
the HTC I and this HTC I is actually a
Windows Phone that's rockin SF dragon
801 along with a 13 megapixel camera 5.2
inch display
and we are trying to understand exactly
why it is being dubbed the HTC I could
this be the successor to Lumia 1020 not
with that camera uh let's see what we
get in October hopefully and finally for
the very interesting news of the day
Apple has just published how many iPhone
6 models that sold on pre-order date
believe it or not the company has
announced that it sold over 4 million
units in 24 hours which is interesting
since they only sold two million of the
iphone 5 two years ago because they
never announced how many phones they
sold of the 5s in the 5c on pre-order
day which hints that it didn't go as
well as they expected so yeah four
million units of the iphone 6 and iphone
6 plus obviously they don't give out
specifics on which one sold more or less
but that leads me to the question of the
day then you choose any of these iphones
and if so which one that you pick
because in my case as i told you the
iphone 6 4.7 inch model is the one I
picked 128 gigs and I'm waiting for it
