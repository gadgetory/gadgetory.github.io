is Jules Wong I was talking now at my
first Galaxy unpacked event and this is
gaseous 8 vs gaseous 8 plus brought to
you by deeper sex we got them
snap during a 35 or an exodus 88 95 both
on 10 nanometer processes 4 gigabytes of
RAM 64 gigabytes of storage of micro sd
room for 256 IP 68 for dust production
and immersion and water up did 1.5
meters for 30 minutes us BC and winner
iris scanner check the same cameras
check fingerprint sensor and confusing
spot you betcha
ok really if you want a spec sheet have
a spec sheet look at that the batteries
and screens are of different sizes
Kell sabri's and that in failure display
oh man yeah put on Netflix it looks
mighty good and you can change the
output resolution to save on processing
power to ness D alright enough
patronizing you want to know the one
takeaway from this comparison you should
have drilled into your brain it's that
for a guy with chubby bear claws I feel
comfortable holding a phone with a 5.8
inch screen and a phone with a 6.2 inch
screen one else have I ever been able to
say that one else has one or hi Mase at
that bang for buck I don't think the LG
G six could feel more comfortable but
there is a question of usability after
all being comfortable holding the thing
is one side of the defense using it from
top to bottom is another we'll get to
that in future coverage but did you know
that jello is older than the zipper jela
was introduced in 1845 well the zipper
was first patented in 1851 we'd like to
thank our sponsor D brand for reminding
us that times are tough in the mid-1800s
you certainly couldn't zip up a full bag
of jell-o this bizarre ad and our
Samsung unpacked coverage is brought to
you by D brand check them out in the
link below
more from pocket now on our website and
on this YouTube page if you want s8
coverage the way we do it you can catch
us on Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram
