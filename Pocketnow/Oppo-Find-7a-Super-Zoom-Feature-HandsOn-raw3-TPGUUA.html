pretty unique camera features but how do
they do it I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is how the Oppo find
7 a can take 50 megapixel images with a
13 megapixel camera mobile manufacturers
are beefing up their camera options some
through hardware differentiation others
by way of some clever software trickery
and Chinese based manufacturer Oppo
wants in on the action
it's too recently announced handsets the
fine 7 and fine 7 a have a pretty
intriguing trick up their sleeves both
come fitted with a 13 megapixel camera
around back yet their maximum output
isn't 13 megapixels trying nearly four
times that that's right to find seven
and fine 7 a have 13 megapixel image
sensors it can output 50 megapixel
images what kind of black magic has Oppo
tapped into here is it a gimmick or
doesn't work as advertised let's take a
closer look instead of opting for a
major hardware upgrade like Nokia is
done with a 41 megapixel sensor Appa has
used a 13 megapixel AMX 214 CMOS sensor
from Sony in normal capture mode
pictures are taken at 13 megapixels and
this phone camera operates just like any
other smartphone camera point shoot edit
upload nothing fancy the real magic
happens when you activate the mode which
Oppo originally called super zoom we
were afraid when we received the 780
that the feature wasn't enabled yet or
then it may be a feature exclusive to
the higher-end fine 7 but after some
digging and asking Oppo directly the
mode has since been renamed HD picture
and we're told in the final version of
software it will be called ultra HD
convoluted feature branding aside what's
going on here is pretty simple and sort
of complex at the same time it's
actually quite beautiful in its
simplicity basically you select the HD
picture mode and fire away as usual the
camera will then take 10 full res
pictures select the best 4 and stitch
them together to create a 50 megapixel
image all in a matter of just a few
seconds the standard 13 megapixel
resolution is 40 160 by 3000 120 pixels
after taking an HD picture the output
resolution is 81 60 by 60 120 what it's
actually doing isn't unlike what
scientists used to
pictures of distant stars in space it
takes multiple photos and uses the
mighty differences in each capture to
fill in the blanks so to speak and helps
create an image four times its original
size and the result is actually quite
impressive more often than not at least
for us it worked pretty well
consistently producing clearer images
than the standard 13 megapixel shots and
the idea is that you can either then
crop the images without losing too much
detail or even resize the 50 megapixel
images it back down to the original
resolution and have a clearer picture
than the standard photo would have been
of course there are some caveats while
the 480 megapixel per second bandwidth
is impressive in its own right
taking 10 13 megapixel images in rapid
succession and stitching some of them
together takes several seconds to
process each time fortunately shaky
hands don't seem to throw the feature
off too much images usually turned out
better than we expected despite our
inability to stand still but not every
picture was perfect some came out
looking worse than the comparable 13
megapixels shots and some had some
strange digital artifacts likely from a
moving subject and all the stitching
going on easily one of the best examples
we captured was of a newspaper the color
of the picture was definitely degraded
to some degree but the HD picture we
took was noticeably sharper than the
regular shot particularly in the clarity
of the text at 100% crop this technology
doesn't come close to what Nokia is
doing with pure view and a 41 megapixel
sensor the 1020 easily Trump's this in
almost every way but for doing more with
less
Oppo certainly wins our vote of approval
the technology isn't exactly
mind-blowing but it's definitely more
impressive than a 13 megapixel camera
taking 50 megapixel images originally
sounded it sounded awfully gimmicky at
first but after some hands-on time it
actually turned out to be pretty useful
and very fun to tinker with and we're
definitely interested to see what Oppo
can do with this sort of technology in
the future
