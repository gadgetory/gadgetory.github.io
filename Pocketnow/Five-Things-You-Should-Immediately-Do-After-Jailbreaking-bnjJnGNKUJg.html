iPad and you don't know what to do don't
worry we have you covered I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and these are
the first five things you should do
immediately after jailbreaking when you
first get your iPhone or iPad jailbroken
you need to acquaint yourself with Cydia
so where you're going to spend most of
your time applying modifications and
looking for new mods yesterday our
fearless leader Brandon minimun showed
us one of the coolest mods out there
it's called accelerate and it's the
first one you should download after you
jailbreak it's free in Cydia and it does
exactly what it says it accelerates your
iOS experience normally backing out of
applications and switching between them
you see animations that slow everything
down accelerate can disable those and
you can choose different speeds at which
those animations occur you can choose
between warp speed and grass growing and
there is a major difference I've been
using warp speed and it is blazing fast
but it may be too fast for some of you
however if you don't like the animations
and warp speed is too fast you can
manually turn off the animations within
accelerate the second application you
should get from Cydia is called SB
Settings it fixes one of the biggest
problems of iOS the fact that there is
no quick settings option in iOS at all
it allows you to add these settings and
toggle switches to the Notification
Center you can also apply them as
widgets if you use other modifications
and there is a drop down menu that can
be accessed as well these toggles
include Wi-Fi GPS data screen brightness
and many more the third application you
should download from Cydia is called
activator it may already be on your
device and you not know it some other
applications from Cydia require it
I have activator setup to allow me to
swipe up from the bottom of the display
to access Siri from the lock screen and
one thing it does particularly well is
show off how well two applications from
Cydia can work together to accomplish
some pretty amazing tasks for instance I
have a triple press of the home button
set up to launch SB settings in the drop
down menu that I showed you a minute ago
but what activator does if the root of
it is allow you to launch different
things using gestures from swipes button
presses different tabs on the screen
and even multi-finger touches to launch
shortcuts applications and settings the
fourth application you should get from
Cydia is quite easily my favorite in all
of Cydia it is called browser changer
and it does exactly as the title
suggests it changes the default browser
by default in iOS if you click a link or
try to share something with the browser
it opens directly to Safari and you have
no way to change the default using
browser changer you can choose from any
of the third-party offerings in the App
Store and open links directly to those
without having to go to Safari first so
if you use Chrome or dolphin and you
click a link and you have browser
changer installed you can open directly
to those browser changer also allows you
to change the default Maps application
from the iOS 6 Maps app to Google Maps
you can't choose from any third-party
Maps application but you can open links
directly to Google Maps lastly you
should download winterboard from within
Cydia you can download hundreds and
hundreds of themes icon packages and
various other things to change the
interface from within Cydia find some
themes you like open them in winterboard
check them and hit respring three clicks
of the heels and you will have a totally
new interface that you can toy around
with and make look quite snazzy however
with these themes there are some quirks
and they don't always look as intended
but these modifications are only the
beginning of cydia it's only scratching
the surface from within City you can
find all sorts of different mods and
tweaks widgets you can also change the
way the task switcher looks you can add
quick settings to that same panel and
many many more mods and at the end of
the day if you found that jailbreaking
and modding is not for you you're only a
few steps away from unjailbroken and
setting everything back to normal as
