today I've got an unboxing for you from
something that came all the way across
the pond from Great Britain it's the
sony ericsson liveview let's go take a
look alright so shipped via royal mail
in a little bubble pack with an invoice
a packing slip and a kind of squished up
box is the sony ericsson liveview kind
of a little bit with its kind of just
free-floating maybe international
shipping should be a little bit a little
bit more robust than this but let's go
ahead and open it up so we'll cut
through the seal here off camera so if I
cut my finger off you won't notice all
the blood and screaming but there we go
we got it opened and they really don't
want you to get into this very easily ok
first off out of the box is a UK style
power wall wart with a microUSB end
obviously I'm not going to be using that
I can charge it up with my powered USB
hub and just one of my normal micro USB
cable so no problem there next is a
wrist strap now this is very much like a
watch but not necessarily so when I say
like a watch because it's got these
little wachee springs here the wrist
strap is velcro with your little place
to hook your little wachee springs right
here that of course goes through the
band and then turns this into a wrist
watch i'll probably be putting a better
band on it than this but just to show
you what comes with it there you go also
you've got this little frame the little
piece of tape on it and this little
frame is just a little piece of plastic
and that of course matches with
the watch strap just like that because
you're watching Springs it would be nice
if they had included if they
preassembled this but they didn't so you
get to launch those little Wachee
Springs across the room and try and hunt
them down after the fact but let's move
on to the good stuff and the good stuff
of course I mean is the manuals right
there you've got your important legal
information and your live view user
guide which has a whole bunch of stuff
that we're not going to talk about okay
moving along yes I know what you're
really after is this part and this is
the actual device itself comes with a
clip which is nice I'm sure there's a
way to get that off so that you can use
it with a little wachee clip band down
on the bottom here we have a little
rubber plug covering up that micro USB
charging port and it's nice it just
slides out here on a half i can get it
open again on a little extender so it's
not going to be putting too much
pressure on that at normal times you've
got a screen protector i'm going to go
ahead and take this off and there's the
screen compared to my thumb so you can
see the dimensions got that all right so
what else do we have up here on the top
we have what looks like a power button
so if you can see that right there over
on the other side we have an action
button and that's about it on the back
here we've got this magic little green
doohickey looking thing which i'm sure
it tells us about in the user manual but
of course since we never read those i
have no idea what it is and then of
course it's got some information in the
back of it is it powered up can we just
turn it on doesn't look like it but
there you go the unboxing of the sony
ericsson live view which is basically a
PDA for your PDA or a very very
bluetooth smart watch or very very smart
bluetooth watch depending on how you
want to look at it that will get data
from your android-powered phone and
display it on this screen so you don't
even have to pull your android out since
i need to charge this
obviously going to be in an upcoming
video so make sure you subscribe to our
channel so you don't miss out on that if
you like seeing these unboxings
subscribe and of course thumbs up this
video so you can share it with your
friends and showing you cool devices
like this sony ericsson liveview for
pocket now I'm Jolie bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
