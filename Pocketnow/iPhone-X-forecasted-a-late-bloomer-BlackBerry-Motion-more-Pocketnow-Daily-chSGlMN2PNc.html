iPhone 10 delays already have analysts
warning investors we get some new
photographs of the BlackBerry motion
which was the Krypton that we used to
call we have a few new things that
Google didn't tell you at its launch
event
I'm hi Matt Rivera and I would enjoy
Friday's even more if I could take them
as a day off wink this is parking out
daily the official news today began with
deals that will pixel to and pixel to
excel were recently announced for those
of you in the market for any of these
currently it's $25 off in the case of
the pixel to excel on Best Buy and then
if you want the pixel to on Verizon you
can get as much as $100 off you can
learn more link in the description now
not everything is positive as Netflix
has just decided to raise the price tag
for its service those of you that are
currently using the basic Netflix
service that'll cost you ten ninety-nine
that's it this month and then in the
case of you're using the premium HDR in
4k service that's going to cost you 14
bucks not that I'm saying that I feel
that it's expensive I feel Netflix is
just too inexpensive for what you get
but yeah it's getting more expensive
food now there are a couple of things
that Google didn't really tell you at
its event one of the major selling
points of the pixel is the fact that you
get unlimited google photo storage if
you have one but the company didn't
really tell us that there's a limitation
and that's the fact that they will only
be supporting this for three years of
meaning that yeah sure you're gonna get
unlimited photos but after three years
you're on your own unless you continue
upgrading to do pixels which is not
necessarily a bad idea either now let's
talk about the BlackBerry motion no
longer the BlackBerry krypton famous
tipster Evan blast just leaked the photo
of what to expect and well I don't know
what to say I mean there's this huge
blackberry button at the bottom the
device looks interesting I mean I'm not
saying the design is ugly I'm just
saying that it's unique because there
are significant bezels at the bottom
still there could be a purpose for this
design and it's one thing that we can't
wait to discover we were expecting that
by now sometime in October we would hear
about this new device and it turns out
that we're still waiting but we'll keep
it posted as soon as we learn more
and finally the very hot news today I
have to do with the iPhone 10 and KGI
yet again as well all the batch of
rumors of the iPhone 10 and its supply
chain and the yield issues that it's
having and the problems that it's having
to be able to create enough face IDs for
the phone is already having men shikoh
recommending investors that now the
supercycle or the major sales of the
iPhone are not going to happen in 2017
if they want to make money and profits
they're gonna have to wait until 2018
which pretty much just proves the fact
that even analysts are not confident
that this phone is going to launch early
enough given the delays that are
expected so you know it leads me to the
question today once you get analyst
involved in this it's pretty much a
given then that's going to happen so
what is your plan B if you were planning
on getting the iPhone 10 which would be
the second phone that you're considering
in my case I can't stress enough how
much I like that goal pixel to excel and
how much I can't stop using the Galaxy
Note 8 that's my list and I'm just
waiting for the LGB 30 as well so hey
