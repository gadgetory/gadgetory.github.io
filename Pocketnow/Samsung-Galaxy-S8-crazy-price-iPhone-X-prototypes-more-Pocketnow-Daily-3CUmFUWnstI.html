not getting any more affordable at
launch sources say that Apple is
definitely not going full OLED with the
next iPhone retailers claims the Nokia
3310 sales are astonishing I'm high
memory that I am to forgive me for all
those of the opposing teams if I wear
this shirt today with pride this is
market out daily the officially say they
have to do with Best Buy and deals is
here in the market for a really
affordable smartphone we never really
recommended the LG g5 mainly because of
its problems but right now Best Buy has
it with the sprint variant for five
dollars a month which if you do the math
it's a crazy $120 that's just cheaper
than anything in that phone is actually
very powerful regardless of its problems
so yeah why not also about another crazy
deal the Nokia 3310 made a lot of
commotion at MWC and for those of you
too thought this was just aged well
Carphone Warehouse has just come on
record to claim that the company is
astonished by the level of demand of the
3310 it makes a lot of sense of thing
it's only going to cost 49 euros and
well it's a nostalgic thing that people
will most likely perform a ton of dropp
tests on oh well after those of you that
have been waiting for the
next-generation I've had I am one of
them well we apparently still don't have
a date for when to expect them what we
do notice is that there are some really
interesting tips over the fact that the
10.5 inch iPad pro is a reality why
because case makers rarely get it wrong
and apparently there is this case where
a case maker just pretty much everything
you need to know about the size and
dimensions of this tablet you can learn
more in the link in description and
speaking of iOS products we learn two
very interesting things about the next
generation iPhone number one is the fact
that apparently there are many
prototypes being tested right now it
seems that Apple still has not defined
which is going to be the final design
and - apparently Apple is not going to
be ready to go fully oled according to
trusted sources if the company is only
going to do this partially and is
going to be ready until 2019 yeah that's
that's that's really far I know but
anyway
and finally a very interesting news
today have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
s8 and some new developments over two
things number one we hear that there is
an extra color option we heard black we
heard gold and orchid gray apparently
there's also a violet option which would
make sense but then again be one thing
that does not make sense or the rest of
the rumors that claim the price tag we
don't know exactly why but apparently
the regular Galaxy f8 is going to be
costing $7.99 and then the higher tier
plus variant is going to be costing 850
obviously it's really hard to confirm
and what we hear are the European price
points but this pretty much is $100 or
100 euro over what the Galaxy s7 and
galaxy s7 edge were costing so it leads
me to the question of the day do you
think of these phones warrant a price
tag that is this expensive or do you
think that Samsung is really really not
handling it well especially with
everything that happened with it oh
seven in my case with the premium mid
Rangers you know just doing the crate
that they're doing and then the flagship
killers like the one plus 3t it makes no
sense to pay double for a galaxy but
anyways leave us a comment down below
