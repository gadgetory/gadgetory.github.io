it hasn't sold out actually nokia also
moves the needle in their smartphone
market share the united states and yes
we are giving away of google nexus 5 i'm
hi meri beta and if you haven't noticed
that this is actually the fourth should
I've worn today this is out
daily let's search they off with some
official and actually very cool news as
Nokia and notice I did not say Windows
Phone I said Nokia let's just move the
needle of their market share to four
percent of the US market and this is big
news actually I'm not talking just about
Windows Phone there's just one OEM even
though it's most of Windows Phone but
still this means that Windows Phone is
as well growing in the United States
which is great news nokia has done a lot
of sacrifice a lot of good work in their
phones lately and we are expecting them
to actually grow they deserve it and
it's actually great now let's go through
some sort of bad news for the android
4.4 kitkat rooting community as it turns
out the Colonel's got this new security
feature that protects it from malware
and exploits and that's pretty much the
way you root a phone we still don't know
exactly the way this is going to play
out obviously the routing community is
going to figure this one out but so far
to see that there is a hurdle there and
cyanogenmod has just published their 4.3
upgrade but 4.4 still in the pipeline so
you get where things are going right at
speaking of android 4.4 on the good side
HTC is now the first OEM to tell us
their plans for 4.4 and this is actually
good and bad first of all in the case of
the google edition HTC one you can
expect the update in the next couple of
weeks probably this or next week that's
great but then in the case of the
unlocked HTC one you have to wait 90
days yeah 90 days next year when the HTC
to is launched and then for those of you
that are waiting for you know android
4.4 on your carrier variants for the
united states have nothing to tell you
sadly we don't know now let's go through
some hot news as the google nexus 5 has
just begun arriving in doorsteps which
is great news people are already getting
it but
if you weren't lucky enough to order
your own phone or if you're still
waiting for it we've got your back don't
worry we're giving away google nexus 5
next week yes the white burien 16 gigs
the phone that a lot of people have been
waiting for we are giving it away for
free and this is not limited to the
United States anybody can participate
licks in the description for full
details on how to do it we're giving it
away next week in the pocket now weekly
and I know a lot of you can't wait and
finally for the odd news of the day
Apple's iPad air went on sale today you
can bet our unboxing it's live there are
a lot of comparisons and our review
coming up very soon but interesting i
mean the tablet did not sell out for the
first time ever i believe the stores are
packed with iPads you could go to the
store right now and buy your own or
online whatever is best for you but it's
really on i mean we haven't heard
reports of crazy lines we haven't heard
reports of anything so could it be that
Apple was really prepared for this
launch or could it be that well people
are waiting for the ipad mini with
retina display so that is the question
of the day are you waiting for the mini
with retina displays are you getting an
ipad air are you getting another tablet
that's not an ipad in my particular case
honestly i went for the air that's
pretty much my case but leave us a
comment down below what are you doing
