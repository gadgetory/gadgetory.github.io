the Samsung Galaxy s5 at least talk
about the Nokia android phone that we
still can't believe in and the
cyanogenmod phone is out even though we
still don't know if you're gonna buy I'm
hi Mary that I and yeah those are
fireworks outside this is Christmas Eve
and the only reason why I'm here is
because my beers are still hot this is
pocket out daily and Merry Christmas
let's search the office of official news
as the Oppo n1 CyanogenMod variant is
finally on sale yes you can forget up to
date and obviously it's big as a benefit
is the fact that you're getting
cyanogenmod pre-loaded on the phone now
the question is if you're really buying
into this device because the biggest
reason why I'm skeptical is because it
has a six hundred dollar price tag for
something that you can currently get for
free on your phone right now unless
you're using an iphone obviously now
Amazon is clearly interested in landing
more customers for their App Store for
Android outside the kindle platform and
the reason why I'm saying this is
because the company is right now
offering five dollars of a gift card for
you to be able to buy applications
within their store but that only works
if you're using any other device that's
not a kindle device which is such an
irony so could this be that Amazon is
just trying to lure new customers or
could it be that their app store is not
really doing so well now let's talk
about the note kid Normandy project
which is assumed to be the first note
get android phone to launch we keep
getting more leaks of the spell now in
beautiful colors which include a very
green green that's really green and
leave it at that but the problem is the
more that I look at this phone the more
that I think this is not really an
android phone I mean unless we're
getting soft keys we don't get what that
back ps4 and a lot of people believe
that this is just the Asha OS or even
windows phone 8.1 with the whole virtual
buttons so stay tuned our company that
really deserves praise is Sony I was at
the keynote at CES when their CEO said
that they were going to take software
seriously with Android this year and
their offerings and they have delivered
there now launching Android 4.3 to the
Xperia Z Xperia Z L and the tablet Z
which is great you can download it right
now and you can bet I'm going to do that
with my ZL but you know even more
interesting is that android 4.4 should
be right around
Corner and I am willing to forgive the
bad viewing angles on my xperia ZL just
because of this and finally for the hot
news of the day we get some more reports
that samsung is buying the panels
further galaxy s5 already that's really
early so we could probably get a phone
early apparently we are getting a five
point 25 inch AMOLED display apparently
we are not going LCD and there are more
confirmations that this will be a 2k
display coming apparently this is not
going to be a curve display though so
don't get your hopes up but anyways that
least use a question of the day with all
this 2k talk do you want a 2k display on
your phone in 2014 or will you rather
OEMs work on better battery life because
in my particular case I really don't see
pixels on 1080p right now so I would
rather get the you know better battery
life on my phone and not 2k display
probably until 2015 but leave us a
comment down below what would you prefer
and friends II know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video still make sure you follow us on
packing out comments ask reptile youtube
channel as well you'd also follow me on
twitter at heine underscore iveta please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw i am hi Matt I'm a better
thank you very much for watching we will
see you again on Thursday because I will
be drunk tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
