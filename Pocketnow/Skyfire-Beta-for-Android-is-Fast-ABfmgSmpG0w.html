pocket now calm skyfire is finally out
of alpha and now into beta and ready for
you to download let's take a look at how
it works so for those of you that don't
know skyfire is a browser like opera
mini that uses server-side rendering to
do all the heavy lifting on their
computers rather than on your mobile
device which is kind of limited in
processing power um so what that means
is that page load times are dramatically
quicker so if I tap on a link here and
i'm using the hd2 just to show an
example let's see how fast it was and
it's done usually paid look page load
times come in under seven seconds on the
Windows Phone version so we are really
curious to see how skyfire did with our
Android implementation which just today
came out of alpha so I'm going to unlock
the screen and let's zoom in here now
sky fires change the logo for their
program it's kind of nice over here all
right and here we are in sky fire so the
first thing I'm going to do is load
pocketnow.com see how long that takes
okay and it's it's done that was almost
as fast as the hd2 a little bit slower
so we're starting out in a very zoomed
out view I haven't set that way and then
of course we can zoom in if you're using
an Android to point out or above device
you can use the multi-touch to get more
precise when you're zooming or there's a
little zoom tool you can use that I have
hidden right now if you do not have an
android 2.2 bucks so rendering fidelity
is quite fantastic let's get in on a
headline and see how fast it loads the
next page okay there we go
okay good again that was about seven
seconds now unfortunately skyfire did
not come out of the gate with flash
support in some of their windows mobile
builds they did a flash support but it
has a really cool video function let me
show you what that looks like so I'm
going to zoom in and go to this HTC
Desire review which I know has some
flash video and by the way it does have
a support for the accelerometer so we
can go into landscape and we keep it in
portrait so now the browser is going to
detect that I've got some flash video
embedded within this page I should see a
pop-up within a few seconds maybe not so
I'm going to press the menu button down
here and it's actually not working what
it should be doing and it's done this in
the past is that you get a little video
pop up here and you can actually play
the flash video in a dedicated skyfire
flash video player so let's go to
youtube.com and probably demonstrate
that a little bit better there okay then
here we are loading up YouTube and by
the way there's a really cool toggle up
here that will let you switch between
the desktop Android and iPhone version
of a particular website and lots of
websites have mobile-friendly pages that
you can that you can load so let's zoom
in and go to a video I'll just choose
this one okay see I got a pop-up right
there and it's telling me that there's a
video on the page I cannot play the
video within the page but I can play it
within the special skyfire video loader
so it's going to download the video all
right and here comes the video oddly it
doesn't show up so maybe dance a video
that doesn't work very well let's go
back to the previous page and click on
another video maybe there was a problem
with that video or maybe that's just a
bug here in skyfire beta
again we get the video pop up so I'm
going to tap play to go into landscape
okay so perhaps that was a problem with
just that video as you can see the video
is coming in quite nicely so a pretty
cool feature a way that skyfire actually
strips out the video from the page makes
it accessible simultaneously while I'm
down here you can tap on the share
button and share any of these right to
Twitter or to peep it really pulls from
your device and it knows that I've tweed
Royd installed I Facebook installed i
peep installed so you don't have to
actually go to the websites you can use
the native applications that are built
into your device there's also an
explorer button down here which I don't
find myself using too much it'll search
the internet for a similar content to
what you're looking at right now so I'm
going to hide this bottom bar just by
pressing the menu button and let's go
back up here to some of the settings so
if I tap on the arrow I can go to
forward find on the page select text
let's go into settings so from here we
can disable that little toolbar that you
saw earlier so I can check or uncheck
that I can show the status bar at the
top this is really cool so you can get a
little bit more screen real estate you
can't do this in other browser
applications on Android so I'm going to
leave the status bar turned on shows you
the skyfire version you can tap on
browser settings to determine how your
initial zoom is so I haven't set on far
I like to have an overview of the page
before I get started with it standard
zoom controls which will show you the
plus and the minus on the page you can
change your start page that change the
default of how it should load whether
you should see the desktop version first
or the mobile version and some other
stuff for loading images and JavaScript
let's see how it does with multiple tabs
so I'm going to tap on the tab button
click on new tab and I'm going to open
up pocketnow.com another thing I want to
mention is that the bookmark tab over
here inherits your bookmarks from your
device so I've already set up a few
bookmarks in the stock android browser
skyfire is inheriting those which is
nice so here we are on pocket now calm
it's a second tab we have opened and I
can tap on this tab go back to YouTube
they say you can have up to eight tabs
open but I'm going to say that if you do
that the performance of the browser is
going to degrade pretty quickly
so I'm going to open up a third let's go
back to engadget again really really
fast page load times and I'm going to go
back to pocket now and as you can see
it's already getting very very choppy in
fact I'm going to exit out of one of
those and only have to open so overall I
think the beta for skyfire on Android is
quite good it lives up to the
expectation that skyfire should be fast
that said navigation the multi-touch
support and the reef lowing of text
columns still needs a lot of work I
don't think it's good enough yet to be
my daily browser I'm still going to
stick with the standard Android browser
which you know just does a tremendous
job both in speed and navigation here's
here's pocket now calm I can just be so
much more precise but that said if you
want something fast especially over
cellular network then the sky fire is
the way to go you can go to get that
skyfire com to get it and we'll post a
link on pocket now calm on other
resources relating to sky fire that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
