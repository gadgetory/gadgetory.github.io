pocketnow.com
and this is a comparison video between
the HTC Touch HD and HTC touch diamond2
a lot of people have been emailing us
asking us to do this comparison because
they're very similar devices and you may
have trouble deciding on which one to go
with now this is gonna be mainly a
hardware comparison because the software
is very similar except for the addition
of the new version of touchflo 3d on the
touch diamond2 and if you're looking for
more information about that check out
our touch diamond2 review at
pocketnow.com
now let's start with availability both
of these devices are not sold in the US
right now they are sold unlocked in
europe but you can import them into the
United States and use them on t-mobile
or AT&amp;amp;T if you buy through a store like
clove coat UK they'll ship anywhere in
terms of price the Touch HD is still
more expensive it comes out to about 650
to 680 dollars depending on the currency
exchange rate at the time and the touch
diamond2 is actually less expensive
right now it's about five hundred and
fifty dollars again depending on the
currency exchange rate right now both
devices have the same screen resolution
so it's 800 down and 480 across and
that's the highest resolution that
Windows Mobile can support now the touch
HD obviously has a much larger screen
even bigger than the iPhone it's 3.8
inches across the diagonal whereas the
touch diamond2 is a 3.2 inch screen
diagonal this is actually in the favour
for the touch diamond2 because the pixel
density is higher that means within a
square inch there will be more pixels
meaning if you look at the same image
from the same distance it'll actually
appear a little crisper on the touch
diamond2
let's talk about the in hand feel of
both of these devices before we do that
let's get a size comparison so that we
can get an idea of how they compare in
size the touch diamond2 is actually
about one millimeter thicker than the
touch HD and of course the touch HD is
significantly wider let me try to line
them up then the touch diamond2 which
actually gives it an awkward in hand
if you've ever held a touch HD you know
that it's very very wide and you really
feel in your pocket whereas with the
touch diamond2 it's more of a narrow
phone and it feels more like a phone
rather than a PDA like the touch
diamond2 feels like if we zoom into the
top we see similar features although
it's slightly different up here here we
have the light sensor in the speaker
with a front-facing video camera and
over here we have a LED status light the
status light on the on the HD is
actually on the top of the standby
button and then we have the light sensor
and then the front-facing video camera
going down here we have some hardware
keys and I actually like the hardware
keys on the diamond to much better
because you can feel for them on the
touch HD they are completely flat and
they are kind of an extension of the
resistive touch screen so you kind of
have to look at them if you want to make
sure you're ending the call or you're
starting the car or you're going back
home or pressing the ok button now over
here the ok or the home button is
actually replaced by the start menu
button which i think is very convenient
it really helps with one-handed
usability especially with such a long
screen so if you're walking down the
street and you want to launch the Start
menu on this device you have to reach
your thumb all the way up here to do so
but if you're using the touch diamond2
all you have to do is use your thumb and
press the start start menu button there
and it will open right up let's flip
over to the bottom on the bottom we have
the microphone here and here and then we
have HTC's proprietary jack which will
work with all mini USB hardware let's go
over to this side and here we see the
stylus and you can actually see the very
fingerprint prone backing to the touch
diamond2 there now the stylus on the
touch HD is magnetic so if you take it
out and you bring it closer it'll
actually suck it all the way in that's
not the case on the touch diamond2
unfortunately i don't know why HTC
emitted this feature so it doesn't suck
in as you can see that said both style.i
plural for stylus will turn on the
screen when you take out the stylus and
the devices turned on and that is also
the case on the touch diamond2 let's
take a look at the other side here we
have the volume up and down rocker z'
and they're identical if you can see
that flipping over to the back we have
to mega-pick our five megapixel cameras
on both devices they both take fantastic
pictures something that's different here
is that the speaker on the touch HD is
on the back which is kind of detrimental
because if you throw it on your bed and
you're waiting for a phone call it may
muffle the speaker a little bit whereas
on the touch diamond2 it's actually
pointing off to the side which is much
better both devices do not have a flash
on the camera but they do have autofocus
again making four really great pictures
if we take off the back of both of these
devices we get to see the batteries and
the batteries are 1,100 milliamp hours
on the diamond2 and 1350 milliamp hours
on the touch HD what's really
interesting though is that the touch
diamond2 actually has I'd say twenty to
thirty percent better battery life even
though it has a smaller battery then
does the touch HD now also on the back
you will find the reset hole for the
touch HD and on the diamond too it's
kind of hard to see because it's behind
the stylus a little red dot there it is
now also behind the battery cover on
both of these devices is the microSD
slot so you can see it over here on the
diamond - and over here on the the touch
HD now that's kind of annoying because
you have to take off the battery cover
to change your microSD slot so if you're
swapping out a lot of music on both
devices you'll have to stop and take off
the battery cover and if we flip the
devices over to the top we see the
standby buttons are in a different
location and we see that the touch HD
has a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
although the diamond - does not I
actually encourage you to read atom
lanes post on why the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack is stupid he makes some
really good points this may be a
deal-breaker for some of you but I
really don't think it's a big deal
there's a you can use a converter jack
to easily get 3.5 millimeter audio from
the diamond - in terms of specifications
both devices have almost identical
specifications they both have a Qualcomm
528 megahertz CPU although with a
slightly different model number that I
don't think makes too much of a
difference especially in the benchmark
tests they both have 512 megabytes of
rom and 288 megabytes of RAM they both
have USB 2.0 of course they Bluetooth
2.0 Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G assisted GPS a light
sensor and accelerometer an FM radio
pretty much the same spec for spec the
only real difference is the battery the
hardware are the the screen size and the
placement of some things such as the
status indicator and how the buttons are
arranged down here so that's pretty much
all for the differences in
specifications so which of these devices
is better well I think the answer is
pretty clear-cut under most
circumstances five reasons why the touch
of diamond 2 is better than the touch HD
number one the price is lower right now
can't argue with that number two of the
feel is better it feels more like a
phone than it does a PDA because it's
less wide than the massive touch HD also
the battery life is better on the touch
diamond2 also the touch diamond2 will
get a free upgrade to windows mobile 6.5
later this year which the touch HD will
not get and also finally number five the
the addition of these hardware buttons
really makes for an added level of
one-handed usability in addition having
the zoom slider here kind of keep your
thumb down here if you're walking down
the street in here
zooming in on a map when you're trying
to find a cafe or you want to quickly
launch the Start menu by just tapping on
a button like so now of course the
screen on the Touch HD is bigger so if
you are into watching a lot of movies on
your device I think the point six inches
will actually make a difference if
you're watching a ton of movies but
other than that I think it's really good
compromise to have a slightly smaller
screen and smaller phone on the diamond
to the screen resolution is still the
same so you get that crystal-clear
picture I'm just not in such a large
form factor so that's it for the
comparison between the touch diamond2
and the touch HD for more comparisons
