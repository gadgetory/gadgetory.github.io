smartphones and even a surface
competitor 1 plus decides to take a new
approach to testing its future one plus
three and it seems that Apple will
finally woke up the smell di phone
storage coffee I'm high memory that i'm
looking for a lot of noise in a more
colorful scenery for Memorial Day
weekend this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with one plus
we've been waiting for the one plus
three for quite a while we've seen
certification documents and everything
but the company now launched a new one
plus three or should I say 1 plus lab
the whole purpose of this is to test the
new one plus 3 but apparently it's going
to be close to around just 30 people
with the whole idea of just providing
criticism for what we should recommend
for the 1 plus 3 and let's just hope
that that ends up providing us a better
device with the quad HD display at the
end now as will the spotlight over to
the new rumors of a probable surface
phone we've been covering these four
years but there are some now interesting
renders where we see the back of a Lumia
1020 and we hear specifications that
start with 36 and probably 8 gigabytes
of RAM in addition to 500 gigs of
storage whether that happens you're not
a still yet to be seen but it would be a
good idea and speaking of storage we
have some trusted sources that are
claiming that Apple finally woke up and
smell the coffee apparently the
next-generation iphone 7 will now start
at 32 gigs which is legendary Apple has
started with 16 gigs of storage i
believe ever since the iphone 4 which
launched in 2010 so it's been a while
since the company has been forcing
people to go to upper storage hopefully
32 gigs means it'll go up to 64 gig on
the next year and then up to 256 gigs
but we'll stay tuned and learn more now
computex is on its way currently in
Taipei and a sous obviously took over
with its new transformer 3n transformer
three pro what makes this product unique
is actually nothing because the
transformer three looks a lot like of an
iPad had a baby and then in the case of
the transformer three pro it looks like
the case of a surface pro for having a
baby specifications are quite compelling
though and the price tags are so well
you can learn more in the links of the
description and finally the hottest news
that I have to do with azusa's new
lineup of smartphones is end
phone 3 sent bone 3 deluxe and the ultra
in the case of the zenfone 3 it's a
premium mid-ranger starts at two hundred
fifty dollars for gigs of RAM Snapdragon
650 too but in the case of the deluxe
that's the full-blown device Snapdragon
820 with the whole nine yards of what we
expect our flagship is these days but in
the case of the ultra we thought that
this would be a monster tablet and well
it's pretty much a monster phablet 6.8
inch display but then it's got a
Snapdragon 650 do processor so it's
clearly targeted to the premium
mid-range market and the price tag also
says as well but it leads me to the
question of today what do you think
about this new lineup of zen phones do
you find them compelling or not in my
case I just find it funny that pretty
much every mid-ranger right now or
blackship rocks the same specs we don't
see anything that's unique with the
exception of what we saw right now from
ZTE but leave us a comment down below we
would love to know your opinion come on
all you nosy cars I want the noisiest to
all rack up right now for this video the
noisiest car is noisy as motorcycles you
name it I want them all it's that the
bikes there's new lineup of smartphones
see I hate my job sometimes run 652 for
gigs of ram and come on I just want one
more clip just one more zenfone 3 deluxe
