got thinking while I was using this
brand new at Droid Razr HD how does it
stack up as far as look and feel to its
predecessor just the standard Droid Razr
just go take a look before I give things
away can you tell which of these two
devices is the Motorola Droid Razr HD
and which one is just the standard Droid
Razr not even the RAZR MAXX
alright times up this one is the HD this
one is the standard razor released about
a year ago let's start with some
differences up here on the top you're
gonna notice you've got the Motorola
logo much smaller then over here the
reason for that they're freeing up all
of this space in the middle too to let
you have a really really nice big screen
over here the screen starts about here
and ends about here whereas on the HD it
starts here and comes all the way down
to here now they've done some things to
make that work over on the razor this
the camera is right underneath this
branding along with some of the ambient
light sensors and whatnot
over here it's kind of moved up and over
to the side making a lot better use of
the space up here you've also got your
sensors over on this side as well as far
as notification LEDs go this Motorola
logo kind of has a little underline
beneath it a little clear plastic well
something whereas over here not so much
that's because this entire thing all the
way underneath the Motorola logo is your
notification LED this thing is huge
you've just got to see it to believe it
it's amazingly huge over here on the
side the razor being on the bottom
you'll notice we've got a little thumb
nail operated door where we can get in
and add a micro SD card and our SIM no
power port or HDMI port on this side of
the razor on the HD you've got that
little hole that you poke that special
tool into rotating around to the
top this is where the standard razor has
those two ports that we just mentioned
as well as its headphone jack over on
its big brother the HD headphone jack on
the top the other ports we just talked
about on the side moving around to the
right side of the device power and
volume up and down are in the same place
so if you're familiar with this button
orientation you're gonna be right at
home
most people are measuring the thickness
of the razor at 7.1 millimeters
they don't however include the camera
bump see how that's kind of a bumped out
there quite a bit it's a nice place to
rest your finger and helps you hold on
to this otherwise small device over on
the HD you might not even notice but
there is a very very slight camera bump
it starts about here and goes up to the
top very very slight it is a little bit
thicker this coming in at eight point
four millimeters rather than seven point
one but I don't mind that thickness at
all it feels really really good it feels
like it should
let's get to the guts inside the devices
you've got a TI OMAP processor it's 1.2
gigahertz dual-core
over in the razor in the razor HD that's
bumped up to the brand new Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 plus not the pro that
we're seeing in some of the other really
high-end devices but the plus which
isn't a bad thing that's still very very
high-end it's a very nice processor and
it's dual-core clocked at 1.5 gigahertz
and of course uses that crate
architecture that we've been so looking
forward to batteries over here 1780
milliamp hours compared to 2530 so not
quite as much as the RAZR MAXX
but so far battery life hasn't been a
problem so that's kind of a walk-around
of the hardware let's go ahead and take
a look a little bit at the software kind
of a fun unlock screen here where we can
select what tasks we want to go to so
just go ahead and unlock very smooth
very fluid you'll see more of this of
course in the full review over at
pocketnow.com so comparing the to the
old razor to the new razor HD 4 pocket
now I'm
Levi and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
