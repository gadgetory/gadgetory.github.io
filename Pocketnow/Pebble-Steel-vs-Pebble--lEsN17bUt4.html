compare let's take a look I'm Tanner
Martin this is PocketNow and this is the
pebble steel versus the original pebble
when we first learned we'd see new
pebble Hardware at CES 2014 we got very
excited maybe a little too excited
we loved the original pebble and many of
us here at PocketNow have adopted the
pioneering SmartWatch but the watch was
not without faults and any improvements
on the original would be graciously
welcomed it's fair to say however pebble
steel wasn't quite what we expected on
several levels
is it the Smart Watch to beat and most
importantly is it worth the additional
$100 over the original model that's what
we're here to find out as we compare
pebble steel with the original pebble we
typically start our comparisons with
hardware since so many of the devices we
compare are so drastically different in
the hardware department most also have a
healthy portion of software differences
as well this comparison is different the
software on the pebble steel and the
original pebble is for all intents and
purposes exactly the same on the user
end
they're both compatible with all the
same watch faces and apps and operate
identically on the software side the
brunt of the differences reside on the
hardware side of the equation and boy
are they drastic and great we're all
familiar with the appearance of the
original pebble the casing is made
almost entirely of polycarbonate with a
glossy finish on the top side it comes
in five color options orange cherry red
jet black arctic white and gray it also
ships with the TPU watchstrap but it's
also compatible with any standard 22
millimeter watch band and it's easily
replaceable Michael and I both quickly
replaced our standard watch straps with
PVD coated steel straps to add some
weight and polish to the otherwise
understated design pebble steel as the
name suggests is made almost entirely of
steel a marine grade stainless steel and
comes in two style options brushed steel
or PVD coating regardless of the color
you choose pebble steel ships with two
watch bands a steel band or a leather
strap and it's not compatible with just
any other watch strap
dimensions of the faces are notably
different as well the original pebble
measures 52 millimeters from pin to pin
36 millimeters wide and 11 point five
millimeters thick pebble steel is six
millimeters shorter 2 millimeters
narrower and one millimeter thinner
those differences may sound minuscule
but they're significant particularly to
someone with small wrists and as you
would imagine steel is a tad heavier
than the original 56 grams to the
originals 38 toss the steel band on and
you can add another 99 grams to the
weight however since we've added the
strap to our original pebble the
difference is less noticeable simply
from a design perspective pebble steel
is far superior and far better looking
than the original pebble you can try to
disguise the stark nerdiness of the
original by throwing the steel band on
it as Michael and I have done but
there's something off about how it looks
a plastic watch faced with a $50 steel
band is a dead giveaway that something
else is going on
pebble steel on the other hand is under
a near-perfect guys regardless of which
band you prefer leather or steel pebble
steel closely resembles a luxury watch
in fact it is a luxury watch the only
tales that will give away its true
nature are the sharp attention-seeking
buzzes and unusual watch faces or apps
oh and the pebble running at the bottom
of the face which is new along with the
better build quality comes some other
improvements for instance the buttons
both models feature the same button
configuration but we've always felt the
buttons on the original have over sort
of difficult to press with very little
tech tivity more or less they're mushy
with a lot of resistance and they wobble
when you press them on pebble steel the
buttons are very easy to press and offer
a nice click the other upgrade on the
face is Gorilla Glass 2 the plastic on
the face of the original pebble
scratched on my personal unit on the
very first day Gorilla Glass will help
avoid shattering and hopefully keep
nasty scratches at bay so far it's also
appeared to be less prone to smudging
despite so vast external differences
they are practically identical on the
inside both are powered by a 120
megahertz arm cortex-m 3 cpu come with
Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy support have
130 million power battery and come with
a host of sensors both also come with a
water resistance rating of 5 atmospheres
and gets all ok to shower or even swim
with either pebble on
the displays are identical as well a 1.2
6-inch display with a resolution of 144
by 168 pixels with an LED backlight
however the pebble steel does have two
more upgrades the inbuilt storage has
been doubled from 4 megabytes to 8
megabytes though both the steel and the
original are capped eight aftermarket
watch apps it's unclear whether this
additional storage will be for future
proofing with software updates or more
user storage in the future for more
watch apps it also has an RGB
notification light which only currently
shows charging status Orange when
charging and green when fully charged
and finally speaking of charging the
magnetic charging ports are different
the new one is smaller and more squared
than before killing any hopes of using
the current Pebble charging cables with
pebble steel or any existing owners
looking to upgrade with virtually the
same exact internals and software the
user experience is approximately the
same between both models but note that
there are finished differences the
tactility of the buttons makes it far
easier to navigate through menus scroll
through notifications and interact with
pebble pebble steel doesn't feel as if
it's fighting back when you want to
control your music or check into a
location using Foursquare and for some
especially those who have already spent
extensive time with pebble this will go
a long way all you've only had pebble
steel for a day there's no reason to
suspect battery life will be any
different from before
both are rated at 5 to 7 days on a
single charge and I've exceeded that
estimate many times with the original
pebble so the hundred dollar question is
pebble steel worth it or should you go
with the lower end pebble for just 150
dollars if you're in the market for your
first pebble you have to answer some
questions first do you want a watch that
will go just as well with dress attire
as a casual outfit or do you want
something more sporty are you okay with
slightly lower build quality for much
lower price both are great but your
answers to those questions should also
answer which is the better choice for
you for anyone who already has pebble if
you're considering the upgrade we
strongly suggest it if you're looking
for a better experience the steel
chassis gives a watch an entirely
different field the vibrate is more
Stern in a good way and the finesse of
the buttons is something you will enjoy
as for the price it's certainly
justified aftermarket PVD watch straps
run for about fifty dollars bringing the
overall price of the original
around $200 throw in other chassis
improvements and the fine tuning here
and there and we fill $250 is easily
justifiable folks that's going to do it
