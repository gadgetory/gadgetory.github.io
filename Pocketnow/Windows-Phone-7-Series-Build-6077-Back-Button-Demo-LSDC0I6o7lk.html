pocket now calm the back button in
Windows Phone 7 series will do different
things in different scenarios and a lot
of people have been confused by this
because a little unconventional but let
me explain how it works and I'll
demonstrated here if you are in the
first screen of an application pressing
the back button will go to the previous
application pressing the back button
again we'll go to the application before
that if you are in the second or third
screen of an application the back button
will step you back within the same
application let me give you an example
so we'll go into the calendar
application and here i am the calendar
application and if i press the back
button now watch what happens i am taken
to the recent application i was in which
was people i was messing around with the
emulator a few minutes ago if i press
the back button again i am put back to
the start screen that's where I ended up
by press it again nothing happens
because I started on the start screen
but if I go back into another
application let's go back into people
and this time I'm going to drill into
one of these items so now i am within
the application and if i press the back
button i will be taken to the previous
screen within this application rather
than the previous application but now
since we're in the first screen by press
the back button again remember we're in
the first screen we are going to go back
to the previous screen or the previous
application that we were in so hopefully
you understand what that does remember
if you're in the first screen it goes to
the previous application if you're in
the second or third screen it just jumps
back a previous screen it actually makes
a lot of sense and helps you to move
around the device pretty fast just a
quick explanation that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
