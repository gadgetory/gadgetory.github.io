of the specifications we should expect
no I've had rumors claim a better
display technology for reading and
savage and mod doesn't seem too happy
with how one plus advertises its phone
I'm hi Mary that I and what was your
favorite Robin Williams movie mine was
good will hunting you will be miss Robin
wrist in peace this is walking out daily
if you thought the way to get an invite
for the 1+1 is controversial trust me
they were just getting started the
company has just published a new
advertisement focused on women and if
you read the app makes the description
it does seem a little sexist meaning
this is only applies to women and it
requires women to take a photo of
themselves in whichever way not
including nudity in order to get an
invite which is uh yeah I have to agree
cyanogenmod is complaining on Twitter
about this advertisement saying that
they shouldn't do this and they're quite
right what do you think about these ads
leave us a comment down below now the
last company you would ever assume would
be doing any spending cuts as Samsung
but the company has just announced that
it is we do know that their quarter
results were not so fun because they're
not selling as many smartphones as they
project it and the company has decided
to cut down on its operating expenses
and it's great to hear that no people
are going to lose their jobs they're
going to try to cut down on traveling
and stuff but yeah it does seem that
Samsung is not happy with its results
and it's looking for something better
and hopefully the galaxy note for the
Galaxy alpha could do something about it
I've got some interesting leaks of the
Nokia Lumia 830 if you remember we
passed some earlier rumors where we saw
some photos of the 830 but it had a hump
that made it look like a Lumia 1020 and
as it turns out we've got some
specifications from this phone and it
does not seem like any slouch in certain
things it's got a flagship camera 20.7
megapixel PureView camera interesting
but then we've got some mid tier
specifications like a 4.5 inch 720p
display we don't really don't know what
no kiss planning with this phone but
yeah it's great to see that they are
raising the bar and cameras for mid to
your phones now another hot product that
will be launching later this year is
post next generation iPads and we've got
some interesting reports claiming that
Apple is going to finally invest on
anti-glare coating for the display of
the iPad amazon has made so much fun of
iPads because you can't really read
using them over direct sunlight because
of the reflection and yeah it seems that
Apple is going to invest in this though
we don't know if this will be over a
corning gorilla glass display or over a
sapphire display this is still yet to be
confirmed but stay tuned the iPads could
be getting better as Apple needs them to
be and finally for the very interesting
but at the same time underwhelming news
of the day GFX bench has just brought us
new information on the motorola shamu
which if you did not know is the code
name for the future google nexus 6 5.9
inch display and according to the
benchmarks we have a 1080p display and
we have a Snapdragon 801 processor which
yeah makes sense because the 1080p
display and stuff but really we thought
we'd see great 2k display technology
with a Snapdragon 805 and so many other
things and it seems that this will
actually be an underwhelming phone when
compared to some of the flagships that
are already out there which leads me to
the question of the day what do you
think about these specifications are you
looking forward to this motorola shambhu
google nexus 6 in my case i am because
it's a Nexus device hopefully it will be
just as greatest Moto X but yeah it
seems that it's not going to be on par
with the latest trends so leave us a
comment down below what do you think
