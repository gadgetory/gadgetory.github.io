processor rumors to rest Samsung already
begins showcasing what to expect for
marshmallow even with so many delays and
Microsoft keeps putting more nails into
its own mobile coffin I'm hi Mary Venna
and the by now you're still using a
Windows Phone that must be a lot of love
this is pocket a daily the official news
today begin with Sony as the company
continues to prove that it does
understand its customers when it comes
to software updates Sony is already
famous for bringing software updates to
legacy experienced lectures from years
ago even the Xperia ZL and even though
those were put to rest if you're
interested in marshmallow and devices
like the Xperia z3 or Z two links in the
description there is a beta program that
will give you the option even though
you'll probably never leave the beta but
you'll get marshmallow and speaking of
software updates let's flip the switch
and talk about the company that just
does not get it which is Samsung we're
still waiting for marshmallow just about
on every device that was promised to get
the update months ago and the company
has a well this leak presentation out
there that shows everybody what to
expect for marshmallow whenever it comes
but the problem is there's also a list
that pretty much tells you you're still
gonna have to wait and this is just
terrible Samsung but then again them you
know with the biggest problem is that
people still buy the galaxy even with
that and speaking of very necessary
updates let's talk about the one m10
from hcc we hear two things today number
one that we might be getting the device
somewhere around April in the UK or the
rest of Europe and for those of you
waiting for it in the United States may
will be sort of the case though we're
not exactly sure if that's going to be
set in stone given whatever the
competition does now the cooler part
about these news is that there is
apparently a one watch in the process
that could be announced somewhere around
there as well that device could make it
to the market before the one m10 and
apparently it won't be running Android
wear let's see what we get I'm moving
over to sad news for those of you that
were disappointed with Microsoft with a
2,300 employees that were let go last
year from the mobile division we hear
that there are more job cuts to
happen very soon for windows 10 mobile
and that is extremely sad the company
did not get its act together with the
whole launch of the Lumia 950 950 XL
terrible phones sadly and our reviews
and it seems that the company will
resort to that in order to fix its
issues we wish Microsoft would someday
somehow figure this out or just you know
leave mobile or just sell it back to
know Keanu and finally the very hot news
did they continue to be the LG g5 it
seems that the benchmarks now confirm
Snapdragon 820 no surprises there poor
gigs of ram android 6th auto dot one on
launch and apparently this version of
the processor brings some amazing single
core performance though we have to
compare that to the apple 89 for the
iphone which is the single core king and
we know that but anyways regardless of
whatever specifications we get and
everything for today's question of the
day we are very curious if you want any
of LG's features to be ported from the
g4 to the g5 which would they be in my
case I wish they kept the IR blaster but
I probably feel that I'm gonna be alone
in that one leave us a comment down
below we love to know your case friends

to get the news earlier before this
video was filmed make sure you follow us
