is growing in antennas while rumors
points1 HTC one I made running Windows
Phone 8.1 Motorola is now rumored to
push the Nexus into phablet territory
I'm hi Mary that I and the fact that my
older son Diego turns 14 today just
reminds me of how old I am happy
birthday son this is parking out daily
let's begin today with some sort of
official news as Samsung has just come
clear about the future of smartphones
running Tizen we saw the Samsung Z
earlier and we've been wondering when
the company is going to launch it but
according to sammy they are not ready
and they are not ready because they
don't have enough applications for it
even with their whole ecosystem of
proprietary applications and everything
Sammy feels that they're not ready yes
even if they can run android
applications on it so if you were
betting on Tizen bad news now one thing
that is confusing is the Samsung Galaxy
alpha that we talked about last week we
loved the fact that it was the first
Samsung device with the metallic trim
though it does have plastic on the back
but the reports have it that this device
is not a flagship phone apparently
that's going to be the galaxy yet this
device will only have a 720p display and
it will lack a lot of features
apparently it will only be
market-specific at the same time so yeah
if you wanted a smaller galaxies and
metal that's not gonna happen now one
device that we've been anticipating for
the longest time is the HTC One m8
running Windows Phone 8.1 we've been
talking about it for the longest time
being dubbed the w 8 and we've got some
interesting rumors talking about the
fact that I see is working on this phone
that it will happen and that it will
happen later this year but the way the
rumors are pointed it seems that it
won't necessarily be the one m8
apparently there will be some changes to
this device just like we saw with the 1x
and then with the other 8x lineup that
HTC launched eventually for Windows
Phone so let's see what we get how about
a dual booting one I made that would be
just perfect same Hardware dudes now how
about Apple's iPhone 6 that we get some
leaked photos of the devices logic board
being compared to the iphone 5s and the
reason why it's not so bigger than
comparison is because this is actually
for the four points
iphone 6 and we have to know antennas
here number one the NFC antenna that's
been talked about with glowing logo and
everything but another one is Wi-Fi 802
11 AC which is great it's great to have
the extra speeds obviously if you do
have a router that supports it but we're
still wondering exactly what Apple plans
to do with NFC stay tuned for that one
and finally for the sizzling hot news of
the day we've got some rumors of a 5.9
inch next 26 being built by motorola
apparently it will not be built by LG
this time executives from LG don't even
believe that and rumors have it that
motorola will be in charge of the stone
and this means a lot of good things
number one Motorola's got that whole
chipset that they built for the Moto X
and we are hoping that this does make it
to the Nexus 6 so now you can just say
ok Google now and it'll turn on your
phone wherever it is hopefully they
figure out a way to train your voice let
it doesn't pick up any other commands
from somebody else but yeah imagine that
computing platform aside from the fact
that it's going to be a 5.9 inch display
hopefully a waterproof phone with
motorola's nano coating this could be
good even greater if Motorola figures
out a way to give us some Moto X love
here but that leads you to the question
of the day what would you think about a
motorola Nexus smartphone because in my
particular case I've been thinking about
this for the longest time I mean what
took them so long why didn't they do
this when they own Motorola leave us a
comment down below what do you think yes
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video with
stokey followers I'm talking out comment
