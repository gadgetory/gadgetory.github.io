back okay we're gonna do we can't do a
hangout we've got a 1 megabit upload in
our charming Airbnb
all right trade show shenanigans were on
the ground in Berlin I mean from New
York last week to German he this week
I've been in five different time zones
over eight days and I think it shows in
our face yeah definitely because we've
already been working here for for four
days now five days yeah so that's trade
show life for you you gotta hit the
ground running you gotta hit it hard but
thank you for joining us for episode two
six eight of the pocket now weekly I've
probably gotten that wrong but I'm sure
Jules will just that in and fix it for
me with Jose but the cute read ever
we've we've already spent a day on the
show floor we've taken meetings with a
number of companies off the show floor
some really great hands-on experiences
with gadgets coming out the latter half
of 2017 and we're gonna share our
thoughts with the share thoughts on some
of the things that we've seen some of
the things we've enjoyed I I think I
want to kick it off with the first thing
that we actually did here together which
was Samsung yeah so their press
conference I mean even I kind of made a
little fun of them that they made such a
big deal out of curator you man you mean
the artificial intelligence for watching
machine yeah so okay appliances are a
huge deal for Aoife and that's not
something that we really cover know and
here's here's the thing I mean Aoife is
probably the largest trade show by size
and it's also what are the most
completed my most complete I mean not
only can the public come in to eat out
but people can actually buy their
artificial intelligence Wow yeah and
Aoife and so the show is mostly based on
everything and therefore mobile is just
part of it right sort of the complexity
of CES but just a lot more complex and
so the you know I found that interesting
I mean never have I been to a press
event well no I did once at CES where
you know the the Android powered toaster
and the and there was the Bluetooth
connected trashcan I remember that one
Twitter powered refrigerator from Sam's
all these things were announced at a CES
ones we made fun of it because obviously
we're used to these companies using the
trade show more for mobile and computers
which is the hottest products they sell
and no this this event was about the a
washing machine right but also the new
Samsung gear lineup absolutely and the
way the company is pushing their their
focus into wearables and this was
interesting I mean a lot of people I was
expecting an update to the gear s 3
mm-hmm to a certain degree I am NOT
disappointed that there was it an
upgrade
I'm really happy there wasn't a direct
upgrade because I mean timepieces should
not be lit that year exactly I think
that you know watch smartwatches
particularly I know I did know I'm keep
talking Adia what it what I did with my
water oh my god oh that's you here you
know this is it no we're good we're good
so so I'm so happy that the gears 3 did
not receive an update I'm glad that we
actually received the gear s 3.5 yeah
because so here's the thing about the
gear support you saw my hands on the
gear support is definitely a sports
SmartWatch but it reminds me a lot of
the Apple watch really it does because
because of the focus on okay so the
Apple watch if you go for the sport
variant which is no longer called the
supply the aluminum variant it is that
it is literally a sport watch that can
become fancy so long as you swap a band
on it okay so this is this was my big
concern when we went with the hands-on
and they had some cool NATO straps which
is kind of a nice way to casual wear
your watch it wasn't until we we did a
mixer with Samsung after the event and
you like I thought the the PR rep was
where David yes yeah you're a gear and
gears been wearing the sport
and it was rested up a lot better than I
thought it was a dress up really well I
mean it's the same 316l stainless steel
which I said a little bit um in the
video where I'm sorry we were tired
you're retired but if you still are it
was the 316l stainless steel and it's
got this like it's got this like um it's
like the silvery it's like a titanium
yeah black it's so weird but it's so
cool and it is again it's a standard
gear s3 the only thing that it's missing
pretty much are the fact that this has
that mode where you're able to pay on
regular you know oh oh yeah oh yeah the
magnetic the magnetic thing that Samsung
has either Samsung I apologize it's only
got an F C right but then absolutely
everything else it's a garis three it
does not have LTE capabilities right and
I think that that's okay like I think
that it will at some point but Samsung
was very specific we wanted to make a
smaller watch and the reason why I mean
the gear is three is a complete watch
for fitness and yet I don't use it
because it's huge right I was gonna say
I mean like when we're looking at like
the watch and like that what it takes to
build LTE into the guest it's the sport
wears more like a regular time so I
actually liked 42 millimeters you can
make it a fitness watch when you want to
you can't what you don't
I love Samsung health like the changes
they've made since the galaxy s 8 and
all that push that they made a rare
event it's actually paid off like I like
how complete it is and then we saw the
gear for to support which was I like the
gear for 2 in its design I like its
functionality I didn't like its accuracy
gotcha and so I feel that the like they
showed me the design changes to the to
the heart rate sensor how now it's a
little more close to the body they even
made an explanation to me that makes so
much sense like for example I like to
use these stainless steel bands they're
like the heavier the watch the less
accurate the heart rate sensor is
because the watch is hidden dangled over
your body a lot
good point whereas if the this is the
reason why the gear fit weather gear
sport is lighter and smaller and the
reason why they made a couple of changes
to the module on the gear 4 to support
in order to improve accuracy and you
know we were talking I was explaining to
them how like in the case of the Apple
watch is not that I want to endorse a
flirt that I care about the Apple watch
it is just the most complete SmartWatch
when it comes to accuracy okay I mean it
takes it a quarter of a mile for the GPS
to catch up and then it is it's locked
on the dot they actually do that really
accurate to a smartphone when you're
running it is on the John upon GPS on
Android wear yeah it is on the dot as
accurate as a Garmin would be and I have
to use garment because Garmin is there a
standard furred back there the standard
they are the tool that pilots used to
happen right that's how good Garmin
watches are so yeah I was very very
impressed I can't wait to hear the
iconic headphones yeah I do want to do
one of those mainly because you know
with Chapra I knew you were gonna go
directly right into job Ron there
because we have to have to spend a
little time at a jobber booth and their
updates to to they're truly wireless
earbuds
we're also compelling so I'm happy to
see both Samsung and Jabra yes I mean
again I think a lot of these things like
the gear fit tube Pro doesn't blow me
away but what I really appreciate is
that they took something that largely
worked and they found a few of those
those trigger points those pressure
points I hated the clasp on the fit and
they went to a regular watch buckle on
them on the pits you plant it in - I
mean again when they're not you mind it
it's like those were those little like
we got really fancy and we've got this
sort of like bubble lock on clasp that I
could really easily like pop it if I put
my hand in my pocket you know it got
caught on the edge of my jeans or
something so seeing them address those
kinds of usability or lifestyle issues I
think we're getting to that point where
even smartwatches have reached a certain
level of refinement and that now we need
to really address some more of those
lifestyle issues the fashion issue
making them blend in more seamlessly
with the rest of your day and not having
them stand out as like these geeky
science experiments that you wear on
your body and I think Samsung is doing a
good job of addressing those and I I was
even forget who I was talking to and I
was explaining that okay so if I have to
choose from from how complete is a
SmartWatch I like there are things about
the gears 3 that I like I love the watch
faces I love that I mean I'm able to add
how much water I've had drink yeah I
love the sleep tracking Oh I mean like
the new calorie tracking tools the new
carry you know you can actually add your
intake and then it'll automatically
calculate based on how much you've
trained during life and because a watch
should be about simple at-a-glance
information I loved that they had like a
three-tier like basically the radar
screen like red yellow green yeah and
it's like oh I'm in the yellow I should
probably not eat these cheese puffs
right right and and like for example now
you're able to sing Spotify off law yeah
like why would this matter well if you
actually want to go run without your
phone mm-hmm
you can actually sing Spotify I it still
doesn't do Spotify running which is one
thing that I would really like for it to
have right because that's what I use to
run but you actually have the option
which is just great now my biggest
problem and I I told them like okay
there is one news first SmartWatch which
is you know you call it funny but you
know I go to you know I set my washing
machine and I'm like set a timer for 23
minutes right set a timer for this I do
that with the SmartWatch I designed it I
set a reminder for this or that I don't
usually use it to call people but one
thing that I use a lot in New York is
give me walking directions to Penn
Station give me walking directions to
this and right I do it constantly with
Siri Siri is good in the fact that it
reacts the promise and I even told them
the Apple watch deployment of apps is
terrible like yeah they are the slowest
and clunkiest things you could ever use
well I'm navigating to the app is also
exactly and so it's like you tell you
have to tell it like
three times give me walking directions
to a spot by the time it actually
launches the app and does what you do
will you ask it to do
Android wear after version two has
gotten a million times better at than
yeah they have done an amazing job and I
like the fact that you can actually
install a third-party version of Google
Maps into yeah the watch is so that it's
launched immediately dance-oriented
version of Google Maps on the watch and
this is what Samsung isn't missing Sam
Ryan does not have maps they don't have
maps they win and we're not asking them
to have maps it's just give me Google
Maps um functionality of that and please
I mean for all the fanfare of Bixby
right when is Bixby going to reach the
gear s3 because it's going to reach the
gear support to a certain degree then
they were like yeah we're gonna update
it update the rest of the watch think
we're a little cagey but I was like okay
just make up your minds yeah you're
gonna do cuz s voice it's terrible even
made a point over how X Boys has grown
and functionality and voice accuracy I'm
like that's not really video like
Samsung still reinventing the wheel
there yeah because I loved like so
getting back to icon X the new gesture
being the long press so that you can
call up your voice assistant and of
course it's Samsung so they're showing
off Bixby but they did make a point of
saying like you can use it with Google
Voice to he's like I know that's the
checkbox I'm gonna click almost
immediately yeah getting that back over
there I feel like Samsung has this
amazing core of developers that work
just on their applications for their
products but so much of it still feels
like it runs in parallel with what's
already being developed by the company
that makes the operating system that
defined I think I think that Samsung has
a point they have the scale they have a
much larger scale that even Google does
and yeah that's either
I wouldn't even I wouldn't even set all
my eggs in one basket I mean we don't
know I mean like I've still said I mean
like voice assistants are wide open
someone could come in tomorrow with
an AI Butler that'll jam blow us away
and everyone will want to switch to that
and use it but I don't know that I see
Samsung really plowing that tray that
trail I really feel like all of these
other services are kind of just reaching
parity so I mean it's like Siri can do
this really well and she can call you an
uber but she can't do this and Cortana
could have done this but then can't do
this other thing and Google now Google
assistant really good at like operating
things on your phone but maybe not so
good at working with other apps yeah and
so it's like all of them are kind of at
the same level of I can use it for some
things but not others and no one's
really started tying all of those loose
ends together so that we've got more
consistent functionality through voice
actions and voice services and that's
where I feel like again Samsung they're
giving me a couple really great features
macros Bixby when Bixby finally gets
updated to you know I can I time mode
and it can go and do all that I love oh
my god that's cool cool that's really
cool because it's so cool
it's so much easier for a general
consumer than the other ways that we use
to program macros on everything and
here's the thing like I am the kind of
person that actually depends on those
things that's really I used to be all
about the innocent acts yes I leave the
house and I tap my phone right by the
door and it turns everything now IOT is
going to the point where you can
actually do that
you know I my son laughs every you know
he gave that you know he's in New York
with me he came to the apartment and
he's like and I'm like good morning and
all the lights yeah he's like he's like
he's like I could live like this he's
like hello computer he really likes that
and you know automation is one thing I
you know I understand Samsung and the
whole concept of pushing bixby I don't
think there's a need for another voice
of system but I can't really say that
the current ones are great yeah so so
there needs to be pressure in some
competitions so that these things get
better it's it's just like each one has
its one novelty yeah and I don't see any
company really coming is like oh well
you know what our voice assistant is
super deficient at
walking directions in a city yeah and
instead of like really trying to address
some of those core usability features
it's like well yeah you can't do that
but look at this other amazing thing I
was like that's not that's still not
helping me really motivate a purchase on
something like that and that's why we
still have so much room for these
services to improve and again like a
hound could come in tomorrow sound hound
yeah and like blow us all the way I've
been mentioning IBM Watson give me an
IBM Watson phone and I could be a really
happy dude but this is also why I feel
like Samsung's approach because they're
so diverse and they're so broad and
they've got our product segments
throughout and they're working the stuff
at multiple different angles from
multiple different Vantage's we're
making fun of it but cue Raider is an
interesting idea in that what is it can
it what what is it that it can really
accomplish in streamlining the
efficiency of washing my clothes right
so I've got artificial intelligence
built into a washing machine oh my god
can I can I just say this because they
were making the presentation and this is
one of those things where I used to be a
presenter like right it was my job in a
company that I worked for to sell
projects like I would be sent to a spot
I would assess the problem and then I
would figure out a way to fix it and I
would have to create a presentation
where during the first three slides I
had to be able to sell to the CEO the
reasons why we had to either buy this
company or take it apart right and so I
remember you were Richard Gere from
pretty woman like I want to take your
company and carve it into pieces the
funny part is when they're the
presentation of the washing machine and
they're like think about how many hours
of your life you're going to say by
being able to because the washing
machine will not take fifty percent less
time and I love the fact that it takes
fifty percent less time from a simple
you didn't have to come and tell me that
I was gonna save so many hours of my
life and they actually did the math and
I'm like wait a second so you're telling
me that you actively sit in front of
your washing machine waiting for it to
die
I'm like really you didn't have to say
that yeah simple fact that the washing
machine is so quick I mean except I
don't know about you Jaime but whenever
I'm doing my laundry I am unable to
participate with anything else in the
world surrounding me until that chore is
completed because I like to make sure
it's done right that it's done properly
and so I do need to monitor no not it's
not a way to really maintain it was it
was almost like you only see those bad
infomercials and like this ever happened
to you
no how do I use my hands and bowls of
chips are so hard
Michael did the review of the galaxy s4
active you're watching this dude you're
awesome it was that was a great review
yeah so I want to pivot here because we
do get to spend a little time talking to
Jabra I know those dudes are right up
your alley
they had some really cool so I came in
as you were talking to the Jabra rep
right it that oh yeah and it's like 80
bucks
oh say here like yeah it's like what it
was like a it's like a dog showing a
magic trick I always gonna ask the same
question whenever I post running
pictures remember whenever I was running
right not currently doing so but like
what headphones are you using and I'm
like they're always Jabra ISM okay so I
used to be a Jabra customer ever since
before I started using their products
for a couple of reasons first of all
this is a company that actually their
origins are the hearing aids yeah so
their technology for audio and quality
from simple like simple phone calls is
insane yeah and so so here's the thing I
have been a Jabra customer the second
reason was because these were the only
headphones that would survive more than
a year without dying over how much I
sweat yeah their IP rating pretty gross
their IP ratings are great and not only
that they have this three-year wanti
thing where for the same price of this
pair of headphones they will literally
warrant your product three years and
like it's a no questions asked
that's a no questions asked well swap
your product and that's awesome
so here's the thing they you know I was
I was throwing on Lotus it was before
getting back to New York and they were
like we finally got a sample for the
elites the in here the full-blown no
wire and I'm like yeah so I tried the
LG's I tried the Cindy first icon for
second acts yeah you know the the
battery wasn't great this new these new
ones now have full marathon batteries
yeah you're in a bright window for very
long you know in the case of these new
iconic sand that's great but like I told
Samsung send me a sample and I'll let
you know right the audio ok my god those
new elite support from Jabra dude those
things sound like a standard pair of
over the ear headphones yeah and they've
got this like four microphone system for
phone calls now the other day I was
running because I actually tried to run
again and my sister calls me and dude
like it feels like it feels that like a
hollow phone call from your old Motorola
from your old Nokia's right it sounds so
great and I'm like okay I now understand
why these things cost $200 yeah the the
sister company resound is all about that
like hearing aid like some of the most
advanced hearing aid technology the
world has ever seen and so they whatever
you ask them about that they they try to
downplay that there's any connection and
I think it's really interesting because
if there's still like a stigma like we
don't want to be known as we're the hip
Fitness company we don't want to be
known as the hearing aid sister company
yeah and and it's a little unfortunate
like we had a recent podcast with a
representative from AARP
I'm talking about two sort of issues you
know as people get older and things like
that and I know we have several members
in our audience and I'm hoping to
address this soon especially once we're
out of you know iPhone launch territory
but you know accessibility options and
like those Jabra czar built around very
similar ideas to improving listening
conditions protecting your house you
know making sure that your situationally
aware
while you have things blocking your ear
canal mean these are really
sophisticated solutions and again it's
it's just interesting that we still
can't admit you know hearing aid
technology is now getting to a point
where it will augment normal people
without hearing deficiency it will
augment your senses you know this is
like you know at some point eventually
you like you know maybe I do want robot
legs instead of regular human legs but
starting with hearing and vision like
the these are the things that we can
address right now and there were a
couple other companies on the show floor
that we're showing off like advanced
hearing solutions and things like that
happen Jabra is the only company that I
think has made as as smart a play in
bringing those technologies to general
contain if it's not Jabra or plant Ronix
I'd like companies that have been in the
industry for ages like yeah you know
it's so here's the thing but they were
showing off at this event was not that
it was so the elites have been out this
this is like the new update to the
elites but they launched this new elite
lineup which is these headphones that
they look kind of funny like their
design it's it's they look like the
typical LG over the over the neck yeah
design yeah that that bar but kinda runs
behind your neck so here's the thing
they have the same driver and audio
technology of the other elites so listen
to this that same audio they have the
same microphones they have an insane 18
hour battery the neck band is basically
all battery and it's a flaccid
technology type battery oh yes you can
like clamp it to your neck it's not like
it's flopping around
guess how much those things cost how
much would you expect to pay for such a
product $1.99 $2.99 80 buns I was like
wait you know it tripped me out and it's
such a small thing uh-huh
what you're like when someone delivers a
really well-executed simple design
consideration and all of a sudden like I
was angry I'd never thought of it yeah
and I'm sure other companies have done
it I just didn't know that someone had
made a product like this but the the
earbuds are magnetic so like they won't
be just like dangling and flopping
around they don't retract like LG's you
want to snap them closed when you get a
phone call
and earbuds detect that the magnet has
detached that's all it takes to answer
to the cone call because it's like I'm
using my LG tone studios and when I pull
that your bud I want it to automatically
switch from the speakers to the earbud
yeah there's no reason for me to have
pulled the earbud unless I want to
listen on the earbud like that would be
but I have to find this fiddly little
switch and again this is totally
infomercial first world problems oh I
had to hit a button but that's the kind
of design that I love seeing that's it
it's such a small but - but it's really
inconsiderate for how consumers are
gonna use this you're not gonna unsnap
your earbuds unless you want to listen
to something you're not gonna unsnap
your earbuds unless you want to answer
the phone it's an action you're already
you're you're doing an action and tie it
to us a feature and I might want to hang
up the call just snapping back together
that's so good it's so brilliant it's so
I walked in on the price and then he and
then one of the other reps she showed me
you actually gave me a little bit more
it was like I had like I had to just
stop her like that's all that's that's
that's that's amazing you had me imagine
step yeah you had me into know someone
who didn't have me on this show floor
for a product that I think I'm gonna
like when I really get to play with it
can we talk about Motorola for just a
little bit so we have a video the moto
moto x4 I'm a big fan Moto X - back in
the day I'm really happy to see the X
line return I think this this is a
product that's on point for what they're
trying to deliver I'm really frustrated
with the number of people who are
complaining that Moto's pivoting to the
mid-range the Moto X has always been
about they've met refinements never been
a flexure it's never been like let's try
and impress you with all of the bullet
points on paper no but we can deliver a
really nice experience through
optimization and give you a slightly
lower price point - yes handle that
that's it the X should represent I'm sad
that moto moto moto maker has died yeah
I'm sorry about that I I'm not saying
that there's anything wrong with the
design of the
now it's a pretty fun it is a pretty
phone it's different it's pretty am I
disappointed with the choices of chipset
no I'm not all mean so here's the thing
I love the 625 so I'm really curious to
see what the 630 can do exactly and
here's the thing you have to remember
the Moto X the original Moto X try to
address something they were like we're
not here for the spec race right we're
not here to compete against these guys
we want to show you that a phone can be
really good not be priced crazy we can
actually come up with something really
cool like moto maker yeah and you're
actually gonna be delighted by the
experience we were delighted by
everything except the camera yeah and
that's why even into the Moto X tune
again it and absolutely every single
iteration of the Moto X I loved writing
about the phone but the camera we liked
everything but the camera and it was
just this cool feel of the Moto X yeah I
mean it didn't matter like for example
the the Moto X - I received two units I
receive that bamboo variant I never got
to play the bamboo I still have my Moto
X - with the blue leather back the white
front face the red accents my Captain
America phone I still love that phone I
love the feel of it in my hand I want
that exact same shell with just more
modern like I want that shell with a 630
and four gigabytes of RAM and yeah 32 or
64 gigabytes of storage but the reason
why I'm kind of picking on Motorola and
this is a mistake that they made last
year and this is something this is like
a little more inside baseball for you
folks listening because I think the
phone is gonna be cool I think the
phone's gonna be a nice option for
people who want to shop at that tier why
can't
Motorola figure out that when they
invite press to an event to look at a
gadget that you maybe don't want super
dark nightclub lighting with hard
shadows and neon lights everywhere how
can I explain to you so if you watch our
video it's like it's every color time in
every shot that that is super dark color
of the phone ISO is cranked and we had
to crank every Oh mad like Congrats on
the video - the video came out great but
we had
sistahs like there are a few shots like
my panasonic is struggling to not make
this a great blurry mess I was glad you
had your sony on dude it's it's I was
like and you know what's the most
hilarious part the lights were actually
the tone of the lights was controllable
so by choice the lighted mirror yes to
give us a urine yellow color hue and
every arrow yellows actually it was it
was gross was horrible I was so upset I
was just let's just get this over with
because I don't want to do what the yoga
book I was like that is such a beautiful
piece of machinery and they would light
up the table for like 10 minutes so you
had a bright softbox that it was on and
then dark everything else you could
never expose like every shot light half
of the shot was overexposed and the
other half of the shot was underexposed
you know and this year apparently they
just decided like bowl everything's
underexposed and everything's dark and
it like reminds me of Samsung of their
Galaxy Note 8 it's like we were at the
Lincoln Center for the Galaxy s8 event
we were doing the hands-on obviously who
were unable to attend the pre-brief and
so we were there at the Lincoln Center
and I was just my jaw was at the floor
with the lighting it was delicious it
was a great sound room we were able to
show off the phone looks beauty and then
we go to the no date event I mean don't
get me wrong the armory was beautiful
the Armory's finished and I'm the
building but there was no consideration
for that kind of the semi things like
the lighting was terrible the floor they
had to throw something on top of the
floor this like I don't know it was like
a wooden frame on top of the floor and
carpet for you not to damage the the the
antique floor and it's great every year
everybody was near you and how could I
tell people like would you stop walking
excuse me I'm trying it is important
we're all trying to get some work done
but lately like every shot in my no date
coverage is like wobble wobble wobble
wobble as people are walking around and
then we get to the gear presentation
here in this beautiful Berlin loft this
Febres diagonally by 23 okay amazing
wood rustic metal they had like an old
motorcycle in one
like every good writer who couldn't
unless you pointed your camera directly
out the window at the Sun you you could
not arrive at a bad shot they had a
working piano I was so great delicious
it was I'm like and when we talked to
them there's like I'm really really
really glad you liked our venue and like
we'll let the lighting designer know
like the Samsung event they had the
consideration of like we're gonna
approach this as if these people are all
shooting films yes and it and it shows
like it was so easy to get great shots
of all those products and then we get to
the Motorola and I'm looking forward to
a Moto X and like I can't even see it
with my eyes in the venue how am I
supposed to put this on camera so again
like I'm picking on Motorola here
because like I said I think the phone's
gonna be cool why I just like I wanted
like I'm gonna maybe drop by the Lenovo
booth and speak with some of the Lenovo
people in just okay I had a lot of fun
at the event they had the Star Wars AR
game it was cool the Jedi a Jedi force
game um my lightsaber was a little buggy
but I was still able to defeat cuz what
do you think about this one I mean that
the the experiencer yeah okay so this is
a great first step to show consumers
what AR can do yeah and I really feel
like the way that they so the way that
they had it they had these like
triangular sections where you could
fight kylo Ren yeah and I almost wish
that they hadn't done that
because it put kylo Ren just on a plain
black background so you didn't see how
he was walking back and forth now in the
approach and once you get this in your
living room I think it's gonna be so
much cooler because I mean it's not like
he's gonna be jumping around and really
interacting with the environment we
don't really have the computational
horsepower and a phone to pull that off
just yet but this is it was such a great
organic experience between headset
lightsaber and then the fighting
mechanic worked in the way that I think
Nintendo always wanted the Wii to be you
know like we haven't really realized
that well and this I thought worked
surprisingly well
I didn't like it you didn't like I ain't
I didn't like the implantation I don't
no idea and the implementation and I
okay so there are a few things I don't
like VR I you know I I would remember
use a gear I obviously did like the vibe
I like how complete the vibe is but I
don't like all the setup that you
require and I'm I just the great it's
just that every time that I had to pull
out those like things to be able to
detect where I was and calibrate them it
just it made the experience cumbersome
like in New York City finding an
apartment with space as a commodity oh
yeah
and you can't set that up at you back
here I did so because I'm backyards also
a commodity yeah so here's the thing
what I didn't like were a few things
number one the field of view of the
headset was very limited it is it's
gonna be a problem area and so here's
the thing I mean I do understand that
they probably made the holographic
whatever a thing that they did in this
and the screen small just to keep the
price tag down and the price tag is
insane at 300 dollars by the way I don't
know that it is though and there's
nothing else like this and again it's
got to be that first consumer yes I mean
you're put you're paying the penalty of
being first but that the pen the display
had to be larger it had it has to be
able to if it if it's not able to cover
your whole eyes yeah you're not doing if
you cannot follow the 120 degrees of
your field of view this is this is what
I like about their approach to this one
and this is why I'm really trying to say
this is the the best first step for
consumers for AR is they're not trying
to do like you've seen those hololens
demonstrations and like man things are
going on all around you but we know that
the hololens has a pretty narrow field
like you have a window I haven't used oh
okay what be me like your complaint
you've got a very narrow field of view
and there's nothing happening ary is in
the periphery but for this game you have
Kyllo in front of you and that's it
they're not trying to impress you by
throwing graphics that you'll not
interact with to the side so I think
they're doing a reasonable job of
addressing the limitations of the
current technology but that's my second
complaint that's nice okay so
okay so here's the thing whenever you're
playing whatever game you're playing you
don't want the fighting to be
predictable right whereas you literally
have to follow a set of instructions to
play where it's like place that's sorted
in this angle than this angle then that
angle it does not feel natural at all
like I understand the concept I again I
love that it's a first step I have to
agree with you but that is a game that I
will be playing for five minutes and
then I will be like okay any more
gestures left so no and it's just repeat
I have some sore feet I have to talk
that out too we probably only got to
fight Kyllo on level one easy beginner
mode and I'm hoping that there is some
expansion in what you do so basically as
you're fighting tile oh and this is
gonna be terrible for people who are
only listening to the podcast or not
watching but there are these yellow
lines that represent where your
lightsabers should always be to properly
block to the fenders of holo and then
there's just like a target on him when
you get attacked and then it's like
block block block by block block block
fight and it's like I can't hit him now
and they tried hitting them hitting it
is like though you have to wait for your
chance to hit them I'm like y'know this
is not a game that's not how lightsaber
dueling works I should be never so I get
that because it is I mean the game
mechanic and that's this is where I
agree with you the game mechanic is
basically a fancy cuts a quick time
event yes like you're playing another
game and like oh push me right now you
know that's not really a game that's
that's just a race of like you know a
measure of my ability to react reaction
time like a B I push me I win and it is
totally that but that's why I'm hoping
that again
first generation I think the technology
is sound like this this actually played
better than I thought it would
especially considering that it's powered
off of phone hardware and I've had some
you know like like we when we did the
Lenovo fab 2 pro yeah it was a slightly
underpowered chipset to have things
really interacting in space around you
and
had some like framerate issues and stuff
so this again is like that's the next
step this is an actual consumer product
that's going to be on store shelves and
I think it's gonna help educate people
as to why a r is different than VR and
from there I'm hoping them will see a
bit more developer interest to really
expand what AR can do so I think it's
the right step
I don't but but we defer we defer but
again I feel it's not even consumer
ready I thought I feel I feel that I was
playing with an alpha game well I'm yeah
probably not too far sorry sorry for
coughing folks I'm probably not too far
I mean it for me it was definitely beta
early beta test or very early beta
territory the game was all try and post
the video maybe like unlike my personal
YouTube channel
yeah like because you got this great
moment like my Schwartz was bent when I
started playing the game so I would I
would go to like defendant would go he
did not want to just correct one you had
to bring the sword down yeah for the
shorts to line properly big as my okay
so I'm gonna wrap this up talking about
what's probably the biggest announcement
at Eva for mobile and that's this this
beautiful device right here which I've
got in my hands I'm showing on camera
and I oh oh and you have one too
looks like we're pals and this is of
course the LGV
30 i apologize everybody i know that
it's it's horrible for me to sound and
talk about rumors of the LGV 30 on the
daily and already have the unit for
about a week so i mean again we can't
talk about it we sign an embargo we sign
an embargo i signed my life away on this
NDA like I really like LG takes this
part of the conversation seriously and I
really felt like the tech bloggers
community did a good job of honoring
that yet there wasn't anyone being
obnoxious with links or anything and we
didn't want to be those people so the
reason why that's important is I get a
little tired of leaked culture giving up
the goods before the company has a way
or a chance to present it the way they
want to because that's the metric by
which I'm going to judge if LG's gonna
make a
clean I want to know how old the claim
they're making so I know what standard
to hold them to yeah so already
immediately oh like one of the biggest
criticisms that's happening online
is this the claim of it having an F 1.6
aperture on the main camera and
xda-developers dug into the the metadata
on photos and you can actually pull up
the exif data on on a photo and once you
take it from the phone and this is
pre-release Hardware pre really software
I was about to say don't know what what
this is gonna look like once the
finished the finished product is out and
so I don't want to judge it by
pre-release hardware standards but the
phone does report NF 1.7 not only that I
mean so we've been playing with
prototypes yeah well and we have a
little few gremlins which we know
probably maybe and so I I'm hoping that
this whole thing that's happening with
XDA is not going to end ruining that
because okay so this is one thing that
we really like about working with LG and
the way they handle their review process
where they will send us an early
prototype and we will we can't give you
an opinion over a prototype that's not
final hardware if you notice we took a
long time to do our g6 review yeah
because it I told them you know no they
were very specific do you cannot we will
send you a final unit and then you can
take your time and do the review it I
received my final unit and I took a week
with it even if I had already spent
pretty much a month it was a different
experience even though the prototype was
in good shape I would even say that this
doesn't feel like a prototype it doesn't
not from a user for a user interface
I've had a couple of problems with video
my accelerometer has an issue on this so
that's the one thing like when I go to
shoot video in the site purposely and so
twist to the phone a couple times all of
my videos have been portrait and so here
the thing I for whatever is is that
happening listen this is not a final
unit don't judge it for being a final
unit do I feel the photography on this
phone is significantly better to the g6
actually no I don't and I can't say that
it is or not because this is a prototype
so I mean what we can say or so
some of the early impressions I like
what they've what I like what they've
improved over the g6 but I agree with
you I don't feel like this is going to
be fundamentally different but because
the phone has a little bit more
horsepower even on this pre-release
hardware their image processing is
already not significantly but noticeably
improved for things like low-light you
know I mean that was one of the things
that that that I had concerns with on
the g6 is that they had this sort of
over sharpening to the noise and really
low light photos yeah so if you like to
do nighttime street photography you get
these weird like crosshatch yeah like
blind noisy effects that looked really
ugly even at full looking at the full
photo like it wasn't like oh I propped
in a whole bunch and I can see all this
grain it was like it was pretty
noticeable even from the full exposure
and those kinds of things have been
improved we have a little bit more
resolution to work with I think the
image stabilization is better that that
I can already say like I like the feel
of video from this camera better than I
like the feel it's very aggressive
actually actually the civilization on
this camera is very aggressive it is
very busted we don't have the same ugly
wobble that we had on the b20 no yeah
that's been drained in it again and
again it continues to be a prototype I
guess what I've liked the most about I
guess I've come to already expect a
better camera from LG here's the thing
the other day I went to I went to the
9/11 memorial with my son and so I
totally forgot to bring the g6 for some
reason I don't know why and I always
keep my v20 in the back of the bag of
the DJI Osmo it's just it's there it's
like it's the accessory for my DJ
awesome yeah it bet is the main camera
for your need and so I I just you know I
went we walked I started vlogging you
know I'll publish it once and one day
next year probably but the thing is I
was in front of the memorial I wanted to
take this photo and it was already it
was already becoming dim
yeah and I was like crap I need a
wide-angle veto I'll shoot I have to be
20 and so I took the photo
and I remember not being satisfied with
the phone yeah why because the g6 did an
amazing job in making me be like okay
b20 sorry yeah it's done
the white it's definitely better on the
Jason so the white is definitely better
on the g6 and it's definitely better on
the V 30 you know I feel that they
handle distortion a lot better much
better
so yeah the camera has been improved I
you know I use LG products and I no
longer you know ever since the g4 the
camera on the g4 and every single LG
afterwards has been amazing yeah and so
I know to trust the camera but it's just
if we leave the camera load and just
focus on this hardware yeah okay so
here's the thing I remember I remember
being in the briefing I grabbed it the
first time and the the field that I have
from the g6 is this unsubstantial a lock
it is a block I mean it's the flat edges
on the side it's the flat edges on the
sides just this feel and this like it's
like rough glass like it like this like
feel to it where it's like it could even
make noise pretty much with how rough
the glasses so it is not slippery at all
but it feels lighter than absolutely any
phone that I've held with the exception
of the Galaxy s8
yeah the regular size Galaxy s8 this
phone is really light it's it's
borderlines
feeling cheap light it's close it's very
close to feeling to lay but the
combination of like what your hand is
reporting to your brain and then what
your eyes see when you look at it yeah
it does I think LG has finally figured
out they're they're sort of style or
they're dashing like this this this
makes sense to me yeah as a pretty
device you know like I love it when
youtubers are like oh yeah it's got a
nice feel in the hand you know no
protrusions or jagged edges you know
there aren't any razor blades to cut
your fingers on so you can actually hold
the phone so that's really cool and
really like so you know the g5 was I
think the last great example of a
flagship positioned phone that was rough
around the area
yeah very poorly implemented for like
having the battery chain and stuff so
it's really exciting to see from one
year to the next
how much more refined this design this
execution is yeah like how much more
confidence I have in LG manufacturing
when you pick this phone up and it its
competitive against them the prettiest
phones on the market today I don't just
think that it's competitive I think it's
one of the prettiest photos I think
that's what I mean is like you know we
talked about that upper top tier we're
talking like you're gonna spend a lot of
money on a phone you shouldn't have to
worry about does the seam on the bottom
chin for the battery match up you're
like can I see light through the battery
compartment you know you should not ever
have to deal with something like that
you should not have to deal with that on
something like a $200 phone yeah but if
you're spending over $700
you know we've passed that price point
you should never have a consideration
for the manufacturing machining and the
aesthetics of the phone to ever have a
fault like that then the v-series is you
have to remember the v-series has never
been a looker you know like the v10 was
not a pretty phone ooh
well baby 20 was charmingly ugly but I
like the look at the b20 the beats
running little not a pretty phone it was
not a pretty phone at all it reminded me
of the HTC type it out of the bag oh the
second you picked up to be 20 is like oh
well this is a big ol fat diesel truck
yeah it is unapologetic and it's it's
bold and so I like it but I can
understand if you're if you're talking
about general consumers walking into a
carrier store and they see like a
beautiful glass curved edges on on a
samsung and then v20 diesel truck I
understand why someone would gravitate I
almost feel like we're a cargo pants
just the feel that I blend with the
style of the b20 by the way thank you my
work boots work boots set by cargo fast
that's that's just good before I go jump
in my caterpillar okay so this phone
does not look like a diesel truck no
this boat gives the Galaxy s8 a run for
its money
any day yeah like really much like it
feels great it looks great and performs
great the old let implementation is very
good it's a little warm huh it is a
little warmer but I mean did you dig
through the display settings so here's
the thing the Galaxy s8 active is
another phone that's like that it's know
that display that's warm right it is it
is well and my s8 was really ready like
my my si plus has a red screen if you
leave it up to its within the neutral
mode yeah the just the color temperature
of the screen itself is significantly
off so this is a little bit warmer but
if you go in through the display
settings I was excited to see like this
is the first oullette that they've had
since the flex 2 flex and they already
had consideration for oh you might want
to cinema mode yeah or you you might
want like a graphics game mode or
something like that you might want to
downscale your quad HD 1080p right I
mean it's so available I'm excited to
see LG has has jumped on board those
kinds of considerations but I also like
that they didn't hamstring the phone out
of the box I do have an issue with
Samsung not disclose like making a
better disclosure of setting up your
phone do you want to save battery and
use a 1080p display instead they just do
it for you yeah so you're paying for
this quad HD screen but you're not
really generating the content at the
resolution of the display and here LG
out of the box it's quad HD plus
whatever that's twenty eight eighty by
1440 and if you want to down tune it you
can but guess what I don't know what for
you it's the most appointed that gonna
be 24 be for the beat 30 sorry how's
your battery life oh my oh my god okay
alright so this phone jumps into key1
territory it doesn't move in two key
ones okay it's just so much better than
any be okay sorry about that so here's
the thing on the my first day with the V
30 I did not leave the phone alone and I
reached a day and a half yeah I
literally fell asleep it's a legit like
full day plus of music I like I can I
can get through a three-day weekend
I know I've never been able to get that
fry I can I can run Mikey one sir so the
key for me just sticking to the v30 just
because this is what is really exciting
the v20 was a monster performer for
hardware and specs but not if you used
those features
you killed that battery yeah I mean
wasn't as bad as the v10 the v10 I could
like I could kill that before lunch oh
yes very NATO it was terrible terrible
so I had I didn't have high expectations
because we know LG runs a ton of custom
software yeah their skin is really
intrusive a lot of people are gonna be
turned off by that but with a 3300
milliamp hour battery and the Qualcomm
835 and I'm running the dark theme on my
OLED display the battery life is
significantly noticeably improved over
the g6 over okay so and like it's in a
completely different league from the
beat one I will give you an example
yesterday I disconnected my galaxy s 8
plus which I've been using here and my V
30 prototype mm-hmm okay prototype
versus final final product by let's
really get to that bar last night
yeah oh man I am NOT gonna be sharing
video from that evening I apologize I'm
gonna say was we were probably there
around oh I pulled out my battery pack
from the A+ both devices are roaming
both devices were t-mobile roaming
telecom the Galaxy s8 flow and there was
no signal in this pub we were all down
on edge which means your phones are all
cooking just to gear up with the no but
also in the venue that we were at the
phones were jumping up and down for
signal yeah so I pulled out my battery
when we left the venue to charge my s8
plus right because this phone is
obviously it's a prototype it was having
trouble even even more trouble retaining
16 oh yeah my ass 8 plus was at 6
percent battery at I it was 3:00 in the
morning no no we left the venue I think
it was
it was midnight oh you mean before we
went to the word yeah so we got to the
bar a midnight the 3500 Mela is so bear
in mind yesterday we started the day at
noon because we had worked all night
yeah so both phones were disconnected
from from from a charger at noon mm-hmm
five hours so at 12 hours my si+ was at
6% my v30 which I had actually used more
because the V 30 is using project Phi so
I get a lot more speed on the Eternity
all my vlog done on the camera then on
my t-mobile yeah and all my Instagram
everything is happening from the B 30
not the Tia the okay not the galaxy si
plus my B 30 was at 53% yes yeah it's a
lot better 6% 53% we're talking about
the same processor we're talking about
smaller battery smaller smaller screen a
smaller No six inches versus - yeah yeah
well and also I mean the galaxy is
running a slightly higher resolution
display - no that's no I'm using the SI
+ at 1080p HD okay see that really
bothers me Samsung if you're gonna turn
my screen down I want better battery
life here I left it there and I am my
ass ain't was is at 6% 53% I have used
this phone more a lot more than this
other one I'm very I'm very happy with
the experience we've had so far on V 30
I mean I can't even get into like the
charts and graphs on our headphone
testing yes I can't tell you like it's a
phenomenal performer I can't get into
like the really nitty-gritty stuff for a
camera review it's a solid performer and
to watch them having evolved again this
is this is like just reinforcing my
hypothesis that if a company is really
engaged with their consumers yeah and
they should demonstrate that they can
refine an update a product over around a
three year period like one plus like one
plus like the Microsoft Surface - yeah
one plus three suddenly is this amazing
thing to talk about v10
and that one plus five is just yeah oh
yeah I understand why some people have
some issues with them oh that's fine but
but you know v10 very odd mishmash of
certain design elements it's a
transitionary device it's the first time
that we had ever experimented with the V
with the V being so any phone from LG
being such a Productivity content
creation device
v20 nails a lot of the tech doesn't
really quite have the right shell I
think to get consumers interested in the
device and now three years I mean if we
look from the v10 to the V 30 that's
such incredible progress yeah to see
that level of refinement arrived and so
like I'm very anxiously awaiting when we
can start testing a production I mean a
finally consumer unit because I'm I
think our viewers are listeners I think
you're really gonna like what we have to
say about the the actual technical
performance yes I haven't found a real
deal breaker on this phone I have the
selfie camera is stare oh yeah I'm sorry
Haley okay that's totally fair LG still
has a lot of work to do on selfie
cameras but it was selfie cameras
terrible but and until I'm excusing this
you're absolutely right I may be being a
little too fair to LG here because if
you really if you're really into selfies
this is not gonna be the phone for you
so it's great because of the wide angle
and I love but the rear donors are so
easy you get an amazing shot from the
even when you're shooting blind the
selfie camera is just such a washed out
mess and the exposure is still terrible
it's if they could give us just like the
same manual modes and you could just
tell the camera hey stop exposing for
the background focus on me
right I'm right here yeah I'm literally
three feet from you and you're exposing
for that white building a mile away
could Jenai but you know I've done all
my vlogging from this camera because
they wear cameras are phenomenally easy
to blind like not looking at the screen
just point this phone in front of my
face talk for a couple minutes and like
the video looks amazing the photos look
great we were at that bar and they had
this like mirrored ceiling and Michael
Fisher was like hey everyone just come
here and look up and v30 wide-angle lens
this amazing reflective shot I don't
remember that
and what's funny is I remember you
making eye contact with the camera but
you're looking up what's on the ceiling
click but those kinds of things are like
it's so so you know I love like Huawei's
implementation of dual camera I dudes
but wide-angle so much more useful to me
than zoom in in so many of these social
situations I'm out and about with
amazing the photography of a Berlin
architecture and you're like I didn't
need a zoom for that I needed to see
like this church this old cathedral so
it's older than America by like a
thousand years you know and like I can
walk right up to it let me be like right
on the sidewalk
yes point my camera up in the whole
thing's right there and it's perfect you
know I don't even know what that so for
example and I I actually ask a designer
like one of these people that are in
charge there's the cool thing about
being part of briefings by the way yeah
for us it's not necessarily just the
opportunity to to have content early no
no it's the fact that the guy that
designed the phone is sitting right
there I'm actually like bugging the
engineer who implemented that exactly
and so one of the things that I've
always been curious about is who came up
with 27 millimeters for a smartphone
okay what's all these guys that we
actually wanted to be like just to give
you an idea I have a 35 millimeter F 1.8
lens thank you for recommending it it's
great it's an amazing lens and it's the
reason why the Moto X for footage was
some chaos oh yeah it came out at all
the biggest problem is that 35
millimeter number right I have to set
the camera here and I have to hold the
phone and I have to be using a monitor
to be able to hold the phone and that's
why I have to be panning and zooming the
pens and the zooms are not to make the
clip look pretty and it's because my
hands are shaky and I want to divert
your attention from the shaky with the
panning that's the whole purpose of the
pan and so
it's just a nightmare the distance that
you have to be a I mean how many times
have you wanted to take a photo of your
friends that are right there and you
have to stand back yeah and so what I
like about this secondary lens is 1.9
what would be the field of view I've
been one well they always I so I need to
like actually do the math on it they say
it's a 120 degree field of view but I
just don't know what translates to in
elevator in a focal length focal length
I have no clue but it feels like 10
millimeters it is still I mean there is
still some subtle warping of the frame I
mean you can't completely fix barrel
distortion on on a lens this small it's
much better than the v20 but it's not -
it's not much better it's miles again
from v-22 v30 you would never if you
want to hold the V 20 in the V 30 up to
someone who wasn't into phones they
would never have assumed that one that
was the same company yeah and to that
that was only one year separation yeah
in in manufacturing but I want to say
that the the wide angle is probably
close to approaching a 10 millimeter
yeah something like that you know that
you're in fisheye territory but it's
still rectilinear it's not like bowed
out and all crazy just phenomenally well
well constructed like 300 the kit lens
is a 16 millimeter mm-hmm for the daily
apparently I'm currently using a 20
millimeter yeah but that 16 millimeter
can actually distort and that's the
reason why I stopped using it because
whenever I'm doing the daily and here's
the edges a frame oh no my cheek is like
it's like yeah I did another laughs but
yeah even that 16 millimeter lens on
these hundred can go really you know you
can get really close into you know you
don't have to be stepping back so much
right and so it's one of those things
where you want to capture a really good
shot that's why I love the wide-angle
option on a selfie camera like yeah if I
want a selfie where everybody fits I
just stretch my arm and everybody
everybody fit and if you're good
lighting the selfie camera will do a
very decent job although I I still like
this is one of those things and I know
people want to be able to
the screen and reference instantly but
once you get just a little bit of a feel
for how you aim it doesn't take a lot of
practice
I was day to doing vlogs from the rear
camera feeling I got this that was a
good shot and not having to like
constantly like reshoot and stuff and so
when we were at showstoppers and Nicole
was trying to get a group selfie and she
was she couldn't welp she short excuse
me she's petite she was she was trying
to get this group and like 9 or 10
people there and all it took was like be
30
I had the rear camera up and I'm making
eye contact with her I'm not even
looking up at the camera like click
click click click and there's everybody
all right let's go let's get on with it
I got to go get some food it shows
choppers yeah did that kind of stuffy
like I really want to express to people
especially the general consumers like if
you practice just a little bit and I'm
not asking you like you know I'm gonna
be a photographer and study and do all
this stuff there is such a tangible
benefit from getting away from the
selfie camera anyway that's like the old
days we do literally the the the men who
invented the film camera the first thing
they did was take it selfie with it
holding the camera like an arm's length
away like not being able to see any kind
of viewfinder or really frame your shot
and and you're like people who are
really good at GoPro photography they
know this like they know what the field
of view is they know how to hold it I've
seen people like vlogging from GoPros
you don't need a screen no and so that's
like one of those amazing benefits of
how they've done wide-angle I'm this LG
is like you've got such a huge buffer
zone yeah to know that you're getting a
good background you're in the shot and
that everything's gonna look cool I
can't stress this enough like play with
your rear camera to do your selfies cuz
it's so much better for the optics for
the exposure for the processing for the
software I mean like the pixel I've got
my pixel up here for show notes like the
rear camera so much better yeah
then even Google's really good image
processing from the front camera but you
just can't fight how much better that
rear image sensor is yeah
no and I again I I'm very happy with the
week 30 so far can't wait to
play with the finished model to play
with the finished model I'm gonna have a
really hard time moving away from this
phone yeah like I you know the no date
is coming I obviously the iPhone 8 is
coming mm-hmm I'm really curious what
always gonna do with the May 10 you know
ever so ISIL - I'm usually a Bluetooth
audio guy and I have been pulling the
wire and yeah you get on my Sennheiser
the difference is abysmal
yeah it's abysmal like there's just no
room for comparison it's like and I find
it funny when you're raising the volume
on the headphones and it's like the
volume dial becomes it starts it stops
jumping from 5 to 5 and it starts
jumping 1 2 3 4 because it - clicks
might be way too much yes and I also
like for example I noticed like LD never
mentioned this but like they've
implemented new hafta son new haptics on
this phone oh yeah and they needed to
talk about it we didn't mention that or
not means so like a number of companies
like oh yes the vibration motor and our
phones is now so much better
so like things like um like in the
grammar at the camera dials even the
focus yeah focus has this little bit of
it's not a pop but it's this little bit
of a skip that feels a little like
looking at like an iPhone 7 plus an
iPhone 7 that's how it feels
yeah those little feels like if it has a
tactic is little Peaks those little tips
the the the bounce that you feel when
you're typing on the keyboard is really
subtle but it's nicely implemented and
they're getting to a point where it's
almost approaching the organic feel of
like what a real camera feels like when
it focuses right you get that little zip
from the lens and you feel it it's it's
something that your hands register and
your brain can go okay there's there's
hardware functioning and when I focus on
the b30 I get a little zip and it feels
yeah I think I've got it locked in right
and for those of you you know that might
be considered a gimmick for people I
listen I don't if you've ever seen a
force touch trackpad on a MacBook Pro or
a Mac
that's the feel that in that feel is so
cool because it helps confirm do you
bingos what you're doing where that's a
button yeah you could swear that that
thing is a movie total it's not you know
it's just so cool when you press harder
to just push this even further like it
it provides extra feedbacks these guys
are it's stupid little things like that
like you overusing a product but again
it's like what do you get when you push
a button your finger goes something
clicked yeah that confirms to your brain
that an action has been completed I mean
that's such a small consideration but
when when I see LG finally executing
stuff like that well I think that's
something exciting to talk about again
it's not a company that three years ago
I would have had this kind of that I
think would have had this kind of
appreciation for that level of design
and refinement yeah no no absolutely in
design and refinement oh my god can I
say into another topic let's just segue
in and then I think we can wrap this up
yeah I mean rambling on we actually have
to get back to myself well I last day Oh
essential it was not an essential carry
for you ah okay okay real quick let's
get let's get into that you got some
thoughts I know to make this parenthesis
as not necessarily an apology but we
have had our review ready since Friday
I have footage I have a script I have
everything but I was reluctant to do the
review I was reluctant to do the review
for a couple of things and it's I am
going to do it but I've been wanting to
give essential a little more time yeah
here's the thing I have never held the
phone okay this reminds me of holding an
iPhone 4 okay yeah the stainless steel
band totally that glass filled that
that you dropped that thing and it felt
like if he were dropping a thick sheet
of glass yeah okay
I don't think there's a phone that feels
better than the essential phone mm-hmm
that ceramic is really nice I don't
think there's a phone that no it a lot
of phones perform while the essential
phone performs well at all as well it's
just I had forgotten what it was like to
use a phone in one hand yes so well yeah
with such a large display mm-hmm the
pixel feels that way to me but I hate
looking at it it's a horrible looking
phone I'm sorry this is horrible
I almost feel like going into the road
just let's do that I mean I'm sorry I'm
jacked in here too that you the I bet
I'm human I'm gonna build some debt here
talking keep talking so I only got to
hold the I mean how many got none
essential before I didn't I know about
my landlord here so I only got to hold
it for the first time a couple days ago
and it is it's a very compelling
extremely well made device so if we're
talking about like luxury goods I do
think there's there's an opening in the
market for someone who wants a product
that's unique that has a luxury and
premium feel to it and the software
performance for the most part like the
actual UI navigation how it opens and
launches apps like I was really
impressed with like how pixel like it
was because it's a screamer in terms of
performance this phone camera needs them
this phone you can operate each corner
of the screen with one hand and it's a
5.7 inch display it's a it's a very odd
19 by 10 aspect right yeah and it's
weird it's just it feels so delicious
but the camera yeah the camera is pretty
weak okay I'm not gonna sit here and be
like okay no so here's the thing Danny
would you told me this like really
awesome tip installed the Google pixel
camera actually TK Bay was the one that
came out of that DK you're awesome dude
he came up with that he figured out and
install the pixel apk on this phone
and the photos are so much better they
really are they are insanely better and
so here's the thing I can't say that in
the review because that wouldn't mean
that I'm making it unfair review because
I'm using software that's not really
what the OEM intended so here's the
thing essential I understand that you're
okay so the reason why I hold back
during the reviews because for those of
you that didn't know this phone came to
be
while essential was just the twelve
people company mm-hm twelve people made
this device made this phone it wasn't
until the phone was ready that they
started hiring more people to be able to
make production possible this phone is
made by one hundred people that is the
essential scene just to give you an idea
we learned yesterday that huawei's
harder than their their software R&amp;amp;D
department is three thousand yeah so I
was gonna say it's 30 times larger than
the complete team of people who may be
essential I was like three no I think
it's three hundred or is it three
hundred I don't know I don't know
because one they had like this
incredible presentation deck about like
all of their worldwide developer I think
I wrote it down I think I wrote it down
and and and my event notes up here I'm
looking for them to regional hold on a
hundred and eighty thousand employees in
fifteen R&amp;amp;D centers a hundred and eighty
thousand employees in fifteen R&amp;amp;D
centers 79 79 thousand which is 5% of
their obviously we're talking about a
company that makes like a ton of
wireline and wireless technologies and
yes no no you're not all on phones but
like like one department of one rnd
Research Center is going to be an order
of magnitude larger than the entire team
know they were saying that they I think
it was 147 software updates last year
alone and that's the reason why they
need so many people Dorothy like Huawei
is a monster yep a monster that I gained
a lot of admiration for yesterday what
I did not know that always started 30
years ago with $3500 yeah yeah like and
it's one of the companies responsible
for like the entire tech revolution in
Shenzhen but I feel from from my very
brief interactions playing with the
essential phone I feel like I agree with
you I think the review needs a bit more
time to marinate because I don't think
the phone is finished it's not finished
so that's the muscle up high is not done
baking yet but I feel that this company
deserves a second chance because the
phone is gorgeous it is an amazing labor
of love I don't think I have ever seen
so much attention to detail on a product
that was designed by so few people and
executed so well and executed so well
and I can't paint rash yes I wear a
startup we're a small company like one
and I we don't have people holding our
lights we don't have noticed are a
beautiful amazing charming air B&amp;amp;B I'm
sorry we don't have people holding our
lights we don't have like yesterday I
did the daily it after our Huawei the
Huawei event had really good lighting
Zico he's like hey can I just shoot
we're just carrying tripod instead do it
so I set up a tripod I pulled out my
iPad we grabbed our clip mic set up my
monitor and I recorded my video in five
minutes in the wot one of the huawei the
the European CEOs was there he's like
you just did that hall video just you
just that's it yeah so we've been
running we understand companies that run
pretty lean we understand what it's like
for you know the level of effort that we
put into what we do and for you know for
us to get your positive feedback while
you watch a video while we're more work
it means a lot to us because you have no
idea of how much will work and it
requires we don't have camera people
it's us it's just wanted me producing
ten videos a week we've got competitor
to do one video a week with a team of
twenty
we do 10 videos we don't want to call
anyone out but yeah you could step it up
yeah everything everybody and you know
sometimes I like I have a lot of that
narration for these teams because they
produce amazing video avidin and I wish
like I wish I just had it's not that we
don't have the read something we don't
have the talent we just don't have the
time the out of towners like it would be
we have to find like a balance between
what we can do what we can't do and not
necessarily because we don't know how to
it's just we don't have the time of
where I produce as much as we do and so
this is the reason why I apologize I
hope you understand we've had this phone
since day one but I really want to give
this company time I want to give them a
fair shot because I don't feel that so
four people are like oh your camera
sucks yeah I don't feel that there's
anything on this phone
that can't be addressed by software by
software because the hardware's on point
it's the same sensor of the LG G 6 and
when you because it the thing is it just
took more effort for me to get a good
photo out of it and that's that's
firmware that's software that's not a
deal breaker until we see whether or not
the company can address those and the
only way for us to know that is by
taking a time yes if they demonstrate
because I know this one's been getting
software updates like c-33 yeah okay so
we know that they are engaging strictly
trying to fix some of these gremlins and
so now it's just a waiting game to see
like can they really deliver on
improving the product for those few
issues where it's having some
significant yeah problems once we get to
that point we would then be able to say
this phone is worthy of a recommendation
yes but look at how fast tech is cycling
right now and everyone has this
expectation of like opening weekend
results for phones now yeah we're almost
talking about it like movies like um
it's already a week old is it's already
I take the L take the L you know like we
need to be able to give a company like
this a little bit of breathing room or
we should just pack it up and say no
just buy an iPhone just buy a Samsung
they're the winners they're already the
top two now nice
you bother getting anything else and
that's what's to me that's what's been
frustrating but I like it was me you
know I'm gonna say frustrating it's a
little frustrating and watching some of
the early response to this because we
all know there is no such thing as a
finished phone every phone is a
relationship with the manufacturer in
the carrier to get refinement and get
updates over time yes and some companies
do a really good job of addressing that
and some companies don't if essential
shows that they are a company who is
going to be on board continuing that
conversation with their customers there
that's a win that's absolutely a win and
that's absolutely worthy of a
recommendation and I know people don't
like to experiment with their phones but
if you were one of those people who are
looking pixel territory good software
territory maybe you wanted like the
Nokia because no key has been promising
updates or something like that this is a
phone that I would put on that list ya
know and it's one of those things where
again I I have nothing against iPhones
it's hilarious how much people criticize
in the daily like this guy always hates
on Apple when I'm carrying them using an
Apple watch in the video which
automatically means the hook which
automatically means that I'm using an
iphone to power that Apple watch I use
an iPad for audio yeah I'm sorry for
people listening to the podcast I just
held up my iPhone se yeah one of the
best travel companion phones the world
has ever seen
and so here's the thing there's no hate
towards Apple there's no hate to blame
no hey what's whoever toured Samsung on
the contrary it's just there is more in
the world
yeah well and it's also there's there's
more in the world I remember last year
and I'm sorry to cut you off I'm gonna
forget this point I remember when we did
the whole the whole pole between pocket
now as to what we thought the best phone
of the year was yeah I was against your
you know in the end the phone that ended
up winning was the v20 yeah I had not I
had played with early xx I was against
it over a couple of things and it had a
lot of do a lot to do with bias it had a
lot to do with it's not a popular phone
right it's not the most powerful
phone from a ship perspective right if
you want to sort or whatever but you
know if we have to be unbiased sit down
and say which is the most complete
package package right the most complete
phone that you can buy right now the
phone that literally has things that
others don't have you were right
hence the v20 there was the b20 it was
the most bang for your buck and it was
the mean obviously absent a note seven
yeah it was the phone that did the best
job of living up to what the
manufacturer claimed it was supposed to
be able to do yes and that to me is like
that's a big selling that's also why I
like coming to do these shows yeah if a
company comes out there and they're
they're modest and like they're humble
and they say oh and this is something
we're looking to address and this is
something reg well I'm not gonna hit
them hard on making outlandish claims of
a company because that there's like this
is the bestest most revolutionary thing
ever and then looking all it's a good
phone they've set a terror an
expectation that they couldn't meet yeah
right and so that's that's to me and
it's ultimately for a lot of our
coverage why I don't want people to miss
an opportunity yeah you're gonna do fine
with just about any phone on the market
for covering the basics yeah above two
hundred dollars us you can cover the
basics like phone calls texting email
respectable cameras like you're you're
well served so once we start looking at
like what is it that you really want to
do and in this is why I get a little
frustrated the best camera like there's
no way to answer that question oh but if
you tell me what it is that you like to
shoot or what it is like I just want to
pull the phone out of my pocket and not
even touch to focus and just push a
shutter button and get amazing color I
can say iPhone or pixel iPhone or iPhone
or pixel done that's easy but if you
tell me like hey you know like I'm
really into composition and or like I'm
I need to shoot some really good video
or I really want a photographic look for
my photos I can go I guess a mate LG you
know maybe you need a balance of
features and Samsung really is the right
fit for you like you care about you know
like low-light photography and you kind
of like to play with some manual
but that's not really your thing oh my
god so mean it's like it's that so
galaxy so when when we that's why I mean
like I never want to talk about wins or
losses thumbs up thumbs down because
it's always a spectrum and I feel a lot
of consumers are probably using phones
which are good and they get their stuff
done but probably aren't the right fit
for them they could be using a phone
that is like absolutely 100% the perfect
fit for them because we have enough
variation in the market to still have
that I mean we've all arrived at the
same kind of idea for rectangle slab of
glass can they're on the back but even
within such a narrow design spec there's
so many beautiful options for like
unique features the unique settings you
tell me you listen to music and you're
not considering an LG V or an axon 7 you
are missing out you're missing out big
time Big Time and you know you make an
amazing point I haven't thought about
but yes I mean I think there is no such
thing as a one-size-fits-all right now
there is not there is a knob I don't
think there ever will I hope there are
never really is I guess the you know
there are two phones that are the best
all-rounders like they offer a little
bit of everything and they do the best
overall package and that would be an
iphone or galaxy yeah and and to those
two the two fo those two companies it
was really hard to try and appeal in the
drive so it's trying but it just it
doesn't achieve the design it doesn't
achieve like it fit the pixel feels
rushed from a design perspective early
it was the software just completely
saves it yeah it's the most underrated
can't like hmmm or pulling the camera
for the first time and taking and I
wasn't really expecting much I was like
wah which one do you want
I want the excels like okay I'll take
whatever that was like I didn't want the
Exile I took the Exile because I made
you take the big phone for the for the
last iPhone yeah and so but you know
like there is no all right there's no
perfect phone and so you know you might
want the iPhone because your friends are
on iMessage and FaceTime and that's a 10
benefits attend school does not have a
messaging field oh god no but then if
you don't like if you want phones that
specialize on Pacific meets specific
niches definitely LG is a creators dream
yeah like all I need is a better selfie
camera and this would be the perfect
vlogging phone but again you could
switch the wide-angle turn it around and
you can still achieve that same this
phone is only one or two app generations
away from being a one-stop shop for
mobile production yes I mean from the
audio from the audio so the mics are
phenomenal mics are phenomena have
features like monitoring really cool
features like when you're shooting video
it's feeding you the audio as it's
giving you a vu meter so you know you're
not clipping you can dial in your volume
and stuff you want to 3 I mean this is
gonna have its own editing suite but
when I sort of like launch power
director and I can work with templates I
can work with layers text transitions
vlog video log video that you can color
braid on the phone we I legitimately
could it would be it would be a lot
slower working process than having my
nice camera in my laptop and everything
to work but legitimately I could create
content from this which would be very
similar to the content that I can
produce from my actual production kit so
here so close mobile I think Apple was
just too early with the iPad pro to call
it a pro agree we are so close to these
tools really rivaling the main line
creation tools that we we've grown
accustomed to I have to agree and here's
the thing
if you're a new youtuber or you want to
get into the business of YouTube yeah
the v30
get a V 30 yeah that's all that's really
don't waste your money on a camera you
still need to buy a phone I would rather
you have a little more money you've
already got the microphones here right
you've got far better microphones than
some microphones mics
yeah you've got far better imaging that
some cameras that you can buy I mean
what cameras do we
have the Duloc video Tommy you've got to
climb up to like like mid tier semi-pro
camera equipment yes you need a $1,000
camera for log video that alone I mean
the the plot deck on this thing like how
much you need to pay just you did the
comparison with a with that with a $400
standalone Pheo x5 which has an amazing
DAC and it's the only amp that I've
tested on a mobile device that does
actually beat the v20 yeah but only by a
couple DB and the V 20s quality numbers
were neck-and-neck yeah
so you I mean I think there is a reason
why someone would want to buy so like
let's say you're rocking like a hallway
where we know we always don't have the
best audio output you rack a huawei and
Anna feel you've got a great combo or
you could get a V all in one device and
that's it and that's it and and you know
I love that you made that point of you
know not one size fits all like hey I
mean to the point like best all-rounders
iPhone and Samsung definitely best niche
products for full creation is to be 34
photography I would give it to Huawei
for stills I still think so but tah
grafite yeah not video not video the
video is good I mean especially on the
on the the P template
Plus yes video is good I'm not gonna say
the video is excellent no but it also is
the techie cool feature always audio
yeah the audio is a big glaring hole in
their lineup right now they need to work
they need to work on audio really well
actually you know what we should
probably do is wrap this up though
vieta's Huawei actually has an effect
that we have to get to I didn't realize
we had to actually been talking for 90
minutes I was like hey let's just do
like a 40 minute podcast I mean and it's
never gonna happen but folks definitely
