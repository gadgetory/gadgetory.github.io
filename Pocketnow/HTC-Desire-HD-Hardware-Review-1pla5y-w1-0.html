today I've got a really quick hardware
only overview of the HTC Desire HD let's
go take a look okay so this is the HTC
Desire HD this is a european /
asia-pacific phone and unfortunately
it's not something that you guys in
america are going to want to get unless
data is not all that important to you
regardless if you've got AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile or some other carrier that uses
similar bands this phone is going to be
stuck on edge for you now over in in
Europe in England in Singapore you're
probably going to be just fine at 3G
speeds should be great in fact
everything about this phone except the
reflective screen which we'll talk about
in a bit is just completely fabulous
let's go ahead and take a look first of
all on the phone and you can see what i
mean by reflective screen this thing is
ridiculously reflective in fact i'm
going to go ahead and turn the screen on
to to try and cancel out some of those
reflections screen itself is 4.3 inches
it's very bright it does really well in
almost all lighting conditions except
direct sunlight now that's not too
unusual for for android phones or for
any phones for that matter the bigger
the screen gets the more subject to
reflection specifically from bright
lights like sunlight it is and you can
just see all over the place how how
those reflections really come into play
so let's take a look around the phone
first of all you've got this really nice
big speaker up at the top and it's got
an LED hidden here in this speaker grill
and then another LED not hidden inside
the speaker grill I don't know why they
didn't hide both of them but they didn't
they both look really good they
functionally well they do what they're
supposed to it's nothing quite as big
and bold and in-your-face as that
pulsating scroll wheel that some of the
HTC devices have like the nexus one and
then some earlier phones but moving
right along screen is very nice very
responsive to touches down at the bottom
you've got your capacitive buttons and
when I was evaluating the samsung epic
4g these buttons the capacitive buttons
rather than physical buttons just didn't
work very well at all I mean they were
they were miserable over here they're
not bad you touch these they're very
responsive I've never had to double
touch to try and get them to execute
whatever it was I was trying to do so
that was really nice you've got very
minimal branding HTC on the front in
this case because it is an HTC phone
rather than a carry your phone down here
on the bottom we've got a microphone
that's your headphone / headset jack and
then a microUSB port that works very
very well it's very snug and because of
the beveling on the outside of the case
it's really easy to get it in and to
make sure that it's being plugged in the
right way rather than the facing upside
down so moving over to the other side we
have something that this is the site
it's completely empty there is a bevel
hear that i'll come back and talk about
up on the top now we've got the power
button now this is a power button that's
I don't know why they'd like to change
it all around here's a g2 for comparison
power buttons on the opposite side on
the Samsungs it's over here on the edge
but this like the nexus one is right up
there so I as a phone reviewer I'd
really like power buttons to be in one
consistent spot it would just be a lot
easier for us to use but if this is your
daily use phone you're going to get used
to that positioning and it's not going
to be a big deal moving over to the
other side you've got not really a
rocker and in my last video I showed you
this I thought that these were the
buttons at the top of the bottom but
turns out the buttons are at the top and
the bottom of the silver part it's not a
true rocker switch and there's not a lot
of play in here that it does its job and
just what it's supposed to there's just
not a lot of tactile feedback here's the
battery compartment door this is
relatively easy to get off but very
difficult to get back on properly down
on the bottom here
is another compartment door and I'll
show you that in a minute there's
actually a little trick to getting it to
sit flush that I will try a show for you
it doesn't work all the time and then
we've got our noise cancelling
microphone our our camera back here this
is an 8 megapixel camera some people
have complained that when you set the
phone down you're setting it directly on
this lens that's not entirely true
you've got a little raised lip right
around here so it's actually sitting on
that lip that's around the lens so you
don't have to worry about scratching as
much as some other people are making out
and then of course you've got a very
bright dual flash some more HTC branding
with HTC Sense and some Dolby and srs
logos on the bottom so that's that let's
look now at this bevel now this is a
unibody aluminum construction and I love
this kind of construction it's just
amazing how it feels it's lightweight
its sturdy it's strong and with this
bevel here on the edge can't see that
all that well maybe that way it gives
you just enough gripping surface to be
able to hang on to it and have it feel
really good in hand all right on the
battery compartments to get this off
there is a little indentation here stick
your thumb nail in there and just lift
and it pops off very simply there's no
retention on the battery at this point
so if your phone was on it is now off
take the battery out it is a very very
slim battery 1230 milliamp hours which
is hardly anything at all keep in mind
this is a 45 nanometer processor inside
the phone so it's a lot more efficient
with its with its power use but I don't
like to see a 1,500 milliamp or bigger
battery for such a big screen that
screen uses a lot of power but that's
how you get your battery out it's very
simple and the first time you get your
phone you're going to have to do this
because there's a film that covers the
battery contacts and then that's normal
so let me look in here and see which way
I need to put this battery back in just
like that now getting this back on is a
trick just line it up like this and kind
of tip it and then push down and if you
do everything right it'll be poking up
in weird spots
you just kind of muscle it around until
you get it back in and if you don't get
that top corner down you've got to start
all over because there are some contacts
in there that I believes just for
grounding so there you go just like I
said brute force push it back in and you
should be nice and solid and flush along
the edge right there now the bottom
compartment comes on easy just pull
straight down you're good that's where
your microSD card is and this comes with
a samsung branded 8 gigabyte micro sdhc
it's a class 2 so not ridiculously fast
but fast enough and then you've got your
SIM slot over here as well now getting
this back on is a lot easier than that
but it's hard to get on properly so let
me show you the best way I've found to
do that is lay it face down on the
surface slide this up on the bottom and
then using as many fingers as you have
at your disposal hold this back plate
down and slide the phone down into it
and doing that will help so that you
don't have much of a bulge right here
and you can see I still have a little
bit of a of a lift right there on the
bottom now where you'll notice the the
problem is if you get this on just a
little bit crooked it'll still be on
secure but you'll have a little bit of a
gap on one side or the other and even
still this doesn't line up very well
even though I've got it slit up this
isn't a problem it's not something that
I'd complain a lot about other than it's
just so uncharacteristic of HTC to do
it's a new way to cover a battery
compartment or some other access
compartment and I think it needs a
little bit more refinement especially
with this unibody construction so all in
all not terrible but they've got some
room to improve the phone in general
overlook those shortcomings if this is a
phone that you're considering it's an
amazing phone it's phenomenal it's fast
it's beautiful and I think you're going
to love it speaking of fast let's go in
and run a quadrant benchmark score on it
to see exactly how fast this is all
right and what hardware review would be
complete without a full run of quadrant
now
just so you remember quadrant is the
benchmarking utility we use the free
version over here more because it's what
you would use on your phone to see how
fast your phone is compared to this now
a lot of people have problems with
benchmark saying you can't compare
apples to oranges to that yes there's
some truth to it but I like to say that
benchmarking is what allows you to
compare apples to oranges it takes apart
the phone into a cpu and a video into a
whole bunch of stuff and it runs all
these tests against one another and then
it spits out a score now how they arrive
at that score that's subject to some
debate but overall it shows you my
device is a thousand points your device
is 2,000 points well then your device's
twice as fast as mine so that's kind of
why we like to include quadrant now of
course I'm just saying this to help fill
the time while you're watching this on
camera but overall it's very smooth very
clean not much jag eNOS or jerkiness
this DNA test is pretty quick go ahead
and send that off and get the results
back and if you can read that up here
this device scores 1767 points see if we
can zoom in on that a little bit so very
very fast the processor in this is one
gigahertz it's the new technology
second-generation stuff 45 nanometer so
it's really good of battery life too and
just really really impressive so that's
the hardware the HTC Desire HD I hope
you found it useful if so give the video
a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to
this video channel because we've got a
whole bunch of other videos not only
regarding the the desire HD but other
smartphones as well from windows mobile
to Windows Phone 7 iphone and of course
my favorite android so speaking on HTC
Desire HD for pocket now I'm Jolie by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
