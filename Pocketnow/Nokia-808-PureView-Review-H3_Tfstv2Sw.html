and this is the full review of the Nokia
808 PureView and usually at this point
we're showing the device we're now
showing only the box because we are
using the phone to actually record this
intro footage so that you can see how
well it records 1080p video the Nokia
808 PureView is a successor to the Nokia
n8 it wants to be the king of camera
phones but whether it manages to be or
not it's up to us to decide and for you
based on our full review which is coming
up right now there is only one aspect in
which the Nokia 808 PureView can compete
with current Android phones iPhones and
even some windows phones on the market
and that is the 41 megapixel camera
sensor the rest of the specs while
modest compared to phones and other
platforms are still a huge step up from
the internals of the n8 Nokia's x-camera
flagship there's a 1.3 gigahertz arm 11
processor powering the 808 PureView
aided by 512 megabytes of RAM there are
sixteen gigabytes of internal storage
expandable via microSD card and one
gigabyte of ROM which while still used
for out-of-the-box applications holds
enough space for your own applications
in order to cope with extremely
demanding tasks of course graphics wise
of handling 41 megapixel images the 808
processor is aided by a dedicated
Broadcom BCM 2763 GPU step up from the
GPU on the n8 thanks to the addition of
the GPU capturing images processing them
pinching zooming scrolling you name it
other graphic applications are extremely
smooth the screen is a 4 inch AMOLED
display with Nokia's clear black
technology but the resolution while
modest compared to nowadays HD screens
is standard for the Symbian platform and
other Nokia devices running it an HD 360
pixels across 640 pixels down as you'd
expect from a ClearBlack AMOLED display
made by Nokia it delivers excellent
colors contrast ratios and deep blacks
outdoor visibility is elevated and if
you don't mind the small resolution
it could be the perfect screen for you
of course you will not be able to see
all the details in a 38 megapixel
picture for instance on this NHD
resolution screen but the software
zooming in the gallery helps a lot
however the color reproduction of the
screen goes hand-in-hand with the great
camera system to deliver real rich
colors which are not oversaturated
connectivity wise the 808 PureView has
Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA bluetooth 3.0 and
frequency support for most gsm and HSDPA
frequencies there's also an NFC chip
included with the antenna being placed
on the back cover and there's a micro
USB and the micro HDMI port for syncing
and respectively mirroring the front of
the phone is taken up by the 4-inch
ClearBlack AMOLED screen and the entire
front panel is Gorilla Glass the top
part is dominated by a discreet chrome
Nokia branding just between the screen
and the speaker grille at the far top to
its right there's the proximity sensor
vga webcam and ambient light sensor the
very bottom of the phone holds the green
cool Start menu and red cool and power
hardware buttons which are made up of a
single piece of plastic when the phone
is turned off or sleeping you can only
see the power button but once the
backlight kicks in red white and green
colors light up there's nothing on the
left side of the phone but the right
side is where you find your four buttons
three black and a silver one the top are
volume rockers and the one on the bottom
is your two-stage focus shutter release
camera button which has a very nice
click and travel to it you can't miss
any of the two stages the middle button
is basically slider which is used to
lock or unlock the phone the top part as
well as the sides back and bottom
everything really accepted the glass on
the front it's made out of the same
polycarbonate which embraces the phone
you'll find your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack here on the top far-right
while the microUSB port that Center for
syncing and charging a small microphone
hole next to it for noise cancellation
and a latch which where's the HDMI
inscription it's where you can find a
micro HDMI port for mirroring your
display on a big screen
not yet it'll make the bottom of the 808
PureView extremely crowded you will only
find your main mic
I'm responsible for your voice goals and
a small lanyard hole to use with your
bundle wrist wrap nokia renamed Symbian
Belle to Nakia Belle and the unit which
we are reviewing runs Nokia Belle
feature pack 1 it is not Android but it
has many similarities with the Google
mobile platform
starting from widgets continuing with
home screens and last but not least the
slide down notification tray a maximum
number of six home screens can be set up
at any time but depending on your usage
you can find even three or four to be
enough each home screen can have its own
wallpaper and the lock screen as well as
the app tray will pick up the wallpaper
of the home screen active before the
device gets locked and you can add both
widgets and shortcuts to every one of
them there are 46 widgets available out
of the box from the simplest 3G or Wi-Fi
toggle on/off to the more complex
widgets like calendars social or email
while they are not resizable and some of
them are pretty large so that you can
only have a maximum number of two on one
screen you can easily find a winning
combination according to your usage the
Nokia 808 PureView with Nokia Belle
comes with almost everything you need
out of the box the email application
comes with full Microsoft Exchange
support as well as easy to set up common
accounts like Windows Live Yahoo or
Gmail there is a full suit of Microsoft
Office Mobile on the Nokia 808 PureView
with Excel PowerPoint word and one notes
this is testifying for the strong
relationship between the two companies
there's also collaboration tools like
SharePoint and Microsoft Lync so you
should be well covered from this
perspective as with the case of any
Nokia product recently you will have
full maps and offline voice guided
navigation on your phone to find your
way GPS works surprisingly good on the
808 PureView with fast locks and
accurate position reporting and if you
live in a region supported you will also
benefit from the public transport
application which guides you throughout
major cities where available the camera
on the 808 PureView is without a doubt
its main feature and selling point the
41 megapixel sensor would be a gimmick
for most out there if it weren't for the
PureView technology to cleverly use up
all those huge amounts of pixels there
are two main features of the peer-review
technology image quality and lossless
zoom in terms of image quality you can
take either eight five or three
megapixel images employing the PureView
technology nokia is using something
called pixel over sampling which could
be misleading because over sampling in
this case doesn't refer to inflating
pixels but creating a so-called super
pixel in case of eight megapixel images
there's a ratio of five to one and
creating images from full-size to eight
this picture of our sampling combines
multiple pixels into a single pixel the
amount of pixels combined depends on the
resolution of your final image eight
megapixel images contain super pixels
combined of less pixels than three
megapixel pictures as far as lossless
zoom is concerned the 808 PureView is
not employing any optical zoom and no
digital zooming either which means no
pixelation but how does it soom then
whenever you zoom into a portion of the
screen the amount of pixels required to
create a super pixel is reduced to zero
when reaching maximum zoom to put this
in a simple context when you reach the
maximum zoom available according to the
final image size you will basically get
a one-to-one crop of the image sensor
the exact procedure is applied when
recording videos 1080p videos will
benefit from 4x lossless zoom by
cropping towards one-to-one and 720p
videos can zoom to 6 X hole in a
lossless way as far as camera modes are
concerned there are three automatic
scenes and creative in creative mode you
can select the sensor mode PureView four
eight five and three megapixel over
sampled images for a full resolution to
use all the pixels available without
over sampling which is useful if you
want to edit your pictures on a computer
you can think of it as a raw mode even
though the 808 doesn't support RAW files
the Nokia 808 PureView comes with an MZ
neutral density filter think of it as
sunglasses for your lenses it reduces
the amount of light that reaches the
sensor and you have the option of
turning it on off or setting it to
automatic you can really play with the
ND filter and ISO modes in order to
tweak the exposure times as in shutter
speeds in case of long exposures for
blurred images or night shots
shutter speed which you can manually set
can go as high as almost three seconds
with the ND filter you can also capture
those effects which make your
photographs really stand out like
blurring the movement of water flow
battery life is a tricky one if the 14
hundred million power battery on the 808
PureView only lasted half a day in our
first two days of usage after the
novelty of the camera faded away it
settled in at around a full day worth of
juice be careful the camera will kill
your battery quickly and if you allow
this to happen and also you see non
flash it will drain in no time coal
polity is exceptionally good on the
phone the earpiece produces a pleasant
sound which isn't at all dull and since
we're talking about audio we definitely
like the speaker at the back of the
phone which produces loud and clear
sounds our biggest annoyance with the
808 PureView was the internet browser it
is slow and unresponsive at the
beginning once pages are loaded it is
still far from the buttery smoothness
you experience while in the gallery or
manipulating photos the 808 PureView was
destined to be a worthy follow-up for
the Nokia n9 and that it is it is
undoubtedly the best camera phone on the
market at the moment
hands down while you can regard it as a
camera phone with phone functionality or
a smart camera both descriptions will be
ingest Symbian is still a smartphone
platform even if abandoned however the
experience as well as the selection of
applications available in the store are
far from what Android or iOS will offer
we should buy this phone if you are not
a power user and your daily usage
implies using the phone sending emails
texts listening to music snapping
pictures and recording videos plus the
occasional navigation then this phone is
for you however if smartphone
functionality is more important for you
than the camera you should probably
either pass on this one if you are
completely uninterested or if you're
interested wait for the PureView
technology to come to Windows Phone at
the end of the day the 808 PureView
might only be proof of concept a pioneer
of a soon to become collector's item but
not yet surely managed to step up the
game in a serious way we raid the Nokia
808 PureView six point seven out of 10
mainly because the platform used
hardware is excellent even if we're not
looking at the latest quad-core chips in
comparison the camera is like
nothing else out there this wasn't on
the united front pocket now and the
Nokia 808 PureView if you have enjoyed
this video please give us a thumbs up
and thank you very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
