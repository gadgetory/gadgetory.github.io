powerful device to come we get some
solid rumors on what to expect for the
next Google chromecast and it seems that
the Samsung gear s2 is closer than we
thought I'm hi Mary vetta and since I'm
traveling back today I left this video
pre-recorded for your news loving
pleasure this is parking out daily the
official news today start with Apple as
the company's ipad mini 4 was recently
torn down because I fix it specializes
in this and well we get to learn two
things about it the first thing is that
it is pretty much identical to the ipad
air 2 in just about every way in its
design it's just the smaller device
obviously there's a smaller battery for
that but then again again it's an ipad
or to it everything up to the point
where if you want to repair this product
their score is two out of ten it is
terribly difficult to repair an ipad i
know everybody's known that since the
ipad 2 years ago and it seems that that
discontinues other Apple news have the
company's a 9 ship being benchmarked
even though the iphone success is not
out yet not only we get a boost in
gigahertz in the past the a8 was a 1.4
gigahertz dual-core 64-bit processor now
we get a 1.8 gigahertz dual-core 64-bit
processor obviously with a better
nanometer process and another thing is
that apparently all iOS products will
now be set at two gigs of ram and i'm
talking about the newer products the
past we had one gigs of ram be with the
exception of the ipad pro obviously
which is set at four gigs of ram finally
taking advantage of that 64-bit
architecture obviously we have to wait
for these products to be launched to be
able to review them and tell you just
how fast they are in a real review i'll
talk about samsung the company's samsung
pay has already made enough headlines
because it is completely different to
every other payment service you won't
necessarily need a contactless NFC point
to be able to use your phone the only
thing you need is a new phone to
actually test it but we've got a samsung
executive already claiming that the
service will apparently reach more
samsung phones in the future we're not
necessarily sure if that includes old
phones that couldn't be the case because
we would need new hardware but it does
seem that the company is planning to
bring the service to lower end phones as
well just don't know when and for those
of you fans of the google chromecast
like me it seems that google is gearing
up for a launch of its new product on
September 29 now hear me out here there
are some good and bad things the good
thing is that we get a new design not
necessarily a better one just the new
design according to the leaks but we
also get spotify connect in addition to
other services that might be voice
enabled which is great the problem is
that apparently the price tag will grow
to fifty dollars so sad news for that
but if we get a better product and why
not and finally for the very interesting
rumors of the day those of you expecting
the gear s2 SmartWatch from Samsung it
seems that you might get the regular
variant October second which is close by
but then again if you want to get
yourself the data enabled variant for
AT&amp;amp;T and other carriers you will have to
wait until november six which is rather
long wait but then again it could be
four different certification processes
so yeah the gear s2 will be available
very soon but my biggest question for
today to you is what current SmartWatch
are you wearing or are you interested in
getting a SmartWatch right now in which
one in my case I tried the gear s2 at
ctia it wasn't that bad at its UI I just
found it rather small so i might stick
to the Moto 360 in apple watch but leave
us a comment down below what is your
selection friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get those earlier
