reportedly still coming in 2017 expect
more milky of phones to be announced
along the year as well it seems that
google voice might make some sort of a
comeback I'm hi meri vana and if I had a
choice I would definitely want to
stretch this Wednesday a lot longer this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals of you are in the
market for two very good devices that
just landed some decent discounts you
can look for the moto g 4 plus that's
currently i think twenty or twenty-five
dollars off the motorola store and then
you also have the option of the moto z
play which is currently also around
sixty dollars off these are pretty much
really good premium mid rangers that we
highly recommend now I know the google
voice is not as big for many of you as
for example projects 5 but for us
reviewers google voice's everything this
is the service that allows us to carry
more than one smartphone and only give
out one phone number we were thinking
the Google was going to kill a service
but apparently google has been teasing
that something is to come a google voice
we just hope its enhancements not
killing the services google does lately
i'll talk about nokia the company has a
surprise everyone with the nokia 6 and
even though we were like wow snapdragon
430 things that this is not the only
product that's going to be announced we
hear that on februari 26 and mwc we
should hear of the product lineup we can
not wait to hear what we get we will be
covering it live and for those of you
that are concerned about all the
announcements of you have to turn off
the galaxy note 7 or you can fly with
the galaxy note 7 depending on your
carrier the company has just announced
that it has been able to reclaim
ninety-six percent of the units up to
the point where the FAA is no longer
requiring airlines to announce that they
have to somewhat leave the galaxy note 7
our customers can't fly with it or
whatever so it's good news to see that
so many units have been reclaimed but I
wish that the announces work continues
and finally a very hot news today have
to do with Samsung again as we hear that
the company is serious about foldable
devices we're not sure if this will be a
smartphone or a tablet but the reports
claimed that we should expect at least a
couple of foldable devices to be
announced in 2017 and limited supplies
up to the point
we're here only a hundred thousand units
or something like that it's kind of
crazy but it leads me to the question of
the day if you had a choice what
foldable product would you buy in my
case I would do so with a tablet I would
love to see a foldable tablet that leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion French another way it
goes if you wanna get the news earlier

a out calm and hit that
