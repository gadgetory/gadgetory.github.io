now plans to help you pay your bills the
whole deal between Apple and beats by
dre seems to have run into a delay and
Samsung confirms an event for June but
we only see tablets there I'm high metal
iveta and at the time the google now
figures out how to remind me to make
this video any faster I love it even
more but this is parking out daily let's
begin today with the official news and
Samsung is just in our presentations for
something that's happening on june
twelfth and even though we thought that
this would be the event for the samsung
galaxy s5 Prime and all the rumors that
we've heard probably even an active it
turns out that all we see here are
tablets and it pegs a lot of colorful
things that we should expect so could it
be that we're getting more irrelevant
Samsung tablets another device that
became official today is the HTC One
mini 2 and yes you're entitled to laugh
you can do so this is probably one of
the weirdest names in tech but hey I'll
reviewed it is already in Michael Fisher
is already testing it and you know it's
not as bad as the HTC one mini that we
saw last year this phone actually has
them these and specifications that it's
got a better camera than the HTC One m8
obviously you will have to compare these
to see if that's the truth but anyways
we have other rumors that this film
might be reaching verizon very soon we
should expect to launch in june
literally driven for the full videos
from michael fisher another product that
became official today is the nvidia
tegra k1 processor that we heard about
at CES it had not found a customer until
now it's being launched in china on a
tablet and well it was benchmarked than
it was compared to the snapdragon 801
along with the Tegra 4 that wasn't that
big Tegra 3 was a big disappointment and
so far the k1 looks great in paper it
looks great in paper so to the Tegra 3
and we'll just have to test this thing
out hopefully it'll come to the United
States at some point Google is about to
make a new update to Google now that's a
very interesting as the company plants
that now scan your gmail if you allow it
to and it'll look for bills that you
have to pay and remind you Google now
keeps getting more interesting and
smarter and we've got to admit I mean
that's one thing we do want to be
reminded of so this should be rolling
onto your smartphones and tablets
coming days hopefully and just pay
attention as a it would help me a lot
and finally for the interesting report
of the day it seems that Apple's
acquisition of beats by dre is delayed
you know that news kind of got us off
guard last week when we heard that the
company was spending 3.2 billion dollars
on beats and it turns out there is a
delay and we do know that the company is
planning to bring us HD audio streaming
and new accessories with the whole beach
by dre integration and stuff but that
leads you to the question of the day do
you think that the beats by dre and
apple should be together do you think
that this is something that could
benefit Apple or that could benefit
beach because apparently apple plans to
keep the brand separate and just use the
technology for its accessories and then
sell beat separately in my particular
case honestly I do hope that beats
doesn't become an apple exclusive but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
