might get an S Pen under a different
approach
iPhone 8 rumors claim that there will be
a 5-inch device with a new dual camera
it seems that the wireless HTC vive too
is in the works
I'm Hina Ravenna and let's all admit
2016 has been devastating for our pop
culture
rest in peace Carrie Fisher this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
have to do with deals those of you in
the market for the HTC vive this is
probably the best time to buy it's
currently $100 off but there is also
another option on the Microsoft Store
where if you bundle it with a compatible
graphics card which were not cheap you
get another hundred dollars off so that
is a really sweet deal I would highly
suggest to follow now so very
interesting rumors have emerged on the
HTC vive mainly with its successor
apparently there are two interesting
changes one that it will have 4k
resolution now which is something that
we really really needed - that it will
be Wireless that is something I would
love to see even more than just having a
smaller HTC vive so we'll see now as
well the spotlight over to market share
because it is the end of the year and
analysts are already providing this
information according to activations in
the United States alone iPhones and
iPads completely surpassed Samsung
galaxys almost doubling them and well
bear in mind this makes a lot of sense
given the popularity of the iPhone in
the United States but second because you
have to remember that the galaxy s7 is
at its end of its lifecycle and there is
no Galaxy Note so it makes all the sense
in the world for people to buy more
iPhones now and for that to completely
switch but the next Galaxy phones come
to the market we will keep you posted as
that happens and speaking of iPhones
we've got some very interesting rumors
from trusted sources claiming two things
number one that the next generation
iPhone will have a 5-inch display or
that at least there will be a variant
and bear in mind if the iPhone eight is
going to have a bezel as display or I
don't know an embedded home button then
it does make a lot of sense for the
screen size to grow but the second
interesting rumor is that apparently it
will be good
dual camera but in a different
configuration instead of it being
horizontal apparently it'll be vertical
that doesn't really matter which way
it's built so long as it works
we'll see and finally the hot news that
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
s8 and the possibility for the s-pen we
heard the rumors of a possible Samsung
Galaxy s8 plus that will include s-pen
but apparently the S Pen will also be
compatible with the other variants and
this makes a lot of sense we've always
wondered why Samsung has not build that
Wacom digitizer into the rest of the
galaxy lineup but just give you an
optional S Pen instead we got the
optional seat pin which was terrible
because it obviously did not bring this
functionality but hey it leads me to the
question of the day let's just say that
Samsung would do that the PS pen would
work across the galaxy lineup how much
would you be willing to pay woo in my
case I would be willing to pay 50 bucks
if not well probably not a hundred but
yeah $50 I feel is reasonable given the
price of the Microsoft pen that you're
able to use on the surface above the
surface pen but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
