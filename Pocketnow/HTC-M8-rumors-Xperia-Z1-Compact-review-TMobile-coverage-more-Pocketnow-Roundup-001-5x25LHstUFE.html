pause you dumb here at Pocket now we are
not exactly lacking for youtube series
we've got the pocket now weekly to bring
you the mobile tech news every seven
days the pocket now daily to give you a
rundown of yesterday's news every
morning the pocket now VIP that lets us
get to know the popular news purveyors
from other sites and the pocket now live
to give you the chance to talk to us
face-to-face about the news but we
haven't had a show that tells you where
to find our opinions specifically the
written editorials that give our site
its voice until now I'm Michael Fisher
and this is the pocket now round up a
once a week recap of everything
happening on the editorial side at
pocketnow.com you'll get a quick
overview of the notable editorials or
features from the week along with links
that you can follow to read them it's
been in busy week so let's get started
this is pocket now round up kicking off
the week after two days on America's
smallest network was me with report on
using t-mobile us for the first time in
over a year and though I used a very
unflattering shot of t-mobile CEO John
leisure within the post that didn't stop
him from responding to the editorial on
Twitter probably because it was a
glowing review of a formerly piddling
network that's grown a whole lot in the
last year if you're thinking about
making the jump to t-mobile or just
interested in what life on America's
Most magenta network is like these days
check it out following that up on
Tuesday was contributing editor Adam
doubt stirring the pot as usual with a
contrarians view on just why nokia's
star camera phone the Lumia 1020 is not
for him now this is less a windows phone
hit piece than it is a commentary on the
staying power of Nokia's Lumia 920 and
the comment thread is actually quite
civil so don't be afraid to weigh in
with your own dots on whether the 1020
is still worth considering in 2014
I know where my opinion lies on the
matter as more HTC m8 rumors kept
pouring in toward the middle of the week
Joe Levi graced us with a think piece on
just how similar the m8 should or
shouldn't look to the company's current
flagship the HTC One I won't spoil Joe's
conclusions but in addition to using a
pile of Star Trek themed cookies as an
editorial aid he also shared this quote
with us rear facing speakers make about
as much sense as an away facing screen
Levi the android guy knows how to turn a
phrase and closing out the short week
was a very busy Thursday the HTC talk
continued on episode 08 three of the
award-winning PocketNow weekly podcast
that's still fun to say featuring
special guest Nick gray of Android and
may and HTC source to talk all things m8
that was followed by Adam dad's
controversial analysis of the pros and
cons of Microsoft's new CEO and Taylor
Martin's video review of the oversized
boost max the carrier variant of ZTE s
iconic phablet which Taylor called a
great bargain with quite a few
compromises that's sort of the exact
opposite of my conclusions regarding
Sony's Xperia z1 compact an expensive
little gem offering a small footprint
with very little compromise both reviews
are live at pocketnow.com along with one
last editorial that just managed to
sneak under the roundup deadline a Joe
Levi piece predicting what Apple might
be able to do to reinvent the SmartWatch
