becoming more stable on your device I'm
Joe Levi for pocket now and this is a
look at CyanogenMod 10.1 m before we
take a look at the device itself which
happens to be a nexus 10 running the
latest M version of the software let's
talk about what exactly that means
CyanogenMod comes out with what they
call Knightley's which are well they're
available as you'd expect almost nightly
they're very experimental they have all
the commits from the previous day and
they're usually somewhat broken however
compared to previous CyanogenMod
versions like six and seven CyanogenMod
ten points something roms have always
been very very stable at least in my
experience on the race to a stable
version of the ROM the team usually
releases a couple release candidates
these release candidates are relatively
feature complete they're relatively
stable they may still have some known
bugs but they're ready for primetime and
ready for mainstream use usually go
through one two maybe even three of
these before they finally release a
stable version of the ROM recently
CyanogenMod started introducing an M
version of their ROM or a monthly a
monthly is kind of like a nightly
released every month except it's more
feature complete and it's more milestone
based than just nightly Tsar it should
also be a bit more stable that having
been said it's also clearly labeled as
experimental and kind of use at your own
risk
like the nightly Tsar what's inside the
latest monthly build of CyanogenMod 10.1
let's take a look at that right now
this is CyanogenMod 10.1 monthly running
on my Nexus 10 let's go ahead and take a
look over here in settings at about and
I'll show you what I'm talking about
it is running Android 4.2.1 and this is
right down here
the 10.1 2013 January 21st experiment
m-1 build that's how you can tell if
it's a monthly versus a nightly a
monthly is going to have the m1 next
month presumably we'd have an m2 and so
on until we finally get some release
candidates and then a stable build so
let's take a look at what's included
first of all while we're in about tablet
CyanogenMod statistics this is not
uncommon you've probably seen this
before it's how the CyanogenMod team
gathers and collects information about
errors and whatnot so that they can go
through and correct things without you
having to submit a bug report when there
is a bug found and fixed they will roll
that out into a new version and that you
can apply over here in CyanogenMod
updates this is relatively new to 10.1
you don't need rom manager anymore to
download and install custom roms this
will even update you when there's a new
version available and you can select
what kind of update type you want
whether that's all versions stable only
all versions including nightly or just
new versions so very quick very easy it
uses clockworkmod recovery and some
other compatible rums recovery roms
rather to apply these different versions
that you download and install and it's
really quick and easy you can tell which
version you're running by the little Sid
guy over here waving at you if you have
one that you've downloaded you'll have a
little downloaded icon and if there's
one yet for you you'll have a download
icon over on the side since these are
monthlies we just have the one let's dig
into some more of the settings and see
what we have we do have the performance
tab which you have to go through and do
your multi tap we showed you how to do
that in a previous video to show the
developer options once that's done
you'll have this performance option a
little disclaimer and then we can come
in here and look at our processor stuff
you can change your governor to one of
these three it defaults to interactive
we talked about governor's in the
previous episode but you notice down
here we cannot change our minimum and
maximum speed so we can't go in and
overclock at least not yet so that's one
thing that isn't yet wired up in this
particular version of the build we also
have memory management to allow purging
of assets I turned that on to speed
things up a little bit
16-bit transparency if you want to
crease your colors so you can get more
performance with the Nexus 10 I haven't
needed that and over here we have
surface improvement which I've gone
ahead and turned up to fix color banding
and blur effect versus the default which
is just to fix color banding looks a
little bit nicer in my personal opinion
moving up a little bit we have profiles
that you can set these are profiles for
lack of a better word they're groups of
settings that you can apply to different
areas home at night silent work car the
game church whatever the case may be you
can come in and change the settings to
turn on and off mobile data turn on and
off Wi-Fi turn your volume up down or
off entirely very nice and you can write
those to an NFC tag so you can just tap
your device to the NFC tag to toggle
between those very quick very easy you
can also then come back into settings
and use profiles in there or use your
power button to go through and switch
your profile to something else fast easy
I like it let's see what else we've got
in here of course we've got themes I
don't have any extras installed on here
it comes with just a couple if we wanted
to we can change from default over here
to this nice green one we'll apply that
and yes I want to apply anyway just
saying that they're from some assets
that aren't available for my particular
screen resolution I've never had a
problem with that message coming up ever
it always just works you can see now
that my icons on the top my coloring is
now green and I have these super cool
I don't know skittles colors over here
for my icon so it just makes things a
little bit more fresher a little bit
more bright and vibrant and of course
you can download these themes from the
Android Play Store download them install
them some are free some cost money play
around see what you like let's go back
over here into settings again and once
we are in settings we just looked at
themes let's look at system in system we
can change the status bar and I don't
have time in this video to go into each
one of these but I want to highlight
what you can do you can change stuff in
the status bar you can change stuff in
your quick settings panel that's that
guy right over there you can change your
notifications drawer your
our menu even your clock widget so you
can change all kinds of cool stuff in
there a notification bar and the
notification light if you want that
on/off or customized to some specific
value really cool there you can
customize your lock screen of course and
then this is if you are using the
trebuchet launcher which comes stock in
all CyanogenMod builds or official
CyanogenMod builds you can come in and
change all of this stuff that's an
entirely different video
I love trebuchet it's super fast not
terribly customizable as far as what you
can do you've got some cool rotation
stuff and transitions that you can do
you can see how I've got that one set to
kind of rotate and tumble in and out so
really fun I don't like that and you
know trebuchet just does everything that
I need it to and it's wonderful if you
want a third-party launcher go ahead and
throw a nova launcher on there or one of
the others that we've shown you in our
launcher war series they're great but
that's a quick look at what we've got in
signage in mod 10.1 M the M stands for
monthly if you have questions or
comments head over to pocketnow.com and
you can ask us those in the comments
over there if you liked what you saw
here make sure you give the video a
thumbs up or tell your friends about it
