brought to you by D brand to buy the
best fitting skin for your phone or
tablet please visit D brand calm hello
pocket now fans and welcome to the first
real audio review of a smart phone we
already produce some of the most
in-depth camera reviews under the real
camera review title we wanted to try and
see if we could bring that same level of
discussion to the audio our smartphones
and tablets produce and to start off
this series we're going to take a look
at a fairly controversial phone in terms
of audio the iPhone 7 to recap the audio
Hardware onboard Apple has added stereo
speakers to the iPhone 7 but of course
has gotten rid of the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack requiring users to go
through the lightning connector for any
kind of connected audio accessory and as
a quick aside there is no such thing as
a purely digital audio listening
experience not until we can plug a USB
cable directly into our brains at some
point you do need to create vibrations
in air that your ears can interpret as
sound and that's still an analog output
digital audio output on the iPhone 7 is
basically just a file transfer to this
plug which is then responsible for
converting those zeros and ones into
actual acoustic pressure now a quick
note about our testing procedure a lot
of it's based on just listening to music
listening to a lot of music we also try
to switch up that testing by listening
on a variety of different headphones my
personal favorites are the sennheiser
hd25 s these are closed back studio
monitors you see them a lot in broadcast
situations and those are joined by a
pair of noble in-ear monitors that i
also like to use for recording
situations and to cover more of a
consumer sound i'm a big fan of the
crossfade m1 hundreds from v-moda lastly
if the phone manufacturer includes a
pair of headphones in the box we also
take a listen to those two just to get a
sense of what the phone manufacturer is
supplying consumers for their listening
audio ecosystem for actually measuring
audio quality one of the first things
we'll do is literally shove a pair of
microphones into my HD 25s just to hear
how loud the output can get these are a
pretty good test for the amp output
they're slightly higher impedance rating
than most consumer grade headphones 75
ohms where most consumer headphones are
somewhere around 30 and if enough of you
actually care to know what that means we
might produce another video on that
topic sometime in the future and lastly
we perform a line test where we connect
the headphone
djaq directly to the inputs on my audio
interface connected to my workstation
that last has can get a little tricky
because some phones like the v10 are
sophisticated enough to change their
output depending on what you've
connected to this headphone jack but for
now that line test is still been the
fairest way we've been able to determine
the actual quality coming out of these
smart phones so how did the iPhone 7 do
in our listening and recording tests not
that actually it's pretty good the
output from this adapter is actually
better than average and so you shouldn't
have to max out the phone's volume to
drive a decent pair of headphones and in
synthetic testing we see a fairly flat
frequency response which means this
phone isn't overly juicing certain
frequencies of sound it's not maximizing
the base or crystallizing the highs to
any significant degree all audio devices
make their own noise even when they're
not playing a sound file and the noise
floor on the iPhone 7 is better than
average as is the dynamic range the
measurement between the smallest lowest
volume and the loudest possible volume
is again better than mid-pack it's a
fairly wide soundscape for a phone and
those quieter sounds are not going to be
competing with the natural noise floor
of the phone when you're listening to
your music iPhone 7 benefits from low
distortion numbers and there's very
little stereo crosstalk that means if
you were to listen to an audio file that
was playing sound in the right ear and
silence in the left all devices
naturally have some a little bit of
bleed where that signal might carry over
into the other channel the numbers on
the iPhone are so low it would be nearly
imperceptible the leakage from one track
to the next now for quality Apple was
the gold standard when the highest
possible audio quality we could attain
was CD quality 16-bit sound but Apple
just sort of stayed there and the rest
of the industry moved on now the iPhone
is capable of playing 24 and 32-bit
audio files but the actual output will
be truncated to 16-bit sound you will
not get the full benefit or the full
dynamic range or the full frequency
response of higher quality audio files
24-bit lossless audio notwithstanding if
all of these numbers are pretty good why
are we concerned about this adapter
situation I mean first of all this
thing's going to be really easy to lose
and we're also not super confident in
the long term durability of Apple
cabling on something that's going to
have a lot of stress applied to it but
when it comes to listening to your music
the iPhone 7 is a small but
scientifically measurable step down from
the built-in headphone jack on the
iPhone 6s in the iPhone se the 6s is
going to feature a wider dynamic range a
lower noise floor and even a slightly
louder amp than what we'll find with the
7 adapter but through the adapter or
through the earpods audio output on the
iPhone 7 is a small step down when
compared against other manufacturers the
iPhone 7 headphone adapter really has no
issues besting the Galaxy s7 or the LG
g5 without of course the B&amp;amp;O DAC but
this thing loses pretty readily to
phones like the HTC 10 or the LG v10 it
also faces a tough fight against phones
like the axon 7 where ZTE will overdrive
most headphones has a lower noise floor
but the axon has a narrower dynamic
range now a quick word about the Apple
earpods these are some of my least
favorite included headphones from any
smartphone manufacturer the drivers are
actually pretty decent if maybe a bit
dull in the upper mids in my opinion but
they create such a poor seal around the
ear that when I'm using them I know I'm
having to crank the volume on my phone
louder to overcome environmental noise
around me which means over a longer
period of time I know I'm going to be
doing more damage to my hearing than a
proper in the ear earbud solution now
more subjectively listening to a variety
of genres of music the output from the
iPhone 7 is pretty good though I find
even with this really flat frequency
response where the phone really isn't
juicing any particular frequencies of
sound just I phones in general have
slightly more of a tendency to
crystallize or create brittle or sharp
high-frequency sounds when I'm listening
through different pairs of headphones
those highs can range from being
sparkling to somewhat harsh or
unpleasant to listen to especially when
you're listening at louder volumes
overall though this is a respectable
solution and better than average for a
modern-day smartphone now moving over to
the speakers we're excited to hear
stereo sound on an iPhone although I
wouldn't say that each individual
speaker is necessarily a higher quality
than the single speaker on the iPhone 6s
but of course having - really increases
that landscape of audio really great
playing videos or playing video games
and having two speakers is just louder
so it's a nice benefit for ringtones and
alerts Apple's first attempt at a stereo
phone competes very well against Alcatel
's and axons though we still do prefer
the speaker layout on the HTC 10 for
really filling in that full dynamic rich
sound for audio and the iPhone 7 can
sound a little stuffy in the mids
especially against the HTC 10 but
overall this is a great first attempt at
improving the speaker quality on the
iPhone we have a separate video linked
in the description below this one where
you can hear some of the actual speaker
tests we perform we stopped including
those samples in our full phone reviews
because too many crybabies were getting
their undies and twists over hearing the
same sound samples in each of our videos
we're not including that content to
entertain consistency is really
important when trying to grade which
smartphone produces better sound if I
play a jazz sample in one video and a
hip hop sample in another what are we
really doing there now I've been
rambling long enough let's wrap this up
where's that leave us with the audio
quality on the iPhone 7 when just
looking at the numbers this is a solid
upper mid pack solution for listening to
music tackling your phone calls and
getting your ringtones and alerts but
when viewed in the larger context of
other Apple devices and competing
manufacturers were not exactly excited
about better than average performance
