pocket now Android has the most powerful
notification system of any platform and
there are certain things you can do to
get more out of the notification system
certain tips and tricks that I use to be
more productive and to remember to do
certain things so in this video I wanted
to talk about some tips and tricks on
being productive and reminding yourself
to do things using androids notification
system so let's get to it okay so the
first step I want to talk about is
called node in and I actually put that
in my debt to put it in my dock down
here and no didn't just lets you put
things into your notification shade
whether it's a phone number
or a sentence or a word or really
anything don't forget to take the trash
out and when you press + you just get a
new item in your notification shade
right there it's super simple and the
cool thing about Nodin is that if you
have a blackberry phone with a
remappable hardware button or an HTC
phone with a remappable squeeze gesture
imagine linking node in to one of those
functions so that wherever you are in
the operating system you can very
quickly add numbers or whatever you want
to your notification shade and just have
them have it there waiting for you for
whenever you need it so a really
powerful app called node in I'll put a
link in the description so you can
download it and try it out for yourself
the second thing I want to talk about is
unique to Android Oreo and later devices
and I think it's something that a lot of
people forgot about which is
notification snoozing so for example
notification snoozing lets you remove
notifications from your tray that you
might not need to action on right now
but you want to remember about later so
for example let's say I want to remember
this notification you slide slowly to
the right or left and you click on the
clock and then you change the snooze
interval to change it to two hours that
way it's gone from my notification shade
but two hours from now it will come back
so super duper helpful another thing
that I do to remember things is by using
Google's inbox email app so this really
this tip really only applies to people
using inbox now inbox lets you treat
your emails as tasks by letting you
swipe them away when you're done with
them or snooze them for later and
alongside your tasks you can
also have reminders and actually there's
a reminders widget that comes along with
inbox and I'll show you a really cool
use for it so I'm just gonna go over
here to widgets gonna scroll down to
inbox reminder just pop it on my home
screen and then from here don't forget
to call the accountant you can save
reminders that will appear right next to
your email list so you're not going to
forget to do them one thing that I like
to do and I actually already have it set
up is if you're using Action launcher or
Nova Launcher or or another third-party
launcher that lets you put widgets
inside of folders down here this might
look like just a link to inbox which it
is if I tap it once but if I swipe up it
contains the reminder widget that I
brought over from the home screen so
that way kind of all-in-one here I've
got a shortcut to inbox to check my
email or a shortcut to add a reminder if
I want to so a really cool way just to
keep track of things on your phone
especially if you're using inbox the
last thing I want to talk about which is
not specific to a particular app is geo
fencing and geo fencing has been around
for a very long time in Android but it's
gotten better and better over the years
because it uses a combination of Wi-Fi
GPS and cell phone triangulation to
determine your location at all times in
a low-power state so that you can tell
your phone to remind you to do something
when you get to a certain location so
for example remind me to pick up coffee
when I get to work yes so boom geofence
created now when I get to work within
seconds really I will get a notification
that tells me to get the coffee or
whatever now the way that you set this
up is actually through Google Maps and
you go into Google Maps you click on the
hamburger menu and you click my places
and then you could go ahead and specify
all the places that you go to and their
address so you can put in grandma's
address there your favorite bar and
restaurant of course you want to put
your home address and your work address
because those are the places that you
probably spend the most time at and that
way you can use Google assistant
to say remind me to compliment grandma's
haircut when I get to Grandma's house so
those those work a look at of a few ways
that I use notifications and Android to
the fullest potential Android
notifications have come such a long way
in the past years you can now triage
almost all of your communication from
your notification shade with a
combination of quick replies swiping
snoozing notifications adding
notifications with Nodin and so on and
so forth so I really hope you got
something out of this video please give
it a thumbs up if you like what you saw
