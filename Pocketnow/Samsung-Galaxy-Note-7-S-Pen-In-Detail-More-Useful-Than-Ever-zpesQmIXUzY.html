reason you call the note a note and what
separates this lineup from every other
phablet but has it really grown up to
become more than something nice to have
I'm highly motivated with pocket now and
let's find out it's part of our galaxy
note 7 coverage brought to you by deep
brand pocket aus galaxy note 7 coverage
is made possible by D brand manufacturer
of precision cut vinyl skins for
smartphones tablets and other gadgets go
to deep brand comm slash galaxy to pimp
out your new galaxy note 7
according to Samsung the main reason why
you need an S Pen is because you need
more ways to express yourself and
because you're always on the go and you
never know when the next big idea will
come notice the word need being tossed
around a lot fact of the matter is you
don't really need an S Pen but boy is it
cool to have one this is the sixth
generation of S Pen and also the one
with the most changes in hardware the
tip is now finer in 0.7 millimeters
nearly half that of the note 5 pressure
sensitivity on the note sevens Wacom
digitizer is also doubled which
contributes to a glide that pretty much
feels like if you're using a small
Sharpie over a piece of paper it may not
detect angle of tilt but it will know if
you press harder or lighter and a smart
change is that now it detects the side
button as an eraser command and if
you're curious if the S Pen works on the
curved display well it depends on the
app since it's a buddy works but the
feel is cumbersome still the major
improvement of the S Pen this year is
that now it's ip68 water and does
resistant and if you're asking yourself
why you should care about this try using
the display one wet or when your hands
are wet I know it's hit or miss right
but now with the S Pen you can now the
other element that makes the S Pen
useful is the software as the company
argues that this is a productivity tool
and not just the big phone as a result
Samsung has done away with the separate
applications it had then launched just
one Samsung notes you can use the
application for keyboard text pen input
drawing with the brush image editing and
even voice notes pretty much a
competitor to other note-taking
applications though exclusive the Galaxy
Note users while we do praised Samsung
for removing the clutter we're set to
see that the interaction between methods
of input is kind of mixed for example on
Microsoft OneNote I can use the s-pen to
doodle and annotate over the text of my
notes just like I would with a typical
notebook while on Samsung notes things
are separate for some reason
now what nails you to use Samsung notes
is being able to write on the display
when it's off simply pull out the S Pen
and voila write your note on the fly you
can even leave these notes as part of
your lockscreen and later call on these
with a simple double tap on the screen
all this again later lives on Samsung
notes when pulling out the S Pen with
the display on you're greeted by air
command the shortcuts are customizable
but smart select continues to be my
favorite find something you like and
grab it with the S Pen and this feature
grew a new really cool option which is
to create gifts or gifts for video which
is definitely welcome screen write
continues to take screenshots of the
display for annotation and we're happy
to see that scroll capture continues to
make the cut for longer web pages
translate is also an awesome feature
giving you text translations on-the-fly
with a simple hover magnify as a stated
a simple way to hover over a section and
the phone will give you more information
and then my favorite which is glance
that minimizes what you're doing to help
you multitask to other applications and
then return to compare and yes the s-pen
continues to be that surrogate Mouse
you've always wanted with air view
always welcome as a way to glance on
things without selecting them though
keep in mind that features like
scrolling are sometimes limited to
Samsung applications with only a few
exceptions like Instagram now what's
interesting is that a few cool elements
from the note 5 are oddly missing and it
could be because Verizon is notorious
for removing applications apps like
write on PDF seem to have fully
disappeared from the note and also
Samsung store though it could also be
because Adobe's Reader has now grown
enough to support these features with a
stylus we'll discuss this further in our
full review right now my go-to
combination is the blend of the S Pen
with Microsoft OneNote
it truly provides a feel of using a real
notebook I can write on draw on annotate
and even type match this with how
natural the s-pen feels today and my
verdict is simple I like this a lot and
I'd seriously recommend that you give it
a try with the samsung galaxy note 7

smartphone tablet game console and more

concrete there are dozens of
combinations to choose from for the most
