service for verizon the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus is now live in Europe and google
music leaves beta and is 713 all this
and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm hi meta data with
pocketnow.com and welcome to android
revolution the show we go through what's
hot and what's not inside the world of
Google's Android project let's start
this week off with what's hot so what's
happening with google music well six
months after was launched in beta it's
finally available for android customers
what this does is allow you to upload up
to 20,000 songs for free to your
personal cloud library and then stream
it to your devices you can also now
purchase music in the android market for
similar prices to what you already know
in itunes and amazon you can even share
songs with your friends in google+ for
them to play at least once and see if
the song is good or not it also allows
independent artists to be able to sell
their music in the android market which
is really cool because currently in
itunes and amazon you can't actually do
that now this is not all fun and games
because first of all warner music is not
selling music there and also well you'd
wonder if streaming music is actually a
good solution when nowadays and limited
data plans have ceased to exist is this
really a good competitor for iTunes and
Amazon music well you be the judge you
can download the application for free in
the android market begin uploading your
music and test it out and tell us in the
comments down below what you think about
google music so far and while speaking
of more google the motorola stockholders
have now finally approved the merger for
the mobile device section to now be
merged with google for a 12.5 billion
dollar deal not sure when this merger
will allow us to get some Nexus devices
being built by Motorola but indeed it
seems that google and motorola would be
separate entities that are working
differently and bringing different
devices not necessarily tied to google
but time will tell so let's see what
happens aside from that wall it's good
to know that the Google Checkout service
is now going to be merging to the google
wallet application so even if you don't
have an NFC capable device you can now
use the google wallet application the
purchase stuff not necessarily just
stuck to NFC so all really cool changes
let's see what happens with that merger
because we are expecting a Nexus device
that looks like the droid razr that
would be cool at other releases for the
week the Samsung Galaxy Nexus in there
for Android 4.3 sandwich is now a
reality for some people in the world the
lucky ones are probably out there in the
right now so so far the initial
impressions of the phone are quite good
though nothing's really perfect so wait
for the phone to get to our pocket now
labs and we'll tell you what's hot and
what's not about the device you'll even
be happy to know that AT&amp;amp;T is asking
their customers through their Google+
page if they'd be willing to buy the
phone so vote everybody because we
definitely want that phone to make it to
the AT&amp;amp;T network and other networks in
the United States and while I bet your
next question would be what other phones
are getting ice cream sandwich and while
the list is actually nicely extensive
first of all the samsung galaxy is to
line up is definitely getting it
deciphered that some other sony ericsson
devices that were released recently are
getting it HTC is not really sure yet we
haven't really gotten anything official
and well we already know that the
motorola droid razr is getting it and
what the merger will most probably see
other devices getting it through the
merger now obviously ice cream sandwich
is definitely worth it so if you're out
there to buy an android smartphone this
holiday season our advice to you is wait
it up until you're clear if you're going
to get an upgrade or not hopefully the
best thing is for you to get the newest
hard work but the Galaxy Nexus is
nothing really different to the current
galaxy s2 devices that are out there
accessible except for the hardware
button so that could be your next
purchase now out of this week's rumors
have a look at the recent images we
published of a motorola droid xyboard
8.2 that's apparently coming to verizon
now the interesting news here is that it
seems that Motorola's planning to bitch
the zoom to and zoom to mini edition
tablets that they mentioned recently and
apparently they're only going to be
launching them as the droid xyboard
weird name 8.21 10.1 now the difference
between these two tablets is actually
only designed and not really significant
so let's hope that Motorola ends up
publishing for devices and not only to
the more the merrier and well aside from
that we also caught other tablets like
for example the HTC Quattro which as the
name entails in Spanish for it actually
brings the first quad-core processor to
a tablet now this goes hand in hand with
the HTC edge that we recently leaked so
it does bring the NVIDIA Tegra 3
processor that we talked about recently
so hit the link in the description for
details on the device and well we also
recently leaked images of an LG majestic
that's headed to us a cellular
so make sure you hit the link in the
description for details because this is
another optimus black device Varian
that's not really compelling out of this
week's coverage make sure you catch
Nicky Adams video unboxing of the Amazon
Kindle Fire which looks anything but an
Android tablet now if you really want to
make that thing look like an android
tablet well we've got your back Vicki
also provides us with a full how to
video on how to root your amazon kindle
fire and then load any version of
android that you want so is it worth it
for 200 bucks definitely I mean it's
definitely a crop down tablet but for
200 bucks it's a no-brainer if you can
root it so also catch Stan Webster's
recent video coverage of the samsung
galaxy note which seems to not only be
big in size but also in quality and
while Joe Levi's is round the videos of
the motorola droid razr or up so make
sure you don't miss them out that does
it for what's hot let's continue on with
what's not and while this is not funny
at all if you own any Samsung Android
smartphone and are either running or
have ever ran the accuweather
application your device is exposing your
geolocation data without your permission
now you think manufacturers developers
and even Google would figure this out
whenever they approve an application but
it seems I don't so write down the fix
you have two options first of all you
can go into the settings of the
accuweather widget and deactivate the
automatic location data and set it to
manually or you can just root your
device and deactivate and delete the
application altogether whichever option
you think about is best because
obviously you're geolocation data could
be exposed to hackers so beware of this
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm high Meadow
iveta remember to give us a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
