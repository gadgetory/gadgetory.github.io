pocketnow.com
we asked our Twitter followers what they
want to see in the next video on our
pocket now video YouTube channel we've
got a lot of answers people wanted to
see the notification system flash in the
web browser gaming performance and some
other things so we're going to roll a
bunch of these things into this video if
you want to be a part of the discussion
on twitter we are at twitter.com slash
pocket now tweets so let's get started
I'm going to turn on the device and zoom
in on the screen first thing you'll
notice here is that I have a missed call
from my line it's a really great way
that Android shows notifications through
this little notification area down here
so let's unlock and of course on Android
devices this is not unique to the desire
we have the window shade so we can pull
down the window shade and see missed
calls miss SMS new program updates new
tweets on Twitter and a lot of other
things and it's really fantastic because
right from here you can action on all
your notifications if I tapped off if I
tap a missed call I am taken to call
history if there's a new tweet and I tap
on that it will take me into Twitter
peek and so on and so forth or I can
clear the notification so I don't see
them anymore okay so let's go into the
internet and talk about the flash
support on the desire so we're gonna go
to a couple of websites that do flash
let's start with flash calm that's
Adobe's website for flash and I spelled
that wrong here we go okay here comes
you get a little waiting cursor there
and it should load there comes Flash
content on a desire it's not super ultra
smooth but it's definitely good enough
so
all right so a little bit choppy let's
go to another website let's go to Nvidia
comm which also has some Flash content
and then we're going to go to Hulu after
that and this is actually flash it's not
really moving right now but you can take
my word for it that it is so let's go to
who comm which I can tell you does not
work unfortunately it's really hard to
get Hulu to work on a mobile device the
desires no exception let's see what
happens when we try to play a Pulu movie
so you get the waiting cursor which
means that the Flash content is loading
and you even get that and let's move
around and actually try to place
something here you get the waiting
cursors over here all of these are flash
based and let's click on we'll just
click on this main story here Saturday
Night Live
okay and so we get another waiting
cursor and it looks like it's going to
play loading video so far so good
wonder if it's going to play today
I'd be surprised and this is what we get
here sorry we are unable to stream this
video please check your internet
connection try again
so you cannot get Hulu but a lot of
Flash content on the web you can get if
you go to youtube and you try to play a
video let me show you what happens there
it doesn't actually play in the browser
it goes into the HTC YouTube application
which is quite fine so we can tap on the
first one we see here and it opens up in
the HTC flash player which is okay we
can fast-forward and there you go
okay so that was flash on the web
browser let's take a look at gaming
performance I've got a pretty intense
game called raging thunder light on here
see if I can find it I think it's in the
application tray which is a high-speed
game that really takes advantage of the
hardware so let's load it up and I'll
get into a better camera angle okay here
we are raging thunder light it's a free
application sort of player
so really impressive here does desire
just very very well at gaming graphics
so let me get out of here
and finally for this video let's see
what happens when somebody calls your
phone I'll give you a hint you get very
big and beautiful picture caller ID
hmm and there it goes
hmm okay and in the screen you'll see
the picture of the person you can end
the call open up the dialpad open up the
contact card or you can put on the
speaker or mute it or of course you can
multitask by doing other things the
screen just shut off after a certain
amount of time okay so that was just a
quick look at some of the things you
wanted to see on the HTC Desire coming
up next we're gonna go through all of
the settings on the device and then
that'll be pretty much it unless you
want to see more be sure to tell us on
