next to the 2008 it's slide mechanism is
real smooth fact I've had this shadow
for about a year now and it's slide
mechanism is still good there's a little
bit of play and this 2009 feels very
very smooth many of the buttons are in
the same place as the 2008 at the camera
button this shortcut key button on the
other side we have the volume keys as
well as the microSD slot at the top now
is power button and as you can see they
have moved the USB adapter socket from
the left side to the bottom which many
people prefer and it works better with a
lot of the charging stations inside of
there is one plug for the mini USB it's
got a nice color fade on the back here
from burgundy to black they've also
moved the camera to the center as you
can see and there's the speaker port
it's not as open as it was before
okay the keyboard is real nice the
numbers are highlighted with white Alt
key its twenty Kiki port can't see much
difference between the layout there are
any differences on the keys except on
the star key it says t9 instead with a
lock right there and on the one key
there is a voicemail icon now in the
front the buttons are a little bit
different there's still the scroll wheel
the button for the scroll wheels much
bigger but the send ends back and home
keys aren't as pronounced as they were
as on the old shadow so hopefully we'll
have less of those in an unintentional
calls this d-pad also has an up left
right and down directional and then
there's the soft keys right here these
are more pronounced than on the old
shadow the back cover is a bit odd so
I'm wondering how this is going to play
out for extended batteries with their
optional covers on the old shadow you
just have this small piece that comes
off this one the shadow 2009 you push
down and up on this cover to remove it
that's a flat just a really thin little
piece so I'm wondering if that thing
will loosen up over time we already have
a sim card in there and battery that is
1100 milliamp hours which is 200 million
powers larger roughly larger than the
old shadow
here's a nice close-up view of the
shadow 2009 it's got nice smooth corners
as a good it has a good feel to it
scroll wheel is a lot it's about the
same size but the button in the center
is bigger the buttons aren't as
pronounced as they were on the 2008
shadow many of the other buttons are in
the same places the volume there's the
micro sdhc card slot the documentation
says it supports up to eight gigabytes
but if you understand the sdhc format
you'll know that it will support up to
32 gigabytes there's a power button on
the side here shortcut key and the
camera button along with the micro USB
or the mini USB port on the bottom as
well as the land yard loop the slide
function is real nice and here's the key
layout see a difference here there's a
t9 where there used to be a lock
pressing that actually locks the screen
as well as a voicemail button for one
for those of you that might have noticed
there's some pink bars up here that
represents the UM a capability of the
shadow 2009 which means you can make
calls over Wi-Fi networks pretty much
like voice over IP except you don't need
some third-party app and another user
name and the login and you don't have to
I credit you just sign up for their nine
ninety five or ten dollar plan on
t-mobile and anywhere you have a Wi-Fi
connection you can make calls so if you
don't have a signal cell phone signal
this comes in really handy another
benefit to this is people that work deep
inside office buildings where you don't
have a signal or students whose
universities have free Wi-Fi networks
basically all you have to do is add the
network the Wi-Fi network to your phone
and you'll be able to make calls over it
now t mobile customer care told me that
we needed the t mobile router
to use the hotspot at home service but I
don't have one of those and it's worked
just fine and I called Brandon a moment
ago over the Wi-Fi network I walked out
of range of the Wi-Fi network the call
was seamlessly transferred to the cell
network and then when I walked back
within range it was seamlessly
transferred back over the Wi-Fi network
so you don't have to really worry about
the call being dropped now here you can
see the burgundy NiO interface this
phone is about half a second to a second
more responsive than the shadow 2008
each one of these pains helps you get to
a specific feature quicker you can go
through your photos you can access your
menu your music from the home screen or
some internet options deal with your
appointments deal with messaging your
calls or your myfaves people you can
since this is windows 6.1 you can use
the sliding panel interface for windows
6.1
each one of these panels is similar to
the NiO interface you go through your
appointments calls there's a getting
started pain that helps you get the
phone set up for email device lock
bluetooth speaking of Bluetooth it does
support the stereo Bluetooth profile
could also access your songs and library
as well as your images here's a picture
taken with the camera of the shadow 2008
and is very responsive the Kent pictures
just slide by or it can access your
profiles Communication Manager and so on
there's also a setting where you can
just display your recent programs when
you hit the start key or you can access
all programs for the Java monkeys out
there be pleased to know that the java
application is j blend so that gives us
a little bit more room to work with when
it comes to 3d java game for the
business minded folk out there this
phone does have Office Mobile on it so
you'll be able to access Excel Word
PowerPoint and OneNote the task manager
is fairly quick to access can end all
tasks so you don't need a third party
program to do this so let's do a
side-by-side speed test with this 2008
in the 2009 shadow so you can see how
responsive it is
you can see that on the NiO interface
the 2009 brings up the results a lot
quicker let's go to the images accessing
the media library much quicker on the
2009 the screen is 1.6 inches 320 x 240
pixels it's a 64k qvga display it's a
quad band world phone so it will work
over 850 900 1800 1900 megahertz using
gsm GPRS edge and Wi-Fi it doesn't have
3g you can sync it with outlook on your
pc and if you connect it to a windows
vista pc you won't need microsoft
activesync or even windows mobile device
center to use the phone as a USB memory
key does have stereo Bluetooth
capability it does have speakerphone and
voice-activated dialing it does handle
my favs so you can still have that
interface that you're used to and it's
available in white mint and black
burgundy finishes so if you have some
additional questions that I haven't
covered in this video please post them
in the comments and I'll be sure to go
over them in the next one be sure to
