running the official Google Play edition
software if so you're in luck I'm Joe
Levi for pocket now and this is how to
take your Verizon edition galaxy s4 turn
it into a Google Play edition when
Samsung announced there would be a
Google Play edition of the galaxy s4
after the Google i/o conference in May
many existing owners of galaxy s4's were
upset and rightly so they purchased what
they thought they'd been waiting for one
of the best smartphones ever created now
it still is don't get me wrong but when
it was revealed that there would be a
pure Android version available soon many
were disappointed and I'd be frustrated
too I've long been an advocate of stock
Android fortunately members of the
development community have come to the
rescue yet again here's all it takes to
get your Verizon Galaxy s4 into a Google
Play edition
as with most rooting procedures there
are some prerequisites first and
foremost you need to assume the risk
routing and flashing when done wrong can
cause damage to your device so before
you proceed make sure you understand and
assume that risk next you're going to
need a few files you'll need the
official samsung USB drivers you'll need
odin version 3.0 7 or above you'll need
a couple kernels the VRU AMD 2
pre-release kernel and the stock kernel
which we'll get to in just a minute and
you'll also need the moto chopper root
exploit tool once you've got all those
downloaded and extracted the next thing
you're going to do is unlock your root
block the stock rom on this phone is
root blocked but there is a pre-release
version of the kernel that has a hole in
it that we can exploit to gain root to
do that boot into odin and flash the
pre-release kernel in the PDA section
once that's been done we can route the
phone connect your phone to your
computer and run the run dot bat file
from where you extracted moto chopper
you'll see a message on your phone
asking if you want to accept a new
computer connection you'll want to
select always and then ok
moto chopper will run and do what it
needs to and once that's been done
install the latest version of supersu
from the Play Store open it and update
the binaries that part's really
important if you forget to do so you
will lose root on the next step next
we're going to restore the stock kernel
remember this one is a pre-release
that let us root now we want to go back
to where we were before to do that
boot back into odin mode on your phone
flash the stock kernel again in the PDA
section and then boot back up into
Android and make sure that everything is
still working properly
now you've laid the foundation and you
can flash a custom recovery image and
then flash a custom ROM the easiest way
I think to do that is to head over to
the Play Store download rom manager the
free one will do for what we're doing
here open the app and then install the
latest version of clockworkmod recovery
after that's complete now all we need to
do is install the Google Play edition
ROM to do that you'll want to download
that ROM to your phone we'll have a link
for that and all of the other files that
you need to do this over at
pocketnow.com again open rom manager and
backup your current rom that step is
going to take you about ten minutes but
if you ever want to go back to the rom
that you had before it's a necessary
step once that backup is complete and
you're back in android again and go back
to rom manager this time you'll want to
install rom from sdcard navigate to the
directory where you put that rom select
it and then follow the prompts the rom
will be flashed and the necessary caches
will be cleared after which your phone
is going to reboot that reboots gonna
take quite a bit of time be patient but
as soon as it boots up you'll be
experiencing android the way google
intended it that's gonna do it for now
