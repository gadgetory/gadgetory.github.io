pocket now com google finally did it
they made a nexus tablet and you know
what this better be good let's unbox it
and you know I say it better be good
because every Android tablet that I've
tried with the exception of the
transformer and transformer prime has
been horrible it's been laggy it's been
slow the app situation for android
tablets is just not good and there's
just not a compelling tablet experience
yet for Android as I said except for the
transformer transformer prime so Google
putting the Nexus brand on the tablet
must mean that it's good at least we
hope that does so we're going to unbox
us now and this is the tablet that came
from google i/o so it's the white one
with 8 gigabytes and I don't know if you
if you're if you can see this but they
actually made a seven with the sort of
silhouette of the Nexus 7 I didn't
really realize that until someone
pointed it out to me but it's kind of a
cool touch and I hope that you agree so
what's cool about this tablet well two
big things in my mind one speed and
fluidity it's got jelly bean on it and
we've already showed you Android jelly
bean on the Galaxy Nexus and we really
like what we see it's it's super fast
and fluid there's just something about
it that makes it just respond so well to
your touches and number two this tablet
is thin and light we're going to compare
it to the Galaxy Tab 7.7 which was one
of the thinnest lightest tablets of all
time the 7-inch form factor is just
super sweet for people that want
something that is actually comfortable
to hold a lot of those 10 inch tablets
out there I know I'm talking a lot here
a lot of those 10 inch tablets out there
are cumbersome to hold even the iPad
when we did after the buzz with the new
iPad that's something that we said the
ipad is thick and heavy when you're
trying to read a book on it or a
magazine or newspaper it's just it's
it's a pain it's not comfortable it
doesn't really give you that experience
of lightness and of comfort and so with
the Nexus 7 we might actually get that
experience because it's so thin and so
light or at least that is what people
are saying so let's take this out of Z
and it's really tight here there we go
and I really don't care about the
accessories to be honest yeah this is
light and I'm really curious to see if
it's light compared to Galaxy Tab 7.7
which is still running honeycomb making
it useless because it's so laggy it'll
be upgraded to ice cream sandwich in the
summer thanks Samsung come on guys so
let's see if it is heavier it's tough to
tell here but definitely actually I'd
say the Nexus 7 is lighter but
definitely thicker let's get this
plastic wrap off that's no fun and those
of you watching this at home that have
pre-ordered the nexus 7 might be a
little disappointed that you don't get
the white version but you know what guys
this white cover is just that it's a
backing it's a cover when you get your
black Nexus 7 from the pre-order I'm
going to bet you that there's gonna be a
lot of third party sites that will sell
this white backing or at least you can
paint it or there will be once with
different decals or colors but this is
just a backing so it's not like it goes
all around the device you have to
disassemble it this is just a simple
backing and darn this is nice i love the
dimples here this has a rubbery texture
and it just feels good in the hand
definitely not slippy slippery but
definitely a little bit thick actually
and i'm surprised by that if you look
next to the 7.7 you can definitely see
what I'm talking about it is it is
probably thirty percent thicker but a
little bit lighter so that kind of makes
up for it so a few things of note here
we're actually turn it on while we talk
about it here now this has a Tegra 3
chip and I'm really skeptical about the
Tegra 3 chip because on the one x on the
acer iconia a 700 the linux third not
that what X the Tegra 3 just doesn't
perform that well it does a great job of
gaming don't get me wrong but in terms
of fluidity of the operating system it
just hasn't impressed me and hopefully
hopefully since this is a Nexus device
it's going to be good enough plus the
combination of jelly bean should have a
winning combination so let's just look
at the hardware kind of get a chance to
get some first impressions here just
that flat piece of glass on the front I
never
really large lens therefore the front
facing camera thank goodness they didn't
put a rear-facing camera on the Nexus so
that would have just increased the price
made of thicker and no one uses the
rear-facing camera on a tablet anyway
looks like that pretty very predominant
speaker grill this is made by asus of
course asus is doing an awesome job with
tablet it seems as i mentioned the
transformer transfer primer to the best
android tablets or the only best android
tablets we've got the the power button
over there in the upper right corner
kind of samsung style and then we've got
the volume rocker got a microphone here
this will be fun to use skype on this
we've got a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack on the bottom and the micro SD
micro USB on the bottom really liking
this white I got it I got to say really
dig it really nice so let's turn on the
screen and welcome okay that's exciting
select Wi-Fi I'm gonna get this hooked
up I'll be right back okay and we're
back and i plugged in my google ID so
it's starting to pull some content based
on movie recommendations this tablet is
all about content it shows some some
magazines that i've recently looked at
you know in a lot of ways this tablet is
made for two kinds of people when it's
made for what we call the grammy group
people that want things just to work
that's easy to use that's simple i could
give this to my mom and I feel like
she'd have a pretty good experience on
it she'd read some books she'd watch
look at some magazines watch some videos
of the other group of people that this
is intended for is the power user which
is very interesting because usually you
don't get the granny group and the power
user to get happy from the same device
reason I say that this is good for the
power user because it's a Nexus device
it's going to be fast and just moving
around i can tell you that it's pretty
darn fast we're going to have more tests
later but also it's going to be easy to
unlock there's gonna be a lot of great
development work on this tablet and so
we're really going to see this tablet
shine so the 199 dollar price point for
the eight gigabyte model on the 249
price point for the 16gb model is just
super sweet just want to go into the web
browser and poke around for a few
minutes while we while we film the rest
of this video accept and continue
sure sign in and of course chrome sink
is pretty cool so we're gonna go to
pocketnow.com and one thing that i have
to say is that 7-inch tablets are very
conducive to portrait typing and that's
really important because a lot of
tablets are very difficult to type on
especially when you're in the landscape
keyboard it's just it's huge and you
can't use your fingers but here on the
Nexus 7 it's the perfect size to type in
portrait even if you have small hands
like me so this will be great for
emailing great for inputting text
alright so here we are screen looks very
nice by the way it's not amazing that's
1280 x 800 so that gives it a dpi of
like 214 as a comparison the transformer
prime tf700 the one with the higher res
screen is around 230 and then the ipad 3
is 260 so so there's definitely a
difference there but you know they had
to keep the price down somehow so we're
trying to go in a landscape hello maybe
landscape lock is on with to check for
that let's flick down the page very
smooth just like we saw on the Galaxy
Nexus web browsing performance is very
good and you know the the animation for
the multitask UI is gone it's just there
there really aren't any apps open
actually let's open a couple of things
just kind of try to overwhelm it I guess
just open up a ton of apps and none of
these are in memory right now so they're
just kind of like you know loading
slowly and we'll open a book the nexus 7
guidebook look at this pretty page
animation okay let's go to the multitask
you I so no animation anymore boom it
just pops right open it's a lot faster
than it used to be so a lot of cool
stuff with this tablet lot of cool stuff
that we're going to do and talk about in
future videos this might be the best
tablet that has ever come to Android in
fact it probably is just by virtue of
the price being so low packing a
quad-core CPU with a gig of ram pretty
nice screen by the way let's see can you
see pixels on the focus can you see
pixels yeah I can but you know you hold
a tablet not right up to your face that
you would have phone so
that doesn't matter as much anyway a lot
of talking but this tablet is really
cool very excited about it and we're
gonna have a lot more coming up on it so
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and thanks for watching that's
it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
