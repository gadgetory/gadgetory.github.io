pocketnow.com with the release of the
Samsung Galaxy s2 Samsung's flagship for
2011 we're seeing TouchWiz 4.0 which is
Samsung's proprietary interface that
sits on top of Android in this case
Android 2.3 Gingerbread in this video
we're gonna take a tour of everything
that is TouchWiz 4.0 so let's get to it
alright and TouchWiz starts here on the
home screen which you can turn on or you
can unlock the phone by pressing the
standby button on the right over here or
you can press the home button right here
to unlock the device
kind of like an iPhone actually so we
can press on that we are taken to the
lock screen very simple plain lock
screen it's not functional like you'll
find on newer HTC devices you just get
the time and the date nothing else which
is a little bit annoying so we can slide
that off the screen slide it up to the
right however you want to do it and we
are taken to the home screen interface
now before jumping into any of that
let's just give you a sort of framework
or some context of how fast this device
is let's take a look at what we score in
Quadrant yeah you know benchmarks aren't
truly representative of day to day
performance they're just numbers but
they help to provide some context as
mentioned so here we are scoring about
2900 in quadrant sometimes it goes as
high as 3100 we're gonna have a full
suite of benchmarks coming up in the
final review on pocketnow.com
what you probably want to see is how
this device is a day to day meaning how
fast is the web browser how good is the
launcher and things like that we're
gonna talk all about that in this video
just went to sleep
now another thing you probably care a
lot about is data speeds so this phone
has three states I have to actually turn
off the Wi-Fi to show you this three
states of network connectivity by the
way this is another aspect of TouchWiz
4.0 you get these Quick Links to Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS you can mute the sound and
turn on and off autorotation which is a
nice feature kind of get that from
previous generation Samsung devices so
this indicator has three states right
now it says h plus implying HSPA+ it can
also say H which would mean H as a DPA
or it can say 3G like it just bounce
back to which is actually UMTS and if we
go into about phone and status you'll
see then it says UMTS right now and it
might actually bounce back to HSB plus
at any moment so the reason we think
that this phone has HSPA+ meaning that
it's a sleeper AT&amp;amp;T 4G phone is because
well we've we've been
mark this phone so if you go to
speedtest.net the application we were in
Washington DC running some tests and
look at these tremendous speeds we got
five point nine megabits per second down
these are not HSDPA speeds these are
those faster HSPA+ speeds that we've
been hearing about four point eight down
let's see what else we have here those
are really the two best runs four point
five down was pretty impressive but I
mean five point nine down that is
absolutely HSPA+ and of course that was
over cellular you can see the little
notification there really really
impressive stuff if we run the benchmark
right now we're over 3G we'd probably do
something like one point eight down one
point five up or so so if you want to if
you want the Samsung Galaxy s2 on AT&amp;amp;T S
4G network it's already it's it already
can do that so that's kind of an
interesting headline for this device so
TouchWiz for point out what is it well
this is what it looks like you get a doc
along the bottom which is changeable you
get a variety of home screens with a
bunch of different widgets and you can
tap and hold on them to remove them kind
of like you'd expect on any Android
phone and the way that you manage home
screens is kind of like you're used to
on any other Android phone you pinch
right so you pinch your take into the
zoomed out view and from here we can
rearrange home screens tapping and
holding we can add new ones see how many
we can add so that is a total of two
four six seven home screens and you can
actually take them away by doing this
clicking them into the trashcan and you
get the point from there so here are the
home screens you can get to them by
swiping left and right of course you can
tap on the number to jump right to five
and go to one you can also tap and hold
and then you get this really cool 3d
animation to bounce from one home screen
to another and let's talk about what
it's like to add widgets because Samsung
has done some really cool stuff to make
the widget adding process kind of a
little bit nicer so you tap and hold
then you get this nice little
translucent menu from the bottom let's
actually go into live wallpaper and show
you two live wallpapers that Samsung is
added this is probably the best one it
shows you the weather when it's going
through a demo right now with windmills
spinning in the back
Brown super smooth great frame rate then
we get to this one ocean weather which
just seems very crappy look health
choppy the wave animations are it's just
kind of seems a lot worse than the other
one that they threw in and of course you
can choose from a variety of wallpapers
Samsung has added some pretty cool ones
you might not care that much about
wallpaper but these are really nice
actually so we go along choose one that
we like starry night this is probably a
nice one to use in this video because
it's not very distracting click Save
picture it takes a little bit too long
to to add the wallpaper but there it
goes okay so here we go let's add some
widgets tap it home go down to widgets
now the way that you add widgets a
little bit different you don't get the
vertically scrolling list that you get
in standard Android you get horizontally
scrolling widgets which is a nice touch
but it's also less intuitive because if
you want to quickly see more widgets on
the screen at once with this you can
only see four at a time so what we can
do here is we can click and drag we can
add a variety of widgets I'll show you
some of these ap Mobile agenda not too
interesting this one called month needs
an entire homescreen to work so we'll
put that on this one go over to the side
here got agenda today some pretty cool
clocks you like clocks we've got a
digital clock too actually several
different styles of digital clock that
you can just tap on here and that's
pretty much it I mean the rest are built
in Android widgets that some of them
I've installed already and some of them
that come with the device when you're
done you hit the home screen button
something really cool about these hope
these widgets on the home screen is that
they are actually resizable where some
of them are like this one the weather so
you tap it hold and let go and this
shows you how big you can make it kind
of like in launcher Pro where you can
resize widgets so I can drag that here I
could make it a 2x2 grid but it's
obviously covered by the clock there so
I hit the home button when I'm done you
want to hit the home button it brings me
back to the first screen so I'm gonna
remove this and show you what it's like
to expand this particular widget to its
full size because it's kind of cool you
actually get the weather
so really cool functionality there and
your ability to resize widgets
here's some other widgets kind of a
smaller size weather we've got the tasks
widget another agenda widget there's the
clock here I've got just the the digital
clock with Google search and some icons
this is the calendar widget so kind of
like any other calendar widget you tap
on an area it shows you the preview you
can tap on that particular entry it
shows you the calendar it's in it shows
you the information if you swipe to the
right we have this really cool widget
I'm actually going to delete this one
that is like a little post-it note on
your home screen so right now I've got
one that says hello and by the way you
get swiped keyboard if you want it that
was not very accurate trying to type hi
again well perhaps it's sent to another
language it is actually check this out
so we tap and hold and switch it back to
uh back to English right and has another
keyboard that comes stock on this I
cannot find English that is very strange
here Australian English good enough so
hi again so swipe is fun you get the
point
and when you're done you get this little
sticky note when you want to add a new
one you have to tap on this little + you
get a new sticky note kind of a fun
little widget so the TouchWiz UI version
4 brings this new way to add widgets
kind of a nicer looking style than you
get in stock Android and your ability to
swipe to the right and to manage them
another cool feature of TouchWiz 4 is
moving around widgets has become easier
so say I want to move around this widget
I tap it with my thumb and I use the
gyroscope to move to the next homescreen
and then I can find a place where I can
actually drop this it takes some
practice as you can see it's a it's not
very precise and it doesn't always work
but if you're trying to move around a
lot of widgets at one time it's a neat
and handy looking feature another thing
that you can do in terms of gestures we
have to go into the gallery to do this
it's this two finger gesture typically
if pinch-to-zoom you go like this right
well in TouchWiz 4 you put two fingers
on the screen
tilt the device towards you and again
this one takes practice and it kind of
zooms in and out I'm not sure the
purpose for this one it seems to be kind
of a novelty you can do this in the
browser too so it's just it's just an
added feature that seems kind of cool
but who knows another component of
TouchWiz 4.0 is the task manager so we
can go into the task manager here and
you can see all your open applications
I'm actually surprised about the level
of integration with the task manager in
the galaxy s2 because it's got so much
RAM it's got 833 megabytes of user
accessible RAM the actual number on
paper is 1 gigabyte so it doesn't really
need memory management it just does a
really good job at managing applications
because it has so much RAM built into it
another thing that's a little bit
frustrating here is if you tap in home
on on the home screen button you only
get six recently used programs and not 8
which is stock for Android 2.2 this is
2.3 and we can tap the home button
there's also a corresponding widget for
the task manager I'll make some room
here so you can see that it's very
simple it just allows you to see how
many applications you have running at a
glance and it is called it's over here
somewhere over here program on there
here you go so quite simply you tap on
that it journals you right into the task
manager so kind of a cool way to manager
programs if you like to keep an eye a
very close eye on the sort of number of
programs that you're running at once
let's talk about the application tray
now here it is it is side scrollable you
can't get a vertically scrolling list
unless you change it to list view but
then that makes it even more difficult
to find the apps that you want and the
grid view is completely customizable so
you can have one screen for your games
one screen for your productivity apps
and so on and so forth and if we go into
edit mode you can see what I mean from
here you can also change the dock icon
so you can say put a little search down
here if you want it move any of the dock
icons you can also add a page from down
here
you just drag the icons you want onto
the page and it creates a new page
we can actually add folders which is
super cool so we can put this down here
readers hub and let's say Gmail just put
it there and you can take the folder and
plop it on a home screen name it
something and boom if we go to save
you'll see that now we have a new folder
pretty cool a folder in your app tray
very good idea very useful thing and if
you want to take the apps out of it you
should be able to just do that and
you're taken into edit mode immediately
so you can just take things out of the
folder pretty cool feature there now
let's talk about the settings built in
to the galaxy s2 we have some things to
talk about let's go to display first and
screen display we can actually change
the font on this device which is awesome
a lot of or most Android phones don't
let you do this this one's kind of the
coolest called shock go cookie and it
changes the entire system fun which is
great you can even add new fonts if you
click get fonts online they're about a
dollar each it just dumps you into the
Android Market
I think this particular font is the
crisp most crisp and clean that exists
here Scott's got some other options here
like autorotation you can turn that off
you can change the duration of the
buttons down here because they keep
shutting off to save battery and when
they're off you can't see them I mean
there's no way to really know unless
you've memorized what you probably will
which ones back and which ones menu but
it's kind of nice to have it on six
seconds so that they show up like so we
can also have a power option here to
adjust certain characteristics of the
screen to save my battery life we can
calibrate the gyroscope calibrate the
accelerometer from the screen let's
scroll down we've got a power saving
mode which is nice so that you can have
the device turn off GPS and Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth when you get below like 15% so
that you could actually make calls if
you need to we've got this item here
called motion which is pretty cool shows
you all the gestures and the motions you
can do a lot of them are very HTC esque
now for example turnover is an HTC
feature that they brought out several
years ago so much calling you put the
phone on its face like so hopefully not
as rough as
and you'll get the the sound to mute
you've also got the tilt feature which
I've showed you in the photo gallery you
put two fingers on the screen move the
device closer from you and further away
from you you've also got panning also
showed you that where you can move jet
icons and widgets from one homescreen to
the next and DoubleTap which is a
feature I'll show you in the next video
that allows you to quickly enter a voice
command into the device let's scroll
down see what else we have language and
keyboard you get two input methods to
choose from Samsung keyboard and swype
let's see what the Samsung keyboard
looks like and did you see that when we
went back to the home screen the widgets
had a tough time refreshing that's one
of the problems with this phone the home
screen takes a long time to read you're
off let's go and type something so this
is the Android keyboard so it's nice it
works it's a magnifies the letter when
you tap on it it makes a vibration and a
sound let's jump back into the settings
here so those are the input methods
let's go down we've got some dock
settings if you want to use an optional
dock to connect this to a flat panel to
go into about--we're see we're running
on android 2.3.3
the latest go to battery usage just for
your own knowledge
yeah the displays using the most amount
of power but this is a Super AMOLED plus
screen so it's really good on battery
power and we're gonna have remarks on
battery power and battery life in the
final review on pocketnow.com now of
course TouchWiz goes into other places
as well like the email application so if
we go into email if you have a galaxy
tab you know if you go into landscape
view you get a split screen view that
has actually come to the Galaxy S to
watch this really cool you get a tablet
view of your email so if you tap on the
message on the left you will get the
message to show up on the right which is
a really nice feature to have especially
with a device with a larger screen like
this 4.3 inches now something that is
extremely annoying is the time that it
takes to delete an email in the email
client this is obviously down up by
samsung it's got a lot of
and things like that so if we tap and
hold something and click delete watch
how long it takes one two three four
five five seconds to delete an email
that's insane there might be some
setting with my email client or
something like that
but I've looked at this many times and
everything seems to be fine another
thing that really is annoying is that
there's no checkmark checkboxes on the
left side of the email client so if you
take a look at an HTC device and kind of
off camera and pulling up email you're
going to see that you get check boxes so
really quickly you can go down and
delete or mark as read or unread a
variety of emails and the Samsung Galaxy
S 2 there are no checkmarks there's no
way to select multiple messages you got
to do a tap an old one at the time very
very annoying in terms of the email
client you know in the future you'll be
able to flash this device put a
different realm on there a different
email client but out of the box the
email client kind of sucks to be honest
so that was a look at TouchWiz 4.0
Samsung has done a lot to change the
experience of Android mostly for the
better coming up in the next video we're
going to talk about web browsing
performance we're going to drill into
the many included applications that come
on the Samsung Galaxy s2 and talked
about some other things as well if you
like this video please give us a thumbs
up and if you want to jump back to that
Hardware tour where we talked about
specs and exactly what you get in terms
of hardware again the annotation is up
right there just tap on that jump back
to that video and enjoy thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
