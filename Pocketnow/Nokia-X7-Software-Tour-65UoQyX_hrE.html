pocketnow.com nokia announced Symbian
Anna platform refresh a couple of months
ago with the occasion of launching the
x7 and the e6 the first two smartphones
to come out of the box with Symbian data
recently Nokia announced in Singapore
that Symbian Anna will be shipping on
devices such as the flagship n8 and the
owners of those smartphones will be able
to download Symbian Anna as an
over-the-air upgrade for their
smartphones we've got the Nokia x7 here
which is running Symbian and out of the
box and we're going to take a look at
the software running on it
so this is the main Symbian Ana home
screen and the Android users will
recognize the pages which you can flip
through left or right which are
basically your home screens and the
widgets each home screen can hold up to
six widgets and you can have a total
number of three home screens you can
flick through with your fingers wiping
left or right or you can use the button
buttons you flip through them now you
can customize the home screens with
widgets let's say we want to remove this
home screen we just tap and hold and we
get the chance to either add three more
widgets to the missing slots or tap and
select remove to remove the widgets and
once the home screen is clear we can
then delete it delete the home screen
yes and that leaves us with only two
home screens of course if you run out of
space you can always add it back new
home screen and add six number of
widgets which it wise there are so many
widgets as you would be used to from HTC
devices running Android but if you have
access to Nokia Ovi Store you can
download either free or paid
applications which have their own
widgets you can add to your home screens
basically you have just a handful of
widgets coming pre-installed on the
Nokia x7 BBC News calendar CNN video e
notifications writers news so on and so
forth so let's say you want to add the e
and you want to add favorites which you
can configure later on and let's say we
want to add the music player so we've
used up three slots out of the six we
can always then move them to the top and
to the button according to our liking if
you notice the home screens have
different wallpapers and our last screen
which we have created has no wallpaper
so we can define a wallpaper just for
this home screen
let's take an image takes us to the
library and it's like this one and there
we have it
what's really nice is that there is
landscape support in Symbian if you turn
it to landscape it will automatically
rearrange the six widgets so that they
fit on screen best and you can of course
let's get back lick through them in
landscape just like you would in
portrait mode let's get back to the home
screen number one and back now of course
your home screen number one has to have
all those widgets which give you the
information you are looking for at a
glance which is most important to you
and in my case I've configured it to
have the clock together with the date
and the profile we have four shortcuts
which can be predefined we have contacts
we have internet we have the store and
we have maps we have a widget for email
we have a widget for calendar we have a
widget for social networking which
congregates all your social networks
into this one widget aggregate I'm sorry
and then we have a widget which holds up
to four or a favorite persons which you
interact with on a common basis let's
take a look at the email application
what's really nice is that you can
collapse groups by date so we have a
group for yesterday's email Sunday's
email and so on and so forth you can
either collapse all and expand one by
one or you can expand or landscape
support is also present and you have a
really nice outlook like display of your
emails with the list and the buttons the
buttons on the right and what's nice and
the new addition to Symbian
is that they have finally added a full
QWERTY keyboard let's create a new male
and here you have it full QWERTY
keyboard in portrait mode previous
versions of simian had only 89 keyboard
and when he's switched to landscape they
switched to the full QWERTY keyboard now
with Simeon Anna you get the full QWERTY
keyboard in your portrait mode so next
thing we want to take a look at is the
calendar application tapping on the
calendar widget brings up the calendar
application and by default it displays
the agenda view but you can switch to
let's say month view and what's really
nice is that if you have more
appointments for today more than the
application can display they are
bouncing up and down in order for you to
see all of them you can of course switch
to another view let's take day view and
this is your typical date view on only
if your platforms regardless if you're
running iOS Android or Windows Phone and
we got the week view which displays all
of your dates and populates with the
appointments to see where you have that
certainly spot where you can put or
squeeze in another appointment creating
the new appointment is easy new entry
and you have to enter the subject the
hours between which knee band will take
place location and so on and so forth
next up we have the social widget which
aggregates all your social updates from
from your social networks currently OB
social only supports Facebook and
Twitter out of the box so tapping on
that widget will bring up OB social and
populate the list with the most recent
updates from Facebook and Twitter if you
want to see this
cific service let's say you want to see
only Facebook we tap the back button and
we go only to Facebook and this goes
into the Facebook application which is
lacking a little bit in and features but
is is quite usable getting back to the
home screen we've got the favorite
people let's take a look at the dialer
what's really nice is that you have a
quick dial if let's say you wanna dial
Brandon you just might be our a and and
that filters by the letters which is
really good if you have many many
contacts you don't want to scroll
through the list up and down and you
want to use only one of your hands so
going through we have the Shazam
application which is installed by
default it's the free version and
supported the YouTube application is
really a shortcut to YouTube mobile so
it's nothing out of the ordinary it
brings up the mobile page form for
YouTube from there you can take a look
at a video given that video is available
for you on the mobile website and right
now we are in the browser and we have
Flash disabled but if we enable flash
you will be able to playback that flash
video here in this in this page let's
get back to the home screen like this we
have some more shortcuts and these are
widgets these two widgets are
third-party widgets one is for movie
teasers which is an application which
let's take a look at it
which basically shows you the latest
movie thrillers so you stay up to date
unfortunately it's not always working as
you can see right now let's try it maybe
later
that geo has an application which has a
custom widget yes we want to allow
connections here that's the back next up
we want to take a look let's say that
the Maps application Nokia is well known
for offering one of the best free
mapping application offerings and these
offerings are coming to Windows Phone as
part of the Nokia Windows Phone
strategic alliance basically you can
have turn-by-turn navigation for driving
and walking you have access to several
maps which are pre-loaded on the
smartphone you can check in and it
automatically checks you in with
Facebook you can update your maps and
you can even you check weather for your
current location it's really really nice
and the application is using vector
style maps let's take a look at them
these are your zoom buttons and just
just look how how fluid the animations
are you can also use pinch to zoom but
it's a little bit jerky but it works
pretty pretty well and it's also
voice-guided let's get back and
out now that we have launched several
applications we can easily multitask and
switch between them if we tap and hold
the home button we get this small cards
like webOS like in the future to be
Windows Phone like cards with the
preview thumbnails of the applications
which are currently running on your
smartphone and tapping the small X
button will close the application we
have no more applications open ok let's
take another look at the browsing
experience and for that we will use an
iPhone to compare the browsing speed and
we have pocketnow.com loaded in its
mobile version let's try to load the
desktop version on both of these and the
iPhone is off well even though Symbian
Ana says that it brings a faster web
browsing experience we haven't noticed
such a quick page loading on pages which
contain many many pictures like even
pocketnow.com and the scrolling is
rather sluggish as you will see now the
iPhone almost finished it's still
loading and the Nokia is still loading
too
and they are both still loading but on
the iPhone you can already start and
navigate while the Nokia is rather
sluggish unresponsive as you can see
we'll leave the iPhone aside because
there's no terms of comparison here now
it says it finished loading and just
take a look at how sluggish the zooming
and the scrolling is I mean I find it
unusable it doesn't react it's slow it
just seems to load forever let's just
wait wait for it to settle
that's still loading
so I wouldn't personally use Symbian to
browse the web if I'm looking to the
desktop version of the web and on this
Symbian on this web browser we have
deactivated all flash all animations of
all we have this text and images and and
it's awful to say the least
let's try to zoom back out and it's it's
still loading let's maybe try to load
the link and believe it loading it let's
see how long that takes
and it's the loading
we are on Wi-Fi right now and imagine
using this on your data connection which
is sometimes slower than your Wi-Fi and
it's still loading and processing now it
says it finished no not maybe now let's
try to flip to landscape and use it like
this zoom out huge checkerboard get bad
you just take a look at this growing I
mean it's it's not working at all okay
let's leave it like that web browsing on
the Nokia x7 maybe this is a not final
hardware with not final version of
Symbian Hana but if this will be the
final version of both hardware and
software I would not recommend you to
use anything beyond the mobile web
this was Anton denied taking a look a
short look at the software on the Nokia
x7 running Symbian Anna stay tuned for
our full review of the smartphone and if
you enjoyed this video please give us a
thumbs up thank you very much for
watching this wasn't something odd from
pocket knock down
