tablets are the best I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow
and this is the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014
edition versus the Galaxy Note 8.0
Samsung's Galaxy Note series is
particularly unique in that it offers an
incredible amount of productivity driven
features as well as hardware which
caters to that sort of use case this
time we're taking a look at two of
Samsung's latest Galaxy Note tablets the
Note 8.0 and Note 10.1 2014 edition
which is the better tablet is the Note
8.0 is compact nature enough to offset
the extra power of the Note 10.1 let's
find out on the outside these two
tablets are a lot alike yet at the same
time they're distinctly different the
Galaxy Note 8.0 is obviously much
smaller it measures two hundred and ten
point eight millimeters tall one hundred
and thirty five point nine millimeters
wide and only eight millimeters thick
the Note 10.1 on the other hand is two
hundred and forty three point one
millimeters tall 170 one point four
millimeters wide and seven point nine
millimeters thick as a result the Note
10.1 is also significantly heavier at
five hundred and forty grams the Note
8.0 is a staggering 202 grams lighter
although both tablets require two hands
for use the Note 8.0 is also much easier
to hold with one hand and use with the
other while the Note 10.1 will often be
held with two hands and used with thumbs
between February when the Note 8.0 was
announced in September
Samsung adopted a slightly refreshed
design with new materials or at least a
new finish like the Galaxy s4 the Note
8.0 offers wide radius corners rounded
edges and a hyper glazed finish around
back
the Note 10.1 is more like into the
galaxy note 3 with its hard edges and a
line faux metal trim mortifying corners
and a faux leather backing in this short
time period Samsung also took the
opportunity to upgrade specifications
across the board internally these two
tablets have almost nothing in common
the Note 8.0 comes with an X and O's
4412 chipset power-play 1.6 gigahertz
quad-core CPU it has 16 or 32 gigabytes
of storage for the micro SD card slot
two gigabytes of RAM a five megapixel
rear camera and a forty six hundred
million power seventeen watt hour
battery the Note 10.1 2014 edition comes
with the X
octa chip or two quad-core CPUs one
clocked at 1.9 gigahertz and the other
at 1.3 it has 16 32 or 64 gigabytes of
storage with a micro SD card slot 3
gigabytes of RAM and 8 megapixel camera
and a 31 watt hour battery with a
capacity rating of 80 to 20 milliamp
hours both come with Bluetooth 4.0 and
infrared but the Note 10.1 comes with
Wi-Fi AC and neither tablet has NFC
onboard the biggest Hardware difference
however is their displays of course they
differ in size 2.1 diagonal inches to be
exact but we're talking purely about the
quality of the respective panels the
note 8.0 has an 8 inch display at a
resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels that's
only 189 pixels per inch the TFT panel
offers decent color reproduction very
wide viewing angles deep blacks passable
contrast and it's quite bright but
pixelation is noticeable even from a
comfortable viewing distance this is not
a problem we've had with the 10.1 inch
2560 by 1600 pixel resolution display on
the larger note it's Super Clear LCD
display offers fantastic colors viewing
angles contrast deep blacks and it's
incredibly bright we'd wager that is one
of the best displays we've ever held
period and in the same trend of the Note
10.1 superiority trickles down to even
the finer points of the hardware the
s-pen the Note 8.0 uses the older s-pen
with a hard plastic tip it's but is
carved to the shape of the corner of the
tablet which means it's hidden and
integrated more seamlessly but the Note
10.1 location is more natural for
unsheathing the s-pen and it's easier to
locate without filling around for it its
s-pen can be inserted in two different
orientations and it's tip is made of
rubber which causes some friction this
takes some getting used to but after you
spend some time with it you learn to
like it even more as it helps with
control and stability of use think of it
as writing with a felt tip on paper
instead of a ballpoint on ice and
virtually every hardware category the
Note 10.1 is superior to its older
cousin not just because it features
better specifications across the board
but because it has been designed with
more care Samsung is tirelessly refining
the Galaxy Note brand and it shows the
Note 10.1 feels executive and premium
whereas the Note 8.0 still feels
somewhat like a toy to us the software
side of things is still in favor of the
newer larger more
awful tablet but much less so than in
hardware the Galaxy Note 8.0 originally
shipped with Android 4.1.2 missing some
of the best features of jellybean such
as lock screen widgets daydream mode and
a dedicated page within the notification
shade for toggles
fortunately the Note 8.0 has received
Android 4.2 with all these useful
features in tow the Note 10.1 however
comes with Android 4.3 the differences
between what the stock Android versions
of these firmwares come with are pretty
slim especially to the naked eye you get
trim and OpenGL ES 3.0 support in 4.3 as
well as multiple user support with
restricted profiles Bluetooth smart
ready support and additional project
butter enhancements multi-user support
is effectively killed by the TouchWiz
skin and some may argue that project
butter performance improvements are
counterbalanced by how heavily latent
TouchWiz is it's fair to say though that
the biggest difference is between the
software versions of these two tablets
are found within Samsung's own software
anyway both notes come with the most
notable TouchWiz features and bloat
smart stay s note group play Samsung
Apps Samsung hub S voice watch on etc
but there is what some might consider
fragmentation from within Samsung's own
ecosystem the S Pen optimizations are
far less prevalent on the note 8.0
holding the S Pen button and long
pressing on the display will take a
screenshot on either tablet but holding
the button at double tapping the display
will open S note on the note 8.0 but it
will open action memo on the note 10.1
removing the S Pen from it slot opens
the far more useful and accessible Air
Command pop-up both tablets also come
with the multi window feature but the
note 10.1 has some optimizations beyond
those of the 8.0 you can create preset
pairs of applications to open within
multi window and you can also drag and
drop content between applications you
can't do either of these things on the
note 8.0 these may only be small
discrepancies but they make a lasting
impression especially after you get used
to using the newer features hopefully
these enhancements will find their way
to the note 8.0 before long but for now
the Note 10.1 takes the cake
performance surprisingly enough is not
so much in favor of the Note 10.1 at
least not in day-to-day tasks opening
applications switching apps and even
using a multi window the Note 8.0 is a
half beat snappier than the note 10.1
pressing the home button brings you out
of the app
your homescreen faster even loading apps
is quicker and so is opening the
application drawer the difference is
negligible in most cases though if you
used both devices apart from one another
you probably never tell but something we
haven't been troubled with on the note
8.0 is intermittent freezing the note
10.1 has a problem with hanging mid load
more than we care to admit this is an
issue Michael have with the
International Galaxy Note 3 also powered
by the Exynos octa-core is quite well in
benchmarks and it's able to maintain
higher frame rates during gaming for
multimedia and entertainment purposes
the Note 10.1 is fantastic but it
struggles with the simple things we
credit the Note 8.0 snappiness to the
difference in pixels it's pushing only
one-fourth of the number of pixels the
Note 10.1 is pushing something else
worth noting since the 10.1 has an
additional gigabyte of RAM it is capable
of keeping more in memory for a longer
period of time the Note 8.0 has to load
some recent apps from scratch the
speaker performance on the 10.1 is
markedly better as the Note 8.0 is
bottom edge speakers are incredibly easy
to cover up entirely they're more tinny
not as loud and just don't do a
multimedia tablet any justice by no
means are the Note 10.1 speakers
terribly impressive particularly when
you compare them to the Nexus 10 battery
performance isn't bad on either tablet
to be honest the 17 watt hour battery
inside the Note 8.0 managed to last us
about a day and a half to two days on a
single charge and standby was tolerable
during a review period though in much
heavier usage you could probably manage
to kill the Note 8.0 in a single day the
31 watt hour battery inside the Note
10.1 is noticeably better in use but
it's standby leaves room for improvement
we're still testing the battery on the
note 10.1 however so look for more
detailed information in the full review
the camera on the note 8 is well there
it takes pictures but don't count on its
quality the 5 megapixel image sensor is
outpaced by most smartphones on the
market from the last two years images
like sufficient color reproduction
detail and contrast they're dull and
full of noise in just about any lighting
conditions the Note 10.1 is markedly
better at picture taking but it's not
terribly impressive either outdoors and
bright lighting conditions provide
decent vibrant pictures anything else
results in bland noisy images with lots
of artifacts
up these two samsung galaxy notes it's
pretty clear which is the better tablet
all around and it's easy to imagine how
differently this sort of comparison
would go if we were comparing the Note
10.1 to an updated Note 8 or if the 10.1
were powered by a Snapdragon 800 instead
of the Troublesome Exynos octa-core
vector and more steady performance of
the Note 8.0 or the gorgeous display and
better multimedia experience on the note
10.1 for us as much as we hate lag and
stutters the display is a make-or-break
feature in a tablet and the Note 8.0
isn't up to the challenge plus the
additional s-pen features and build
quality of the Note 10.1 seals the deal
for us that said we like the form factor
of the Note 8.0 better and we can't wait
to see what the refresh of the Note 8.0
will be like once it arrives that's all
