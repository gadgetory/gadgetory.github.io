space Samsung's first Galaxy Note was a
niche device no one thought would sell
and now the note lineup is one of
androids most prestigious properties
Google's Nexus phone began as a platform
for developers before morphing into the
affordable flagship portfolio it is
today
and last year's Moto X a smallish
handset with modest specs designed to be
a smarter smartphone has become the Moto
X second-generation
a husky powerhouse with the same soul
but in a body built to go toe-to-toe
with the best the competition can offer
how well does Motorola's special take on
Android mesh with this new Bron I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow let's find
out in our Moto X 2014 video review
we've already compared the new Moto X
with its predecessor in a separate
comparison video at PocketNow so if
you're stuck deciding between these
devices or considering an upgrade from
old to new be sure to check that out as
well taken by itself the build of the
new Moto X is a kind of fusion a
cobbling together of design elements
that results in a distinctive if
slightly kludgy fuselage the top and
bottom speaker grilles we saw on the
Moto e have been ported over and the
curved design of last year's Moto X has
thankfully survived intact it's bordered
by an aluminum frame here which brings a
somewhat spendy feel and mirroring that
metal right in the middle of the back
cover sits an expanded version of the
finger dimple that's become a motorola
trademark here it's as big as the camera
lens and while that means you'll have no
trouble finding it with a fingertip it
is big enough to seem garish the new
Moto X has also been widened to
accommodate a 5.2 inch display it's
1080p with 423 pixels every inch and the
vibrant colors and raven blacks we've
come to love about AMOLED screens are
here as well the flipside is that it's
not great in direct sunlight and the
Edit girth it demands makes the new Moto
X harder to use with one hand but it's a
big display with narrow bezels almost a
requirement for true flagship status in
2014 and the gorilla glass 3 protective
layer atop it seems to flow directly
into the aluminum border beneath it so
craftsmanship is not in question here
speaking of craftsmanship Moto maker is
still here to answer the call to
customize offering finishes from
colorful composites to wooden backs to
the HAR winged leather of our review
unit the leather looks feels and smells
like the real thing which it is and
while it does show we're quite easily it
works together with the aluminum trim to
make the phone feel more substantial
than 144 grams the spec sheet claims it
all comes together for a more memorable
feel in hand than we experienced from
its forerunner and the spec sheet is
more future-proof 2 with a Snapdragon
801 driving everything at two-and-a-half
gigahertz its raw power is right in line
with
most other top-shelf 2014 smartphones
but the Moto X has never been about raw
power and the new version continues
Motorola's focus on delivering a smarter
smartphone not just a beefier one when
it's reclining and standby the new Moto
X uses its face plate sensors to wake
the Moto display when you reach for it
that's a handy addition to the existing
trigger conditions which light up the
screen when you pull the phone from a
pocket or periodically when it's sitting
on a desk moto assist has grown a lot in
the year since Motorola introduced it as
we covered in our Moto X after the buzz
video a few months back not only does it
dictate text messages to you when it
detects you're driving a car
now you can respond to text messages by
voice as well and you don't need to be
driving anymore Assist can read your
texts aloud when it knows you're at home
or it can automatically silence your
phone when you're sleeping or in a
meeting most significantly moto voice is
better than ever before even with the
screen off you can still talk to the
phone now using a custom trigger command
what's up
the list of actions recognized by the
Moto X has been expanded to so you can
do everything from setting an alarm to
taking a selfie without ever pushing a
button or even touching the phone we'd
still like it to be faster but it's
useful it's fun and it's something you
can only find out of the box on the Moto
X it's also great for finding a
temporarily lost phone too as far as the
rest of the software we're looking at a
very clean build of Android 444 using
the Google launcher popularized by the
Nexus 5 that means big icons a bright
paint job and Google now enjoying a
permanent position on the leftmost
homescreen it's a big jump from the
older darker palette but it more closely
associates the Moto X with Google's
preferred incarnation of its software
ironic considering Google's recent sale
of Motorola Mobility in any case the
software is spare lightweight and it
flies under the
the 13 megapixel camera on the back of
the phone is notable for its distinctive
ring flash and for it's helpful trigger
shortcut a quick double flick of the
wrist and launches the camera now the
software isn't the Google camera app as
you might expect rather its Motorola's
custom build from last year with very
few changes we liked its simplicity but
the photographs it produces we can take
or leave on the bright side photos can
sometimes turn out very nicely indeed
with rich color and a fair amount of
detail especially in a 13 megapixel mode
the camera defaults to 10 megapixels so
you can shoot in widescreen instead of 4
by 3 most of the time it does the job
it's supposed to do you can coax some
great results from this camera given the
right conditions and a little luck but
the focus is too slow and it drifts too
often exposure also drifts depending on
where you're focused low-light
performance is underwhelming at best and
there's no optical stabilization either
the improvements since last year are
only marginal a shame when you consider
how disappointed we were with that
devices optics that said reality check
many PocketNow readers didn't think last
year's motox camera was that bad and
something of a blind taste test so maybe
we're making an Edsel out of an El
Camino here and on video things are
better
while colors are more watery than they
are in real life it's not as shaky as
you might expect from a camera with no
optical stabilization 4k recording and
slow-motion are here if you want them
and audio is actually pretty great
probably thanks to the four microphones
in sum the motox wouldn't be our first
choice if the camera was our number-one
priority but it's also not a total
disaster
it's just an underwhelming portion of an
otherwise exceptional package that
package brings some pretty great sound
quality to Motorola's crystal talk noise
reduction benefits greatly from the
addition of that forth microphone
resulting in much more effective noise
cancellation than on last year's Moto X
moving the loudspeaker around to the
front also makes the new phone better at
speaker phone calls and watching videos
or streaming audio while we're a little
disappointed that only one of the front
firing grills is used for a speaker we
are grateful it's a loud one with
processors so advanced it's tough to
find shortcomings in gaming performance
these days and the Moto X handles
basically any title we can throw at it
the more pressing concern when it comes
to this stuff is battery life an
embedded power pack almost the same size
as last year's and powering a bigger
denser display sounds like trouble and
frankly it is as with most modern
smartphones we can get through a day of
use on the new X but only if we're
careful now Motorola has updated some of
the software we're using during our test
period so we need to take some more time
to run the phone using the new software
to see if it helps any and we'll update
the full written review at pocket now
once we've done this overall though we
doubt this phone will ever be known as
an endurance champion the new Moto X
sacrifices some of the principles of its
forerunner in its quest to keep up with
the Joneses it's bigger screen makes its
casing more cumbersome its battery
probably less potent but those are
handicaps also suffered by the very
competitors than new Moto X seeks to
keep pace with and this phone uses its
horsepower more intelligently than many
of those contemporaries for the second
year in a row put simply it's the reboot
that not all old Moto X owners will
appreciate but it's also one that needed
to happen and for what it's worth it's
one that this reviewer has already
purchased for himself for more on the
new Moto X and its companion SmartWatch
