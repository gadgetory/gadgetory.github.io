pocketnow.com when you go to buy a new
iPad you have to choose color capacity
and carrier yes the three C's of the new
iPad in this video we're going to help
you better determine which configuration
is right for you let's get to it so
let's start off talking about color
white Heights fingerprints far better
than the black DOS however with white
you get a very defined definite border
around the screen which can help kind of
make the screen look a little bit
smaller some people say that black
actually makes the screen appear more
vast it's a matter of personal opinion
in my opinion I still like to go with
white because it hides fingerprints
very well number two capacity 16
gigabytes used to be enough space but
what we're finding now is that apps are
getting huge absolutely huge
the New York Times app is about a
hundred megabytes and it just shows
content some of the biggest games use
about two gigabytes of space if you
download an HD movie you're going to be
at about 3.5 to 4 gigabytes if you
download the high-def version if you
download a high-def version of a TV show
that's 500 megabytes so if you're doing
a cross-country flight you want to load
it up with movies and games and TV shows
you're gonna run out of space at 16
gigabytes 64 gigabytes is for people
that keep all of their music on their
iPad for most people that's overkill
that's why I went smack in the middle to
the 32 gigabyte version which suits my
needs perfectly and there's a great
balance between its ton of space and not
enough space number three carrier AT&amp;amp;T
has not as much LTE as Verizon meaning
the network is not as ubiquitous however
their fallback network their 3G network
is several times faster than Verizon's
network so if you have helped to eat in
your area
on AT&amp;amp;T definitely go with the AT&amp;amp;T
version but everyone else should go with
the Verizon version because there's much
more Verizon 4G than there is 18 t LTE
also as an interesting bonus if you take
out the micro sim on the Verizon iPad
and you put in an AT&amp;amp;T micro SIM you
will actually be able to get on to ATT's
3G network of course it says 4G at the
top but it's really there 3G network
which is great because then you have the
option to either use Verizon's 4G
network or a TN t--'s 3G network let's
say you have an AT&amp;amp;T phone with an
unlimited data plan to save a little bit
on data costs you're traveling pop out
the Micro SIM if you have a micro sim on
your AT&amp;amp;T smartphone pop it in the iPad
boom you've got that unlimited data and
you don't have to pay that fee for the
Verizon data plan
so hopefully this video was helpful for
you it's a lot of choice and it's so
it's a lot of money when you start
adding up all these options but a good
balance of all of them would be the
Verizon 32 gigabyte white version as I
mentioned in the unboxing video that's
the one that I went with that's the one
I'll be using for personal usage I think
it's the best balance let us know what
you think the best balances in terms of
color carrier incapacity in the comments
and if you like this video please give
us a thumbs up thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
