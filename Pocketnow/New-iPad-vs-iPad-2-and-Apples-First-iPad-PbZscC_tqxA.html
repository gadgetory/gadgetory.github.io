have the first generation iPad we've got
the iPad 2 and we've got the new iPad is
it worth to upgrade from any of these
let's find out if you've never owned the
tablet in the past it's kind of a
no-brainer to go for the new generation
iPad it's the only tablet that we've
ever given five stars out of five in a
review so read the link in the
description for details on why but how
about if you're coming from the second
generation iPad and you want to upgrade
or how about if you come from the fresh
generation iPad and you're thinking
about upgrading or how about if you're
considering that the iPad 2 is now in
the market for a hundred bucks less then
the new iPad which is better to buy or
keep let's find that with a comparison
trying to film three tablets at the same
time is kind of crazy so bear with me
here we've got the first generation iPad
here at the right the iPad 2 at the left
and we've got the new iPad here in the
middle other than that the devices don't
really very got the same nine point
seven inch display here nine point seven
inch display here and nine point seven
inch display here what varies here is
the resolution we've got 10 2014 by 768
on both the first generation iPad and
the second generation iPad but things
vary because we go to 2048 by 1536 on
the third generation iPad both these
devices have 132 pixels per inch and
then this one's got a whopping 264
pixels per inch the first generation
iPad had the first single core a4 chip
with normal graphics this iPad 2 has got
dual core graphics in the a5 chips this
I've had 2 was 9 times faster and
graphics than the first generation iPad
alone and then the third generation iPad
has got quad-core graphics which is
actually pretty much 4 x or we could say
twice as much as the second generation
iPad so both these devices are dual-core
devices don't be mistaken by that but
aside from that this device has no
cameras this device has terrible cameras
VGA here and then at the back it could
barely give you 720p resolution on this
camera and then here we've got the same
VGA camera up front but then we've got a
5 megapixel camera at the back with the
optics of the iPhone for us which are
quite legend there
so you can film 720p video here and you
can film 1080p here you can do FaceTime
here on this one FaceTime here
no FaceTime on the first generation iPad
so this video is your thing definitely
the first generation iPad should be out
of your league now all these devices
have 802 11 in these two devices have
Bluetooth 2.1 EDR but this one has the
new generation bluetooth 4.0 which you
could find Linde and iphone 4s and then
also in the new generation MacBook Airs
and then aside from that the other
differences are pretty much minor now if
we talked about ergonomics if you look
at them from the front there's really no
big difference unless you try to really
be nitpicky about the size because the
first generation iPad was 9.50 6 inches
tall and 7.47 inches wide in comparison
to the second and third generation iPads
which were both 9.50 inches tall and
7.31
and just wide it's a very minor
difference now where things change is in
the thickness because the first
generation iPad was point 50 inches
thick the second generation iPad was
point 34 inches thick and then the third
generation iPad is point 37 inches you
pretty much can't notice that these are
thicker that the third generation iPad
is thicker than the second but you'll
notice that you definitely I mean the
third the first generation iPad just
dwarves each of these devices if we
would compare weight the first
generation iPad for me was probably the
most uncomfortable of them all it was
the heaviest one at 1.5 pounds it had
these borders here that just made it so
uncomfortable to hold at some point that
if you didn't have a case things would
just be I don't know they were just
complicated now if we grab the second
generation iPad this one weighed 1.33
pounds and I'm trying to get rid of that
one point 33 pounds here if you went for
the Wi-Fi model and then if you went for
the Wi-Fi plus 3G model the difference
was very minor but for me the second
generation iPad was probably the best in
weight somehow Apple didn't make a big
difference in weight but they somehow
figured out weight distribution because
this device is extremely light you can
hold it in any way you can hold it this
way for example and you don't feel that
it's hurting your arm at some point for
holding it this way now if you would try
to do the same thing with the third
generation iPad then
change sadly the third-generation iPad
is 1.46 pounds in comparison to the
other devices it's lighter than the
first generation iPad obviously but it's
only a couple of ounces in comparison to
the second generation iPad so so far
I've got to tell you you do feel an
extra weight in the third generation
iPad and I feel that again it has to do
with weight distribution they have to
fit a much larger battery in this device
if you compare it to the second
generation iPad so if they're ganar
thing for you and if you're looking for
the lightest tablet out in the market
that's still being sold it would be the
second generation iPad let's talk about
performance now the first second and
third generation iPad are all certified
for 10 hours of battery life though this
is a 25 and 25 watt hour battery and
this has a whopping 42 watt hour battery
just to power the Retina display so this
device I just pulled out of the box but
it's been working for almost an hour
that I've been filming this it's already
got 99% battery life
we've got 96% on the iPad 2 and 93% on
the first generation iPad now bear in
mind this is a two-year-old device
one-year-old device and this is a brand
new device these devices are all
certified to give you like five thousand
cycles out of the box so that's pretty
much five years of battery life but you
could expect some sort of degradation
still you still get the certified 10
hours of battery but the problem here is
that because this battery's so much
bigger all these devices ship with the
same 10 watt charger so it'll take these
devices three hours to charge and it'll
take this one 7 whopping hours to charge
it'll take you ten hours to discharge it
then from 0 to 100 it will take you 6 to
7 hours to charge it again totally
defeats the purpose you probably in have
to be carrying a charger or something
all the time which makes it kind of
uncomfortable but let's try some
performance these devices of all they're
all not running any applications at the
background we're gonna try to launch
Safari at the same time it was preloaded
with pocketnow.com before so it should
launch the website again let's try to do
this at the same time though it's gonna
be kind of complicated
ah the iPad 2 went first you've still
got gear boxes here gear boxes here it's
still loading the first generation iPad
has it hasn't even loaded the sidebar oh
the third generation iPad is already
done 2nd generation iPad is still
loading things at the bottom
let's try two little things here to the
bottom they're first-generation iPad
well parking out out commas loaded fast
on each of these but sadly the
first-generation iPad is a lot slower
the gearbox is still rolling here on the
first-generation iPad if you compare it
to the other devices now let's do a
comparison with games and Infinity Blade
2 was a game that was launched for the
iPad 2 and optimized for dual core
graphics but it could still run on the
first-generation iPad though you'll
notice that things aren't the same even
though you can run it here and then
we've got the third generation iPad
which this game was recently optimized
for Retina display graphic so let's try
to run the game at the same time it's
gonna be kind of complicated but the
thing I have big hands let's try to do
it at the same time here we go
and by the way the third generation iPad
has got stunning sound sorry about that
I didn't put the depth the sound down
but these two devices are running at the
same time this one's slower but then
you'll notice a little bit of a
difference here
launching logos all is going well but
we've got one introduction here one
introduction here both running at the
same time the same introduction this
introduction hasn't even launched but
let's see it loading notice that the
introduction here launches at a
different time in a different pace and
then because this device doesn't have
the same graphics power as these and
it's not dual-core you'll notice that
here you don't have sound support as you
do here eventually it'll take a little
longer for these to get here but let's
have them run you'll notice that there
are subtitles here because this device
can't run the sound because it doesn't
have the extra processor that's what
these do so let's see the leaves load
you can see the same leaves falling here
same leaves falling we've got audio
support here
both audios are going at the same time
here you only have again you only have
subtitles graphics are good remember
that the first game that's gonna take
advantage of these graphics is gonna be
Infinity Blade dungeons which is gonna
be available soon not available yet so
both devices are running this game
really well so far now an interesting
note about streaming is the fact that
these devices this one has 256 megabytes
of RAM 512 megabytes of RAM and one
gigabyte of RAM but makes a difference
here is that this device buffer this
1080p video once and it won't buffer it
again this one took a little while a
buffer and this one is still halfway and
it won't buffer anymore so this has a
lot to do with the way that the device
handles video performance when launching
so let's try to launch this video at the
same time to look at color quality uh
I'm trying to stretch my hands here
let's see let's see let's see sorry
about that it's kind of hard to do this
at the same time it's kind of crazy to
try to review a tablet three tablets at
the same time but notice the color
quality's on these three devices there
were all handling colors and screen
brightness at the same time but even
though the third generation iPad has
warmer colors it handles this 1080p
video without lag at all no lack here on
the iPad 2 obviously the third
generation iPad is lagging now because
it's RAM doesn't allow it to buffer any
more videos so you'll notice that it's
still struggling to buffer it again if I
would try to pull this back it'll delete
everything from the buffer and start
again from scratch on the first
generation iPad and here it's buffering
again notice but I have to play the
video again now how do these three
devices handle photos well we have the
same 18 megapixel photo taken from the
same DSLR from the Lumia Nokia Lumia 900
back at MWC so this one is sorry the
second generation iPad is cooler that
even the first generation and the third
generation iPad but I noticed that the
third generation iPad handles blacks
a lot better than the other devices that
are being compared now for some reason
the rendering engine on either of these
iPads doesn't do a really good job at
handling zooming and we notice the same
problem with the iPhone 4s at the same
time now I'm gonna try to show you
something that's kind of hard to show on
camera so bear with me here all written
the display graphics worth it for the
third generation iPad well it's kind of
a mixed bag because the third generation
iPad does a better job at handling text
than any of these devices if you try to
zoom in on this text though you'll
notice that text looks just as well on
these three devices once zoomed then the
only difference is noticed whenever you
pull out from a website where you will
notice pixels and a little sort of like
grainy show up for text on these two
devices whereas on the third generation
iPad colors just pop things look amazing
but there's a very big problem here see
websites are not optimized to handle
Retina display graphics even though the
iPad does a good job of doing this with
text it can do it with imagery so again
where do the Retina display graphics
kick in they kick in when you're zoomed
out but still certain images when zoomed
out on the third generation iPad look
grainy the problem is that the Retina
display is beautiful it's gorgeous but
for anything else that's not text you
really can't notice the difference yet
so now the bottom line is definitely a
tough call if you've never owned the
tablet or you're coming from the iPad
one definitely either iPad 2 or iPad 3
are miles ahead of the first generation
iPad the second generation iPad is $100
cheaper and it'll give you certain
things that are even better than the
third generation iPad like for example
how thick it is and obviously that it's
lighter and obviously that it can handle
performance almost just as well what the
advantage that you won't take seven
hours to charge it as opposed to the
third generation iPad word there are a
lot of technologies that are sadly not
there yet
first of all battery technology is not
there yet they had to make the device
thicker and actually a little bit
heavier and obviously charging
technology is not there you have to wait
seven hours for it to charge
but other than that I feel that websites
are gonna evolve in the future to
support rented the display graphics it's
not there yet but it will happen because
Android tablets are now gonna try to
compete with this Retina display they're
gonna try to bring even better
resolutions in here so websites need to
be optimized apps need to be optimized
software needs to be optimized
everything is happening from now on and
the third generation iPad would pretty
much be future proof you'd already own a
device for a hundred bucks more
that'll already be prepared to support
what's coming in the future so in my way
of seeing it I'd go for the
third-generation iPad just because I
have the latest and greatest but again
if you're on a tight budget the second
generation iPad is no slouch this is it
for our comparison video of the third
generation iPad with the old generation
models we hope you enjoyed this video
don't forget to give us a thumbs up if
you like what you saw this is hime every
