packing.com and this is another episode
of the android application weekly in
which review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started so
this application is called angry birds
lite and it's in the beta stage right
now so unfortunately you can't get the
full version like you can the iOS but
one cool thing about this version is you
can get three extra levels in the free
version of Polish to the iOS version so
let's try the first level i'll show you
how to play it's pretty simple all you
have to do is launch these birds at one
of these objects to try to get rid of
this green little pig so we shoot the
birds and hopefully we hit something a
little bit well back can also pinch to
zoom out and pinch to zoom back in
ebuddy is a free application available
on the android market and what it allows
you to do is to chat either through
Facebook or any other IM service so what
we can do down here is go to add account
and i can show you all the different
accounts we have we have msn yahoo aim
gtalk myspace icq hives and facebook so
that's pretty cool we can add any one of
those and as you can see i have a few of
my instant messaging programs right here
so the way i can view my buddies and
also click to view my chats motion and
sound alarm is a neat application if you
want to keep track of your device let's
say you leave your device on your desk
and someone comes along picks it up well
all you have to do is arm it and if they
touch the device let's say it's set to
motion it'll activate in five seconds
and if i pick up the device
it will trigger the alarm unfortunately
it went off by the sound that time so
I'm just going to disarm it and this
application costs two dollars and
ninety-nine cents on the android market
wiki droid is a pre-application
available on the android market there's
also a paid version which is one dollar
99 cents which removes advertisements so
the cool thing about this is you have
the entire wikipedia on your device so
all i have to do is go down here and
let's say i want to search or something
let's try searching for phone and hit go
and now we'll find the phone and it
giving its me all the information that's
available on wikipedia with the paid
version you can save the pages directly
to your SD card for future reference
zedge is a free application available on
android market and what it allows you to
do is download hundreds of thousands of
ringtones and thousands of wallpapers so
if i want to listen to a ringtone before
i download it all i have to do is click
here and let's say i want to play this
perfect ringtone which i've already
downloaded we can just play this now and
it plays very quickly so we can just hit
pause or stop and if I like one of these
other ringtones all I have to do is
click here and select download or add it
to my favorites or I can't even send it
to my friends so I can also view
wallpapers and there's thousands of
wallpapers available so this has been
