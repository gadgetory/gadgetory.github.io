along with it the confirmation for a
launch date new reports claim that
motorola might innovate significantly
with moto x plus one camera and let's
talk about some cool features of the
galaxy note 4 i'm hi meri vana and if
you haven't participated in our backbone
giveaway it is ending tomorrow today's
your last day this is parking out daily
let's begin today with the official and
sad news exactly how many amazon fire
phones do you think have been sold you
are going to be shocked obviously amazon
is not providing any details but it
turns out that we have some add
information you know those statistics
that tell you which phones sell more
judging by how many phones are actually
connected it turns out that there aren't
more than 26,000 amazon fire phones
connected in the market and given that
this phone is only available in the
united states that means that yeah it is
really bad and let's assume that the
numbers are wrong if there was a error
margin here apparently the most there
could be is 35,000 phones in the market
which is terrible when Apple and Samsung
sell millions of phones on the first
week now we've got some interesting
Motorola leaks first of all with the
Moto G we got some leaked photos showing
us the whole chassis the replaceable
covers and everything we know that
specifications are going to be very
similar to the ones we currently see on
the Moto G so the moto g2 will not be
something big but then again the Moto X
plus 1 is apparently going to be very
hot the reason why is because apparently
Motorola figure out a way to give us
optical zoom on the camera of this phone
a camera of the Moto X was terrible so
it seems that aside from better optics
which we hope will give us better image
quality you will be getting optical zoom
and that's the reason why that lens is
so big so let's see what we get in the
event and if you're wondering what will
make the Galaxy Note 4 hot well a lot of
things in addition to its height and
weight and size and everything in the
middle chassis and all the stuff that we
already know it seems that samsung will
innovate with the fingerprint scanner
because yes there is going to be a
fingerprint scanner here but not just in
the scanning you will be getting that
but it seems that the company is also
considering some fingerprint gestures in
order to give you shortcuts we don't
really know exactly how they're planning
to do that or how these gestures are
going to work but
tuned like those full details on other
leaks that pertain to this as yes that
would be very cool and we've got some
leaks of the iphone 6 user manual and
yeah it does confirm the design which is
fine yes we do see that we're all the
hardware buttons are going to be and
everything and we also see something
very interesting it seems that it tells
you what date the phone will be launched
if you notice an apple events you'll see
that the exact date when the phone is
announced is the date that's being used
in the phone and it's also the day
that's being used in the manual so
apparently that will be the launch date
September 9th but the problem is that
we've never seen a black and white user
manual for the iphone so that's a little
sketchy and finally for the very hot
news of the day because these are news
Apple has just submitted a new patent
and this patent plans to bring you a new
type of flexible display it's so
flexible that it actually adapts to your
fingers when you need it meaning if you
have a keyboard being shown on the
display the display will actually mimic
the keyboard give you hardware keys
pretty much even though these aren't
sort of like the touch covers that we
see on the microsoft surface and there
is actually a texas keyboard at the
market right now that can actually do
this there is a technology already it
seems that Apple is pending this for
future of the iPhone and the iPad as the
pen say and even this technology brings
you microphone technology and it gives
you my god sound technology as well
there's a lot of detail linksys return
for full details but that leads me to
the question of the day you remember the
microsoft research details you know the
patent with haptic feedback and we now
have this flexible display technology
from Apple which would you think is
better in my case I would think that the
Apple technology is better but leave us
a comment down below what do you think
and don't forget about our black phone
