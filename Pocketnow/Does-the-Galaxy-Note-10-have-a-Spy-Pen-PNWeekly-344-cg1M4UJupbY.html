much so now that safe search is actually
not needed anymore when you're on Google
let me say that word on books
we're life I don't know so it says off
air still waiting for it I did not have
breakfast this morning by the way also I
don't mind if the live comes on and
we're in the middle of the thought so
it's sure it's better that way yeah it
means funny

gonna be great for pre-roll alright it's
almost there almost there yes there it
is we are definitely live yes I can
confirm all right giving it a little
second hello everybody and welcome to
episode 344 of the weekly from PocketNow
annex
developers recorded on Friday the 8th of
February 2019 for murder oh that one's
really tough work from cellular mergers
to cameras in your stylist potentially
it's all the technology that makes us go
and maybe it also makes us pipe I'll
talk about that a little bit later hey
it's Josh Vergara what's going on
everybody um I got mighty everything is
set up the cameras looking pretty good
so I'm doing alright we are not going to
have Jaime on the show this week I give
him a bit of a pass he has a lot of work
to get done before we all well a lot of
people are heading to New York next week
because let's just say there's a lot of
stuff that we're gonna check out right
before Barcelona so take for that what
you will we do have with us today
Brandon minimun as Jules wrote in our
script joining me today is the dad Joe
piaced of debts
Brandon hello I am playing with my new
toy this week yes it is a friend
it is a mate and it is 20 and it's
professional so it's demo that is the
pro okay it looks a little big in your
hands w if you don't mind me saying but
it just it looked like the meet 20 is
what I'm trying that's what somebody
said yeah I knew that all the time
just kidding I'm sorry you cut that are
you are you are you are you enjoying the
the phone at the very least the wide
angle in the rear right and then I mean
obviously high specs on there I mean our
our illustrious guests I'm about to
introduce and I have spent a lot of time
with the mates when you Pro actually
we're both big fans of it yeah it's
awesome the UM one of the biggest
surprises is the super macro mode it's
just unbelievable how close Union yeah
indeed well we might get a few thoughts
of that from our guest this week joining
us from New York Brooklyn in particular
is bored at work himself in a bong at a
how's it going thing thank you very much
I finally have my voice back after being
sick and celebrating my team winning the
Super Bowl yet again you notice I'm
wearing an L a hat you know it's just
kind of the game-winning buzzer beater
at uh the Celtics the other day I'm just
saying you got to take what you got to
get man and it was Rondo just say
well happened your voice why'd you lose
your voice was there like a lot stuff
going on I was kind of sick last week
and over the weekend and then my voice
was already raspy and then I watched the
Super Bowl at a bar with mostly Jets and
Giants fans in New York so it was
basically myself Sam and you know 40
other people who were rooting against
the Patriots so I was yelling I can
imagine that was I will admit you know
regardless of the outcome that was
actually a pretty good game like it was
I was on the edge of my seat most of the
time yeah it was a tough defensive
battle but we are here to talk about
other things other than folks yes yes
yes and abang as you know audience has
been on the show before we're so glad to
have it back on make sure you get into
the chat as well I do have the video
right here Jules will also be looking at
comments in the chat so make sure you
let your voices be heard and we'll go
ahead and get into our stories for this
week when we have a bit of a we have
less stories this week than we typically
do sometimes we try to really pack
everything in but we decided to sort of
get a little bit more casual with the
number of stories so we're gonna go into
a longer form discussion this week so
hopefully everybody will have plenty of
things to say and we would love to
respond to your stuff in the live chat
alright so one thing that I did want to
have Jaime talk about had he been on the
show was a recent video that he released
on pocket now and that was regarding the
razor phone - now I will do a quick
synopsis of the video you know in his
stead basically Jaime was able to
finally come back to the razor phone -
and review it after having it for like
three or so months and to explain to
everybody the reason why he hadn't done
the full review yet well if it was
supposed to be a gaming phone he wanted
the most gamer experience he could have
on that phone and it had to do with in
particular a game controller the razor
ride - mobile which I mean I did receive
a few weeks back I think right around
the end of CES we were actually able to
start using the ride you mobile the ride
you mobile has a clamp on it has all of
the buttons that you would expect from
it it does have an Xbox layouts in terms
of where the control sticks are and what
the button layout is and Jaime was super
excited to actually
try out games using the controller
whether or not his experience was why he
was expecting that's a whole different
story the bottom line here is that
Android gaming doesn't really have the
support for controllers that I think a
lot of people were expecting but that's
also kind of true for PC games and I was
hoping to get some some thoughts from
you in a bong you've used the razor
phone - you actually are into a lot of
gaming and you have hat you'd have used
that phone for extensive gaming if I'm
not mistaken yeah I have in terms of
mobile gaming which is something I'm
trying to get back into even though it's
a very big market it's one that as a
gamer I I'm not too fond of it's you
know they're not many titles that fulfil
my experience but the razor phone does
handle that pretty well you know in
terms of cooling in terms of frame rate
especially just you know playing the
games on the screen having that really
fast refresh rate does wonders now I
have also done a video on the rider
controller and it's a nice controller I
like the concept it just feels a little
bit too heavy for me when you hold it to
control itself without putting a device
on there feels heavy which is nice until
you put a device on there then it feels
like you always have to tilt it up you
know you've got this action where your
hands doing this rather than just
resting to play so you've got that with
the controller itself but it works well
it works well plus you've got remappable
buttons and all that kind of stuff in
there I think you know when you mention
support for controllers in with android
games because Android gaming is just
like Android operating system where it
is free for all aka you know Google has
not done a good job I think in saying
this is what gaming should look like on
Android you know you have to wait per
game basis for support so for tonight
just announced that now they now support
controllers for gaming on Android I
think this was probably last week so
that's I think that's where the lot of
the problem lies because you
the way Google handles Android and also
maybe gaming in particular is it's kind
of like you know hey yes a space do your
thing and there's not a lot of you know
fine-tuning or control for that because
you would think controller support was
should be baked in you know into the OS
kind of like Windows you know Windows is
pretty easy if you plug in a USB
controller you're good you're good to go
when it's PlayStation Xbox or even
something like the right you yeah and
the way that I because I did do it I did
I did my video on the right um mobile
the controller in particular and what I
was trying to the point I was trying to
get across there was that there are a
lot of games that support controllers
but what you'll notice about those games
is that it's games that make sense for
controllers you know cuz you won't have
a game like candy crush just like you
wouldn't necessarily have a game that's
like a full of real-time strategy game
on PC work really well with a controller
you would probably opt for a mouse and
keyboard in that case you know and it's
the same on Android you got to think a
little bit about what games actually
make complete sense
and even though mobile sub controller
support apparently is supposed to be
coming for fortnight and pub G at some
point it may or may not be fully
supported at the moment brandon some
thoughts from urine because like are you
are you a big gamer yourself i wanted to
ask and among a question because oh yeah
i'm trying to justify the existence of
these gaming phones and he partially
answered already but isn't it true that
a gaming phone is a good power user
phone and isn't it also true that a good
power user phone is also a good gaming
phone yeah i mean that is a very good
question because devices like oneplus
for example right which in terms of
performance is one of the fastest
performing android phones on the market
and when you gain with a oneplus when I
was in the oneplus 60 with the 845
processor it was smooth you didn't of
course have that fast refresh rate on
the on the display I think the problem
with gaming phones and gaming and
Android is that they are not enough
games at least here
to to fully justify you know picking up
a gaming phone so you know maybe if a
gaming phone we're priced cheaper like
someone like the shark for instance
where you could see it makes more sense
because now that's so specifically
focused on gaming and its price point is
say let's call it I don't care where the
shark was but it's 500 bucks then you
can kind of go okay alright I'm buying
it specifically because I want you know
this kind of performance the other thing
too is that it depends on the gaming for
so like the ROG phone from a soos is
overclocked to give you higher
performance you can overclock
performance per game so it games like
fortnight really take advantage of that
because you can boost the performance as
well as pub G itself so those are the
kind of things it's it's the minutia
it's it's it's almost similar to gaming
laptops in a sense but at least with
laptops and gaming the performance
difference is so different from like an
ultrabook
that you really want to go with that
over a gaming phone compared to a
high-end phone so I think right now
there's just not enough software to
justify that oh you know difference so
for if you were playing fortnight on an
ROG phone and then you switch to a1 plus
60 you're saying you would be able to
notice a performance difference that
would impact your gameplay I will be
able to notice the refresh rate on the
display that's the biggest thing I can I
can see the refresh rate difference and
you know it depends on how good you if
you like me who is you know terrible
fortnight people have seen my gameplay
it doesn't matter if you're a really
good for tonight player it matters a lot
because I think fortnight is
cross-platform right so you're not
playing just against mobile users right
you're playing against PC users as well
so that refresh rate comes into play
because anyone who is clearly the mouse
and keyboard is just gonna take you out
no matter what it's also a longevity
thing to write because something like
the ROG phone like I have in my hands
here there's that peripheral that is a
fan so it keeps it as cool as possible
for as long as possible so there might
be some other phones not necessarily the
oneplus but there might be phones that
actually heat up the longer you play
the more intensively you play as sushi
if it's plugged in so there may also be
that issue as well but you you bring up
a good point Brandon about the different
features that might be coming up with
gaming phones cuz I know that for myself
when I look at laptops and I want
something that is highly productive or
is potentially highly productive I tend
to look at gaming laptops first because
I know that they have the most bells and
whistles so we've had we've already
mentioned a few we have the isuzu ROG we
have the razor we have the Black Shark
there was actually the Nubia at CES are
there any particular are there any
particular features in a gaming phone
that you are really sort of clamoring
for what would be that killer feature
that a gaming fund potentially has that
you would want out of there either of
you guys it's gotta be the refresh rate
like an among said I mean because in
terms of like thermal performance and
cooling I think a lot of phones have
gotten really good at it in terms of
battery life a lot of phones have gotten
really good at it speakers you know
front-facing speakers are kind of a
necessity but a lot of phones have just
such loud speakers now I mean that it
pretty much leaves refresh rate then
that makes the difference that makes a
gaming phone a gaming phone for the
hardcore players so do you think that
like the cooling systems haven't exactly
I proven themselves as a killer app or a
killer feature rather I should say I
mean personally when I use any one of my
phones and I've got a lot around here
they regardless of what I'm doing they
don't heat up like phones used to they
have done they do a really good job at
staying cold granted I'm not playing an
hour a fortnight but um I can't I can't
imagine that having a fan on the back of
a phone makes a tremendous difference
then again I might be totally wrong
about that I I think to me cooling does
play
I think Android phones do a better job
because the iPhone does not cool well
even though just just because the last
time I did a gaming video in the iPhone
in five minutes it started just getting
warm Android phones do a better job
because most people are now using you
know liquid cool you know
cooling on you know the semiconductor
and I think he with the allergy foam
with the fan my experience it's done
it's done well I think I've played for
maybe about thirty minutes so so and I
noticed a difference that a you was just
you just felt cooler like it actually
felt like a well-ventilated PC build
where you put your hand in there and
it's just like cool air as opposed to
just heat from your your thermals you
know blowing up so I think that is
important but for me it's it's games
more than anything else then because
gaming phones you remind me of
it says hardcore gaming and just like
gaming pcs the problem is there are no
games that take advantage I mean a lot
of games are mobile games out there
they're new games every day but you
don't need a gaming phone for those
right it's it's tap here swipe here do
this do that as opposed to anything
that's pushing the performance you know
of these of these devices especially be
the kind of chips we're having we know
how good the 8:45 was 855 is supposed to
have you know much better performance
Apple has a really good chip on theirs
too as well and so it's Huawei and but I
don't see games that take full advantage
of quote-unquote you know they say these
can replace desktops but I'm not seeing
the performance they're games that can
do that
and that's that's what I want to see
okay I've made the point a couple of
times before lad like the what I when I
find so cool about mobile gaming is that
we're getting so many ports of classic
games like Final Fantasy games Dragon
Quest or some other good ones all the
tell-tale games you know are IP to
telltale as a company but the what I
love about that is that I could take a
phone and just tell people who are
looking to get into any forms of gaming
and they wants to play some of the
classics that you can actually do it on
your phone like can you imagine back in
the day you could have played Star Wars
Knights of the Old Republic on the go
like that bad that blows my mind and I
absolutely love that and that's and that
was kind of the point that I was trying
to make that there are some really
amazing games that are coming out now on
Android
Ragnarok game is an example actually
I've been playing ass
all nine actually think that's a great
game too and there they are awesome but
don't forget about the classics also
because this is like the perfect bed for
those kinds of things just before we get
into our next topics I just have a
couple of final thoughts I wanted to
bring up a couple of alternatives I'll
show mine off of quick and then Anna
bond I'm sorry if I didn't tell you
about this earlier but I wanted you to
show off that SteelSeries because I've
been getting advertisements for that
SteelSeries and that looks really dope
too I kind of want to check it out
myself
he should told me it's somewhere around
you don't know it's it's on the other
table that's all I mean I could I could
go grab it
I mean if you want okay while you do
that I'm just gonna show off this one
here the this is one of my favorites
actually this is probably my favorite
controller of all time this is a SNES
controller retrofitted with analog
sticks that also has shoulder buttons
everything that you could ask for at the
very least this is one of the best
switch controllers that you can get but
it works for PC and Android I'm actually
doing my video on this once a day this
is the 8-bit do SF 30 Pro I freaking
love this thing and and abang said
earlier that the riot mobile is a little
bit beefy so too chunky this thing
travels like this thing is awesome
I would bring this with me everywhere so
she would this meet book that I'm using
a really nimble classic gaming setup
yeah but then there's this new one brand
new one that just came out that I think
looks pretty sick yeah it's the
SteelSeries controller this is it right
here it's a bit dull in terms of lookers
it's all it's almost like black on black
really but it's got more of the
PlayStation layout which I'm not the
biggest fan I'm just used to the
opposing layout like that it's a
comfortable controller to use though and
you know it's got bluetooth Wi-Fi it's
got a USB dongle which on PC it's best
to plug it in via the USB dongle you
just get better response times and
bluetooth you can have some bluetooth
interference because this is proprietary
Wi-Fi signal battery life has been good
and on mobile it's it's it's old it
works well it works well on with every
PC game I tried I think I tried about
six games so far plugged in it works
well mobile as well works pretty good
and it it it also had it doesn't have a
cradle like the right you
these attachments you can buy it's a
think like ten bucks which you can use
as a cradle with it but I do like the
controller so far and I've been using it
on my PC games even though I can use my
xbox controller but I'm using a PC games
lately so far yeah
I'm so sorry Brandon I mean I know that
we're the gamers over here having their
little side discussion you guys are so
lucky that you have the time to play
games
we don't know I don't have absolutely I
do not have the time we just this is
what an enthusiast sounds like when they
have or rather a junkie sounds like when
they can't get what they want I'll put
it this way I have Resident Evil 2
installed on my xbox that's it
I'm stopping God of War listen let's
never go there and I just installed
division 2 beta yes there was also that
I don't want to get too far off topic
but like they also have the the new
battle royale game that I actually kind
of expected yes oh yeah I did try it out
for 10 minutes I mean it's free I mean
how could I not try it
well yeah see this is Brandon this is
what gamers sound like when they can
game as much as they want oh man okay so
um I did have a couple of final thoughts
on there but actually you know what when
we go and move into our next story so
with all of the games that are coming
out on Android and on all of these
smartphones they can be rather large
even classic games like Star Wars
Knights of the Old Republic takes up at
least two gigabytes of storage so that
might be a bit of an argument that
storage is going to be like the next
frontier and apparently there are
already some manufacturers that are
creating phones with up to one terabyte
of on-board storage not even anything
that has to do with SD cards or anything
like that this is on board built-in
storage now we've already talked a
little bit I think it was last week or
the week before that the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 may have this kind of storage
option and we did talk a little bit
about how if that actually makes sense
or not well we'll rehash that discussion
a little bit here but there was one
manufacturer called smart smart is M I
don't even know if I'm pronouncing that
correctly but I just I mean allowed me
to be 12 years old first eye game I just
thought it was a really fun
name the name of their phone was the nut
r1 so I mean what phone are you using
using the nut
I thought it was fine anyway if you were
to take a phone from this company which
unfortunately it's not really around
anymore they they had I guess had too
much overhead maybe they went too hard
too fast or too too early rather and
they just like used up all of their
funds but potentia this was a phone that
was supposed to be about $1400
well the snapdragon 845 8 gigabytes of
ram but one tear by a view FS 2.1
storage that's that's a lot of that's a
lot of storage and it seems like they
threw a lot at the wall for this phone
and it kind of makes me remember do you
guys remember Li Eko yeah I mean their
whole situation was a little bit
different though because they did they
had a phone and then they tried a whole
lot of other things and then it ends up
being way too much for them and then of
course now we have what we have when it
comes to Lika which is nothing but would
you have a like without even thinking
about Samsung potentially doing this
with the s10 they as the rumors are true
the many variants of the s10 that might
be announced pretty soon would you
actually want a phone with that much
storage in it would it actually would
you actually use it is that something
that you would be willing to pay for it
yes oh really
okay well Brandon seems like you had a
yet a counterpoint I'm curious why I
know Vaughn says yes but I was going to
say it's really not intended for us you
know we take for granted if we want to
stream an entire album we stream it if
we want to you know download YouTube we
just watch it but in a lot of parts of
the world data is very expensive and not
available and much slower and so you
need to store a lot of stuff locally if
you want to have media consumption so
for a lot of people listening and a lot
of people in the u.s. 1 terabytes just
completely unnecessary because you can
just get stuff from the cloud and stream
and download but for a lot of people in
the world they don't have that luxury
hmm I kind of agree with you there I
mean we actually have a comment just now
andreas new Mert I'm gonna say 1
terabyte for 8k recording that's if
phones could even do a K in the first
place like we're not quite there yet for
coding sure but how much of that work
morning what are you actually gonna do
wait I mean true I definitely agree with
Brandon I think that's a very good point
but also here you think about it you
know the rumors are that the
front-facing camera would do 4k the rear
camera we do HD are 10 recording so if
you do nation are 10 recording that's
already bigger just smile sighs hello
and then you you add in the fact that if
you know we were at Qualcomm event and
they talked about bouquet recording as
well that would be a bigger file size
than just regular 4k recording so
already you're looking at things that
will just eat up more space and I do
like the fact that as a user I can hold
my own content that's how I think in
general is that whatever content I want
to watch whether it's something that I
have to pre download or I can record my
own stuff I don't have to ship it to the
cloud I don't have to pass it on and I
think that makes a whole lot of sense
for a lot of people plus in my case I'm
a creator so recording and having enough
space is always great
well and I agree with you there like I'm
one of those people that like is really
into vlogging with smartphones I've
actually never with with current options
in Android I've never run out of space
on a phone to the point where I was
actually like kept from creating my
content so I guess I guess for me it's
I'm never going to complain for having
more I'm never going to complain that
one terabytes there and if I do get a
one terabyte phone let's say in the
review unit then fine I'll try to use it
as much as I can it'll be there but I
just there's this one problem that I
have with this whole thing it's that
there's this huge price disparity when
it comes to storage options in
smartphones you have a company like
Samsung that is going to make I mean
they're they're phones are already
famously expensive at this point but a
one terabyte option could be like $1600
or we don't even know how much it might
end up being meanwhile you have 256
gigabytes of an equivalent type of phone
from Samsung that might be $1,000 from
oneplus that's only like $600 like what
is what is justifying the price point
for some of these people when we have
storage options from like Apple that are
also super expensive as well
like there's this price disparity that's
so crazy to me and if you want to have
the best of the best
seems weird that we have one terabyte
storage options that might be way more
expensive than any of the other
equivalents I think it's simple though
the the just building that one terabyte
fab right now according to reports they
just started which means it's just going
to be expensive because this is the
first set of one terabyte fibers that
are coming out for devices so Samsung is
going look we're not gonna sell as much
one terabyte devices so we can jack up
that price at justify the cost most
people are gonna buy a what 256 or you
know whatever is that 128 256 price
range buffer there but for those who
want it you know to me I would see that
you know the reason they also that
mentality works well is if you look at
what they did with the galaxy notes a
lot of people a lot of note users
probably went with the 512 I'm guessing
because I know a bunch who did who
bought because note users are considered
power users and they go look I want that
storage I want that use case it might
not work well for the SS line but I
think you know hey if you're building it
right now and they're creating there's
one terabyte memory fabs then it's just
going to be expensive because it's the
first line that's coming up they're the
first ones doing it anyway no one else
is you know what I find funny is like I
feel like these features including one
terabyte hard drives are gonna be things
that we see on phones phones always get
the first thing because I just received
one of hallways media pads and it has
mid-range specs I'm in keep thinking to
myself why don't we put high-end specs
in a tablet or in a different form
factor where it might make more sense
for the type of niche user that wants to
pick that up
who needs that power in that maybe they
don't use it every single day but when
they do use it they do need that power
they need that storage they need that
media and I find it funny that this is
the kind of stuff that we get on our
phones which end up becoming so
expensive but we never see those
features anywhere else what's
interesting is that people associate
high storage with future-proofing for
some reason and they're willing to pay a
significant premium you know they think
I'm just going to get a you know a
tremendous amount of space for some
reason I might need it in the future I
don't want to have to get a new phone
18 months so I'm just you know willing
to pay a lot for one terabyte I don't
know why I need that but you know I'm
gonna I might need it I think I think to
your point Josh is the fact that to be
honest the only time you see this kind
of big memory jumps are within laptops
and cell phones do two things you use
the most tablets just are not that
effective because you need to add
accessories to fully use that tablet
doesn't matter what's happened it is
your cell phone you pull out of your
pocket you use it right there
your laptop you open it you start doing
whatever work you want to do the tablet
has a form factor is one where even with
Apple right with the the new iPad so
many people read about it but if you
look at people's productivity setups
they are like three dongles couple
attachments before you start even doing
any work so I think that's why it makes
sense for like laptops and cell phones
because those are the things that
immediately you will pick it up and you
start using that device and you go okay
yeah this make sense yeah I mean and I
see where you're coming from with that I
do totally agree it's just I couldn't I
could not stay away my my disappointment
once I turned on that tablet like oh
yeah bigger screw all this dick like
what was it uh the picker in 600 or
something I he definitely wasn't the
latest one but yeah a couple of people
in our chats Mark C 609 is supporting
your your thought v 512 gigabyte no nine
so there you go keep John walk even
though he had a 64 gigabyte Note 8
before that so big jump up there our
previous commenter andreas new merit
hopefully again I'm saying it right
lossless audio formats offline title
support libraries or title playlist
libraries that's true like lossless
audio I've not gone into it whatsoever
so I that you know raw file raw photo
file editing rough raw photos also that
might be a big thing as long as it
becomes an option in more of our cameras
so I get it there is going to be this
demand but I don't feel like most people
kind of understand that at least not yet
but it's up to a company like Samsung to
appease literally every type of user so
I guess that
kind of explains it there um all right
so wherever the Samsung Galaxy S 10
might end up it might be on any pretty
much every carrier I mean that's the
case when it comes to Samsung but there
might be one less that Samsung has to
worry about at least over the next three
years because there's a bit of a merger
that's supposed to be happening t-mobile
and Sprint are on their way to become
one entity and from the article that is
over at pocketnow.com what I notice here
is that they're calling it the new
t-mobile so I'm like okay fine like
that's fine just keep Sprint's just
going to let go by the wayside but one
thing that is great about this is that
John Legere who I think has done some
great stuff during the uncarrier era of
t-mobile has pretty much said that over
the next three years which is
potentially how long it will take for
these two carriers to actually merge
properly lead ledger ledger as Jules is
okay John ledger we all die computing
the share anyway so even though D even
though a decrease in competition in the
general carrier mark you might mean that
prices actually go up what John I'll
just say John is trying to do is freeze
prices to where they are right now for
any customers that are on spring and
customers that are on t-mobile so that
over the next three years while the
mergers actually happening their prices
are not going to go up as a result of
all of it so one thing I want to ask
what quake is doesn't you we all saw the
uncarrier stuff happening I remember
there was one story that I have when the
first two uncarrier moves actually
happened I think it was bin John I
actually got to go to a concert that
t-mobile put up and it was Zedd Little
John and Bruno Mars I can't believe I
was actually super happy that I got to
go to that one at the LA amphitheater it
was so awesome they've been doing some
pretty awesome stuff and I want to get
some thoughts from you guys about like
where t-mobile has gone what they've
done to like change the carrier
landscape what carriers are you on even
an toboggan Brandes I am on AT&amp;amp;T really
honey okay I'm on t-mobile okay so
you're on t-mobile
I'm the only one who has fully converted
to Google Phi I guess I mean as much as
I love t-mobile I mean I just couldn't
justify having two different lines but
okay so with 18 T being your carrier
Brandon like have you seen have you have
you as a customer outside of what
t-mobile has been doing have you has it
been enviable in in any fashion like
have any of the things that t-mobile has
done as the uncarrier like made you want
to jump ship absolutely and I kind of
lost track of all the stuff they were
doing I tend to remember there was like
unlimited music streaming there was just
so many little things and t-mobile is
less expensive if you compare apples to
apples with AT&amp;amp;T a while ago t-mobile
had this test drive where they would
send you an iPhone 5s and you could use
it for several weeks and see like you
know how data speeds were and how call
quality was because before that t-mobile
had a poor reputation in terms of
reliability so I did the test drive and
I was like hmm Tebow was less expensive
let me see how the coverages and I kid
you not in this area in Southeast
Pennsylvania most of the time t-mobile
did not work indoors which is you know
kind of a problem because I'm a human
being and I go inside sometimes so it
was a non-starter I'm sure it's gotten
better since then but I I would love the
switch to t-mobile I could probably save
hundreds a year but I stay with AT&amp;amp;T
because their their coverage here is
bulletproof yeah I know the coverage
thing is always a question that was the
reason why I was on Verizon for a
certain amount of time even being in
even being in Greater La like coverage
was very spotty for both 18c and
t-mobile which is why Verizon will
always kind of have a soft spot for me
in terms of just their overall LTE
coverage but in your case in abang being
in like Metro like New York City there's
an t-mobile kind of king out there
yeah t-mobile is Lord and and reign
supreme in New York yes here this
bonkers I've been a t-mobile customer
since 2003 my superior spring customer
and Idol
after some uselessness which spreads but
you know Brandon's right t-mobile's had
it's its rough days one of the things
they did was when they eventually did
their full 40 rollout instead of just
HSPA+ is they did it the right way by do
you know basically by going for by for
my mo and the biggest thing now that has
helped them is they now have a 600
megahertz bandwidth so that of course
because basically the reason why I just
didn't work in apartments is because
higher bandwidth is almost like just
call it higher levels it's higher in the
cloud and it's lower plus when they buy
Sprint's and get all that WiMAX
bandwidth for 5g it would be insane
that's what they're good for
that's really why they want sprint
because they've just got this bundle of
stuff not this was the customers but
about that bandwidth that they can push
now in terms of all the benefits as a
t-mobile customer now it's it's kinda
it's kind of customary to just expect
something new from them you know cuz I
can stream Netflix free without using in
my data I can stream my music as well I
the other benefit is is if I'm flying on
any airline that uses Google Wi-Fi I
don't have to pay I can just connect
with t-mobile I miss that and it was it
says it says only text me you can send
text messages to people but you actually
can browse the web so it's just a quick
cheat for anyone you just basically log
in with your team enroll and you can
browse the web with it so those kind of
things they've done well and of course
the contact the t-mobile Tuesday whether
you get to win stuff discounts of movie
tickets I think they've done a lot of
things to ensure that even though
they've had gaps in service in certain
areas that customers feel very welcomed
which is plus again you're looking at
the price that they actually portray but
in places like New York I still live in
Boston t-mobile has just been really
good in terms of service where my AT&amp;amp;T
foreign
my gigabit LTE speeds here I get up to
highest of learners about 220 I think in
New York for downloads uploads around
100 how much how much do you pay and how
many how much data do you have for that
price I've got an older plan to pay 70
bucks
unlimited I used to be I've got that old
that mean my old old plan was like 50
bucks
unlimited I wish I still had that one
but it's 70 bucks in limited data and
the only thing that's capped is my
tethering which is yeah 10 gigs yeah I
think I remembered I think that was
exactly the plan that I used to have
before we had people in the chat talking
a little bit about carriers abroad and I
wish I if there was one thing that I do
wish Jaime was here for was the
discussion on that cuz I wanted to hear
what carriers or like out in Honduras
which is obviously where he is right now
but if I could just shine a little bit
of a light on what it's like outside of
the US I do know that carrier incentives
like what t-mobile's trying to do what
the uncarrier moved me and all that
stuff it's actually really common in
many other countries like for example in
now I'm not gonna get into any of the
actual like social political like
implications of this but there are
carriers in the Philippines that will
literally give you free data you don't
have to pay for anything if you're only
browsing Facebook so we don't to get
deeper into that I'm just saying that
that is a thing
so carrier incentives are not or nothing
new they're kind of new to the u.s. I
will admit t-mobile is kind of
pioneering all of that but one last
question before we get into our break
before we get to our last couple stories
after the break
do you get any worries about monopolies
with this with this kind of stuff you
know because we're seeing the loss of an
old old company like Sprint being merged
into something and now it's going to be
t-mobile and even bigger company after
that does that does monopoly or
antitrust stuff ever worry you guys with
this I mean I think in my case it does
because you only have now you've just
got a big three right you've gotten
mobile Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T and you know
who's to say that the cats
together to you know set things a
certain way especially with 5g coming
because you know I remember when we I
don't think you were there but I was at
Qualcomm and they were talking about 5g
and how it is cost-saving for carriers
um the the way they needed a break that
was like hey look because of this you
know just one aspect of five Jesus
speeds because of how fast it is it you
know the fact that you can go in and
download that one gigabytes movie or to
do buy movie from Netflix so quickly and
get off the network allows for other
people to jump on so it literally
streaming like streamline the process
for the carriers and this should
actually be spending less money but we
do know very well that that's not gonna
happen and again we the kind of
bandwidth that 5g produces are we gonna
see that switch to you know homestyle
internet pricing or are they gonna now
give us different weird tiers
now this becomes harder when you only
have three companies instead of four or
you know more companies that provide
competition where it's now three aware
you know if 18c sets a price that is
somewhat okay Verizon will just match
and then t-mobile my just offer slightly
less you know even though it's not
necessarily price-fixing but now you
just got this thing where all the prices
are somewhat similar and not necessarily
anything worth jumping or saying oh I've
got a really good deal here I can move
mm-hmm any final thoughts from your
Brendon before we get to our break yeah
I was gonna say it does concern me about
monopolies in this industry because
unlike any other industry it's not
welcoming to competition because you
can't just wake up one day and say I'm
gonna start a carrier you'll need tens
hundreds of billions of dollars and it's
just like it's virtually not possible in
other industries you know whether it's
mobile phone operating systems or PC
hardware or really anything else if you
really wanted to you could get into an
industry if you had enough funding but
to to create a carrier to
with AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon is quite literally
impossible and so it does make me
nervous that these guys with the big
power will have too much power and not
the benefits of a market economy where
other people can come in and compete
yeah I agree the well we're gonna see
we're gonna have to see what happens I
mean even then after after three years
we don't know what's going to happen I'm
just going to be a bit of a pessimist
and say probably the prices are gonna go
up anyway in three years but at least
until then you might have the prices be
where they are
you're right though Brendan like the
people can't just wake up and just like
try to become a carrier like there was
literally one business here I just want
to this is funny that's why I just want
to say real quick
there was one business here that tried
to open up to give fiber internet to
people to call giggle fiber that that
building is now a doughnut shop let me
just say that all right so we're gonna
go ahead and jump into our break before
we get to our last couple of stories the
PocketNow weekly is brought to you by
swap up where you can browse from a huge
collection of gently used tough phones
all right let me do that one more time
the pocket net weekly is brought to you
by swap where you can browse from a huge
collection of gently used phones all
that price is significantly lower than
you'd pay for them new every phone on
swap is in very good condition with no
screen damaged are certified to have
clean ESN sand ship for free browse for
your next phone at swap accom alright
Brendan I know that you have as usual
you have to get out of here in a few
minutes so I just wanted to check in
with you real quick we do have a couple
of stories that are coming up but if you
have any general thoughts that you
wanted to share with us go for it now
hmm because if not I have questions
pertaining to the last two stories that
I want you to answer okay um just trying
to think if there's anything I want to
say about them 820 Pro because I've been
oh yeah what amazes me about just a
couple of test totes about the meet 20
Pro is how how small it is relative to
its screen size
you know it's just and I've small hands
and it just it feels so good that it's
just such a good foam really everything
about it I think the like you know
everyone praises the heck out of this
phone especially high me and I could see
why it's it's blisteringly fast the
hardware's impeccable the charging is
unbelievably fast the camera you can do
so many creative things with it I'm
really glad I got it I could see why
people loved it so much so I'm really
I've been really happy to try something
different in the last week so yeah have
you been spending a lot of time with
that wide-angle camera like gives us the
first wide angle that you've used or it
can't be huh I've used the wide angle on
LG phones I think I think it's great I
mean wide angle should be standard on
every phone and it's probably going to
be you have any thoughts on EMU I
actually because I know the software
tends to be a polarizing feature I
really don't like it
like it's forget it's forgivable because
it's clean and light and it feels a
little bit like iOS but you know it's
nice and they did a good job with the
gesture system it's not as good as
oneplus but it's pretty damn close and
you know it's colorful and I mean it's
just fast so you kind of forget about
the iOS ness of it yeah I gotta say I'm
really excited to see what Wally has to
bring to MWC I have associate er that
meets when you Pro has like you know
just really wowed so many people I mean
we clearly have a p-series phone that's
supposed to be coming up so I wonder
what they're gonna bring out the
woodwork there anyway you have a few
minutes left so I do want to ask you a
couple of quick questions and then we're
gonna expound upon them while in a bong
and I do the last two stories so okay
the last two stories that we have the
chance been going crazy about it already
yes there is this idea that the s-pen is
going to have some sort of camera in it
there's a patent that Samsung was just
granted that would potentially put a
camera inside of that little stylus
harkening back to all of the James Bond
/ superspy stuff like would you actually
want a camera in your S Pen Brandon
because you you were a fan of the no 9
for a bit I remember what a camera
actually adds to that
variance um if they can get the optics
right and the battery life I think it
would be actually really cool because
you can take it anywhere that a phone
might be too cumbersome to take so think
of like a concert or like a family event
just to take you know a camera in your
pocket that's the shape of a pen I mean
it's super lightweight you'll problem I
mean if it's any good which probably
won't be because how do you fit good
optics in there if it's any good you'll
be taking more pictures with it because
you can take you could put it around
your neck as a lanyard or stick it in
you know in your jeans you have that
little second pocket you could stick it
in there
and it's just more more opportunities to
take pictures if you don't have to lug
around your you know your your regular
you know 6.5 inch screen phone well okay
and you know what now that you brought
up all those points we'll just get into
the greater discussion and then Brandon
you can you can pop out whenever you
need but like you just talked about all
of these scenarios where a camera inside
of a really easily pocketable pen would
work but what situations would you
actually want to take a picture using an
S Pen like that like that's my question
I'm a little bit flabbergasted as to why
Samsung would even think that this is a
practical feature situations where you
don't want to lug around your phone
let's say you're going on the jog and
you should take your S Pen on the jog
for some reason and maybe you see like a
nice mountain or something and you
didn't bring your your you know your
your phablet phone essentially because
it jostles around in your pockets while
you run so anyway I'm gonna drop off
there guys go for it alright thanks for
doing that guys alright so Hanna bong s
fan camera actually you know what before
we get into that any any general thought
she wanted to share it's I like check-in
because we haven't seen you in a bit
oh well let me ask you the S Pen one
because it's just it's still in my head
the camera is not for taking photos it's
for better it's better optic
coordination with the tactile screen on
the
on the display so you can actually write
better it's got it's basically position
point sensing so it's gonna be pointing
towards the tip so that I can see yeah
that's what the cameras for I mean is
really is that my agent actually is has
I actually happened in no no one started
I just but because you're not going to
be able to fit any sensor size that is
worth a dime in that S Pen size so
that's why it's best for that because
it's all about it's basically the camera
or it may not even be a camera it might
be that camera sensor that is literally
just on understanding where it is in
touching the screen pressure point
writing when you lift off those kind of
calculations so that as you're writing
you be you should be getting smoother
writing strokes or drawing more
precision besides all the pressure
points as well okay we may never use it
because they just were officially
granted this patent and it's you know
whatever yeah I mean we have months and
months before the note is even a noun so
we don't even know what the s-pen is
gonna be like but the thing that makes
you sad if you look at this patent
diagram where's the clicky top like
that's by far the best part about the
s-pen I don't see you know clicky top on
here so I'm disappointed today 10a now
that says light entering unit though
like and it doesn't it doesn't seem to
come up you know yeah but also I guess
if you look at the patent imaging this
is from the galaxy know what five that
well that that particular - yeah so
again the patent was just officially
granted doesn't mean that this is it or
it will come or this is how it will look
like it's just what's they're trying I'm
at least were they trying to do but I
think again it just all depends it
depends on you know what it would be
used for and I think we'll have to just
wait and see but I don't think this is
something that um you know is is for
taking photos that way you know well I
mean Jules's azing
edgeless like because he's saying in the
chat here that the s-pen already seems a
good enough on its own but obviously
putting a camera in it would make some
noise and obviously people all these
companies want to be as newsworthy as
possible every time the cycle comes out
but yeah it's weird because like okay so
Jules has the the patent diagram up
there right now the the optical system
seems to be pointing outward it's not
like you hold it like a kind of a pen on
me but oh so yeah it's it's it's this
right the flat side right like it's it's
this side right and they're pointing
that way to take a photo right
oh no I well I thought it would looked a
little bit more like the neuralyzer from
men in black where it's holding yeah oh
yes so this way it sticks yeah I mean I
guess which is why they might have had
to tie the clicky bit by I mean yeah I
mean what-what would even use that for
like aside from just like the like hey
look I've got a camera yeah I mean when
it was the note 5 this would have been
cool because it's just saying that oh
now I've got something I can I can take
a photo or but again it's a patent like
everybody gets patents approved you know
every day and it's I don't I don't I
don't think this is something they will
throw in just because what I think we
know is coming out on the galaxy s 10
that is gonna be transferred to the note
is it Lots it's a lot of stuff so I
don't think that you know having that
camera there plus the the cameras that
are gonna be on the s10 are gonna be
just so improved
which would be the same camera system on
the note which you know slightly
improvements what's the point of having
this I think they were just granted a
patent and then everybody's just
overthinking it that's a yeah probably
but that that is that it's kind of part
of our job descriptions being in the
industry but also there are a couple of
people in the chat and they bring up
some pretty interesting points if the
s-pen oh sorry
flame off yeah la can't even speak right
now Frank
Clow plowin if the s-pen cam will kill
the front cam then let's go for it no
cutout for the screen would be nice but
like you would take out the S Pen to
take a selfie yeah
so either you do this or you do hey hold
up a second hold up this that's that's
where the you know I mean that's already
too much work by the way did everybody
see that just now did everybody see Anna
bong with that weird flex just now you
just showed off that super special note
9 in his hand right yeah
none of the only people we know who has
the Casey Neistat edition I wasn't
trying to flex at all it's just it's
just what I use this is my daily driver
itself I don't blame you I don't get me
whatsoever that's such a cool it's free
nope nice yeah no you asking what I
wanted to talk about that was in the one
thing no story after this oh yeah go for
it if you have any option where you want
to talk about story that came out that
said Microsoft is looking to put Xbox
Live on iOS Android and the switch and
it happens to what they're trying to do
this year which again is low riding so
we have streaming game services this
shadow which after I want to check out
which allows you to play on your PC your
smartphone supposedly we've got M video
and video streaming service that allows
you to do that as well but Nvidia's is
only you know per PC you can so I can
stream I tried that out and I had a
video where I played she recalled due to
World War two on MacBook Air and I was
doing 180 frames per second at 1080p so
Microsoft is trying to do the same thing
because word is this year they're going
to release a streaming xbox 100 bucks
that you can stream all your games
directly to it and you know with
everything that's going on this is this
is this very big strategy that Satya
Nadella had is you know we build out our
cloud services ur right now you know
cloud is big for Microsoft a lot of game
developers are using Azure servers for
their game development and
cross-platform play so the reason why we
fired this big boom of course battlin
plays because it comes from Microsoft
sir
so Microsoft is owning that so look at
the strategy if they are owning that
then releasing a streaming Xbox makes a
lot of sense now and then you add to the
fact that if I can now play now we
talked about gaming phones if I can now
play those Xbox games on a razor phone
or something like that on the go and
continue from where I stopped at home is
even better yeah and I think that size
to be interesting things to see it's in
this one Sony tried to do this with the
PlayStation now service 10 day and well
not not that they had a streaming what
they did the pleasure yeah no didn't
know they do have a streaming service no
stream said you can stream your
PlayStation game from home to a laptop
exciting Xbox can only do streaming
within the home so I can stream from my
xbox a I'm playing Resident Evil and say
I have someone watching more than once
watch TV I can stream you to my PC here
and you know continue to game so you can
do it in home but this is not just in
home this is in home any device this is
why they want to move Xbox Live to as
many even the switch as many devices as
possible and it's a very interesting
strategy of saying forget the hardware
race software is where it's gonna be at
right and not just software in titles
but software and how you deliver those
titles I agree
and that's a great prospect I mean it
would be the way to actually and this is
the reason why Hydra genius is because
that would actually be the way for me to
get into Xbox stuff I've never been an
Xbox player but if it was that
accessible maybe a subscription service
something like that maybe I would
actually do it or they already have a
subscription service service way it's a
$20 a month for Xbox one S Plus Xbox
Live and then I think it's $40 a month I
could be wrong somebody correct me for
the Xbox one X so I can see so when they
started that a lot of people kind of
like ah why I'm like this is the plan to
to get you to just subscribe to the
streaming box it's 100 bucks you either
pay for that at me
and you're done and then you pay like
$20 a month for for all access to Xbox
games so it sounds like you're kind of
into this like potential future of ours
we're like let's say you have a low-end
PC but you have the streaming service
and great internet you could still play
triple-a titles yeah I mean you paint
really titles at 1080p I mean me
personally I would still have the Xbox
that does the aka at home because I have
to but but I think for everyone else
like you said for someone like you you
can now go okay yeah I'll get the
streaming box to play the Xbox no
problem or I'll just pay the $20 a month
and I can play on my phone I can play on
my my laptop and it doesn't matter what
laptop I have at this point now right
because you just streaming exactly you
know I can I can do that and and then
when you're not adding 5g to that whole
aspect you know down the line when I had
senior 2021 where at least we probably
have most places have 5g by 10 in the US
then being able to play those games is
just a matter of like picking up your
phone and going I want to play Gears of
War bad done okay let's do this
you know and that's it's very
interesting place now because as you've
seen all these things come together
where it's you know server stuff 5g
mobile devices you know all coming to
like one cohesive framework yeah I think
I'm excited to try it out and even
though I might not be the biggest
believer in like cuz you know you want
good quality and also not everybody has
really good internet to begin with so it
might not be easy for this streaming
service to actually take off for most
people that is check out project google
also has the as well I tried I tried to
sign up they never they never invited me
in so I got Dave like I used three
different Google accounts and I signed
up nothing I was so why did you use the
one for your YouTube account because
that's what
okay use all of them I have three
different Gmail three three different
gmail email addresses and I use all of
them nothing sorry but I wanted that
Assassin's Creed Odyssey anyway okay so
we have one final story very very light
one I hope everybody is enjoying the
show so far as we kind of we like I said
we brought down the number of stories
because we wanted to make sure that we
were actually going into discussions for
each of these things a little bit more
focus in terms of the things that we're
talking about but now we're gonna get
very unfocused we're about to get very
distracted because the 59 new emojis
coming out soon it's time to start not
talking in English and only talking in
tiny pictures that are on our phones are
you an emoji guy at all
I've got into emojis lately I mean you
realize most people to realize I am NOT
that young I may look like super fresh
air but you realize when you have to
communicate with do you know like my
cousin's for instance or you know people
if you're talking to people who are
younger than you in my case and you know
a lot of people text for me so it's the
it's the urban dictionary or find out
what or every abbreviation is oh yeah
so I actually prefer emojis because they
are just I know what it is like I know
at least if you give me say 100 emojis I
can automatically looking and understand
90% 95% immediately as opposed to
somebody just giving me I R K or
whatever you know children you Asian and
I'm like I'm supposed to know that so I
I'm cool with emojis but you know I
think it's just a matter of time where
we just have to find that balance of
like how much is too much
yes because that was really my my
thought here was while I'm not going to
be I too have only recently got into
emojis and it's honestly only because of
the person I'm dating that's really it
like she uses him she uses him Lisa
Rodriguez over at gadget Matt she uses
emojis fairly often
I got into using it more often and I
don't even
but I'm very careful with it I don't try
to use I try not to use emojis in such a
way that completely replaces my actual
use of language like there are certain
things I'll use it as a compliment to it
so if I say like love you babe and then
there's a kissy face but it's not just
like gonna be emojis in one string there
have to be words in everything that I
said let me just say that but linked
it's funny because people have these
opinions when it comes to emojis people
are excited about these emojis that are
actually a couple of really funny
articles I came out one of them is
actually a gadget match to give Issa my
girlfriend a shout-out here she put up
an article saying that there are already
a few do they're already a few emojis
that girls are gonna use to shoot down
guys it's pretty hilarious because one
of these is called the pinching hand
this thing is ridiculous
picking hand it's basically like you
going just a little bit but you can
imagine what people are going to use
that one oh yeah
big yawn is funny mmm yeah that's pretty
funny oh boy that that that emojis gonna
take a lot of yeah there's gonna be so
many on Tundras with that
Rakhi grenade an hour an hour Chad just
says if you don't receive emojis you're
not special see how people use these
kinds of things because you and I both
like yes yes I'm a bit younger than you
but like I still was in the era of the
emoticon of the like : parenthesis you
know like yeah yeah so those all the
scroll down I just want to see all the
these like people kneeling right yes
there's that too is that prayer or yes I
why I saw yeah I would say prayer but
some probably say you know get on your
knees or kneel before Zod or something
so I thought meditation but okay but
okay to the left of
that there's also like a blind person
walking I mean it's cool representation
is definitely at an all-time high with
these yeah I get that but can a blind
person actually see the emoji to post it
or even read the emoji yeah it's like
what situation would that actually makes
sense you know like when you're trying
to describe somebody to a friend of
yours that you know my friend is blind
for example would you just say my friend
is blind or would you actually just send
that and that emoji to them and be like
he's this like how there's a line of
respect and disrespect when it comes to
using emojis and obviously that's where
some comedy comes from but like what is
actually the what why why what's purpose
I am I mean you know I like the
prosthetics but you know it's cool that
they have wheelchair and power
wheelchairs like yo I upgraded there's
also a chair just a brown chair its way
to the right and then stethoscope okay
fine I personally am a fan of the waffle
but I think donut is way better than
waffle and then there's a there's a
butter emoji which I'm actually really
happy about hashtag Kido one guess so
many connotations already god I mean
it's it's just so funny to me and then
there's even one here that I don't even
know what it is like is that a pearl oh
that's a clam with a pearl okay never
mind
um there's a melting piece of ice like
you know and it's just funny like it is
that's what it means
what does I say stop sweaty no you can't
take the heat oh okay that's true
so like emojis like the the digital it's
digital slang which is fine do you have
any emoji that you always go to though I
guess don't wonder you always use oh uh
I mean it's laughs out loud I laugh a
lot so it's like you know that's pretty
much it you know that's kinda crying one
right alright yeah it's pretty much my
might go to emoji and and then like
facepalm because people do a lot of
foolish things and well that's when the
yawn emoji is gonna come in and then
like just imagine the amount of shade on
Twitter that people are gonna be able to
give with this kind of stuff so we who
makes emote like who's the Moche like is
there like emoji organization that
everybody is the Unicode organization
okay yeah it's it's such a throwaway
term because like you you use your
computer you see the word Unicode you
know like oh that's just what it's
writing with but no it's an actual like
conglomerate like or like association or
organization or something yeah
multinational lobbying group featuring
tech companies and Bahrain and in some
other countries as Jose is saying in our
chat yeah probably the only one out of
all of these new ones that I would use
very often as a sloth because if
someone's like hey did you get up yet
and I just lost did you get any work
done yep sloth it's like I'm just
chilling right now killing sloth sloth
chair all right so let us know what you
think about all of these emojis using
the hashtag p.m. weekly as well we have
some people in the we have some we
actually have people in our live chat
right now having discussions about how
young or how old other people are which
is hilarious because this is really
funny about oh really I just make this
happen yeah I remember when I was four
back in 2008 and I never use emojis even
though I'm 14 my goodness yeah it's it's
crazy how how our language our digital
language has been evolving over the
years but you know what it's on that
note that we're gonna go ahead and call
