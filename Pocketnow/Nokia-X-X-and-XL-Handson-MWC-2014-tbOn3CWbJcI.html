Stephen Elop mentioning the word
Android and yes we are running it though
this is a very different version of
Android this is the Nokia XL the
nogueira connection was let's talk about
them Tony behind the camera hi meadow a
bit of a parka now this is MWC now what
you're seeing here is the Nokia X plus
and the Nokia X the differences between
these phones are quite significant
because this one is a 5 inch display 4
inch display this one is focused more on
the entry-level market and even though
this phone is an entry-level phone that
is much bigger 4-inch display 5 inch
display here both of these phones run a
fourth version of Android so the only
difference for example between the pull
of the X and the X plus says the amount
of RAM you have 768 megabytes of RAM on
this one
you have 512 megabytes of RAM on the X
and then on the XL which I wish would
not turn itself off
we have 768 megabytes of RAM now this
phone's run a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor which is dual-core on each
side they have very limited memory but
you do have expandable storage here both
phones are dual SIM card phones but the
big news here is really Android this is
Android but this is not really Android
this is like what you see on the Amazon
Kindle it's a completely fork version of
Android up to the point where it does
look like Windows Phone but it doesn't
really perform like Windows Phone at all
it is very fluid though looks really
nice you can create folders now one of
the cool things here is you can run
Android applications but keep in mind
these are not the Google Play Store
applications this phone doesn't have an
unlocked bootloader we really don't know
if you are going to be able to siloed
applications yet but one thing I will
tell you is there is a Nokia Store that
runs Android applications and obviously
these phones are even though these homes
are focused for the entry-level market
you have to remember the asha phones are
for the entry entry level where you even
talking about a twenty nine arrow astra
phone
these ones are focused on the 99.99
market and they are completely different
because the Lumia phones are going to be
the more higher-end phones now another
difference between this x+ and the X is
obviously 5 megapixel camera here with a
flash 3 megapixel camera here without
/ and probably one of the cool things
about this design here are the dual SIM
cards you've got the replaceable battery
you've got the camera with the flash but
look at this I mean it's a complete
unibody plastic case that if you drop
your phone you can just completely
replace for another one so just snap
this in here and you have your
good-looking phone that you could
replace at any time now going back to
the UI this is a very nice UI like for
example you lock the display from side
to side and once you're here you only
have two panes which is the principle
pane with different applications
different services and then you swipe to
your reasons and these reasons can even
include your social media now if you're
asking what version of Android we're
running here this is just based on
jellybean but we don't know exactly
which version of jellybean this again is
a fourth version of Android and just
gives you the model PM 10:30 but it
doesn't really tell you what version of
Android you're running you could notice
for example that you do have if we could
move back here we do have developer
options there is USB debugging it
actually looks a lot like Android when
you go into the settings for example you
can create different services here just
like you would on Android now keep this
in mind for example as Stephen Elop
what's mentioning they don't plan to
send you to the Google cloud they want
to send you to the Microsoft cloud so
this is onedrive
this is Skype this is really everything
based on Google services you have
everything else the backup and reset
vasaline is the name of the UI by the
way and again you can add your social
feed into this manage history manage
notifications it pretty much works a lot
like Android now going through some
additional specification as this phone
is running an IPS LCD display viewing
angles are very very good actually even
though this is a WVGA 800 by 480
displayed in our last time I saw this
resolution but you know it actually does
look very crisp on the displayed aside
from that you also get as we mentioned
four gigabytes of internal storage 2,000
milliamp hour battery on the XL and we
do not have a dedicated camera button
but let's look at the UI
got white balance we've got exposure
we've got the flash controls face
detection noise reduction obviously
there is no optical image stabilization
here and you do have some manual options
here which are really interesting even
though we can't really confirm what type
of video recorder we have here I'm gonna
have to look into this a bit further
when we review this device eventually
but so far again it looks strictly basic
now let's be specific for 89 euros 99
euros or 109 there is really not much we
can ask you notice it is a little bit
slow to take the photographs but again
this zone actually looks quite premium
and you won't have to be dealing with
the fact that you're missing
applications from your phone at a very
reasonable price again we're gonna
continue looking at these phones these
are again entry-level phones this excel
will be available later this year we're
going to have definitely a review on
these devices mid-range devices hi
meadow Nevada from pocketnow.com
Tony behind the camera no get here with
just about everything they're released
we'll see you soon for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
