and we're gonna do a quick preview of a
new xbox live game for this phone let's
check it out alright this week's game is
Splinter Cell Conviction we're just
gonna go right into it show you our
place okay here's our guy and we have a
joystick over here and this was going to
move him and we have buzz over here that
changed sometimes so this will do your
sniping and you touch the screen
anywhere else to move your angle of view
sound a little bit too far away for that
and this is the trigger button this is a
you can choose your weapon and the red
eye means that I can be seen cuz I'm in
the light that's all there's obviously
the pause button now thing here if I
don't hit the joystick right I'm gonna
start moving my angle of view so that
was kind of annoying
anyway let's run over here and you see
things change I have an extra button
buttons change over here let's see if I
can target somebody
let's see if those guys see me
I got him see if that guy nope
let's go there and just get shot
apparently I'm getting shot at
there we go
it's just standing there you see me
all right so we've got to pick up some
ammo so this game was announced way back
last year it's been a long time waiting
for this to come out and it seems like a
very straightforward port from the
iPhone I've only been playing it for a
little bit but I kind of don't like the
controls I know a lot of people are
gonna like this game just because it's a
shooter and we have some great 3d
graphics but the controls get kind of
confusing and tedious maybe if I learn
them I'll get used to them but I'm not
gonna kill this person now let's just
check her out okay so that's the basic
gameplay we also obviously go through
different missions and levels and you'll
get to do different kind of
assassinations options we don't have
much just some sound effects stuff
meters or feet and we have achievements
and leaderboards this is a trial so I
have the bifel game and I feel like
paying the money for it it's gonna cost
$4.99 when it comes out tomorrow that's
Wednesday February 22nd now one thing to
know the load times are sometimes a
little long and here's our main menu
yeah Chivas and leaderboards that's kind
of the only real difference between this
and the iPhone version there's no
ringtones or special live tiles to
download nothing like that
we need to have some cool movie graphics
this will play a movie for your intro
pretty neat going on there and you can
skip it if you press the back button
so that'll go into the game it's more
cool graphics and then we get to our
loading screen again and it'll have to
go through that before we can start
playing so that's a quick look at
Splinter Cell Conviction coming out
tomorrow Wednesday for 22nd in the
Windows Phone Marketplace for $4.99 it's
a pretty cool game with a really neat
graphics I personally found it kind of
tedious and a little difficult to
control however others will probably
really like it there's the thumbs up if
you like this video and that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
