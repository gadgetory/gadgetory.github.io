point no for the US and we go hands-on
the next version of Windows Phone 8 to
include support for 1080p displays and
Google just pull the record number of
apps for the Play Store I'm hi meri
behna wishing I didn't have to drive 10
miles for my much needed cup of coffee
and this is parking out daily that's
right Samsung is just announced their
galaxy note 8.0 was announced at mwc in
Barcelona the device starts selling in
stores on april eleventh and so far well
our review unit arrived a couple of days
ago obviously we were under embargo we
couldn't share anything but our four of
you for this product is now live and
make sure you watch our video licks in
the description because it could be a
good tablet for you it could probably
not be so make sure you watch the full
video and read the full review let's
move over to Windows Phone a lot of
people are asking the same question one
hour 1080p display is going to be
supported by the operating system as
this is this year stick for Android and
as it turns out ddr3 is the version
number of the update that will come in
the fall holiday season that will
include support for 1080p display so if
you're expecting it now sadly it will
probably be next year's thing as it is
this year's thing for Android speaking
of Windows Phone let's talk about nokia
as aside from the catwalk rumors and the
Lumia 928 rumors we also have an RM 877
device being rumored now for AT&amp;amp;T and it
brings all the bells and whistles of the
Lumia 920 the same flagship specs some
probable and improvements out there so
we could be seeing a new flagship Lumia
smartphone coming to AT&amp;amp;T very soon
we're not sure if this is going to super
see the Lumia 920 so just stay tuned
we'll keep you posted now let's move
over to google ask well the leaks of the
Google Play Store version four point oh
yes terday have now become official
today the update is now available to
everybody but it'll take a couple of
weeks for it to reach every device so if
you're interested the APK s and the
links in the description but aside from
that are an interesting note google has
just pulled between februari till today
60,000 very bad quality applications
from their google play store if you
thought that only Apple did curating
well this is a new hit or miss surprise
as Google is now doing the same thing
but it's interesting these apps were
first approved and then pulled so make
sure you look for your applications
hopefully they're still there we're not
sure which one's got pulled 60,000 is a
big
and finally for the ironic news of the
day Google is now being accused of
anti-competitive app practices on
Android because if you didn't know
Microsoft was accused years ago almost a
decade ago for Windows bundling Internet
Explorer and Europe as well and as it
turns out it's microsoft and nokia that
are actually pushing these accusations
in europe to happen to android just
because they bundled maps and they
bundle all these services that actually
make android phones make sense so that
leads me to the question of the day
would you like an Android device that's
bare-bones no Chrome browser no Google
now known of the services that you
currently like Android for in my
particular case honestly if these
weren't bundle and Android than Android
wouldn't really make any sense and it's
really about google's fault that
Microsoft and Nokia can not figure out
mobile as google has with Android so
leave us a comment down below I just
call this a very bad practice from
Microsoft and Nokia and of course for an
earlier soup of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
