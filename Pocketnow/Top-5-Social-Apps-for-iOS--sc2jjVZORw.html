applications on iOS but which one should
you download I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and these are our top 5 social
apps for iOS
I lost track of all the social
applications I downloaded and deleted
from my iOS devices years ago new
innovative ways to connect with people
pop up every single month and they're
usually first to arrive on iOS so where
should you begin your search for the
best social apps to install on your iPad
and iPhone like I mentioned in the top 5
social apps for Android video yesterday
you should give all the official apps
that go first such as Google+ Facebook
Twitter Instagram etc most of those get
the job done sufficiently well but
sometimes third-party clients take
things to a new level we've been around
the block with dozens of social apps and
these are our favorite on iOS when it
comes to Twitter on iOS there are
third-party clients and then there's
tweet by others like echo phone tweet
castor and Twitter if ik get the job
done the tweet bot does it with the most
class and style and it has one of the
broadest selections of embedded features
to boot it has support for popular read
later services URL shortening third
party image and video uploads and
timeline sync above all it's the
cleanest most polished UI and experience
I've ever had on Twitter period tweet by
3 is available for $4.99 but you'll have
to purchase the separate application for
iPad which is yet to be updated to match
I owe s7 for another $4.99 if you're
looking for a great reddit client for
iOS there are tons of clients in the App
Store but there is only one you should
bother with hey Liam blue I've done most
of my reddit browsing from Android until
last week I took to Twitter to ask for
iOS reddit client recommendations and I
got my answer very quickly with the
unanimous recommendation for alien blue
and rightly so I downloaded the free
version at just seconds later I knew I
should go ahead and upgrade to the
individual paid versions for iPhone and
iPad which are 399 each the UI is laid
out in a very clean and easy to navigate
manner and it brings some very helpful
features to the reddit experience you
can't get from the web such as a gallery
view where you could view large
thumbnails to quickly sift through it
and find the more interesting posts
common threading is incredibly easy to
pull out and overall alien blue makes
for one of the best reddit experiences
around in fact I prefer using alien blue
from my iPad Mini over the web from my
macbook I included buffer in my social
apps for Android video yesterday because
it's an application I use each and every
day but the iOS version as expected is
packed with additional and very useful
features for instance you can't create
or edit
being scheduled from the Android app you
can still buffer posts but any editing
to the schedule has to be done from the
web if you're using the iOS client
however scheduling is built directly
into the app other than that they're
practically the same though they look a
little different for those unfamiliar
with buffer it's a service which allows
you to create posting schedules for
multiple Facebook Twitter and LinkedIn
accounts as well as Google+ pages it's a
must for anyone who regularly shares
links and wants to casually space out
their posts automatically the buffer app
and service are free of charge but you
will need to upgrade to a premium
account to unlock certain features such
as multiple posting schedules or
additional accounts I wanted to stay
away from first party applications in
this list but thanks to a recent release
from Facebook that was never going to
happen yesterday Facebook released a new
way to view mobile Facebook for iOS
users it's called paper and it actually
looks a lot more like a third party
client than something that actually came
from Facebook they're no saturated blue
tones and the app actually works quite
well surprisingly it's almost entirely
gesture based and it's incredibly fluid
the main view is your newsfeed composed
of the typical post from your friends
and the pages you follow or like you can
navigate this by swiping left or right
on the bottom half the page to scroll
through posts and dragging the thumbnail
upwards to expand swiping upwards on the
article preview will open the full
article with a slick animation and
swiping it back down will minimize from
the main view you can change sections by
swiping left or right on the top half
the default page these sections are
essentially different topics of interest
and they can be edited by pulling the
home page down and tapping edit sections
best of all you can disable autoplay on
videos and it has a read later support
built in for pocket instapaper pinboard
and safari paper isn't perfect but it is
by far the best Facebook app to date the
last social app for iOS on our list may
come as a bit of a surprise Foursquare I
know I know the app and network isn't
anything particularly amazing it's been
around for a while but there's something
you get from Foursquare that few other
software companies provide quick support
for up and coming platforms I took a
personal hiatus from Foursquare over two
and a half years ago and I only started
using it again last week when I was
testing a preview of the Foursquare app
for pebble as far as the application
itself goes it does look very nice and
it's simple for anything else it
wouldn't be worth using but there are
two reasons I'm included
square in this list it's impressive how
quick the company has made application
and how easy it is to check in somewhere
earn rewards and give feedback I also
love using this app to find places my
friends have gone Yelp is also great for
finding places to go but Foursquare adds
a hint of a personal touch not found on
Yelp folks that's going to do it if you
enjoyed the video let us know by
clicking the thumbs up button below and
leave a comment if we missed any of your
favorite social apps for iOS be sure to
subscribe to the channel and follow us
on all the usual places twitter facebook
and google+ at pocket now until the
morton you can find me on twitter at
casper tech and i will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
