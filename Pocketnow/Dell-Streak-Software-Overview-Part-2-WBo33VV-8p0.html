pocketnow.com and so far you've seen us
unbox the dell streak give you a
software overview video that shows you
the custom interface that dell is
implemented as well as give you an
in-depth look at the hardware that makes
up the device well now it's time to take
a look at some of the applications
including the browser and a few of these
social networking applications that make
this device what it is so let's go ahead
and get started alright now we're back
and we're going to go ahead and jump
into some tests and kind of show you how
this device performs using certain
applications and first up is going to be
the YouTube application which we're
going to actually show you the video
playback performance as well as I kind
of want to give you an example of how
that speaker sounds so we're going to go
ahead and pull up the YouTube
application here and we'll search for
pocket now of course what we'll do is
we'll just pick any random video will
select this one here in the very top I'm
sure it's hard to hear someone hold it
up to my lapel mic and I hope you can
tell once again pulling up to my lapel
mics it was a little bit easier for you
to hear but it sounds brandon has a very
distinct voice and it sounds almost like
he's swimming underwater it sounds like
the speakers on the verge of blowing and
it's not turned up all the way either
when you turn up all the way obviously
it gets worse as the gain increases so
that's something Adele really really I
mean again this could just be this
device here but if it's not if it's with
its device wide and III we've heard
issues before with this particular
device with the speaker if it is Dell
Streak wide that's something i don't
really drop the ball on hopefully it's
just this device but hey we'll see what
happens now going back to the playback
here as you can see we'll go ahead and
we'll actually fast forward a little bit
here as you can see the frame rate
actually is not bad at all it's keeping
up no problem despite the fact that it's
happening to power that 5-inch screen
you see there's some pretty fast motion
it doesn't appear to have the HQ button
down here in the right corner however it
does play the video back without an
issue at all with a decent framerate
another great element of the 5-inch
screen on the dell streak is going to be
in the email application typically with
the android devices you have to actually
pan and zoom in order to see your entire
email i have to pan left and right that
sort of thing however the 5-inch screen
here really gives you some real estates
actually see the entire email for what
it is without having to move left and
right as you can see here we have an
email from gamestop and it gives us all
of the information without having to
actually undo move left and right in the
email application and that's really
great as you can see here we can't go
left and right fortunately can't zoom it
will try and do is will actually hold it
in the vertical position here and it
looks like we now have the ability yes
to go left and right like on typical
Android devices some ability to zoom
however what this basically means is
that if you are i power email user and a
lot of your emails contain a lot of
graphics maybe some HTML code pictures
or just a very large body of text and
you want to see the entire email about
having to pan and zoom left and right
this is going to allow you to be very
efficient because of that another
application that has actually gained a
lot of attention lately is the facebook
application for android and that is
because it recently received an update
so go ahead and opening up this
application here you will see that
facebook and their developers need to
actually rework house is going to work
on some devices because we do not have a
landscape mode and we will actually hold
the device up here even shake it it
won't go into landscape mode at all so
we're stuck with the vertical which
looks identical to what you're going to
get on any other android device just a
little bigger you have a little more
space that you're really not going to
utilize you still the ability to scroll
through some recent pictures here check
your newsfeed that sort of things so
really getting to utilize the full
aspect of this screen comes down to some
of the developers of certain
applications and of course you want to
go ahead and take a look at the browser
now right now we're connected to a Wi-Fi
network so we have pretty solid
connection we're going to go ahead and
open up the browser here it will bring
us to our homepage that is Google and
then from there we're going to go to
pocket now
as you can see here right to the
Wildfire review that we recently did and
it loads fairly quickly but it also
loads the pages of holes you can see
here you do want to zoom out just a
little bit and that's likely because the
last time we were browsing we actually
had zoomed in on a picture but you can
see the entire webpage very very clearly
you can read the text without an issue
at all so if you were actually holding
this phone in front of you right now you
can clearly read this paragraph without
having to zoom in at all you can zoom
totally zoomed out stay totally zoomed
out and see all of your text without an
issue that makes the browsing experience
much easier you do have the multi-touch
support as always to zoom right in
however the tech sticks a little bit to
render when you actually zoom in and out
it actually has to render the text
changing in the size so you'll get a
little bit of a blur until that actually
fully renders you can also use the
browser of course in the vertical mode
which will then require you to pan zoom
the whole nine yards but once again as
you can see here you can fit the entire
website and a decent aspect ratio and
now it's time for a gaming test we have
raging thunder loaded on both devices
here which are the HTC evo 4g and of
course the dell streak so we're actually
going to go ahead and start a race on
both these devices at the same exact
time and we'll see which one performs
better in terms of frame rate whatever
it may be or if they perform the same or
else of that you can actually see if the
menu here is much easier to read because
it is actually much more clear and much
wider to the resolution of the device
one side note we typically test with
asphalt however the asphalt racing is
only compatible with Android 2.1 up and
of course the dell streak only has one
point six so we had to use raging
thunder now these are both running at
the same exact time going to zoom in
here just a little quickly so you can
actually see it almost looks as though
the colors are a little clearer on the
dell streak as far as the detail goes it
also looks like the detail on the streak
may be a little bit clearer on the car
itself you can see some of the fender
accents a little bit clearer but that
may be because of the fact that it's a
bigger screen they've
more to work with as far as frame rate
goes however it is a close close
competition here this game likely
doesn't go past 30 frames per second so
you're really not going to see a
difference between these two devices
overall the experience on the streak may
be a little better for gaming that's
because the screen is bigger it's very
close to the dsi XL so this is actually
more of a portable gaming system for you
by having a bigger screen however you
can't go wrong with either the two
options here and there you have it thank
you for watching everyone please give us
a thumbs up and leave a comment if you
have any suggestions or questions stay
tuned for the next and final video in
the series which will be our final word
in our full review on the dell streak
there will also be a long posting on
pocketnow.com so be sure to check there
