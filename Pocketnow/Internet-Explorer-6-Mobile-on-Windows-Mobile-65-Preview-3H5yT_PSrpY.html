pocketnow.com
and this is a tour of Internet Explorer
mobile six as it appears on an early
windows mobile 6.5 rom from XD
developers now obviously what you see
here will be different than what you
experienced if you were to buy a windows
mobile 6.5 device later this year but I
thought it would be interesting to kind
of give you an idea of what we can
expect from the new version of ie6
Mobile which replaces Pocket Internet
Explorer which everyone hates so let's
take a look here and I'm going to start
off at the main screen here and I've
already got amazon.com loaded here and
you can actually see a little flash
animation in the bottom right corner
because ie6 Mobile supports Flash so
what happens here is that you load up a
page it goes full screen automatically
and then you get a little button in the
bottom right corner which will bring up
the kind of Mac OS 10 leopard like
buttons that are kind of docked with a
little bit of a shadow underneath of
them and all these buttons do some
different things so I'll go through them
now this one on the right acts as kind
of your soft key menu so you can add to
favorites go to your home page you can
flick down to see all the other options
and of course we see the finger friendly
windows mobile 6.5 menus here so it
makes it a lot easier to use and we can
go to history and it's a nicer looking
interface for history the scroll bars
are a little bit bigger and let's go
back again to see what else we have in
that menu and let's go down to tools and
then options the options screen is a
little bit cleaned up it's still kind of
text-based
and so if we go to privacy and settings
we have a bunch of checkboxes that's
it's not guaranteed that when I eat
mobile six ships it will look like this
but right now that's what we have to
deal with okay so let's move along to
the other menus here we have a zoom
slider and I'm gonna show you the zoom
functionality in a minute it's actually
really really fast it doesn't have the
animation like you would find in a
safari mobile mobile or opera mobile 9.5
but it's actually quite fast in the
center here is the keyboard button which
obviously will bring up the keyboard so
that you can type in a new web address
here we have the favorites button which
will
up and nicer-looking favorites them were
accustomed to in Pocket Internet
Explorer we can add a favorite kind of
is reminiscent of the Opera Mobile 9.5
interface a little bit and if we go back
once more here's the action button so
when a page is loading it will be an X
so you can stop it from loading and
right now it's just a back button so I
told you I'd show you the zoom so let me
show you what it looks like I'm gonna
double tap to zoom in works very fast as
you've just seen and it's actually quite
smooth I'm quite impressed for an early
version of Pocket Internet Explorer
mobile or Internet Explorer Mobile I
should say this the scrolling is very
smooth you can tap on any link of course
to go to that link you can double tap to
zoom back out like so or you can use the
zoom slider which doesn't seem very
intuitive having to press another button
to get to the zoom slider and here's the
zoom slider which will kind of just zoom
in on the center of the page so I think
the best of it would be just to double
tap and let me show you how other
websites look so I'm gonna click the
address bar and I'm going to go to let
me get the address bar up here alright
let's go to ebay.com and as you as you
type Internet Explorer 6 Mobile will
look up the web address or kind of
actually make a little shorter for you
so that you don't have to type com
or.net or things like that so it saves a
little bit of time here we are on eBay
and I just want to show you a pretty
cool feature that you don't see
immediately when you drag your finger
along the screen you get the little box
in the bottom left corner some other
windows mobile browsers have that and
it's really helpful to see where you are
along the page and to be able to find
the information that you're looking for
so that's a welcome feature and of
course we can double tap to zoom back
out so overall Internet Explorer 6
mobile for windows mobile 6.5 even in
this pre-release form looks quite
promising it seems to be able to rival
opera mobile 9.5 and its ability to
render web pages like they look on a
desktop and even brains flash support
and finally we have finger friendly
buttons for the native browser of
Windows Mobile so that's it for now and
