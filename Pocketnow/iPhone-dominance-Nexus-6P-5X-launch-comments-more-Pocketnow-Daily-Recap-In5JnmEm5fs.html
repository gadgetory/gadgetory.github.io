really do you fit in that furniture too
can I be one time when this guy doesn't
make a reference to drinking no for have
you should dress up as a bottle of beer
that will hear transformation will be
completed all right that's right it's
that time of the week I am hi Mary vetta
this is pocket now and this is the
bhagat out daily recap for last week I
Monday asked you if you ordered any of
the Nexus devices which one and why as
we had dates for the launch of the Nexus
5x on october twenty second which was
two days ago we had 682 comments we
start with I didn't buy a nexus I would
never buy a phone just after its launch
you need to have reviews and yeah that's
exactly what I'm doing and so far so
good with those for Michael i watch
Seinfeld good for you I ordered the
nexus 5x because of the size i have two
tablets so i don't need a phablet and
yeah i have a tablet but then again
there are certain added functionality
that that lets do provide that yeah
you're right Nexus devices don't so you
do make a solid point there it probably
doesn't make sense I have my eyes set on
the Nexus 6p simply because the design
is to die for and of course a large
battery pushing that 2k display and so
far Michael's impression of the Nexus 6p
is really positive we didn't actually
expect to love a huawei phone this much
but the company has done an amazing job
and yeah can't wait to give mine a try
until I asked you if you would be
interested in a modular smart watch as
the blocks project has a full campaign
on kickstarter for a modular SmartWatch
we had 544 comments we start with that
makes total sense your SmartWatch will
never get outdated and true and it does
make a lot of sense when it comes to
watches in particular because you're not
buying one every year it's going to fail
like project ara no one wants to worry
about carrying modules or blocks or
whatever you can call them what project
are hasn't really failed it hasn't
really launched by the way but think
about it in the case of a SmartWatch you
won't be carrying around modules they're
part of the bracelets so I feel that it
won't necessarily happen the way you
think seems like there's always a sensor
or something
that missing on the SmartWatch as I want
so now i can get the gps heart rate
monitor and all the other fitness
tracking in one package seems legit
let's just see how that battery life
performs with all those modules buddy
wednesday was about huawei and lenovo we
had some market share figures and even
though Samsung and Apple are still at
the top they are on the client and
Huawei in the no war on a rise asked you
what do you think they're doing right we
had 195 comments we start with price
that's what they're doing right and yeah
it's hard to argue with that but they're
not the only ones by the way Huawei
design &amp;amp; price lenovo value for the
money and you know here right
particularly what Lenovo is doing with
Motorola they're adding more value and
reducing the price tag I think that yeah
there's a solid point there Samson
losing low and mid-range market Apple
losing to Samsung because of the success
model looking the same as in six
unfortunately the only we can tell
others that you got a new iphone is by
buying the other iphone pale pink and I
sorry not all your comment is on spot
but I did pick it particularly because
of what you mentioned Samsung is losing
on the lower end market to these
companies because these companies are
being more aggressive about price points
and great design and Samsung is still
being really cheap about it so that part
of the comment i do agree with thursday
was about iphones we had more market
share figures there is dominance with
the iphone and i asked you even though I
phones are not the most left phones why
are they so popular we had sixteen
hundred and two comments thanks a lot
guys we start with you at least get
updates on the iphone i have received
two updates to my galaxy s5 in 1.5 years
and yes the software update part is
terrible with android but i don't think
that's the major selling point for
iphones why do they sell their popular
and are simple to use plus they are way
more reliable and yeah it would be
easier for me to recommend an iphone to
a friend than any other android phone
not necessarily because android phones
are bad they're just more difficult to
learn you have a point there my opinion
I phones are more like fashion
statements more than anything I will
manage to make their hardware and
software look like they're both simple
and yet elegant two characteristics in
general consumer love about them and
yeah that's the thing the world
made out of general consumers the geeks
like us are actually just ten to twenty
percent of the market so i think that
Apple did a smart job in appealing to
the general consumer you have a solid
point there indeed and finally Friday we
had some last statistics from teenagers
that were rather interesting they are
interested in iphones but they don't
care about the Apple watch and I asked
you what do you think people don't
really care much about the Apple watch
anymore and well we have 206 comments
thanks a lot guys we start with because
it's an overpriced stupid watch it's not
a stupid watch but it is overpriced I
agree oh the iphone is already expensive
and then you throw it an expensive watch
to go with the phone add that up and you
get around twelve hundred dollars
roughly and the true you need an iphone
to be able to use the Apple watch and if
I were a teenager and I had to picton
definitely i'd rather have the iphone
without the watch than anything else why
is there no interest I'll answer with
another question what does it have that
the average teenager wants and dude this
is the probably the best comment of the
week and I'd love to end the video with
this and s you guys in the comments why
do you think that the Apple watch is not
popular and what does it have that would
appeal to teenagers because you have a
point there I don't see anything
appealing to teenagers except for the
fact that it's a cool gimmick that
you'll carry on your wrist but then i
get an expensive one indeed please leave
