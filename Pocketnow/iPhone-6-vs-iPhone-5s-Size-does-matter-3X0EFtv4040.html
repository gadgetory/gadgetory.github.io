of people have is if it's really worth
it to upgrade to the iPhone 6 from the
iPhone 5s or this is really just the
bigger iPhone I'm hearing that are with
pocket now in this comparison is brought
to you by Squarespace
join me for iPhone 6 vs iPhone 5s if you
pay attention to the average iPhone
hater which are quite common here on
YouTube you'll be immersed in a sea of
negativity that claims that the iPhone 6
is just the bigger iPhone that could be
truly judge a book by its cover so let's
dive in and see which device is better
the face of the iPhone 6 looks indeed
like every single iPhone that's ever
been launched but once you step inside
by side with the iPhone 5s you'll notice
just how different they are the iPhone 6
has a display that's 15 percent larger
though retaining a similar pixel density
and in that same matter it's 15
millimeters taller 8 millimeters wider
17 grams heavier even though it's almost
the full millimeter thinner if that's
even easy to believe coming from an
iPhone 5s which is already thinner than
thin says a lot but because of that
increased size you really don't feel
that the iPhone 6 is actually heavier
because of better weight distribution
the iPhone 6 is also more powerful in
internals it has NFC for Apple pay
additional LTE radios voice over LTE
were supported and more storage options
though I won't bore you with these
details since the behavior of both
devices is almost identical the word
feel is really the theme going forward I
can honestly say that the iPhone 5s had
a better looking design than the iPhone
6 especially when you compare these
horrible antenna cutouts but do yourself
a favor and walk to an Apple Store or do
whatever you can to hold the iPhone 6
before you judge it the curves in the
display of the iPhone 6 match perfectly
with the curves of the aluminum body and
this gives the device of feel that's
almost unmatched in hand
ganar the annoying chamfered edges of
the iPhone 5s which that make it look
like a piece of jewelry but the didn't
look great once you drop the phone for
the first time in the hand the iPhone 6
feels more refined and that's also the
feeling that extends whenever you hold
the phone in your ear when hair the
usability is impaired though let's be
honest here
the thinner chassis of the iPhone 6 thus
helped this to some extent but for its
display on the iPhone 5s is clearly the
winner in that department Apple's new
reach ability featured this helped a lot
but the the double touching on the home
button is very annoying whenever you're
trying to hit every single navigation
key at the top this does call for a
dramatic change in the user interface of
iOS and this is a perfect segue to start
talking about the software as is the
tradition the existing iPhone matches
the newer iPhone to a great degree when
it comes to software features with the
exception of certain camera enhancements
iOS 8 looks almost identical on the
iPhone 6 when compared to the iPhone 5s
and that does include all the services
and applications that are included where
the iPhone 6 is unique is what the reach
ability features and with a standard and
zoom mode that you'll find for the home
screen the standard mode replicates how
icons are seen on the iPhone 5s which
will allow you to see more things on the
display than with the zoom in feature
which floats everything out and makes it
look like if you're using a 4-inch
display though on a bigger 4.7 inch Amis
we recommend that you stick to the
standard mode though you will notice
some fuzziness here and there and bloat
in certain applications that are not
enhanced for the new 4.7 inch display on
the iPhone 6 you'll also notice that the
iPhone 6 is faster to launch
applications here and there but other
than that software is the last place
you'll find differences here I wish I
could report on the m8 cope processor on
the iPhone 6 compared to the m7 but that
will have to wait for the after the buzz
as you really can't find many
applications that take advantage of this
and some of these actually require extra
accessories and the same can be said
about Apple pay which will be launched
on till October
the user experience is sort of a mixed
bag and that's mainly because you can't
always tell the difference between one
device or the other it is definitely
more pleasant to consume content on the
iPhone 6 because of the bigger display
and most of us agree that iOS 8 was
definitely made with a larger screen in
mind certain things do feel convoluted
on the iPhone 5s now that we know better
but for some people one-handed usability
is more important you will enjoy playing
games more on the iPhone 6 you're
watching a video though that doesn't
mean that the iPhone 5s is a slouch in
that department it's just smaller or you
shouldn't expect any differences
whatsoever are in the camera the
protruding camera on the iPhone 6 is an
annoying sight to see but other than
with the focus pixels both cameras are
almost identical and specifications the
iPhone 6 does have a newer sensor and
the focus pixel technology this helped
the smartphone take photos significantly
faster and I mean significantly faster
but the resulting photos are pretty much
the same great color accuracy in
daylight and these in photography at
night as well other than the option for
slow-motion video at 240 frames per
second which does bring you really cool
video everything else on the camera
department is pretty much the same data
speeds and Wi-Fi retention are the same
and when it comes to phone calls those
on the other side couldn't really tell
that I was using a different phone on
either phone call it just tells you how
good call quality is on both devices one
big improvement is battery life you
could say that the 300 million power
difference between batteries on these
devices is insignificant but the iPhone
6 is really the first iPhone that I've
ever used where the battery does last
all day with my type of usage the
conclusions lie in your needs if you're
currently rocking an iPhone 5s and you
like what you have you might not be
missing out on much with the iPhone 6 if
you're using any previous iPhone then
differences are substantial so yes you
should upgrade and if you wish to save
an extra hundred dollars by purchasing
the iPhone 5s today I would rather you
spend them on the iPhone 6 they may look
like the same phone but the iPhone 6 is
Apple's new baby so you can expect it to
get a more promising treatment during
the next 12 months and
and in that sense really hold the iPhone
6 go to an Apple store and give it a try
you will notice that this is a more
refined iPhone and the experience can be
better the display should be bigger and
so far I do have to admit that I would
prefer to stick with the iPhone 6 than
to return to the iPhone 5s once again I
