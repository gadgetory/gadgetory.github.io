review and when the reviewer gets to the
camera section all-day poster a couple
of terrible shots while writing that
camera off because it's not on their
favorite phone don't you want to know
more about a phone camera than what you
might learn from a handful of mediocre
HDR photos let's do something about this
we live in an age where the only camera
person might own is the one bolted to
the back of their phone so we're going
to review that with the same attention
we might give a standalone camera
there's more to smartphone photography
than just mega pickles and selfies
shooting in real-world conditions we're
going to cover color saturation exposure
optics image stabilization bulk a
low-light focusing video and any other
fun features a manufacturer might have
included I'm Juan Carlos bag now for
pocket now and here's our real camera
review of the LG g5 buckle up folks
we've got a lot of ground to cover and
we're gonna move pretty quick first a
little housekeeping our LG g5 is an 18 T
branded unit with dual image sensors
onboard the main shooter is very similar
to what we saw in the g4 it's a one over
two point six inch image sensor paired
with an approximately 28 millimeter
field of view and an F 1.8 aperture the
main sensor captures 16 megapixel stills
with a native 16 by 9 aspect ratio and
features laser focus assistance the
second sensor is paired with a super
wide angle lens that captures a 135
degree field of view which is roughly
around an 8 millimeter equivalent lens
this camera has an aperture of f28
megapixel stills also with a native
aspect ratio of 16 by 9 the exact
resolution of the sensor is 3840 by 2160
which means this was designed to also
capture UHD video both cameras feature
optical image stabilization this video
review is being uploaded at you HD
resolution and any adjustments to photos
or videos will be detailed in the upper
left-hand corner now starting with still
photos and looking at exposure and
saturation in trying to produce bright
and vibrant images LG still pushes
exposure a touch brighter in Auto than I
would prefer but for most setups the
difference is around a third of a stop
in all but the brightest direct Sun
situations this last week we had
cloudier than usual weather in Los
Angeles so the g5 is getting the
benefit of softer nicer light in some of
our setups than on previous camera tests
blues greens Browns earthy and sky tones
look fantastic there is a little
compression noise in the sky but it's on
par with competing cameras warmer colors
are always difficult for digital sensors
to capture but the g5 is sure-footed
with yellows like this hibiscus and
direct Sun we still see plenty of petal
detail and we're only barely clipping
the broadest surface of the flower reds
however get a little funky producing a
JPEG red start to fear a little more
orange than what we've seen on previous
LG's of dropping the exposure a half
stop gets us back in the ballpark but
color processing does seem to be ever so
slightly different than what we saw in
the v10 overall LG continues to offer
terrific dynamic range even on a JPEG
we're still able to see the texture of
this wall in sunlight without completely
losing info and shadows under this
Terrace average JPEGs from the main
camera between five and eight megabytes
in size Rob photos come in at 19
megabytes per exposure which means each
shot where a JPEG in a raw file or saved
can eat up almost 30 megabytes of
storage a cropping in on JPEGs there's a
fair amount of noise reduction
sharpening being applied to all shots
even those in daylight this can create a
little splotchiness on edges and fine
details which pixel peepers might not
enjoy looking at some raw output we can
push the recovery of clipped highlights
and dark shadows by almost two full
stops blowing out the details on this
wall walking back the exposure still
looks pretty good and all of that
texture still exists in the photo
exposing specifically for this street
lamp we can still pull up quite a bit of
detail in the shot from underexposed
sections and using desktop software you
can pull a bit more sharpness and
structure out of each photo before
pushing into the smeary territory of the
JPEGs from LG zap to be fair the JPEGs
produced are actually quite nice for a
phone and these defects are only really
observed when viewing photos at 100%
crops the 16 by 9 aspect ratio
guarantees that full resolution photos
will occupy your whole phone screen
while also being a good fit for most HD
TVs many and our audience should be
happy to see that maintaining the 16
megapixel resolution of the v10 and g4
means we also have a little more room
to crop or zoom in each shot when
compared to Samsung's lower resolution
galaxy s7 shots at the far end of the
zoom will still look blurry and terrible
so you'll want to zoom mostly with your
feet to maintain image fidelity but a
little crop zooming can get you closer
to your subject the g5 does feature the
nifty trick of incorporating the
wide-angle lens into the zoom range when
shooting video zooming out will
automatically switch to the wider view
and zooming in will swap back to the
main camera LG still seems to be
sourcing a slightly lower quality lens
than what we might see on a Samsung or
Lumia though it's a touch more prone to
fringing and aberration
you see the snail shot this curved
distortion in the brick or looking at
the warped rays of light from the street
lamp this isn't terrible performance for
a phone but these defects can sometimes
prove distracting funnily the wide-angle
camera doesn't seem to suffer that exact
kind of aberration though the wide lens
does have quite a bit of barrel
distortion as we push into almost
fisheye territory macro performance is
respectable we've got a similar close
focusing distance as we might find on
competitors and the F 1.8 aperture
delivers a very pleasant bokeh as
objects in the background are nicely
blurred out looking at the focusing
system
LG's laser assisted focus lock is still
one of the most sure-footed systems
we've ever used though it's not nearly
as fast as what we see on the galaxy s7
there's a pleasant slide and lock into
focus which looks good as a rack focus
effect between two subjects throughout
all of our tests we only ran into two
situations where the phone was confused
by busy scenes and refused to lock on
the subject white balance performance is
very good the color sensor on the g5
does an excellent job of landing
accurate color and with the exception of
some of those wonky Reds it's rare that
photos are far off the mark
from what these scenes look like in real
life HDR shots still rely heavily on
pulling information out of shadows but
we don't see this processing reining in
highlights as well as what we see on the
iPhone also LG's image capture isn't the
fastest and even on subtly moving
objects you're apt to see some ghosting
on the edges of your subject panorama
performance is good but it doesn't quite
match the accuracy of Apple or Samsung
we see a few breaks and stitching
together these power line
for example funnily even though the wide
lens is almost a one-shot panorama by
itself this camera can also be used to
capture a panorama shot it's such a wide
and distorted field of view though we
can get some really funky distortion
where seams should have lined up I'm not
a huge fan of selfie cameras but the
front shooter on the g5 is respectable
the eight megapixel stills look decent
enough in bright light and aren't
completely terrible indoors though we
see quite a bit of chroma noise on those
lower light shots 1080p video from the
front shooter will be twitchy due to a
lack of any stabilization and if you
want to make yourself look like odo from
Deep Space nine you can always slap on a
beauty filter the g5 s flash is
respectively bright for a single LED
solution but the way the phone meters it
seems a bit more prone to blowing out
highlights than some of the dual LED in
color tone flash solutions we've tried
recently this camera performs very well
at night with very good dynamic range in
manual mode the phone uses spot metering
and that can sometimes make it a little
difficult to expose for the scene as a
whole focusing on the darker building
blows out the billboard but focusing on
the billboard makes the rest of the shot
a little too dark overall though I
prefer this method of metering as a
better guarantees that the subject I'm
focusing on is what the camera is going
to expose for now we've already seen the
lens distortion from this creepy tunnel
shot but the overall shot is wonderfully
exposed with good contrast very good
detail cropped in and noise reduction
isn't overly degrading the image here on
our creepy gate the g5 gets us pretty
close to the actual lighting of the
scene as this gate is lit by a really
ugly orange yellow security lamp our
walkway test shows the same great
accuracy between these two bulbs which
have different color temperatures and
the blown out areas below each lamp are
fairly small with some information still
recoverable in the raw file these pink
flowers lit by a yellow porch lamp look
terrific great color very good detail
wonderful for a handheld shot and moving
to extreme low-light the g5 continues to
lock focus in situations which can
cripple other phones focusing isn't as
fast as what Samsung provides now but LG
is still a top-notch performer in almost
no light manual modes are always fun for
testing long exposure shots throwing the
g5 on a tripod you can very easily
up some streaking tail light shots
happily those manual exposure controls
also apply to the wide camera as well
and the output from that pairing of wide
field-of-view and long exposure can be
downright stunning moving to video we
take one big step forward from the g4
and one huge step back from the v10
video is saved at a much higher quality
than last year's phone that's good news
we're now saving just under a 50 megabit
per second bitrate up from 30 megabit
per second on the g4 and the difference
is noticeable better color and contrast
for all of our test shots saving higher
quality footage means taking up more
space and each minute of UHD video from
the g5 will come in at just under 400
megabytes of storage the bad news
not only our video manual modes from the
v10 missing but a number of other basic
options are still absent the g5 shoots
video very similarly to the g4 using
some kind of matrix or averaged metering
mode this makes it really easy to blow
out the highlights of your subject if
the background is a bit darker there are
no options to use spot metering which
would change the exposure based on where
you focus there also is no exposure
compensation to adjust the brightness
while shooting video which is a shame as
that is a very helpful feature for
improving our video output our video
options are limited to 30 frames per
second at 720p 1080p and 2160p there is
no control over frame rate or bitrate
there is no 60 frame per second option
nor the ability to shoot a cinema wide
video we can push to a 240 frames per
second 720p slow-motion but this is
another area where LG is not quite
caught up to leaders like Apple the
Nexus 6p or even the recently reviewed
galaxy s7 video is edgy quality is low
and we see a few more dropped frames
than I would prefer
video does give us a better look at the
image stabilization employed LG uses a
very wide field of compensation which
makes output gel OE this is great for
still photos compensating for a wider
range of hand movement but it can make
video sometimes look a little seasick
dropping video quality to 1080p gives us
a hybrid software and hardware
stabilization option but LG's solution
here still hasn't quite caught up to
what competitors can provide for
smoothing a video out the wide range of
hardware compensation introduces subtle
warping effects which when paired with
pan and scan cropping can look really
twitchy or distracting audio is another
area improved over the g4 the g5 doesn't
quite match the stereo audio from
competing manufacturers but the noise
reduction filtering on this phone is far
less destructive than any other LG we've
heard before
exposure adjustments are buttery smooth
moving from a dark scene to bright and
back we see a very pleasant blooming
transition which for the first time on
an LG matches or maybe exceeds what we
saw from the current generation of
competing Samsung's during this past
though the white balance did have a
tendency to overreact pushing to warm
then to cool very rapidly before
settling on a color temperature for as
well-behaved as night photos are tonight
videos are often too bright and suffer
from quite a bit of noise due to using
higher ISO settings than we really need
we start to see an almost purple tone to
some videos because of that additional
chroma noise again there's no way to
rein this in by adjusting the exposure
and that brings us to the wide-angle
camera you didn't think we'd forgotten
about it did you it's a whole separate
camera and likely could survive a whole
separate review now in a previous video
I described to this 135 degree field of
view as approaching fish eye style
lenses and someone was correct in the
comments to point out that focal length
does not determine whether a lens is
fisheye even at a crazy wide focal
length it is possible to create
rectilinear lenses where straight lines
aren't curved that does require quite a
bit of additional glass to correct for
the optical distortions though and there
likely isn't enough room on a phone to
properly achieve this the lens on the g5
isn't a full-on fisheye lens but we see
significant barrel distortion lots of
curving and bowing of objects and the
horizon is almost always slightly
smiling unless it's dead center in your
frame but it is an impressive field of
view 8 megapixels is plenty of
resolution to use here you won't be
cropping or zooming from this camera and
it's plenty of dots for UHD video in
bright light exposure seems to be nearly
identical to the main camera but
low-light is not this camera strong suit
given how much wider this lens is I
wouldn't be surprised if this camera had
a smaller image sensor than the main
camera we seem to be producing a darker
image than just reducing the aperture
from F 1.8 to f/2 point 4 seeing a
real-time transition in video it looks
like an almost to stop drop in
brightness
with these compromises the second camera
grants the g5 the most versatile zoom
range outside of building a camera with
a hardware zoom or a super-high
resolution sensor like the Lumia 1020
and even those cameras couldn't push
nearly as wide as the g5 can there are
some fun features to play with thanks to
these multiple cameras you can use the
wide camera is something of a shadowbox
frame for the main camera in the pop-out
mode this combines the output from both
and has a few settings to adjust for the
wide camera like black and white or blur
photo saved remain at UHD resolution to
match the wide camera but videos are
reduced in resolution to 1920 by 1080 we
also have a multi view option where you
can use two or three cameras at once
again fun to have all three cameras
going but this will further reduce video
resolution to 720p so let's wrap this up
where's that leave us with the cameras
on the LG g5 LG strategy is very
different than Samsung's where a note
should leapfrog an S series phone we
expect that each successive generation
of galaxies will pick up the camera
features of the phone released prior LG
on the other hand seems to have drawn a
hard line separating G cameras from V
cameras though video quality is higher
than the g4 the g5 does not receive any
of the wonderful video controls the v10
delivered it also lacks any of the basic
adjustments we take for granted while
shooting video on any other flagship
phone photo performance on the main
camera is very similar to the g4 which
is a good thing and adding the second
wide camera makes this a crazy flexible
platform the g5 is one of the best
overall performers you can buy for
Stills though it lacks the raw speed of
the galaxy s7 this is still a very fun
camera to shoot with and the output is
very good ultimately the recommendation
for the g5 has to fall on those lines if
you shoot a lot of video this probably
isn't the phone for you if you're mostly
shooting photos we think you'll like
what LG has to offer as always folks
