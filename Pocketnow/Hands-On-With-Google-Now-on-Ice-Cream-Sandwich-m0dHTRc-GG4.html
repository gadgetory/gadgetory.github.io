pocketnow.com google now is one of my
favorite additions to android jelly bean
it's available in both version 4.1 and
4.2 but not for point 0 because that's
ice cream sandwich a while back we
showed you away you could do it but it
required rooting your device and hacking
a whole bunch of stuff it was painful
now you can do it simply by side loading
an APK you do have to be rooted I'm
going to show you how to do that right
now so for everything worked the way it
was supposed to you now have access to
the new google search through the gmail
handlebars app unfortunately if you're
like me and many others that only works
some of the time mine did not if that's
the case fire up the handlebars app and
restore that'll put everything back to
the way it was before you started the
process and you can now go with the
other method the other method involves
downloading a zip file that you flash in
recovery so i went ahead and did that
flashed it in recovery now i'm up and i
can't get into google now that's okay
sometimes that will work sometimes it
will not to get around that you can do
one of two things either come in and
launch google that way and it's trying
to recognize so about that or you can
tap on your persistence search bar to
get into the same thing as well so two
different ways that you can get in and
do it you can now have google now
installed on your ice cream sandwich
device without having to wait for a
jelly bean rom hope you liked what you
saw if you did make sure you give the
video a big thumbs up hopefully that
took care of some of the frustration and
let me tell you I've been working for
hours and hours and hours to get this to
show you this hopefully this video will
save you a bunch of time so you don't
have to go through the pain that I went
through hey it's all in a day's work
it's what we love to do over here at
pocketnow.com showing off hacks and
slashes Google
now on Ice Cream Sandwich devices for
pocket now I'm Joe Levi thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
