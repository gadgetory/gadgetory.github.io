world smartphone market share domination
Microsoft seems interested in
cyanogenmod plan to take over Android
and the LG g4 is rumor to take this
place to a whole new level one more time
I'm hi Mary vera and since we begun
celebrating friday yesterday we're
continue today and tomorrow as well this
is parking out daily let's begin today
with the official news is Microsoft is
just updated its windows insider
application notice i just said windows
this time as the company is now giving
us a full showcase of what to expect for
Windows 10 particularly a more important
part if you're interested in knowing if
your current windows phone will support
Windows 10 well the insider application
will give you more information on a
specific ations that you need so links
in the description get the application
but it seems that it only works in the
United States for now that's not the
most important news of the day when it
comes to Microsoft or should I say
rumors The Wall Street Journal has just
pulled out a very interesting report
with a full article talking about the
fact that Microsoft is planning to
invest seventy million dollars in
cyanogen yeah cyanogen no because no
they don't want a version of cyanogen
for Windows Phone not only what they
want is to help cyanogen take over
android we know that the cyanogenmod is
currently working on offering OEM is an
alternative to android where they're not
forced to use Google Play services the
way they currently are so we'll see if
this ever happens and you'll see what
the whole purpose of the Microsoft
investment is because 70 million seems a
lot that's actually a very small share
in the hundred million dollar business
of cyanogen believe it or not now let's
talk about the galaxy s6 as we've been
wondering exactly how Samsung plans to
differentiate this product and while
we've heard of replaceable backs that
are useful etc but even while your
stinger now the schematics that we just
landed on its design apparently and one
of the most interesting points is that
it will get dinner remember that it
actually got thicker between the galaxy
s4 and galaxy s5 and apparently there'll
be seven point one nine millimeters thin
which is not been on the iphone 6 but
definitely one millimeter thinner than
the galaxy s5 which is really good news
we just wonder exactly what the
one of the whole thinness will be and
how Samsung plans to again differentiate
now another very interesting rumors
let's stop at the LG g4 we're not
expecting this product until bid 20 15
but it seems that the company is
planning to change things when it comes
to display and no they're not going back
to 1080p or giving us a better 2k quad
HD display they're not actually what
they're going to do is add more pixels
to the existing quad HD display I only a
25 percent growth in pixels up to 4
million something it's just the crazy
amount and we wonder exactly what the
point is display on the LG g3 wasn't
something great we won't argue on that
with the LG G flex 2 but we you want
more pixels on your display and probably
for the very interesting news of the day
we've got to analytics companies already
bringing is data on worldwide smartphone
market share note a smartphone and
apparently there is a tie believe it or
not Sam saying is tied with Apple yeah I
know just the iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus
and they are tied with so many galaxy
phones in the market that are classified
as smartphones 70 4.5 million units on
both ends but notice this apple's units
are actually accurate that's what the
company confirmed that it's a what a
results conference call and samsung
hasn't provided exact figures on its
galaxy sales for years so this is really
an estimate we don't really know exactly
how many galaxy phones are in the market
it could be more or it could also be a
lot less and that really leads me to the
question of the day that both companies
are apparently tide which company would
you like to win which company would you
want to be the top smartphone seller in
the world apple or Samsung in my case
ooh that is a very big question and if I
say Apple you'll call me a fanboy and if
I say Samsung you'll call me a fanboy so
leave us a comment tell me what you
think frenzy s you know the drill if we
were to get it was earlier before this
video is Phil mushy follow us on
pocketnow.com and subscribe to our
channel as well it also follow me on
Twitter I'm elders quarterly better
