not ship at all on November 5th we go
through a batch of things that Google
didn't really tell you on its pixel of
that yesterday and we have more teasers
on the huawei mate 10 and now it's
battery I'm Jaime Rivera and today is
another crazy day the only way to get it
done was pre recording yet again this is
pocket out daily
the official loose today begin with
deals to a certain degree if you want a
google pixel - or a Google pixel and you
don't want to use Verizon there is
always the option to go for that
t-mobile bring your pixel deal where you
get two hundred thirty five dollars on a
MasterCard prepaid card if you bring
your pixel so that helps you subsidize
the purchase of a very expensive new
device
now let's go through the things that
Google didn't really tell you at its
event for those of you that heard about
the hole made for Google licensing deal
it starts today there are 26 partners
list this vast you can learn more about
them in the description more important
for those of you that know that the
headphone jack is dying I got questions
on Twitter yeah it's gone you will get a
dongle in the box of the pixel to but
the biggest problem is if you lose that
dollar you want an extra one because
Apple charges for its lightening dongle
ten dollars but Google is going to be
charging twenty-five which just proves
just how much of a mess USBC has become
and it shouldn't be
USB Universal Serial bus a universal now
not everything is bad when it comes to
the things that were not announced
yesterday guess how many years you're
getting of support if you buy a pixel -
in the past there was two years for
Nexus devices or pixel devices but
agreed into the specifications you'll
learn that Google is confirming three
years of support for the pixel to pixel
to excel that is great we're not saying
that it's going to be Apple like where
there are I phones that are being
supported for four years but still three
is better than two now let's move away
from Google let's talk about Huawei what
are the devices that we're highly
anticipating is the May 10 and for those
of you wondering the battery life well
we were expecting the battery to
actually shrink because of the keren 970
and its whole power efficiency that's
being provided but no the battery is
going to be four thousand milliamp hours
according to a teaser today on Twitter
so that phone is going to go from great
battery life on the mate 9 to insane on
the may 10 or at least we hope and
finally the hot news today have to do
with the iPhone 10 and the fact that
we're not even sure you're gonna be able
to get a phone on November 5th the
reason why is because we've got trusted
sources and analysts claiming that yield
rates for production
have dropped to an all-time low 10% that
is insane that's terrible will most
likely see people not being able to
order the phone on October 27 because
well there was you know not enough them
not enough phones for so much the man
where it's actually the fact that Apple
might not be able to supply as many
iPhone sense as it can up until mid to
late December that is terrible it leads
me to the question today I mean I was
thinking yesterday and I wanted to tweet
about this the fact that I don't think
that we've had a year of so many great
phones so much great innovation this
year so would you really wait for the
iPhones and until you know December
January let's just say you're there
pre-ordering in my case I don't think
I'd wait for it I mean look at these new
pixels I was able to order mine
immediately leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
