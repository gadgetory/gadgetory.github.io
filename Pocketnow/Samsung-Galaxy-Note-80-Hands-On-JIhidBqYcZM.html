pocketnow.com michael behind the camera
we are in barcelona 40 2013 mwc samsung
showing off the galaxy note 8.0 for
taking a look at it right now so this is
the galaxy note 80 hardware here we're
taking a look at this 8-inch device will
just take it for a quick hardware tour
very very similar to the note 2 and the
galaxy s3 actually from the back if you
use your imagination a little bit it
looks almost like somebody blew up a
render of the galaxy s3 complete with
the the raised camera hump here but this
is a 5 megapixel camera around the back
this battery cover is not removable but
it does cover up a 4600 milliamp hour
battery underneath you can see the s-pen
hidden away down under here it is kind
of an intermediate size S Pen between
the the one on the node 10 at one and
the note 2 I believe on the right hand
side power stand by volume keys and an
IR blaster which we'll talk about in a
second come around on top just a
headphone jack microSD expands the
onboard memory which can be either 16 or
32 gigs that's expandable via microSD
there's your SIM card slot this is the
pre-production international version and
down below micro USB port looks like
dual speakers flanking those and up
front here of course we have the the
front facing camera sensors and this 8
inch panel before as far as the display
goes this is a 1280 x 800 panel kicking
out a pixel density of 189 PPI it is a
TFT panel and just before I get too far
away from the hardware specs on the
device this is a this is 338 grams and
we'll talk about this in relation to
other tablets in another video but it
feels neither substantial nor flimsy in
the hand it is in that perfect sweet
spot that the the note 2 occupies and
Samsung seems to have continued their
look and feel push with this I mean it's
you can see the hyper glaze coating
picking up my fingerprints very very
readily here you're definitely want to
get a case if you're considering this
device and as well on the front as well
but it's like I say the Samsung was
talking about carrying it as though it
were a journal whereas
we're a small notepad and it does feel
very much like that and on this global
version here you can see the earpiece up
top this can be used as a phone it has
dialer built in I believe we were
running just a second ago yeah there it
is and you can indeed hold it right up
to your head if you want to now that
feature is going to be removed from the
US variant we're told obviously Samsung
could change their mind on that but
we'll talk more about that in a segment
let's talk about Hardware this excuse me
let's talk about software this is a
android for done 12 running a standard
overlay of TouchWiz this is going to be
familiar to anyone who has operated a
Samsung device modern Samsung device as
you can see here not much has changed so
you can get some of the glare off the
screen there but there is some custom
software here most particularly for the
to take advantage of the IR blaster the
S remote is going to allow you to
control your not just samsung TV but
your your regular TV your DVR your
blu-ray player right from the device
which we think is pretty cool so this is
an awesome note and this is the Android
version which is debuting on the note
and the Galaxy Note 80 this was formerly
on another platform of competing
platform but you know Samsung made
mention of the fact that yeah they've
always bundled s note in right so you
can always come into the home screen and
you double tap and you've got your
pop-up best note and you can do all the
kind of fun things that s note gives you
but awesome note brings a whole lot more
features it brings a lot more granular
control just going to ditch that and as
you can see we haven't taken a big tour
of this but you can see just on the home
screen view here the level of control
that you have with this app and the
level of detail you can drill down into
and Samsung there it is with the diary
functionality love love love building in
the ability to use your device whatever
size as a diary so good to see that
that's here obviously we're going to
take a look a little more about this
device will just happen to the browser
here but there's not a whole lot new you
see we've air view functions just the
same as it does on any other device with
the S note and then of course we can do
multi view in here if we're making a
phone call and bring the dialer app here
function with that while we're browsing
you know it's going to be very familiar
to anyone who's used a note device
before and we'll have more in-depth
assertions once we spend some more time
but this is just
quick look the Galaxy Note 8.0 from
samsung announced here at mwc in
Barcelona I'm Michael Fisher pocket now
stay tuned for a lot more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
