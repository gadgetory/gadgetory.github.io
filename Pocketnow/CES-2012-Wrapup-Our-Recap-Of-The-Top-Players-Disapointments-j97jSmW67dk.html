with parking out calm and well just like
we'd begun CES 2012 telling you
everything that we expect it to happen
in the event let's go through the things
that happen the things that didn't and
what disappointed okay so let's start
with the biggest winners of CES 2012 and
we think that the biggest one is AT&amp;amp;T I
mean out of the blue nobody was
expecting AT&amp;amp;T to bring out so many
devices we got six new Android
smartphones and we also got two new when
those phones and all these devices are
4G LTE so it's really great to see that
AT&amp;amp;T brought us some really great budget
devices like for example the pantech
element that probably may not be that
big for you but hey it's a waterproof
device so you're out there for a tablet
for your kids or something that's
probably your best choice you can
actually purchase it with other budget
smartphones for a really good price and
we also got some really good high-end
smartphones from Android like for
example the Sony Xperia ion I was about
to say Ericsson but there you go and
well we also got some really good
windows phone 7.5 devices the HTC Titan
to brings that 4G LTE connectivity to
the Titan design it was a really good
device we brought two hands on of all
these devices and a lil aside from that
we also have the nokia lumia 900 which
we did expect to happen but we were kind
of thinking that 4G LTE wouldn't happen
and it did so the Lumia 900 is also
another hands on that we showed you so
far the device is really good and while
another big winner for CES 2012 is
definitely Microsoft and their nokia
combination i mean speaking of
microsoft's alone was the fact that they
figured out how to get some really good
4g LTE connectivity on their new windows
phones that was something we didn't
think could happen I mean we heard that
hardware software wise the operating
system was not really optimized for a 4G
LTE so we thought we'd have to wait
until probably the Apollo release by the
end of this year now this was really
surprising we were hoping for it but it
was wishful thinking we didn't think it
would really happen now we have the HTC
time to and we also have the nokia lumia
900 now speaking of that lumia 900 we
were expecting the 800 to be released in
the united states and hey we got
something better
900 is a really great device really
great loony 800 design but actually
bigger we reviewed the 800 and it was a
really good device but obviously there
are people out there they want the big
screen and I personally prefer windows
phone 7 on a larger screen so definitely
the Lumia 900 is a compelling device for
a lot of you now speaking of winners we
also got verizon that finally brought us
their motorola droid 4 I mean it was
more like a soap opera waiting for that
device with so many leaks in no phone
but we finally got it it's a really good
razor design that brings you a slide out
keyboard if you're out there for a razor
the motorola droid 4 is definitely your
device if you want the keyboard and also
we got the LG spectrum which brings that
720p display really good design really
good device I really liked it personally
and well we also got that Samsung Galaxy
Tab 7.7 and probably that was probably
the biggest one and for me it was
because the reason why I don't like
7-inch tablet is because you also have
to put up with the bulk of a 7-inch
tablet because they have to fit the
battery and just about everything there
on a smaller sandwich like you see on
for example the kindle fire for the
blackberry playbook but something else
Sampson figured out a way to pull it off
with this Galaxy Tab 7.7 and it's not
plasticky it's really surely a really
good design I wasn't really sure if it
was metal and a knotted look metal it
felt metal but you know they do some
really good things with plastic these
days so could be but it was a really
good design so far was really sleek in
the performance was great so definitely
if you're out there for 7 inch tablet
this most likely should be your next
pick I know it will be for a lot of us
now out of the blue another one that we
got out there we weren't really
expecting anything from with sprint we
got there Samsung Galaxy Nexus brought
for their 4g LTE network and we also got
the LG viper now well you have two
choices you can either go for the higher
end Samsung Galaxy Nexus though it's the
same design and the same device that you
already know that we reviewed and we
also have the LG viper if you're looking
for a mid-tier device that will bring
you stock android 2.3 on your 4g sprint
LTE network now again we weren't really
expecting anything it's good news that
we got it so let's hope they come out
soon because nobody's providing dates I
kind of hate that
and well Intel was also able to deliver
we were not really sure if they were
able to pull some something off with
their intel atom chip for a smartphone
but we did get a device sadly we didn't
get an LG smartphone we got a lenovo
device which we showed you a hands on it
looked really good though well we tried
the prototype and everything worked well
with the prototype but then when you got
the Lenovo phone and then really cut it
there so we are expecting them to polish
their Android UI because the Lenovo you
is kind of weird not really sure when
we're getting this device on the United
States we're getting it in China somehow
one of your in china so we're kind of
waiting to see what happens because
remember last year we got that phone
from LG and Intel that never got
released so sadly it's kind of a hit or
miss let's see if they really pull it
off lenovo seems to be really sold on
this and well let's hope they release it
soon in the United States so far the
specs and like you could see on their
preview I mean the phone really
performed well the prototype at least
let's see what happens and well just
like we started with the biggest winners
let's talk about the biggest losers I
mean honestly we were expecting more
Android devices to be launched 2011 CES
was the event for all androids devices
to be released and sadly we didn't get
that same story in CES 2012 we're
expecting a lot of ice cream sandwich
out there and well we got a lot of
gingerbread that will eventually be
upgraded but that was pretty much it we
didn't get more and then we were also
expecting more from for example t-mobile
and we didn't get anything at least
nothing compelling and then well that
was pretty much it that was CES 2012 in
the mobile spectrum obviously we do have
ctia and we do have mwc that will bring
you more mobile devices let's hope that
all OEM and carriers polish ice cream
sandwich more polish Windows Phone more
to bring us more devices in the future
because well CES was mostly a consumer
electronics show for 3d TVs that was
pretty much the big news here and last
year was more Android so smart TVs were
the thing this year let's see if we get
some more smartphones and tablets in the
next events so this is hien everything
that is signing off from CES 2012 we had
a lot of fun it was a lot of work a lot
of things to cover we hope you enjoy the
hands-on so leave is the comment down
below what things that you like the most
in with things that you not like
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
