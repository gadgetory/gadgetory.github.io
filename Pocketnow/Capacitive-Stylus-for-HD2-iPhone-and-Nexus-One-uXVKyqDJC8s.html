pocket now calm as you probably know a
capacitive touchscreen such as that
found on the HTC hd2 the google nexus
one and the iphone do not respond to a
traditional stylus that is because they
require a change in capacitance to
register a screen press there is an
electrostatic field over all of these
screens and the only way that they know
where you've hit is by a little bit of
electricity in your finger changing the
capacitance of a certain area on the
screen whereas on a resistive
touchscreen it's all done by pressure
and that's why any object including a
stylist will work but if you get a
capacitive stylus such as this one that
I got off of ebay for about five or six
dollars you can actually use a stylus
with any of these devices or any device
that has a capacitive touchscreen let's
take a look so here we have the nexus
one I can easily unlock that the hd2 and
the iphone HTC is actually selling or is
going to be selling an HTC branded
capacitive stylus for use with their
devices although obviously they will
work with any device with a capacitive
touchscreen so why would you want a
capacitive stylus well there are a few
reasons that I can think of first and
foremost is that when you have gloves on
you can't use the touch screen on your
capacitive touchscreen device and having
a capacitive stylus in your pocket when
you're wearing gloves will really help
out with that another way that a
capacitive stylus helps is when you're
doing any sort of painting application
or you're doing handwriting recognition
so we can scroll down here to say the
notes application and sort of
demonstrate this we can write something
with our finger like hey and it's not
very precise on a capacitive screen we
can be a little bit better when we use a
capacitive stylus but not chip not much
better it's not perfect because
capacitive touchscreens aren't
particularly precise so i'll post a link
on pocketnow.com on how to get this
capacitive stylus it's very inexpensive
and as you can see it works quite well
to operate the screen that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
