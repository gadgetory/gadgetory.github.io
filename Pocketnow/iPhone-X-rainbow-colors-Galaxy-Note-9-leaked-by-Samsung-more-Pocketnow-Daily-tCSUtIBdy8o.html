LCD iPhone will come in a rainbow of
colors one of Samsung's support pages
just pretty much went live to show us
everything we want to know about the
note 9 and foldable smartphone rumors
are back but this time by LG I'm hi
meadow Iveta and I hope you're enjoying
your holidays by the way thank you so
much for your support with the Spanish
Channel already 1000 subs in three days
you can subscribe in the blink that I
will post right here this is pocket out
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for a
smartphone that's extremely affordable
okay the original Google pixel considers
to be one of the ugliest phones that we
still recommend most right now the 128
gigabyte variant is just three hundred
and eighty dollars at B&amp;amp;H and these guys
of vnh have got some awesome deals you
can learn more in the description now
let's talk about foldable phones
apparently we're not done with that
topic even if we haven't seen one yet
seems that LG has a patent from many
years ago that apparently will make it
to the market at some point there's this
pen designed for a hinge that makes it
look more like the way the surface book
closes where it doesn't fully close and
apparently there are a couple of ideas
there like snapping the phone in your
front pocket and you're you know shirt
pocket and being able to use that for
video while you're walking and yeah
apparently that is going to be a thing
we just don't know when now let's talk
about the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 this is
one of the phones we are highly
anticipating and it seems that web sites
in Europe are anticipating it so much
they just published the support page you
can see it there in gold and in other
color options we see mostly design you
know the horizontal camera fingerprint
scanner where it's supposed to be
thinner bezels can't wait to see more we
will keep you posted now let's move the
spotlight over to the iPhone whatever
that number is going to be in 2019 we've
got some sources now that was claiming
that one of the major pushes in
technology for next year is going to be
triple July oh I almost got confused
there were three cameras on the next
iPhone mainly because apparently the
company wants to take a are seriously
even more they're doing a great job
where they are KITT but we're gonna get
three cameras for
better deaf sensing in addition to
better optical zoom never the case maybe
it seems three cameras is the way to go
thank you I await p20 probably and
finally the hottest news today come from
one of the most trusted sources when it
comes to iPhone rumors when she quo we
hear that yes the LCD iPhone is going to
come in a rainbow of colors that include
white gold in addition to others the
list is actually kind of asked which is
great but for those of you that want
colors on the other iPhones iPhone 10
2018 and the iPhone 10 plus apparently
you're stuck with Space Gray and a
probable black and gold in addition to
the current silver it's really hard to
predict what the color options are going
to be for the other iPhones but yeah
color options are going to be about this
LCD variant which is the theme that
Apple has followed since iPods but in
the question today let us know what
colors make you want to use an iPhone 10
an LCD or an iPhone 9 an LCD whatever
that name will be or would you prefer
the typical colors cuz in my case got
that red one plus 6 has me wanting red
