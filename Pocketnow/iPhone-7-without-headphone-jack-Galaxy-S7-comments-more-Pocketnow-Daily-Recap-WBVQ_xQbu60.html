okay so but that means I got thumbs down
your comment because I didn't like what
i read two out of high man introduced
with the drinking joke read the news and
with a whatever ravenna multiple times
and you know you almost got it right
you're actually just missing one tiny
little bit who writes your jokes best
voice are they that bad that's right
it's that time of the week I am high net
event this is pocket now and this is the
point out daily recap the last week sun
monday the news were about the iphone 7
there were rumors about a device without
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and i
asked you if that is important to you we
had 1479 comments thanks a lot guys they
better offer some really good wireless
ear pots then and you know audio files
will tell you that it's not the same
audio quality in yada yada yada there is
a protocol over the lightning cable and
obviously audio files are not going to
like that as well I'm not an audio file
so i'll just take bluetooth headset as
well just like you terrible idea and on
another note i hate the been impossible
thing that apple and other aliens are
doing I want a big battery wait more
than a thin phone you know I do value
the thin design as phones get bigger
like for example I'm using the galaxy s6
edge+ the phone is just so thin that
regardless of how big it is you really
don't feel it that way in your hand
that's extremely important but then
again yeah not at the expense of battery
life focusing on slim design by
sacrificing an important part of the
devices just plain dumb eliminating the
headphone jack would feel more like i'm
downgrading instead of upgrading to a
better phone how the heck would like
charge and use headphones at the same
time the saddest part is that people
will have bought it and say it's
innovation and brilliant and you know
what hey the Oppo r5 then the dude
headphone jack many windows mobile
devices that include headphone jack and
as a matter of fact the headphone jack
returned with the first generation
iphone to smartphones i do get your
point i just i don't feel that it's a
downgrade i feel that the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack is old and i do agree
with you i don't want that same adapter
mandala
that Apple has like with the first
macbook I feel that there should be a
new 3.5 millimeter headphone jack that's
thinner I think that should be the
future obviously there will be a
transition towards that and there should
be adapters for that the beginning but I
do feel that we should not just use one
port in your defense but then again I do
feel that phones can get thinner and the
protocol and evolved I'm Tuesday well we
had more news about iphone prototypes
you heard that there was one without a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack another
with a touch ID embedded in the display
then we had another with the USB type-c
and so many other cases and I asked you
which one of all would you pick is
apparently this was not just one phone
we had 625 comments we start with
fingerprint scanner on the display it
would be crazy awesome and after a few
months samsung with to the same and I
would love that too particularly because
iphones have terrible bezels they really
need to evolve in that as displays and
devices get larger I feel that that is
the way to go for Apple to continue with
their whatever one hand the usability
mentality and I think that would be the
smarter prototype 2 I choose the one
using USB type-c but I can't see Apple
ditching lightning connectors just yet
and you know even though USB type-c is
more usable than the Lightning port I
don't see Apple doing that as well at
least not now I'd vote for that iphone
prototype with a huge battery in micro
SD card slot which there was any if
existed but really USB type-c should be
a standard everywhere and my humble
opinion and I also like the idea of a
fingerprint scanner on the display 3
touch for multiple fingers sounds a bit
cumbersome though and yes there was
another prototype that will allow multi
touch with 3d touch and just think about
that you'd have to force touch with two
fingers or three fingers and yes that
was cumbersome but again I don't feel a
USB type-c is happening particularly
because well lightning is actually a
business there is a built for iphone
protocol and obviously the Lightning
port has a lot to do with that an apple
makes money over that Wednesday the news
were about the recent CEO swaps at
Samsung and what the company was doing
to pick itself up even though it wasn't
on the floor and I asked you what would
you change from future Galaxy smartphone
that could help Samsung regain its
limelight we had eleven hundred and
thirty-eight comments thanks a lot again
guys we start with the launch less
phones and you know that if somebody
made a point yesterday that was
extremely important in the comments the
biggest problem when you have so many
galaxy phones that use the galaxy brand
is that you dilute the mindset of the
consumer and they don't see galaxy
phones its premium because obviously
there are a lot of cheap galaxy phones
out there so in that mentality in that
retrospect I feel that if either Samsung
would rebound rebrand their lower end
phones and keep the galaxy lineup for
the expensive ones I think that that
would be a smart idea or then just
launched less phones as you say am singh
running stock android would definitely
make me consider getting one of their
products and you know i felt that way
about android kitkat and before that and
then after that lollipop even though
looking good doesn't really perform any
better so I kind of disagree i feel that
touch was this perform really well with
these new batch of galaxies IPS rating
expandable storage no TouchWiz and maybe
some sort of a 3d touch up keep dreaming
but because Apple is doing it it could
be the case then on Thursday the news
were about how many people were
switching from androids to iphones after
the launch of the iphone success which
is another record and i asked you why do
you think people are moving away from
android devices towards iphones lately
and we broke records 2717 comments
that's a first by the way thanks a lot
guys we start with people switching to
the iphone because it's a seem simple to
use and also good show off accessory in
developing countries and that is the
case at least in my country and in
developing countries i do agree a lot of
people feel that the iphone is a status
symbol and even though it's not a better
product it is something last year in
society sadly people are switching to
the iphone because it's an iphone it's
nothing more than just a status symbol I
thought is really really overpriced
device that's why people think that if
they have an iphone in their hand they
can chalk their rich yeah again the
status symbol argument but it's not only
happening with iPhones there are other
phones like the new batch
galaxy phones the edge devices are also
something that's sort of a status symbol
I do get your point I just most of these
switchers were in the United States I
don't feel that that's necessarily the
case in the United States people please
please remember that Android is on very
cheap devices many people in my area own
cheap Android and most give Android a
bad reputation because if the first
experience with Android is cheap laggy
outdated and just fat clearly not the
case with flecks of androids so they
think that the high-end Android would be
the same save money and switch to iOS
you have a very very interesting point
yes here in this country where i live on
you can find android devices for forty
dollars fifty dollars and i'm not
talking about android 1 i'm talking
about basic android so the performance
is terrible displays are bad and you're
right people have a very bad mindset
about android because of the way it's
just deluded on very cheap products the
same happens with windows phone because
the most popular Lumias are the very
cheap ones and yeah there's nothing
aspirational about android because of
that you make a very solid point and i
feel that apple has nailed that down
particularly because they're cheap
phones suck by the way and then finally
friday i asked you if you'd like to do
microsoft we had Steve Ballmer on record
complaining about the new microsoft
saying that their mentality and what
they're doing is not the right thing and
yeah I want to know if you like the new
one or the old one under steve ballmer
we had 413 comments we start with i
think the new microsoft is amazing
windows 10 the Lumias cortana xbox game
sales surface pro service book just
amazing yes i think everybody at pocket
now agrees this new breath at microsoft
is just awesome a lot of innovation
really great products things that I'm
sure Microsoft that could feel proud of
because we consumers like them that is a
really good way to start Steve Ballmer
is a price clown it's because of him
that Microsoft is such in such dire
position in the smartphone OS space
anyone who listens to him is and I'm not
even going to say that but you do have a
solid point Steve Ballmer completely
underestimated a lot of things and you
made a lot of jokes out of them out of
which some of these are mean
others are just hilarious points on
YouTube oh you're right it's sadly he's
not really famous for making Microsoft
any better but you have to remember that
he was pretty much in charge of
Microsoft for a good amount of time even
during the Bill Gates days it was really
Ballmer that was doing a lot of the
stuff Satya is doing a great job
Microsoft is being presented in a fresh
breath of air people want microsoft
products now and there is innovation
steve is times over he's so 90s and
actually it would be so 2000s but you're
right Satya Nadella has infused a lot of
very positive changes some negative like
for example the layoffs I don't like I
feel that Microsoft is making enough
money to have kept its people but then
again at least they're focusing on
things and they're doing them right I'm
actually using Microsoft Outlook now
something I would have not considered a
year ago I had such a bad mindset about
Microsoft products because of the whole
tarnish the King from the stoop all are
they so again I feel it's not just still
has a lot more to do to clean up the
mess that was left but I feel that
things are going in the right direction
true that's it for the parking out daily
