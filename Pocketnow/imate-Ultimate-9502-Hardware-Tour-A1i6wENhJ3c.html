pocketnow.com and now we're going to
take a tour of the
aware of the I'm eight ultimate 9502
let's start on the front the screen is
2.8 inches across same size as the Titan
to for example and it's vga resolution
around the screen we have this polished
metal finish which really makes it look
high quality and lets you see the the
outline of the screen kind of glisan
when you turn it around at the top here
we have a hardware button for mail
messaging and a button for pocket
Internet Explorer to the right of that
we have the front-facing video camera
for video calls we have an LED indicator
light that you just saw blink there and
this of course is the speaker for audio
when you're on a call moving to the
bottom we have a four-way d-pad with a
select button in the center call start
and end key start menu button ok button
and they really awkwardly placed a soft
key soft key set of buttons so if I turn
on the device you see that not quite
lined up turning over to the side we
have a scroll wheel a very very welcomed
addition we like to see a scroll wheel
and it's actually got a inward
functionality so you could select things
with this as well and let me show you
how fast it Scrolls because I like the
speed I think it's good so I'm gonna go
into my contacts here and goes pretty
fast I like it to the right of that we
have the ok button another ok button in
addition to this one then we have the
wireless communication manager shortcut
button and then we have a mini USB port
this is used for syncing charging and
for the TV out functionality on the top
we have the stylus silo kind of outlined
in this polished metal look with the on
and off switch on the right here it's
got this interesting leather texture I
don't think it's actually leather I
think it's plastic and I'm not sure if I
like it it's actually a little bit tacky
it doesn't show up anywhere else on the
device except for the bottom the stylus
is a collapsible stylus unfortunately
and it feels kind of cheap it's got a
little bit of wiggle to it to the other
side of the device
flip it over here we have a volume up
and down button a button to record voice
notes and a camera button now the camera
button actually has two actions one
halfway down to focus and one all the
way down to take the picture and over
here we have a 2.5 millimeter headphone
jack which is good but it's not the
standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
but 2.5 is better than having to use
headphones through the mini USB port
with an adapter so so that's good
turning over to the back we have the 3
megapixel camera the camera has a
mechanical autofocus which is very
powerful and I think it works very well
we have a fill light which will turn on
to light the area around the picture and
then we have a speaker to the bottom
here we have a button that will slide
over to open the back and if we open the
back it will reveal the slot awkwardly
placed for the micro SD micro SD card I
guess it's better than being behind the
battery but still it would be great if
it was you know along the bottom or
along the top or something like other
devices and to put this lid back on you
have to position it at 60 degrees or
else it won't go in but you get kind of
used to it so it's not that big of a
deal if we slide open the keyboard it's
got a fantastic spring assist we see
this small keyboard that I talked about
in the unboxing video in the upper right
corner here we have the soft reset hole
so it's it's within reach so you don't
have to open the back to get to it and
that's good and it feels high-quality
when you open up the screen but you kind
of get a little bit of wiggle room here
I don't know if you can see that and if
you shake it like so you can almost hear
it click back and forth it's not it's
not bad but it's noticeable and you
shouldn't have this wiggle room on an
eight-hundred-dollar phone and that's it
for the hardware tour the i-mate
