calm i just got back from nice little
18t vin at the great little restaurant
called the rosa mexicano and i came back
with this nice little box so let's see
what's inside that
alright so here we go so yeah Samsung
Infuse 4G X orange box got some text
over here comes with a two gig micro SD
card some other things and we have hspa+
4.5 inch amoled plus display android 2.2
8-megapixel camera 1.3 megapixel front
camera so let's just check it out here
we are thank you for purchasing go to
there for some tutorials a little quick
start guide nice quality there see how
we can do our battery insert sim use the
phone little diagrams that are cool and
here's the device okay get out there
well that's nice we got labels for our
buttons and what do we have here another
little listing of some things we got
micro USB oh sorry micro SD card adapter
oh free $25 Sampson media up credit
that's cool don't copy this code if your
manual
and we have right USB cable and this
appears to be ah ah good good good this
is your HD TV adapter so look at that
nice hdmi port and this is my crew just
be on that end so you need it hdmi cable
oh and look at that there's a micro USB
there for power if you want to charge at
the same time very nice great that
that's included we have some headphones
with those a little rubbery as for the
years I don't find that comfortable but
you got different sizes and you got a
little button for answering a little
microphone there's your headphones and
here is your charger whether USB port
and that looks like it okay so let's do
some quick size comparisons this is a
really really thin very nice I'd start
with the samsung galaxy s 4g on t-mobile
so there you go a little bit thinner
much bigger screen much taller device of
course and as you're stacked a little
bit extra edge over here look at the hd7
with its 4.3 inch screen versus the 4.5
inch screen over here
see that's thinner there and I guess
we'll look at the nokia n8 this
obviously has much smaller screen so
there you go we are going to take this
through its paces and let you know how
it is that's it for now
