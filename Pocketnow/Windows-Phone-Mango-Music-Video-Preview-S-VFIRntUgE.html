and you're watching a windows phone
mango preview all right this time let's
look at the music and videos hub now we
can see the background is a lot darker
now so that makes the foreground stuff
easier to read but you see less of the
artists no artwork back there and we see
a little bit of the reorganization
history now scrolls vertically so you
can get a lot more stuff in there and
same with the new section those are
different here's a app section and now
they're play button is down here and
there's a little menu so you can search
the marketplace the music library is
pretty much the same see everything like
that videos and podcasts very similar to
the for now one thing that I was hoping
for is tap and hold and add to now plain
but that is not there thurs however a
pin to start and a place mark djmix
smart DJ is a pre awesome feature
inherited from the zune HD and I'm going
to play that right now so what this is
doing picking music from the marketplace
just turn this down and if I look at the
list you can see some of them have a
little icon right there that means that
those are coming from the marketplace
streaming through zune and the regular
ones are ones that I already have on the
phone memory so it is doing a big mix
finding stuff that might go with this
artist combine in there so that's really
cool now while we're here this is the
new player screen
I'm gonna see the play and next and
previous buttons i move to the top the
reason for this is if I am in a
different program and I press the volume
button the buns are in the same place so
they're always in the same place so you
can remember where there and it's easy
to access and remember by motor memory
there's also menu down here so you got
please smart DJ mix again more in the
marketplace save as playlist and share
so share is good it is love let me do
this one they'll send a link to the zoo
net page for that artist and the song so
that's really nice for sharing the stock
people can preview it if they don't have
zune pass or if they do a zoom past they
can stream it right there so that's
really cool and here's something else
that I want to show you let's get some
if I am my screen is locked there's the
lock screen oh wow look at that that's
the artists are coming through and we
have our buttons on the lock screen I'm
going to the next song quite again
she doesn't have an artwork and it is
changing there we go
you see it changing there in the lock
screen so that's some really cool stuff
okay I must be streaming on Zune on the
other desktop so it's not really
connecting to the zune marketplace very
well so back in here videos still play
really well you can now skip so
thankfully that feature has come and of
course there's TV with music all sorts
of sections and let's get to an artist
page where were we there's another new
feature the artist page now has a
related artist section so we've already
we've had bio for smart DJ buttons new
there so I can see what artists are
related to this artists that I might
also like so you can go to him and then
you can see what's related to him so
this is a really cool way to find new
music that's about it for the music and
videos hub and player be sure to check
out pocket now calm for our full windows
phone mango preview with more pictures
text and videos that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
