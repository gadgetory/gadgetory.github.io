bring transits iOS Maps the Moto X and
HTC one mini have finally made it to
AT&amp;amp;T and believe it or not Steve Ballmer
is retiring from Microsoft I'm hi Mary
vera and what do you guys think would be
a decent salary for the next CEO of
Microsoft I mean you never know right
this is fuckin hell daily let's start
stay off with the official news is a TNT
has just launched their moto x LG
optimus g pro and get this even the HTC
One mini which is interesting since we
didn't get any precedent or anything
they just launched the phone just like
that but anyways listen the description
for the reviews of all these phones are
all really good bones but in the case of
me honestly the Moto X is way up there
in comparison to the others leave us a
comment down below are you in the market
for any of these and speaking of the
Moto X of Motorola VPS just confirmed
that if you want this phone on the other
carriers they should be coming there in
the next couple of days and he didn't
say weeks or later this month or later
this year he set the next coming day so
you can expect it very soon but aside
from that if you're interested in
getting this phone with a wooden back
plate well apparently they'll cost you
fifty dollars extra whenever that's
gonna happen in q4 I just don't find the
idea of a wooden phone to be cheesy but
I don't know about you guys now let's
talk about Apple as the company has just
purchased them bark and no this is
actually not a verb that's the name of a
company that's famous for their public
transit since you know it seems that
Apple thinks that the only thing we
hated about Apple maps was the fact that
it didn't include public transit it's
still hard to know when the
collaboration will begin between these
two companies hopefully soon and
hopefully Apple starts fixing the rest
of everything that's wrong with Apple
maps which is everything actually and
for those of you waiting for
Notification Center to reach Windows
Phone will according to some trusted
reports apparently it will be part of
GTR 3 we don't know when Windows Phone
gdr3 is going to be launched probably
sometime in the fall but yeah apparently
we are getting Notification Center but
aside from that speaking of gdr3 Nokia
is just pretty much leaked the
information of what their software
package will be called for ddr3 and it's
be called bittersweet shimmer um I don't
know why these companies come up with
these names I mean why don't you call it
codename five or codename 10 or 12 I
mean there's only one number that's
called 12 in the market why are you
gonna give it a name like bittersweet
shimmer anyways and finally for the
unbelievable news of the day yes Steve
Ballmer has just confirmed that he will
be retiring a CEO of Microsoft with the
next 12 months or as soon as they can
find the replacement and by the way that
replacement committee is already working
and it's being led by none other than
Bill Gates himself it's fair the company
is out for desperate measures I mean
they're financially okay but sadly their
products are not windows 8 windows phone
8 have not been the success that they
want and they want to become a products
and services company as Ballmer says in
his memo so far the xbox is the only
successful product that they have but
anyways that leads you to the question
of the day how do you feel about Steve
Ballmer's retirement do you think it's a
positive or a negative thing for
Microsoft in my particular case honestly
he was a great business administrator a
great sales guy but sadly microsoft
needs a products person like Bill Gates
and sadly this was not a products person
and honestly in my particular case I
would love it for Bill Gates to come
back but leave us a comment down below
how do you feel and guys as always you
know the drill if you want an earlier
