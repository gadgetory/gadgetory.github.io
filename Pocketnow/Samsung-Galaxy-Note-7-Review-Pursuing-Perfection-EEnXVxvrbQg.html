Samsung has taken all the complaints
that received from the note 5 then later
built on a success of the s7 edge and
combine both to launch its next
generation of tablet killer the company
claims to have reached meaningful
progress but does that mean that it's
meaningful to you I'm high metal matter
with PocketNow and let's find out in our
Samsung Galaxy Note 7 review brought to
you by deep brand Pacquiao's galaxy note
7 coverage is made possible by dbrand
manufacturer of precision cut vinyl
skins for smartphones tablets and other
gadgets go to deep brand comm slash
galaxy to pimp out your new galaxy note
7 following the trend that began last
year samsung has brought all the look in
the feel of the S line up to the note
lineup though this time with more added
kick than just a stylist this means
amazing build quality provided by the
7000 series aluminum trim but then
boosted by Gorilla Glass 5 on the front
and back instead of before that's
brought by its siblings instead of
launching to phablets like last year in
2016 the curves found their way back to
the note as an essential part of the
gorgeous 5.7 inch quad HD AMOLED display
that brings this phone to life the
device even includes a new md ni each
chip from the samsung TV business that
improves HDR video reproduction where
available and even when it's not the
color reproduction is stunning and the
edge leads to a bezel s appearance that
just makes this phone look so real
samsung claims that the contour was
specifically made to not affect the
Wacom digitizer that enables the s-pen
input and that does hold true the curves
also extend to the back and the trim is
actually less pronounced than that of
its siblings so at times it feels like
if you're holding a phone that's fully
made of glass even though that glass is
also a fingerprint magnet those of you
wondering why these curves are essential
need to remember just how beefy the
Galaxy Note 5 and the galaxy note 4 felt
in the hand
but new galaxy note 7 by contrast is
just as large but feels far more
ergonomic and the combination of elegant
color options along with the click enos
of both the buttons and the s-pen I'll
point to a very premium product in every
aspect now where the note 7 didn't grow
to better its siblings is under the hood
we've got the same Snapdragon 820 or
Exynos 88-90 of the s7 lineup along with
the same four gigs of ram it also brings
the same ip68 water and does resistance
even though the battery is comparable at
3500 milliamp hours it stands between
the s7 siblings over a larger chassis
which is just ironic though fast and
wireless charging still made the cut
improvements come with a new USBC port
more of a standard but not really an
improvement to the fast charging that's
included the base storage is now 64 gigs
and also expandable via microSD
addressing one of the biggest complaints
of last year but the coolest improvement
that Samson clearly perfected is this
new iris scanner the benefits behind
this feature were so vast that we had to
film a separate video but let's just say
that it's faster to register and unlock
the phone of the fingerprint scanner and
it's also insured to only work for you
as the service only allows one pair of
irises I went to the degree of trying to
fool the iris scanner with a video of my
eyes and even a photo and the infrared
camera was not fooled at all so we get
why Samsung is telling everyone that
this is the new way of mobile secure
banking while some of you might want to
stick to the average fingerprint scanner
or password it'll take a day with gloves
or what fingers for you to know just how
useful this feature can be obviously
this new blend of hardware brings a mix
of old and new to the software
department the particular case of the
iris scanner enables a new secure folder
that allows you to store media and even
a separate copy of applications for you
to log in separately in a private way
though this doesn't really limit you to
the iris scanner we do recommend that
you use it just to ensure that it's
private only to you other improvements
come from Sam's ex new redefine UX which
has a farm
our subtle appealed in previous software
builds in addition to smoother
transitions that make the experience
feel very fluid ganas Samsung's focus on
replacing icons for text and it's then
we find fields for searching just about
everything all around the interface we
even notice a new blue light filter for
a more delightful experience using the
phone at night and one of the most
practical settings menus in the industry
the whole purpose according to Samsung
is to provide a frictionless experience
for the user and that's the perfect way
to describe it if that user interface is
not enough for you head on over to the
themes store where the approach is far
more useful now instead of the
all-or-nothing approach of old you can
now select things separately like for
example your own wallpaper or theme or
icon pack even though there are more
price tags now than there were before
Samsung's always-on display is also
growing up to accommodate new designs
and colors and you now have the option
to get notification icons for
third-party applications which you can
sometimes glance at with a DoubleTap on
the display though that depends if you
have the iris scanning feature on or off
about the S Pen you're greeted by new
hardware that's now more precise and
feels more natural than ever even if the
software mimics a lot of what you could
do last year say for some bonus added
features like gif or Jif creation and
the fact that the bevy of notetaking
applications from the past are now
consolidated into one but this is just
another one of those features that
required a separate video slide from the
right and you've got the exact same
software features that you found on the
S Evan edge providing quick shortcuts
for your favorite applications contacts
tasks useful tools and a bevy of other
edge features that you can install or
buy separately for the note 7 proves to
be better is that we do notice that
there is a degree of palm rejection when
using the interface which is a welcome
surprise given how annoying it was to
not have this on the galaxy s7 edge and
then the same old features that we love
from Galaxy phones make a return like
split-screen multitasking ahead of
Android nougat and Samsung's game
launcher to also say
the day whenever you're playing games
without killing things with your
navigation keys and you bet the gameplay
is just as blazing as we come to expect
from a Snapdragon 820 processor over all
the software experience proves to be an
Android power users dreamboat so long as
you have the time to dig over everything
this phone can do now at the event
Samson claimed that the main selling
point for the Galaxy Note 7 was to build
the film that works the way we live and
in that respect the blend of high-end
hardware and productivity software goes
very far but needs may vary I've used
the Galaxy Notes ins version 2 because
the focus does appeal to me personally
our daily routine involves a lot of
content sharing so for me it's easier to
use smart capture when I want instead of
taking a full screen shot of things and
later having to crop them scripting
reviews involves a lot of notes and we
test products continuously so it's great
to be able to just pull out the s pen
and write a note instead of having to
unlock the phone look for the note
taking application and write things down
at times I need to describe what changes
I'd like to make to a scenery so instead
of fumbling with a text description I
just rather take a photo and draw over
it I know that some of these features
can be achieved with third-party
applications on any other phone but the
experience of a phone built around this
is far superior and then there are the
things that the Galaxy Note 7 can do
that other phones just can't do like the
exclusive secure folder that comes along
with the iris scanning features and of
course there's the fact that you can't
really use a notepad when it's wet and
most likely that notepad won't survive
whereas in the galaxy note 7 you
actually can use the phone when wet and
you can also use the s-pen when wet and
then the sherry topper continues to be
the camera Samsung once again doesn't
disappoint we've got the same optically
stabilized 12 megapixel shooter with F
1.7 aperture match with a 5-megapixel
selfie shooter that shares the same
aperture Samsung has also redone the
user interface to rely more on swipes
than buttons to make quicker interaction
the results are as expected just
stunning
Samsung Galaxy smartphones have taken
the cake this year for the best color
saturation deep contrast amazing
low-light quality and great
stabilization regardless of its day or
night now obviously our own Wan collars
back nail wood Shimon back very soon
with this full camera review as you'll
notice that the saturation can go a
little overboard in colors like red for
example video recording has also brought
the same great stabilization that we
love from the galaxy s7 lineup and about
the only complaint that we have is that
even though HDR video is mentioned well
we can't really bind the feature that
tells us that HDR video is being
recorded all we know is that it works
only in 1080p at 30 frames per second
now obviously not everything is perfect
and there are features that still need
some work like the case of the
translator usually people need to
translate a full block of text making it
easier for you to copy everything to
Google Translate instead of going
word-for-word hovering and then in the
case of Samsung notes while we do
praised this new holistic approach it
would be awesome if these notes would
talk to each other between pen input and
typing which currently doesn't happen
like we see in Microsoft OneNote and
then there is the biggest caveat of what
you'll need in order for a phone to
replace a full notepad and that's
endurance we've tested the Verizon
Galaxy Note 7 for a week in New York
City and the results were average giving
us at most four hours of screen on time
now it could have to do with the fact
that the verizon network is not as
powerful in the sector of Queens where I
live where I've usually only get around
2 bars of signal at most a clear example
was through call quality where it was a
little spotty every now and then even
though data speeds were average on
download and not that great at all on
upload and then something that was also
surprising was a less powerful and
expected speaker which wasn't terrible
by any means but also not as strong as
the s7 siblings
it's time for a showdown again the word
average would be the best way to
describe it still for the smallest of
shortcomings it's really hard to even
consider comparing the Galaxy Note 7
against other smartphones sure our round
of comparisons will follow this review
as you know we do but it's really hard
to find another phone with this level of
build quality a camera this great and
the set of software features that can
compete about the only thing that we
could say would hold anyone back is the
hefty price tag but then if you compare
this phone to an iPhone 6s plus at 64
gigs or even the galaxy s7 edge well
let's just say that once you do punch
the numbers you'll notice that the
Galaxy Note 7 is on a league of its own
and where we could safely say that
you're getting more for your money and
the best of the best overall this video
