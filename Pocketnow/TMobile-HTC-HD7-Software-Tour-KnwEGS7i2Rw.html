com next up is our software tour of the
hd7 from t-mobile so here we are at the
start screen on the t mobile hd7 and
what you get when the carrier's
customized phone the first four panels
are tiles rather have to be microsoft
chosen ones the next four can be
customized by the carrier so t-mobile
chose these and then as you scroll down
the next ones are microsoft chose and
tiles and then you got some more down
here that our t-mobile chosen and HTC
chosen so I didn't install any other
programs on here I didn't do any
customizations all I did was log in with
my live ID and maybe set up a couple
emails so you see it comes with Netflix
that's pre-loaded you can see that and
you're gonna have to log in you can see
this other places I don't have an
account so we'll just skip that you got
slacker radio again you gotta have an
account I believe I do have one but I
don't remember it anyway it's the same
as anything else you download for a
slacker radio here's some special ones t
mobile TV this one is only available on
t-mobile windows phone 7 devices however
it is basically mobitv
in Windows Phone 7 version and you can
pay ten dollars a month for all the
premium channels or if you don't
subscribe there's a few free channels
then here we can see the ones without
the dollar sign next to them can be free
so there you go streams pretty nicely
here those speakers we're going to
compare those to the HTC surround later
and then over here we have family room
this is a specialty mobile app you can
associate multiple windows phone seven
devices with your family so you can
share a calendar here's the notes
chalkboard calendar those pictures and
media share them with your family so I
can focus so basically you create an
account to start a family room and then
you send an invite code to your family
members and they need Windows Phone 7
devices on t-mobile in order for this to
work so we don't have any of those
besides this one next you got microsoft
things and we got tone f
there's that loading this is the first
time it's been launched so might take a
little longer and say yes allow it
accept the Terms of Use and we got to
pay for it you can do a day pass or your
3 3 3 30 days anyway that's going to be
the same as tell Nava on the 18 t2 Isis
and let's see if there's anything else
here we got family room at flicks is
pre-installed office of course is there
and that's about it we also got the HTC
hub obviously from HTC
adil load
and we got basic stuff however this
looks like something new for tmobile my
account app free access to your tmobile
account check minutes or messages so
that's something important I think that
should have been pre-installed
okay so that's about it for what's
included on the t-mobile version of the
HTC hd7 thanks for watching thumbs up if
you liked this video and that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
