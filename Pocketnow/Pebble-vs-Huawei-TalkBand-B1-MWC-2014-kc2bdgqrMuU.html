pocketnow.com and I am still at huawei
and this is a place where you don't have
to wear a jacket because it's too hot
but we've got a comparison video that I
know a lot of you are going to be
looking forward to we have the first
generation pebble and we also have the
huawei talk then be one let's go through
it okay so here's the deal this is a
smart watch this is sort of a Fitbit
product but this thing can do more
things in this one and vice versa as
well for example one of the advantages
of the pebble is that it's a work in
progress meaning you can change your
watch phases to whatever you want you
can install other applications to bring
additional services into your pebble you
can pair with just about anything and
then last for a full weeks so it's a
good product you don't like the watch
bands you could just change your arm
bands as well and obviously I have to
find a cheap one because I can find a
metallic one for this one in my country
but now when we come to the talk band
there is a reason why this is a talk
band and it's the reit the fact that you
can remove this and make this a
bluetooth headset so if I get a call on
my phone I could just take the call from
here and that's pretty much it you get a
multiple display that actually works
even when this is disconnected from the
you'll notice that everything pretty
much works there's only one button here
and you get the information for your
sleep that as the PR agency was telling
us works even when you don't tell it
that you're sleeping it knows that
you're sleeping somehow and then you
also get the time of day the fact that
you're paired or not and you get the
information of the amount of stuff that
you take and you have a pedometer here
so the only difference between these
products and the disadvantage between
this talk band is the fact that it is
that and that's it you can't really
adjust it in any way I hope they have
bigger sizes because this barely fits me
but another advantage that you have with
this talk band is you have a USB
connector right here and you need a
proprietary connector for the case of
the pebble regardless of what pebble you
have so again this is high meadow better
with pocketnow.com Tony behind the
camera
what I recommend that you get this or
this it depends on you i love the fact
that you can make phone calls with this
thing but we'll be back with more
coverage very shoe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
