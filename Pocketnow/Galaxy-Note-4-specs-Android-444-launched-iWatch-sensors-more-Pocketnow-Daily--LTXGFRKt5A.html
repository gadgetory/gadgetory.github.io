samsung galaxy note or emerge google
launches android for dot for dot for to
the surprise of many and could it be
that nokia wants to launch their x2
already I'm hi Marilee that and at the
time of the recording of this video my
country was still in the world cup and
I'm crossing my fingers this is
out daily let's begin today with some of
the official news as Android for not for
not for was released today by Google and
its really interesting as nobody was
expecting and I mean we are just a
couple of days away from google i/o and
we get a software update and according
to some internal sources the update is
just some security patch is really
nothing major so it should be pushed to
all Nexus devices and hopefully it will
reach whatever Google edition devices
are out there though stay tuned as they
are expecting a newer version of Android
to launch next week in other official
news Microsoft has just launched this
much expected surface pro 3 in Microsoft
stores today though there is a catch you
can only buy the core i5 model today and
if you want the core i3 or core i7 model
you'll have to wait till August now why
is this bad well remember that the
surface pro 3 is being retailed at
different price points but the core i5
model starts at nine nine nine a
thousand bucks if you want to buy this
thing so yeah if you want the cheaper
model you'll have to wait now a very
interesting rumor is that even though
the nokia X was launched at mwc 2014 to
not much fanfare it is a cool product
but not where it should be just yet
apparently Milkha wants to launch the
Nokia x2 next week now obviously this is
still a rumor it's not very much
confirmed what exactly are we expecting
all we have is a banner as part of the
league so stay tuned hopefully they
figure it out this time how about a
better display let's talk about apple
and specifically the i watch as the wall
street journal is already reporting what
to expect from this product first of all
apparently the launch in october so
apparently the iphone 6 will launch in
September and apparently this i watch
will have 10 sensors ten different
sensors in order to figure out your help
tracking etc so really interesting to
see what we can expect though obviously
iOS 8 could tell us a lot in the future
betas
and finally for the very hot news of the
day benchmarks now reveal what to expect
on the samsung galaxy note 4 a lot of
people have been asking you this on
twitter yes i do want this phone first
of all apparently will have a 2k display
three gigs of ram 32 gigs of storage
aside from the fact that this will
apparently be the first 64-bit processor
Exynos processor on a Samsung product
and the Android product per se though
obviously there is a lot of time from
here to eat by where we expect this
product to be launched aside from other
details links in description for what to
expect from this product but that leads
you to the question of the day is the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 the phone you're
waiting for this year because in my
particular case it is though I'm really
curious to see what new form factor
Samsung plans to bring as they said they
would with the note line up soon so stay
tuned for that and friends you know the
drill if you're wanting in the news

structure youtube channel as well you'll
also follow me on twitter Jaime
