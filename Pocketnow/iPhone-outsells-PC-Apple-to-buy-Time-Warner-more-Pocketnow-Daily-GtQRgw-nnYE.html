Windows PCs for the first time ever
Samson confirms that orders are on their
way for the technology needed for the
Snapdragon 820 and Apple's next move
might be to buy a cable provider
altogether I'm high metal Iveta and
while Apple is that that why not just by
our depth as well this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
Microsoft as the company has made three
things public already number one is the
fact that it's build conference is
happening on March 30th that
registrations are ready for February
19th but that you'll have to pay twenty
two hundred dollars for that and for
those of you wanting a later version of
Windows 10 mobile that actually fixes
all the issues on Lumias expect that
very soon according to retina mazwell
stay tuned other official news come from
google those of you that are fans of
Google cardboard there are some
enhancements that just arrived to the
SDK where there is now the option for
spatial audio that allows developers to
actually create content that will allow
you to move your head around and
obviously find audio from those
directions this was actually the missing
link from VR when it came to the
cardboard protocol let's hopefully see
if developers take advantage of it and
yes believe it or not we are an official
new still a same thing has just
confirmed that there are orders for its
new 40 nanometer FinFET architecture
that's required number one for the X and
O's 8 processor and number two for the
Snapdragon 820 is in that an irony that
the Snapdragon 820 will be more or less
powered by samsung's architecture but
yeah that means that we will have
smartphones with this protocol very soon
let's hope soon means the next couple of
months those who the spotlight over to
both rumors and Apple this is rather
interesting as we have trusted sources
claiming that since Apple can't really
convince everyone to play nicely with
the Apple TV sees as the company is
willing to buy a cable provider there
are strong rumors claiming that it will
be Time Warner that there are already
talks obviously Time Warner's not gonna
really mention anything about it but
imagine that a Cupertino into the TV
business just to make the Apple TV take
off and hey let's hope they do because a
lot of people complain about Time Warner
and
and finally the very interesting new
said they actually come from analysts as
well we see that for the first time ever
and in graphs the iPhone is selling more
than even Windows computers and this is
rather crazy this is not necessarily
just the iPhone selling low but you can
notice in the graph when the iPhone
begins selling in 2007 - when the iPad
launches in 2010 - when Windows 8
launched and pretty much killed Windows
computers and yes buried down in the
graph you'll see max which we know sell
a lot less than Windows computers but
this is rather interesting it leads me
to the question of today why do you
think that iPhones a sell more than
Windows computers today in my case I
find that even more interesting that
iPhone sell more than iPads and that
iPads don't sell as much anymore it
makes me wonder if people really need a
computer at some point but anyways it
was a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends as always you
know the drill if you want to hit the
nose earlier before this video was
