10.1 in galaxy gear sony announces the
xperia z1 along with their camera lenses
and google's LG nexus 5 just got leaked
on video I'm hi Mary Vanna and I wonder
if androids next slogan will be give me
a break with that KitKat bar this is
pocket out daily you know i wish i could
say let's start it off with a product
releases but today has been just about
that let's start with sony as we finally
get there sony xperia z1 along with
their cyber-shot qx10 yes the z1 is
everything that we heard on leaks the 5
inch display with an aluminum chassis a
20 megapixel camera links in description
for details but then again this
cyber-shot qx100 that sony came up with
great design and all as long as you
don't hear about the price tag which is
actually the sad part of everything went
to the description for details again it
could probably be for you but then again
it's like buying another smartphone now
moving over to rumor mill a cool
tradition the google has is to have this
party for employees whenever they bring
a new version of android and they had
this whole front lawn thing with the
KitKat statue arriving but I think
Google wasn't aware that their employees
were gonna film everything and some of
these were using Nexus 5's yes we
finally get it on camera took a while to
get the video because Google pulled it
from almost everywhere and as it turns
out it looks a lot like the Nexus 7 when
it comes to design and we do see a big
LG logo at the back so it's only a
matter of weeks I guess now on the
negative side the company that does not
see a break lately is HTC we praise
their HTC One is probably one of the
best smartphones of the year but sadly
their revenues are not speaking the same
language they're currently down 45 47 it
comes to revenues compared to last year
and if we all remember the results of
May were even worse so it's really hard
to know if Peter Chou will end up
stepping down a CEO of the company as he
promised if the HTC One would not be the
break that they were looking for it
would be sad news to see that but it
does seem like things are going in that
direction now another company that's
struggling to sell phones at least
outside the united states is motorola
with their Moto X you'd assume that the
customizable phone would be popular but
it turns out that since
exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T and customizations
yeah the rest of the countries and
carriers are stuck buying that thing in
black or white and it seems that people
don't like it first of all it started
two hundred dollars on a contract now
it's 189 and it's dropping to 149 and
according to tipsters is going to drop
to one hundred dollars outside the
United States and even within the United
States is apparently only AT&amp;amp;T showing
some good numbers we have nothing
official just yet so stay tuned but it
would be good if Motorola found a break
with this phone it's actually a good
phone and finally for the hot news of
the day samsung has unveiled three
different products today the Galaxy Note
10.1 which brings the screen resolution
to the Nexus 10 only that with an S Pen
and with TouchWiz SAT for that TouchWiz
part but then again the Galaxy gear was
also announced then it's actually not as
ugly as we thought it actually allows
you to make phone calls relate through
your phone and everything and it's you
know kind of interesting Michael Fisher
loved it on the video make sure you
watch the links in the description but
then again the price range is kind of
difficult since it's more expensive than
access for possibly the Nexus 5 now in
the case of the galaxy note 3 that film
did take us by surprise we're expecting
a bigger galaxy s porn that was it and
while they ditch the hyper glaze and
they improve the phone a lot of catch so
we are expecting this to be a really
good phone really compelling so that
means you to the question of the day did
you like any of these three products the
note 10.1 the Galaxy gear in the galaxy
note 3 in my particular case honestly I
didn't like the first two that much but
the galaxy note 3 is definitely a phone
that I'm getting so leave us a comment
