have nothing terribly new to add to the
iPad pro conversation but it's such a
noteworthy move especially from the
normally conservative Apple that I
wanted to share my first impressions
anyway it joined me then as I try to
wrap my head and hands around one of the
biggest tablets ever made by that of
course I mean one of the biggest tablets
ever made for the mainstream things like
Samsung's Galaxy view and the Alcatel
OneTouch access are much more appliances
than mobile devices now the iPad pro
might be optimized for keyboard and
pencil input neither of which we have
yet by the way but the core of the
device is a big old tablet it comes with
what you'd expect presented exactly as
you'd expect it to be presented and the
only really notable thing about the
unboxing itself is the charging cable
which is quite long I wander a bit when
I'm tableting so that's the kind of
thing I appreciate everyone's said the
same thing about the iPad pro and while
I'd love to hit you over the head with
some new and amazing revelation the
number one most noteworthy thing about
the physical hardware here is that it's
ponderous the iPad air 2 was the biggest
tablet I routinely used up till now and
the iPad pro Dwarfs it it's a 13-inch
display which doesn't sound all that big
but to get a sense of the size
difference just hold it up to a computer
monitor here it is against the 15-inch
MacBook Pro there's really not too much
difference it's so big that certain
elements seem comical in context the
touch ID sensor appears tiny relative to
the face plate and it takes a second to
figure out the best way to unlock it the
virtual keyboard is a monster it's
really great to have this much acreage
to spread your fingers out on and it's
quite accurate but not all apps support
it kind of like the situation with the
iPhone 6s plus and at a pound and a half
it's heavy too I'm so heavy that you
can't hold it with one hand but heavy
enough that you won't really want to
that big footprint brings some big
benefits the obvious one is the added
canvas for videos and web browsing and
the display really looks good in person
but there's also the huge battery to
consider according to I fix it it's an
over ten thousand three hundred milliamp
hour unit forty percent larger than the
power pack on the iPad air 2 and even a
hair bigger than the one on the surface
pro 4 I'm definitely looking forward to
endurance testing this one and don't
forget the four corner speakers which
from a few minutes of cursory testing
seem to live up to the reputation
they've earned from other reviewers
while we wait for the keyboard and
pencil accessories to roll in we'll be
testing the iPad pro as a standalone
product which at least some buyers
looking to save the extra two hundred
and seventy bucks will no doubt also be
doing it let us know what you want to
know about flying solo with the iPad pro
and we'll do our best to answer your
questions in the coming coverage in the
meantime I'm gonna go try and figure out
how to be out in public with this thing
without people thinking I'm looking to
deliver a television be sure to see what
our colleagues think of the iPad pro
folks check out our chat with mobile
syrups Daniel Bader on episode 174 of
the pocket now weekly and visit us at
pocketnow.com for editorial and feature
coverage on this mammoth monstrosity
till next time this has been michael
fisher captain two phones on twitter
urging you to be a pro no matter what
you're doing thanks for watching we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
