bludgeoned by all this news is you

are correct but now I'm I wouldn't even
think about that but now I'm full of
fear thank you yeah and did just to give
just to give our listeners an idea I
actually logged between see I think it
was like 50 or 60 hours between Sunday
and Tuesday afternoon work you know just
yeah that that much that's how much work
we've had and this in this past week
with all these launches and stuff man
it's just crazy and the end the reviews
are not you know the phone's not all the
phones that are that we're getting this
holiday season are in for review yet so
it's crazy it's not to mention about
your Q which is going to become even
bigger soon ah don't mind I want to
throw this in at the top here I actually
um I didn't write this down when I'm
glad I remembered listeners if you are
not aware you should be that
every day still right I mean is it is
still daily oh yeah what'd you get all
day the rocket now daily comes out as a
breakdown of the of news and happenings
told from the perspective of Jaime
Rivera and if you're screaming if you're
screaming at your screen right now
because we don't have video on this
podcast first of all go back and listen
to the first episode and you will
explain why but you should definitely
watch the pocket now daily because there
is video in a time a and he's great on
video and I I love watching the daily
Tony and I watched the daily like well
every day in Berlin together that was a
good time mm-hmm max I'm at least you
have two guys who at least watch your
videos right ok i know i know that i
really appreciate that you've got no
idea what it's like to stand in front of
the camera every day thank you very much
um let's say it's because there is so
much news will go to two hours if we
don't get started soon but Before we
jump into the news Tony I understand you
have coffee poisoning yes I have and
this is because I'm such an idiot a
moron I've been preparing for for my
ipad mini pre-order which of course
should have happened on october 26 but i
am in Romania and I don't have an apple
store so the closest apple store me is
Apple maggiano's a couple Hungary I'm 10
hours before Cupertino time and
hungary's nine hours before Cupertino
time so I was like happy to pre-order
for the first time in history before
Brandon does so I'm staying up until 1am
which is midnight and Hungary and
nothing happens and then up until two
and three and four were you refreshing
the page and nothing says yeah like
every 10 seconds and at five o'clock in
the morning I decided that there's no
use for me to go to sleep anymore and
then hi my wakes up and I'm like come on
what's going on and he was like of
course pre-orders start October 27 26
but it's Apple cupertino time not local
time and I was like okay so sorry yeah
if I have a warning voice I've been
having that all day long it's
close to evening here so yeah and that's
coffee poisoning reason these are the
perils of being on a planet that spins
right yeah sorry Tony I've been there
man I woke up once in an absolute panic
in high school because I I was told I
could not be late one more time in high
school otherwise they wouldn't let me
graduate and i woke up around eight one
morning and I was supposed to be at
school 20 minutes beforehand and it's
about a 20 minute drive so getting my
car flying down the road and I just
realized that something's really wrong
I'm like I'm like in my pajama pants and
I'm like whatever I'm just gonna get to
school it doesn't matter but I'm like
whatever no it doesn't matter i'm gonna
get to school and I'm gonna make up some
story and hopefully they'll let me
graduate and then I realized that
there's nobody on the roads and only why
are there nobody on the roads it's a
busy oh it's totally Saturday morning I
don't have school bank so I completely
understand man I've been there you know
I'm actually happy that it's only
happened to you once gonna say it
happened to me twice already what the
pre-order thing or being late to high
schools seriously seriously in the
college it happened to me twice are you
serious yeah you showed up a class and
it was a weekend yeah that's awesome the
thing is there were certain classes that
worked on weekend certain classes that
worked on weekdays that that was just
the way lunch and work very bored and I
I just totally screwed up the schedule
from one semester to the other don't ask
me how there was there was a lot of beer
involved with that well then that's what
that's what college is for right we're
gonna talk about college later in the
podcast 2 i'm looking forward to that
Tony you had before we jump into the
special announcements Brandon typically
has a has a little thing to say at the
top of the podcast but today Tony does I
don't take long just five minutes of my
time see how it sounds like your blood
is boiling over there and I don't know
what this is about there's gonna be a
genuine surprise should I get the
setting button ready should get the beep
the beep better are you gonna agree I'm
gonna try to beat the words out myself
okay by the Bogatyr you forgot yeah I
got it I got it go ahead good okay so it
won't take long but I I definitely feel
obligated to do this with the amount of
exposure and attention I'm recently
getting I have to show some love back to
all those who whose purpose in life I'm
yet to become aware of
I blame them for what the Internet's
running out of ip's not so slowly
anymore because I believe that's a old
air purpose in life is limited to to
take up an IP regardless so here it goes
the other day I think or the day before
that I was writing a post something to
give you an example like the samsung
galaxy ace is awesome and within 10
minutes of hitting the publish button I
get a comment yeah but the iphone 5
sucks android greater than iOS it's
nothing reason panting to myself that
okay another IP has been wasted of
course there are people who haven't seen
the internet in their lives and this
moron right here is wasting precious
bandwidth so I get back in the comments
and I'm like hey Baba what the beep has
the iphone 5 iOS or Apple for that
matter got to do with this in my hand
wouldn't ya within a couple of minutes
there's a reply which turns into an
endless thread of comments trying to
convince me that I am an apple fanboy
and I sheep brainwashed or paid by Apple
probably in this exact order yeah but
I'm surprised that the comment did not
include him the Lumia 920 will be hot
yeah oh my god the Lumia 920 the Lumia
920 the Lumia night and like yeah I want
the damn phone to could somebody please
beg no key to give me the phone that's
what I want right now come on just may
tell no division to Tony's right though
that the core of the thing is that no
matter what the piece you write is you
get a like there's always gonna be some
commenter and usually I think I agree I
Tony are you saying this is happening
more often now that did they will
comment on a device that wasn't even
mentioned in the piece usually an Apple
device just so they can kind of crap all
over it is that right yeah and you know
I continue on and I'm gonna say you see
the problem with you you idiot is that
your you're nobody because even though
you're trying to be somebody so hard you
are not visible me and the rest of the
guys on the team we are visible I mean
you know our names in our faces our
voices our email addresses our Twitter's
everything don't get a cuz yeah
that's because we say something and we
do it in a public manner you on the
other hand
stupid idiot are hiding behind the
username some of the times come and sing
as a guest and with a stupid avatar
instead of your picture so you say you
don't care about the iphone iOS or Apple
and yet you find the time to bash it and
not even going to talk about pieces
which criticized the unicorn platform
that's how I'm calling it right now for
one of its OEMs or about those pieces
which are laudatory to any other
platform or OEM whose device they
probably don't have the key takeaway
here is that the amount of activism is
unbelievable I mean it's things from two
miles away it's odious it is that kind
of militancy and propaganda that not
only speaks of you idiot and you're only
idiot brain cell but it also gives you
the perfect dictionary great definition
of what the term fanboys and this is one
category the other category is is is the
dumb and ignorant you simply say that
you're right but the insert android
phone name here is better than the
iphone okay i breathe again hop in the
comments and say okay he obviously have
an argument for that let me know why and
he's like thank you for your feedback
he's like because it's an iphone it's
simple and the insert android phone aim
here is better android is better than
iOS and I reply again hoping he has an
argument finally and ask him why is and
read better than iOS and he's like
because it is iOS sucks yeah okay that's
the that's what the end game 2 so many
of these arguments is it's because
you're right what did you say you called
it odious it is that it is there's a
horribly irritating and frustrating and
destructive environment that is that is
fostered by these kind of attitudes that
I've been seeing of course I apparently
it was my turn to like write the
unpopular pieces this week because it's
like every other headline I think I hi
Mabel 300 know you're getting just be
just right or I'll disagree with you but
I'm gonna make I'm gonna make a little
point here and I am just gonna leave
this on the table and the listeners can
make their minds for whatever they
about this i have used windows microsoft
products forever if anybody if anybody
if anybody can tell me what the command
a trip plus h plus r and a file
extension means then yes you do know
what deal was 4.2 me if you can't answer
that then there's no reason for you to
hear this but the thing is you know I've
I have more pocket pcs in my drawer that
I have of any of the newer devices that
have been launched in last five years
that's the type of Microsoft fanboy that
I used to be and I accept that that was
me I would hate palm devices back in the
day and you know if any of you remember
when when Microsoft launch Windows Phone
7 you know all of us were really excited
windows phone 7 and everything but none
of us have ever really used that back
then you know that was that was 22 years
ago right and you know I just completely
started noticing this pattern in the
comments that totally begun irritating
us and it was that we would we begin
having these really stupid batch of
comments that were like it's gonna be
great and it was the same thread the
same line it's gonna be awesome it's
gonna be great it's gonna be awesome and
you would see you know like 40 or 50
comments of windows phone seven that
were like it's gonna be great like man
this sounds like a marketing firm that's
being paid to comment in our systems and
to and to stir the attention to Windows
Phone 7 and then you would go to an on
windows phone 7 you know post and they
would just pass you and this has been
happening with the Lumia 920 for the
past month my name is Lumia 900 just
going crazy please launch the phone I'm
tired of these common especially I just
launched the phone it's easy because
because it's clear that there is some
sort of manipulations both yeah I saw
one of those I'm on my piece there was a
bit there was a paragraph long thing
with nope no line breaks in it so I left
a smartass remark and I you know I was
like please use the enter key and you
know everybody hated that because they
don't like it when I'm Petty in the
comments and whatever okay then you look
fine I get it but I was like this is a
giant block of text the size of a
continent I'm not gonna read it and then
I was like who is this user and I look
at her other posts and they're all the
same exact thing they're not
you know verbatim but they're all giant
blocks of text defending anything and
everything windows phone but they don't
seem to be more in depth in that and
then the to like her to first posts ever
were like spammy posts on like sex sites
and I'm like who are these people who
are commenting exactly exactly and so
this is this is my point yesterday I
published my thoughts on the Microsoft
Surface RT and so I get this comment
from this guy who you know he's like you
know you haven't even touched the
surface RT and you're already commenting
on it I'm like you have a valid point
but the problem is you know Joe leave I
didn't touch them at the ipad mini and
he made his post on what an android guy
thinks of the ipad mini and so has Adam
Lane not touched the ipad mini and he
made his comment and I'm like this is
actually a serious we're doing a series
where I do my opinion on something
that's opposing to what it's my daily
driver and so the guy just be guns just
begins bashing me and bashing me and I'm
like wait a second and I just began
hitting his profile and it turns out
that this guy is a microsoft MVP and I'm
like oh no the bottom of your shoes
danis yeah listeners for the record we
have a microsoft MVP or a past MVP on
this on this podcast X to Y on the bug
guess yeah but we have two on the team
okay so Anton could you please explain
how the MVPs retain their title please
well back in the day when I was an MVP
because I didn't get the award for this
year Microsoft and the MVP team is
taking a close look at your activities
throughout the community supporting the
product supporting users who have
problems and usually being a militant
for the platform itself oh so it means
that you have a certain interest in
providing your positive feedback towards
a product that nobody's ever used right
yep okay okay so that's my point this
sort of manipulation that sort of
practice is something that I consider an
ethical because if a product was as good
as these people say it is what isn't it
you know aren't customer supposed to do
that because you know I do the same
thing on out daily I ask
everybody on my my question of the day
yesterday I asked everybody what are you
the windows RT tablet the surface RT or
the windows 8 pro everybody I'm like
ninety-nine percent of the commenters on
YouTube and on that posted pocketnow
responded the windows 8 pro and that was
it's just demo that that was my point in
the editorial the point is the windows
RT tablet is sadly a half-baked tablet I
would rather wait for the pro version
that to go for the RT version that has
no apps that was my point in the whole
editorial it's like if I if I'm gonna
visit an iPad user is here is frustrated
because he doesn't really have a
computer he's got an iPad it's something
different and so the RT tries to be a
computer but it's not and it tries to be
an iPad but it's not and so my point is
it's really in the middle and that
middle ground has never worked right it
it has historically never worked but
from what from it from a commenting like
perspective from it from from this kind
of like marketing you know marketing
driving commenters you know there are
departments I mean you know you outside
the MVP program which we just reference
but in every company and every company's
marketing division I mean these these
people are out there you know I mean
these are there are actually like we
call people paid shills when they're you
know advocating for a brand sort of
baselessly but there are actual like
legitimate paid people who are exist to
be in the comments section I'm not
saying that that's everybody who who who
comments on our site certainly we have a
wide range obviously not yeah like from
a from a from perspective of moving
forward to try and kind of like getting
squeezed some positivity out of this
very negative situation because it is
destroying the dialogue and it's it's
having a fight in the comment section if
I see a piece of mine that has 82
comments in you know it's 20 minutes
unlike it's almost never a positive
thing I'm always like oh ok here we go
and I click in and sure enough you know
the Apple versus Android is at it again
of the windows guys are at the end right
guys it's like stop it just stop it you
know yeah that's not cool but here's my
mic request to listeners because the
tent what would I've tend to tend to
defines that the listeners to the
podcaster are very thoughtful people and
that's based on listener mail and
comments on the post and stuff like that
and it's not
just because I'm sucking up to your
listeners but no I really respect your
your input so if you if you feel the
urge to comment on a story please do
because I feel like we get a lot of
awesome comments at the really
thoughtful and that contribute to the
discussion but they don't get upvoted
necessarily enough because the fanboys
are too busy uploading each other in
their fights and that their comments
just get lost at the bottom of the
discus thread really please comment and
it could continue sharing your
thoughtfulness because we're reading
them we don't have time to reply to
every comment or sometimes any comment
depending on how busy the news day is so
please keep driving the discussion
forward and if you see these kind of
massive wars we try and deal with it on
the mod side and stuff but please do
your part to to download idiots ok can I
go full circle and animate positive note
so of course we talked about the fanboys
we talked about the idiots and the
morons and of course there are the
intelligent platform fans which
unfortunately we see less and less as
time goes by which are civilized and
have their arguments and with whom I
believe that for me and I think for you
too it is a pleasure to discuss and even
share contrary arguments so I think that
this should go out those aficionados if
I if I may who use different arguments
than calling you names or just throwing
words out there that a platform and its
infancy with zero users 0 market share
will kill an established platform which
happens to be a market-leading one just
because well because they say so or they
feel so so that's that's pretty much it
please don't die out those intelligent
ones for all the idiots out there I have
a wish I wish that the upgrade to your
current phone will be the best phone
you'll ever own exactly and I just like
to I just like to end it as well with
this um none of us get paid by any
companies and you know for the record
because I always get this comedy you
guys are sponsored by apple and I'm like
okay wait a second Apple products are
actually the only devices that we have
to pay for to review or at least among
the very few exactly we rarely pay we
have to pay for some of you units to get
them on time and that's just because we
want you know
we want our readers to get the first
point but you know it was just the thing
is none of us get paid to do this oh
yeah and it like done an apple event and
we have no yeah if we're apple fanboys
then we're doing something wrong like if
we're sponsored by apple we have to talk
to apple because something's going very
wrong we should get we should get paid
we're we're families but the point being
is our only purpose is this we get to
try everything we get to try absolutely
everything that comes to the market and
there are some really great products out
there and there are some really bad
products out there there are there it
just is and you know I wish that our
readers and our listeners would remember
that we are trying to be as objective as
we can we're not trying to bash any
company just because you want to bash it
we are saying what we think because
companies can do better companies can do
better and we've seen some really great
products come to the market i'll give
you an example the galaxy s3 I just
unboxed it yesterday for the first time
and I'm I'm extremely amazing it's a
great congratulations man it's a great
phone and then you know I've had cases
were for example I had the iphone for
the thing had antenna gate and I hated
that thing I'm serious you know it's
it's it is the way it is I have an ipad
3 which i just sold because it's
extremely heavy and i'm going for
another one and that's just the point
listeners we are not out here to put our
personal opinions just because we want
to it's because we actually use the
products that we want you to make an
educated decision before you buy
something because you know in our cases
we get products all the time but in your
cases sometimes you have to sign a
two-year contract and hold that phone
for two years yeah so we want to make
sure that you're doing the right thing
when you buy keeps that is entirely
that's that's that's one of the primary
reasons we're here and I wanted it to
say that the being civilized in the
comments does not mean agreeing with us
this is be my final point on the thing
is we got to move on the you can
disagree all you like it the part of the
most interesting part of reading
articles after they're published is
seeing commenters come in and say
actually I have a different view and
like here it is and then you know
civilized debate on that point because
exacts I'm wrong like once or twice a
week on
at least one one point and you know one
of my articles where I get it I gave
something wrong and somebody corrects me
even if it's just a typo Mike ha thank
you yeah but that's the point of an
editorial I mean editorials are opinions
on these pieces are something else right
but ended up but you know what and in
the point a minute part of the point of
an editorial is to incite discussion so
if you want to disagree that's that's
awesome then just do it in a civilized
way I've had some really civilized
disagreements on someone chose this week
and it's been that's that's a pleasure
it's just when you come in you're not
contributing anything you're just
dragging everything through the mud
anyway we've we've been through this
over you over and let's move on we've
had a great discussion about this this
was a good thing to bring up thank you
Tony my pleasure before we jump into the
news I've got two things first of all
while we're in this the kind of pre-show
bit I would like to to thank everyone
once again for forgiving us a whole
bunch of itunes feedback and just really
briefly I as everyone knows I'm the
other part of my existence has taken up
acting and i was i was recently
something happened to me for the first
time i was in a show a play that was
cancelled and that's a first for me and
it's it's really sucky it's really a
horrible feeling and the reason we were
cancelled is because we didn't have
enough audience and i bring this up
because the podcast is doing very well
we're growing at a wonderful rate and
we're getting more and more listeners
who are as i mentioned before
intelligent and cool and who sent us
awesome listener mail but in we're
certainly going to continue the podcast
there's no danger of the podcast being
cancelled i'm not saying that but we do
need audience and we need we need more
audience we want more people to hear
what we're saying we are not going to
work continually revising our format and
deciding new things to do and things
like that but you know it please if you
if you enjoy the show please do do tell
some friends spread the word please do I
was gonna wait till en de to say that
but you know I got the sneaking
suspicion that people might tune out
once they hear the outro come on but I'm
I don't know just for a second I thought
that you were going to tell us a story
when he went on stage for one of your
shows and like somebody from the third
row was yelling like yo dude it's all
good man from pocket Bella hey please
don't do that please because you will
probably break me if you do that now
yeah I'm waiting for that to happen no
so anyway that's just just a quick quick
heads up and also on a somewhat on a
completely different note if you are
listening to this podcast on the day it
goes up which is which is friday the
twenty-sixth you have until the end of
today you still have a chance to win our
last nexus 7 that we're giving away with
amzer it is the third week of the
giveaway we've given away to already to
some very happy listeners I'm actually
about to ship out the second one today
so please enter all the details are at
the linked post if you check out the
podcast post you can have a look it is
an awesome giveaway we have more
giveaways coming up very soon which we
will announce shortly so stay tuned for
that so I just worried let's go Michael
want to rush i went to hungary 12 hungry
in 12 Russia yes sir you know anyways
guys it's gone i know is it hey hey get
the American were the Americans are with
that aside let's um we're going to talk
a little bit more about android tablet
android devices later but i think the
considering we have high me on the show
and considering this is probably fanboy
alert the biggest news of the block i
want to talk about the ipad mini apple
has announced the ipad mini pre-orders
have have opened for it as we talked
about at the top of the show poor Tony
thank you let's talk about let's talk
about the ipad man we've all written
about it we at an insane amount of
coverage dedicated to it because it is
such a significant product why is it
such a significant product hi would you
doubtless have an opinion on this oh
yeah but my opinion on the mini is
actually I think you guys read my
editorial about what would Steve Jobs
think about the ipad mini yes and
the reason why is because I you know I
think it's a great product because you
know it's extremely portable and
everything and it gives you all the app
echo system and everything it doesn't
chop you down on the things you can do
with it I just I you know the ipad
mini's got some good specs but I think
it could have been greater you know and
and and I think that that I the great
thing about this product is the design
you know if anybody if any of you have
held the iphone 5 it's just it's a
different phone I mean the way it's
designed and built it's just a different
phone it's a very beautifully built like
Tony tweeted about that recently didn't
you yeah it's a bad just got my man yeah
and and no longer waiting for that I'm
serious the phone does look like a piece
of jewelry it does it just does it's a
very well-made phone and yes by the way
I've been using mine without a case for
three weeks and I haven't scratched it
for the record but you know the ipad
mini brings that iphone 5 designed to
the ipad um the only problem with this
product is that it doesn't have a Retina
display and that's why you know in my
datoria I'm like I'm like Apple you've
missed the point i mean if you're
building a smaller ipad it's because you
want to build a dedicated e-reader and
as it turns out if it doesn't have
retina display then you've got two
tablets in the market already to do
which are the Nexus 7 and the kindle
fire 7 HD so I'm like how is it that i
can pay two hundred dollars for two
tablets that can give me the reading the
reading experience that I want and then
i have the ipad mini which i have to pay
120 bucks more and i'm not gonna get
that same experience you know so it's
those two things you know the iPad Mini
is a great design product if you're if
you're coming from a first-generation
ipad or an ipad to the ipad mini is a
greater faith and the you know since the
ipad is not really a computer it's you
know it's actually just a tablet to
consume products you know I've come to
the point where I always have to be
carrying my macbook air everywhere I go
so for me it's like to carry a macbook
Karen an iPad it's just a hassle yeah
I'm see iPad Chevy the iPads a heavy
product so for me to get the nexus 7 was
just an eye-opener i was i was
completely against 7-inch tablets until
i got the next 7 you tan so I feel that
Apple missed the mark with the price tag
because it should have been an impulsive
buy I should have seen two hundred bucks
and I would have been like
torrid bunch that's what I pay for
dinner with a couple of friends or beer
this guy roller about 200 bucks I'll pay
for it but but 329 was like oh God and I
always take the 32 gig models oh my god
God you know that's not Apple though you
know they weren't gonna do that there
weren't then we're gonna come out the
gate with something that was priced on
the mark because there at all they can
charge that pre true you know true but I
won't like okay if you don't give me the
retina display to give me the price and
now that's what I was exported to have
the two right you know it didn't happen
and you know Apple Apple is the Apple is
the new blackberrys what is what I call
you remember those days when blackberry
would come up with a new version of the
pearl but this one had GPS and no i
phone right yeah end them and then they
brought a second model which had Wi-Fi
no GPS and then they brought a third
bottle that they had all two things and
they're just just giving people just
bites you know slowly and that's what
Apple is doing lately they bring the
iphone 5 with knows what strange effects
that are not revolutionary and then the
next model will bring everything and
that's just the way they do it which I
actually am NOT proud of I don't like
that but you know the iPad Mini is what
it is um to be honest readers and
listeners I got a knife at me I did
pre-order and the reason why good reason
why yeah the reason why is because I was
able to sell my ipad 3 because I was
frustrated with the thing you know it it
took seven hours to charge it was
extremely heavy and you know I think
that I'm able to live with the
compromise of having a non retina
display for a year and just you know
seeing if not then I'll just sell it yes
I did pre-order I feel like that's gonna
make you happier than anything else I
mean on account of like you'd you're
talking about the nexus 7 opening your
eyes to the form factor and that's what
it did for me i love the nexus 7
primarily because it made me fall in
love with a 7-inch form factor and you
being you know a giant iOS fan i feel
like this is going to be the perfect
perfect product for you for a little bit
in spite of that I feel I feel like that
display would drive Brandon up a wall
because you can see the pixels on it but
you know not necessarily and I have a
couple of a couple of thoughts on this
issue yeah probably the the biggest
problem which was brought up in comments
related to the ipad mini was the small
resolution
and the small ppi value now the iPad
Mini has a smaller resolution than being
at the Nexus 7 but not necessarily are
you still guys with me because I okay so
not necessarily let me tell you this
much 1024 x 768 is the resolution of the
ipad mini it is smaller than the
resolution of the nexus 7 because the
Nexus 7 has a wide screen form factor so
that means more pixels in height if the
ipad mini would have had a 16 x 10
screen resolution just like the Nexus 7
it would have had around 1300 pixels in
height but no apples going with four by
three and in a four by three aspect
ratio 1024 is as high as you can go
without going with a new resolution this
is consideration number one
consideration number two is 1024 x 768
on a 10 inch tablet which was the ipad 2
it wasn't really such a problem with it
and see necessarily pixels this same
resolution is on a form factor which is
two inches smaller so the pixels will be
even smaller and you won't be able to
see and consideration number three and
the last one I agree that the Nexus 7
has a higher resolution and a higher PPI
rating but most of the guys who
commented were probably also pre
ordering a surface RT now the surface RT
has a resolution of 1366 x 768 on a
ten-by-ten 10.6 inch screen mass appear
the PPI value is 1 47.8 the iPad Mini
has a ppi value 1 68.4 so who are you
kidding your surface pre-order guys the
surface RT has lower PP is still you're
bashing the ipad so this is what I was
talking about get your facts straight
and if you made a mistake or if you just
are unhappy with the product you got ok
admit it I wasn't happy about the camera
on the One X even though I I bought that
phone so now see Billy's it takes balls
to admit it that's it speaking of the
camera that this is interesting about
thank you for bringing that up the the
ib I've had many ships with a rear
facing camera
Indy and it's technically it's branded
as an isight camera right so it might
wait no 5 mega particular yeah it does
is it I said yeah so yeah I mean that's
that's awesome the nexus 7 does not have
a camera and I frankly I haven't missed
it much but as we've talked to have kind
of gone round and round on this
discussion of this kind of burned-out
topic of like should you take photos
with the tablet and yeah you look like
an idiot but sometimes it's a good idea
and it is exactly sometimes you like an
r you have and you look like like we're
in a world where we're going to talk
about the galaxy note 2 later but we're
in a world where phablets are becoming
more mainstream and so you're kind of
already walking around with a little
mini tablet that you sometimes take
pictures with so I feel like I feel like
this the ipad mini might be one of the
one of the first legit tablets to come
out that that won't make you look like a
total idiot taking a picture with it and
that's exciting to me because even
though it's only 5 megapixels whatever
we know Apple does a great job on their
camera objects yeah and I yeah that
that's that's cool I mean witchy what's
your your thought there go ahead i mean
i think the consensus is that the next
what makes the ipad mini stand out and i
just saw that by you know each of the
publications that had a hands on you
know they were like man this thing is
thin or this thing is like you know it
has a it's like the perfect idea you
have a big screen on a small device you
know how that you know how Dell made
that with a 13-inch laptop recently they
they fit a 14-inch screen on a 13-inch
set chassis what yeah they did a science
fiction sty I know I know they figured
it out it's really cool and so that's
what they did with the ipad mini it's
been a really big screen on a small
chassis and apparent according to them
it just feels really unreal but if
that's a term and the bezel is so is so
thin along the sides that there is some
there's some software at work I
understand yeah and the iOS 6 version
for the ipad mini 2 to ignore kind of
frivolous inputs from your thumbs when
you're holding the thing along the sides
which we've written about way like i
wrote a piece on on this like edgeless
displays or whatever and that was one of
the things i was like we have software
that's smart enough to do that we have
palm rejection if you're writing with a
stylus so why can't be edge rejection
and that it looks like that's what
they're doing
they figured it out and regarding the
camera you know yeah this is the same
lens as the iphone 4 but it has the
optics of the 4s for some reason you
know I used the four in the forest I
actually like the photos on the four
more than on the 4s I don't know why
just I think there was just something
different there if you've ever taken a
photo with the five-man that bet is like
really really awesome obviously I've
never owned the PureView Tony don't
comment on that circling badges for one
second for Alex 27 but but yeah you know
I'm really excited to see how you know
how it takes photos because you know yes
it doesn't feel uncomfortable on a
7-inch tablet what are we gonna stand on
the seventh honey yeah Michael and me
have both agreed and concluded in in the
entirety of the discussion while we were
in Berlin that the Nexus 7 is not the
device for me yeah and well it doesn't
do what I want to do on a daily basis I
mean it does but not the way I want to
do things I mean I had like five
completely empty homes Queen that's
exactly that's you have to understand
like listeners I gave to him I tell nice
looking at one of our Nexus 7 and he's
like I'm like I don't know how would
this discussion came about but Tony's
like let me let me set this up the way I
would set it up I'm like okay whatever I
go back to doing what I'm doing I come
back like like five minutes have passed
and tony has eliminated everything from
every home screen and like it's just
this blank home screen with a dock along
the bottom line and he's like yeah this
is this is this is what it would be if
it's worse this burns yeah so so I got
back from Berlin with the with the
limited edition white Nexus 7 which
which i got from Brandon and you know
what the first application was that I
installed it was the camera enabler Oh
even though I don't take pictures with
my camera with my tablet but I need to
have that there maybe it's because I'm
visually attracted to the icon I know it
has to be there I know but VI VI Connor
yourself Matt yeah that is
I actually to you know you put your
finger where the shutter button is you
turn your camera away from you and your
yeah taking a picture is just completely
lame but I want to have a camera on a
7-inch tablet if it is possible if it's
not too much to ask absolutely no it's
it's a great idea I think for that form
factor it's tough to beat I mean it's
it's really a good match for first 7
inch tablet and I I think that um I
think you can still make the case that
on a 10 inch tablet it's it's still
weird you know but on a 7-inch I agree
it's it's it's it's fine so it's good to
see I'm glad that the that that we've
got some pre orders in on the team here
I was tempted I will not be pre-ordering
one for my personal use just because I
you know we're not going to talk about
this but iOS 6 has done really nothing
different yeah isn't it wasn't it
striking how they didn't even discuss
iOS 6 like we talked about the apps they
talked about app support vs nexus 7 well
they talked about that with the occasion
of the iphone 5 yeah yeah yeah but after
after the iphone 5 everything just help
rose over when when it got released and
you know for CEO to have to come on
record and apologize from over over a
product you know there must have been
something really hot happening in there
and you know I I think that you know iOS
6 I I do understand the philosophy of
why apple doesn't change iOS 6 yeah I
get it yeah i do understand the
philosophy and the problem is none of us
three in this phone in this podcast are
the targeted market and most of our
readers and listeners aren't the
targeted market for iPhones or iPads you
know there are very simplistic products
that are designed to cater to everyone
in the audience you know not just a
specific meet Mitch of of the market and
you know I do understand why they don't
want to change it but I am disappointed
with iOS 6 i've said it so many times
yeah and you know the reason why again
the reason why when you you want to know
the only reason why i bought that ipad
mini yeah number one because i had an
ipad 3 that I hate it that's the reason
and I was able to sell it so I sold by
ipad 3 and I'm just you know and because
the nexus 7 would have been the perfect
product if it had a better screen yeah
the screen gbox I'm like you know I'd
rather put up with pixels than with dull
colors
can I say while we're talking about the
Nexus 7 and the ipad mini like can I
just say that one of the big things at
the presentation i think was phil
schiller who was like look at this like
look at her look our competition it's
plastic on the back and it's lame and
it's stupid and look at our thing is so
thin and it's so beautiful in it look
it's metal and it's stuff and I'm like
yeah but for a guy who doesn't like
cases particularly on tablets I don't
like cases on phones but I really don't
like them on tablets for a guy who's
gonna carry the thing naked you know
what I do like my nexus 7 you know what
I do to that thing like I just I don't
like like punt it down the street or in
like that but I'm rather careless when I
toss it around because I can be its
durable it's it feels great in the hand
the thickness is perfect for for the for
the type of device it is and that it's
just nice to be able to not have to
worry about am I going to damage my
expensive looking product agree you know
I Syrians you don't want something to be
a pretty piece of jewelry sometimes you
want it to be functional and of course
it will buy a case then well I don't
like cases no I don't like you know i
was i was talking to an out of mine we
just got an iphone 5 she's like why are
you wearing your iphone 5 without a case
and I'm like I'm like Thea means on in
Spanish I'm like this is like buying a
BMW and using seat covers on the leather
my stubby good point I'm like if you're
gonna buy the thing and you're gonna
cover it up what's the whole point of
buying it let's go buy a frickin Toyota
and make yourself happy exactly if
you're gonna worry about what's gonna
happen to it a couple of years don't use
it right so so I'm like you know I this
is me i buy the phone i buy applecare if
something goes wrong I just smash it
with a hammer I take it to an apple
store and I get a replacement for 50
bucks that's me you know it's funny I I
will always remember that there was a
back in the days of the dumb phone it
was the first camera phone of the United
States the sanyo flip phone yeah yeah
yeah yeah you remember what I'm talking
about yeah I remember that phone i had
it yeah was the 5300 and my friend Rick
bought it before me I was like oh my god
he got it and whatever and I noticed
like he'd had it for two days nothing
was already scratched to hell like what
do you what he doing man this is a 400
phone he's like he looks at me he was
like it was meant to be used it was like
wow you know I can't argue with that man
you were absolutely correct that was
about eight
years ago and I've always thought of
that when I when I get my first scratch
on it because you remember even in spite
of all the stuff we're talking you do
remember the first scratch you put on
your device right oh yeah I you I almost
every device I have I remember where
what the first damage I did to it is man
my one x recently I was I was it slipped
from my hand and it hit my foot and it
can you broke your toe listen its lid on
its screen overall the the ceramic tile
and I'm like oh so I'm like oh so much
for gorilla for gorilla glass it's all
scratched all the borders of the
Infinity display got scratched so I'm
like whatever damn whatever well any
anyways III I noticed you have the the
ipad you know the ipad 4 on the topic
list as well and you know just the sad
yeah i just talked about that for like
40 seconds yeah just just to add up i am
waiting for brandon to receive the
tablet and to tell me what he thinks
about it yeah because you know i was i
love the ipad 2 I i hated the ipad one
because it was heavy I owned it for two
months and I sold it then I got the ipad
2 and for me the ipad 2 was the perfect
tablet it was not too big not too small
it was not heavy it just felt good and
you know the problem with the ipad 3 is
the weight distribution which is the
same problem of the 1x and so the ipad 2
didn't have that problem because the
battery was smaller so I'm like Brent
Allen just hold it tablet and tell me
what you think because that's what I
would like to tell you know listeners to
expect for the ipad 4 if the weight
distribution is better than I'd buy it
but if not you know if I'm gonna have
get the same heavy tablet I'd rather
wait for the ipad 5 what's the I haven't
looked at the specs on this you guys
which weighs weighs exactly the same but
again the time yeah it weighs exactly
the same as the three but again the
problem with the what the ipad 3 wasn't
really the weight it was only like two
grams heavier than the ipad 2 the
problem was the weight distribution the
battery is just so big and so dense that
it just knocks her balance when you're
holding it you have one a day I am yeah
I huge it feels huge it feels huge in
you don't get that same feeling with the
ipad 2 and so you know for me I'd rather
hold on for full-year the supporting
pixels with the with the eye
had many then you know they'd stand
another iPad you know for I'll wait for
the five but you know again my opinion
is wait for brands to get his review
unit and will tell you if it's lighter
if it feels different or anything
because usually these are just design
cues what uh before we before we jump
completely I think we're done with the
many but did you have a final point to
make on that Tony yeah I was going to
take this opportunity just to inform our
readers that even though the ipad mini
black and white went on pre-order this
morning and both should have delivered
by November to it seems like the white
sold out like six hours before the spot
guess was recorded and it's shipping now
in two weeks so the thing to take away
here is number one people are either
cared seeing those scratches on the
black iphone 5 number two either Apple
did a piss-poor job at predicting their
initial stocks or number three they do
indeed might have some problems in the
supply chain and that's that's it Wow
once I guess we'll have to see what yeah
which which side of the story I'm
expecting a press release on monday as
they usually put out one like I don't
know ipad mini pre-orders throughout the
weekend if there will be no s release
then I'm gonna assume that there were
poor pre-orders and if there will be a
press release will be happy to find out
about the millions of units people
pre-order throughout the weekend world
why then let's not forget that this time
many many many many countries are in for
the pre-order so I'm expecting if I if I
can make a prediction right now I'm
expecting around four or five million
units that's we'll see mostly that's
interesting I don't know you know how
many how many units are going to move it
it's going to be incredible i think when
i was watching the announcement and I
when he first went phil schiller foot
first pulled out the product the ipad
mini i was like well this is this is
going to sell incredibly well and I I
don't know you know what that translates
into in millions but I think they're
gonna probably break some records here
well go on I felt the same I felt the
same you know until they brought the
price tag that's where I that's where I
thought that's why don't you doesn't
matter one bit no no no no no that's
just me that's just me and you know I
think that another mistake that Apple
made this is
just a personal personal thought I feel
that the keeping the ipad 2 was a
mistake because what you're telling
current owners of the ipad 2 is that
your ipad is still up to date so you
know current owners are current owners
of the ipad 2 are not going to want to
go for an iPad Mini or an iPad for it
they're just gonna stick to what they
have for another year it is a little
weird that the two is still in the
lineup like you would have thought that
the many would replace the two no it's
the two is the is the budget full-size
iPad and the four is the D expensive the
last year the deluxe go and the small is
just a small one that this is not the
thing that pisses me off Apple went
crazy defending themselves that Siri is
not compatible with the a5 chip on the
iPads you well that's what i pad mini
has the same bishop and series there
yeah and i feel like that was what was
it within within like two weeks or maybe
even less time that the development
community was like no we can totally run
Siri on this absolutely yeah what are
you talking about yeah I I want to say
about the about the ipad 4 before we
kind of move on here I think it's really
it was very slick of Apple to to wait on
the ipad for refresh because it's just a
refresh it's like the least exciting
iPad news there's ever been and I love
that they just used the the ipad mini
event as kind of a mask for that they're
like hey by the way we refresh the ipad
anyway moving on to this really cool
product you know i think that's pretty
awesome pretty basic nothing you know it
didn't take a genius to come up with
that idea but I I really like that in
March um I don't know I didn't I at the
three I think I feel like the three
still has a lot of staying power I feel
like a lot of people are really annoyed
on Twitter like they were they were
complaining so hard about this refresh
of the ipad 4 to the point where
somebody i forgot who tweeted it but
somebody was like why is everyone acting
like their ipad 3 just exploded and they
don't have a tablet anymore you know you
know it's funny you know p you can't
make people happy you can you know if
apple if apple takes an extra six months
to launch the IP iphone 4s everybody
goes crazy because they don't you know
or if Apple just launched an iteration
of the for making the 4s and they didn't
launch a new read
with the five and completely made their
phones obsolete they're all so unhappy
so you just can't make beat pack now you
can't win you can't win but anyway
that's so let's put iOS to bed where
this is going to be a long podcast we
know but we can't be in all day one so I
we we're going to move on to to Android
here do you have a closing thought on
iOS either of you gentlemen poor removal
no I've already talked too much about
this yeah yeah the armory well I just
came back yesterday from the from the
Galaxy Note 2 launch event in new york
city of course the Galaxy Note 2 was
already released to international
markets weeks ago we reviewed it but the
US launch was was the day before
yesterday and it was a massive event I
keep telling people are like I was it
what you do in New York I'm like well it
was you know it's the biggest smartphone
there is basically so it couldn't be a
subtle event it wasn't gonna be like a
small a small little party like you know
they had samsung had Kanye West there
they had a giant line of VIPs they had a
bunch of actors whose names I don't know
because I'm a poor student of pop
culture but they really went all out for
the galaxy note 2 release and I had an
opportunity to to play with whole bunch
of devices we've got some review units
from the various carriers samsung you're
actually did something really cool if
you have not seen the video one of the
difficult things about demoing a US
release product or a product that's
already been out and you've already
reviewed it and now it's come out
another market is that they're often
very similar carriers used to have a lot
of power with Samsung where they would
be like no change the design put a
keyboard on it to whatever and now
Samsung's so powerful that they're like
no you're going to you're going to
release the phone as it is and that's
pretty cool but then you find yourself
doing a video two weeks after you've
reviewed the phone it's like hey it's
michael with pocketnow.com again again
back with the galaxy note 2 hey remember
air view hey remember multitasking but
anyway well samsung had this really cool
pop-up studio that they let us use and
they had looking looking really cool
love that Hideo I love the video too and
it was all I cannot take credit for any
of it that except for just being there
and demoing the stuff because they're
real pros they
running the studio for us it was very
nice to them to to give us that those
kind of resources I just wish that I
didn't oh that I didn't look like I
always look which is exhausted dead
tired and high and drunk haha yeah hi
that's right so just quickly I have a
lot of love for samsung as a company
especially for the USB ours who who are
guys and girls yes and all the great
stuff but I am disgusted to the point of
vomit by the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and
the samsung galaxy s3 the problem and
the problem is that if you open the tap
the valve at the sink galaxy s is threes
and no tubes are flowing out I mean
everywhere you look and everywhere you
you at all you see is the note 2 we had
like 75,000 events a lot of ads I
actually stopped using my galaxy s3
because I couldn't put up with all the
galaxy has free ads on television and
they have adverse effects on me I know
marketing teams have to sell the product
of course we can argue that good
products don't need that much marketing
but regardless of that i think they are
doing a good job with their products but
marketing and samsung is an overkill I
don't think you ask somebody on the
street who should be according to their
age gender and stuff like that
knowledgeable that you ask them about
the samsung galaxy s3 or the no.2 and
they don't know about that so I think
marketing with Samsung is an overkill
but by the way let me interrupt here I'm
HTC Sony all these companies please
write this down this is how you release
a product by the way a lot of marketing
make people aware of it low people
people still don't know what the one x
is in my country yes I still don't know
they look at me and they're like oh man
your nostril respect your country
doesn't matter and then mine doesn't
matter either i don't know i mean i mean
our countries the gym I image my mind
non-relevant country got the galaxy s3
on launch date that is oh no what I'm
saying is that is what a bold company
does yeah exactly is what am I
old company duh and I know I also see
the galaxy s3 stuff everywhere i'm about
to start seeing the note to stuff
everywhere i mean we have in south
station in Boston which is a massive
train station there are probably 40 to
50 like ad placement sectors there are
banners and and hanging things then they
Samsung has blanketed the place and it's
ridiculous I mean that that blue that's
in the galaxy s3 at is just everywhere
so they're blown it up and we've talked
about this on the podcast before and
they're just destroying it the
interesting thing to me is and this is
what I was going to ask somebody at
Samsung if I'd had the opportunity to do
an interview on that video and I didn't
and I was sad to miss out on that but I
was like you know what's interesting is
that Samsung is trying he's going to do
this with the note 2 they wouldn't have
a giant blowout event like this if they
weren't planning on doing what they did
with the galaxy s3 with the note 2 they
wouldn't be launching out on every US
carrier almost simultaneously and the
note 2 is designed well enough and I
said this in the reviewed so that where
that it feels a bit like a smart phone
in your hand more so than the note 1 did
because of its changed aspect ratio so
it's like you guys are going to try and
push the phablet into mainstream
acceptance like the note was an
experiment that went really right and
now Samsung you're going to be like all
right well hey the phablet is now going
to come to everyone because if you're
already thinking as a customer if you're
already thinking of buying an s3 you're
gonna see the note 2 next to it and be
like well this is why not yeah but this
way I'm already thinking of a four point
eight inch device why why wouldn't I
think about maybe taking a step up to
5.5 inches in oh look it has more
capabilities and it's not really that
much bigger is it you know I mean that's
it's huge it is big and the problem is
not it's not that reason the segment of
the market has a limit attached to it
from the 4 inch and the 3.5 inch
segments which was the iphone segment
has a limit there are people who don't
want that small screens then the 5.5
inch market has a limit to it it's just
the question is when will Samsung reach
that because people who love huge phones
and huge screens will not buy them no
they won't but you know what the people
there are people who wouldn't have
bought a 4.3 inch device I remember
people calling my original Eva
huge and now look at it me as a week
everybody don't really have a chance now
I mean four point three and four are
really small phones today Roy exactly
and that's and that's the way the market
I think we're gonna top out at 5.5 I
don't think I go bigger but by the way
listeners the guy with the biggest hands
right now is saying that he's gonna puke
with the Galaxy Note II that's a good
point well anyway this thing is going to
destroy destroy the world I they are
really really gonna going to blow this
up and um and I'm happy I'm having them
I'm having fun too because I'm pleased
to have this type of marketing as well
and it's not just the marketing thing
it's taking its it's saying with the
note one hey here's this ridiculous
thing right any like everyone's like
what what are you what are you talking
about what you you guys have lost it and
then it sells really well and then
they're like okay we've refined this now
because we can now reap the rewards of
taking a bold step and not just making
another aping 4.5 inch device or 4.3
inch whatever you know what I mean and
owned by the way we're gonna bring back
a stylist to what you guys are back on
drugs and then it turns out to be pretty
awesome so anyway it's it's you know
yeah don't get me wrong guys it's it's
okay everything is okay and I don't have
a degree in marketing and stuff like
that but I just dunno I'd happen to know
I've been working corporations all my
life that the marketing has its
downsides and the consumer doesn't need
to be constantly reminded like every
commercial break or every every
billboard or banner they see on the
street that this is the best thing the
next thing the biggest thing that I
don't know I don't know what then it's
not necessarily about Samsung it just
the Samsung happens at the moment to be
using this I think in an exaggerated
manner and for for people like me this
has an adverse effect it has a negative
effect I mean I wouldn't buy it now too
if I got a sick of the advertising yeah
I just I just hate to see that every 10
minutes I feel like that they factor
that in right if you're like the
marketing people who are really good at
this stuff they're like okay
one-point-five percent of people are
going to be so irritated by this that
they are gonna be turned off and then
they call that an acceptable loss
because they want to build this galaxy
brand to such a degree and that's you
know that's been working we
talked before about how like you know
it's no longer Oh what is that is it an
iphone or a droid it's like oh is that
the new galaxy yeah you know one of the
101 of the billions that yeah right yeah
okay they're making some mistakes some
good like the galaxy camera sucks I know
it doesn't have okay you look tonight
awesome love it was thank you for being
that up because they did announce that
for the US as well the other night i'm
sorry i forgot to mention that but go
ahead go ahead good well ya know they
announced the galaxy camera as well
we've played with it endlessly Tony and
I saw it in Berlin then Brandon got a
chance to get a hand of it the hands on
it in New York City it I don't think
it's going to sell very well
particularly out on a contract on AT&amp;amp;T
it misses the appointment you gonna fade
a data plan for a camera exactly are you
gonna do I think that's it's pretty nuts
but I yeah I think gadget lovers are
gonna love it I I don't think it's pro
enough for real camera enthusiasts to
enjoy it nah I don't think its consumer
enough for for consumers to be like yeah
I'll pay a data plan for a camera and
again no wait I think it misses the mark
on a couple things but just as a cool
different thing I like it I don't think
it's going to be as successful as the
note was certainly well you you my
friend will also love the webos toaster
that is true you put webos on a
refrigerator and I will buy them yeah we
established this in Berlin we did I'm
waiting for the Android power vacuum
cleaner than webos toaster by the way I
brought my lair to Berlin to show Tony
and we're seeing seeing Anton denied you
holding an HPV r is one of the most
interesting things ever because it kind
of looks like a pebble in your hand like
I like a grip like a piece of gravel god
it's a tiny phone anyway um real real
quickly to wrap up the Galaxy Note bit
verizon slapped their logo on so so I'm
thinking of questions to ask for this
interview that never happened in brandon
sends me this thing is like ask about
the verizon branding i'm like oh what
did they do did they put a big logo on
the back oh yeah their 4g LTE logo it's
big whatever you know that right you
know what they takes me hold on wait let
me tell everybody what they did they
actually slapped their they slapped the
verizon wireless logo on the home button
if you haven't seen the story and not
just
check mark which would have been
offensive enough the check mark and the
verizon wireless like the full brand the
full trademark logo logo and as you guys
are ignorant is the most obscene these
guys driving their f250s with with a big
ball sack hanging from the bottom of
metric yes it's that awful that is what
the verizon logo looks like on a small
home but god it looks like something
that shouldn't be there it's that's
right it's like footballs belong to a
horse or a freakin cow not a car the
question here and the problem and it's
by itself is more severe and more
serious than then of course we're joking
but we have talked endlessly about how
Samsung has grown into that company
which is now a la iPhone and Apple
imposing its products on carriers yes
untouched the galaxy s3 was a good
example of that they no longer went with
50,000 variety of variety for every
carrier in the world for separate
variants in in the US and the Galaxy
Note 2 was expected to be dead and it
was that for AT&amp;amp;T and for t-mobile and
it's that for sprint now the question is
is verizon that ballsy to tell samsung
my friends if you want to sell this
phablet on my carrier is going to be on
my terms or is verizon that unimportant
for samsung that they say okay get your
logo on it what hand afford i think that
factors into the strategy of theirs
right i think if if it had come down to
that it come down to such a like a my
way or the highway kind of thing with
this branding samsung can't afford to
lose verizon if they're trying to push
the galaxy note 2 as hard as they want
to they cannot afford to lose the
biggest carrier in the United States
exact yeah to get back to what time is
it it's about balls and verizon has
bigger balls than Samsung yeah but look
at Samsung look at what they're like
well we don't have to change the design
we don't have to add a keyboard do
anything crazy all we have to do is
silkscreen a logo onto this button and
people might hate it but you know what
it's going to get us access to 80
million customers or 90 million
customers and and to make a point here
Verizon actually sold more galaxy s the
reason they
old iPhones last quarter I think it was
oh really now that's that is telling ya
I'm sure this should include a sandpaper
in the box I know oh no I don't polish
remover yeah anyway that's let's get
away from the heads just so annoying um
the I want to kind of power through at
the rest of Android here pretty quickly
we had this was this was really cool
that the nexus 10 quick start manual
leaked now we're pretty confident this
is legit right this is not we'd like to
believe it is we would have and it looks
like the flying sauce the firing squad
perhaps even look at this not at all
what I would have expected like you
think Nexus 10 and maybe involuntarily
you're like all right so your brain
blows up the nexus 7 to Nexus 10
dimensions now that's what I was
expecting yes but I'm glad and you know
maybe it's ugly and we won't we haven't
laid eyes on the actual product or at
least I haven't but it reminds me of a
galaxy note 10 dot one with like bulged
bulged out like it looks like somebody
took a straw put it in the note 10 at
one and like blew into it until its size
boat Michael goals they have to avoid
litigation from Apple don't forget short
and i love it i love the design it looks
like a pad from Star Trek Voyager and
I'm into that so guys a question I'm
gonna make a point I'm song do then win
that or name one just one give me one
top-selling landscape oriented tablet
one hmm yeah that's rough don't get
yourself there aren't any the
top-selling tablets on the planet are
the iPad the kindle fire and the Nexus 7
those are the three tablets that have
sold the most in history even the Nook
Tablet i think sold more than a lot of
samsung tablets yeah they're trying
they've been trying to push this
landscape for in fact there ever since
the motorola xoom and it does not work
sixteen by nine on it on a thick tablet
is heavy and it's uncomfortable and
people don't like it people ended up
buying the zoom and returning it and
that's why this tablet you know I'm sad
because I wanted four by three or
whatever you know the Nexus 7 is a
perfect example of how you can fit a 16
by 9 screen on a sort of a non too long
factor and it they made it portrait
oriented that's what they should have
done with this tablet and I feel I feel
that it's gonna fail I sadly feel that
it's going to fail you know if that's
it's a solid prediction I can't
necessarily disagree with it I landscape
is a weird orientation to choose for the
primary orientation of a tablet I get
why you would do it but it's tough it's
a tough case to make I don't I don't
have a whole lot of confidence no
Michael can you imagine my Nexus 10 how
would that look on 10 10 inches of empty
screens no I know third thing everything
and just for me to make a point and a
lot of people don't understand this but
for example i worked in airlines for 15
years and if for example you guys know
why seats on an air on an airplane or
are you know most of the cloth is tinted
blue know so that they don't need to
wash it when they're there they're dirty
they're dirty okay no I would guess ya
blue actually is a color that inspires
both Komnas and royalty so it gives it
gives the psychological impression to
customer that the airline is actually a
top-tier airline and it also brings
calmness to users so my point is
everything has a psychological effect on
people everything sure um you know the
reason why Mazda use it you know why did
the mazda3 become the most popular Mazda
ever sold her 323 i think it was it was
because of that smiley face in front of
the car that was drawn by the design
which is on so much yeah but people love
that you know the average user love that
everything has a psychological purpose
of being the way it is you saying adult
is 10 is is is is like it as a landscape
device sends the wrong message right off
the bat since there are all the
landscape tablets that have ever been
launched have not sold for many reasons
true but why is it what's the difference
between if you think about it it's only
hardware oriented differently but
everything has a psychological impact on
people absolutely yep the comes the news
for example why do you think that sharp
borders on anything feel offensive for
people have you ever seen a the LG what
is it the optimist
view I mean oh yeah yeah oh the Vice
with sharp corners that actually sold
and you know it was no I the razor edge
sharp corners like you know it's a it's
it's not an all encompassing yeah it all
depends and yeah I can tell you this
much since Google Google's Android is
not a 4 x free platform 84 x free
supporting platform they don't have
really much choices but to go with a
landscape form factor because everybody
any anyone who has ever held a 10 inch
android tablet and has turned it into
portrait that thing sucks that still
works yeah but they don't have a choice
but to go with landscape well you know
I've installed cm9 or whatever the hell
was on the on the HP TouchPad for one of
my first videos for propaganda and like
you know using Android in portrait
orientation isn't fun but on a four by
three device like that it's not bad it's
it's certainly much better than it is
unlike the motorola xoom or something
with a 16 by 9 where you just feel
ridiculous holding the thing on but
what's concerning to me about the nexus
7 this will be my last point on the
excuse me in the nexus 10 is that they
have not solved the problem of this app
this app question an apple made sure to
nail them on this when they were
comparing the ipad made anything against
nexus 7 they're like look at the app
experience when you stretch a phone app
up yeah i think it looks like crap and
it does it looks better on the nexus 7
than it does on any other android device
because it's smaller you stretch a phone
app to 10 inches and still look at
pandora running on a 10 inch android
tablet it is hilarious how who knows i
be maybe android 4.2 will bring
something like I don't know small
windows and you'll block launch Twitter
or Facebook on a 10 inch tablet then it
will take up only a small part of the
screen instead of just maximizing and
seeing empty space everywhere which
would be awesome cuz we which would
think we've learned that that floating
windows are actually like possible and
awesome on Android devices with the
galaxy note 2 and like the only good
thing about the 10 dot one maybe yeah
let's see what Monday brings let's see
what Monday brings we'll see we may see
Android for tattoo on on monday Joe
Levi's a great piece up we can't talk
about because we have to move on but you
should i'm looking forward to to
google's event on monday while we're
talking about 16 by 9 tablets let's
let's do it let's jump into this this
surface news the survival yeah the
surface RT kind of had its coming out
party dudes it's like it started there
was a press conference yesterday it's
gone into today we've got some hands-on
coverage on the site adam lean got his
hands on what about 14 billion in
windows 8 tablets yep every two minutes
like anyone with this hands-on with it
and all all 14 billion above by the way
not not just some yeah not just some of
them all of them i mean so this has been
cool it's been fun to watch the flood
we're gonna have we're gonna have
surface review up early next week so you
just stay tuned for their impressions on
that but it's so interesting to watch
the internet and I did this for
editorial I wrote yesterday about
pre-orders more Tony and I were talking
about you know what what does the
surface say about the state of
pre-orders and I kind of whipped up a
piece on that and you know everybody
hated it and that's cool whatever but uh
it's so interesting to like survey the
internet and see the reactions from
sites that i like you know and i
probably looked at reviews from eight
eight to ten different different tech
sites in it it's it's interesting to see
what the reaction have been so far and
pretty much everybody agrees that the
hardware is really amazing with that
vapor mg that magnesium sort of weird
alloy that they're doing there but also
a lot of people are saying that it is
because of what we were just talking
about with this 16 by 9 aspect ratio
that it is very awkward in portrait and
and of course it is and that's why the
you know the capacitive windows button
is down in landscape orientation on the
on the long side i have to admit to
having forgotten that when when they
microsoft announced the surface i knew
that i'm sure i wrote about it but it
wasn't until the review started coming
out that i was like oh yeah this is one
of those really long tablets um that's
weird you know combined with the not
negligible weight of the thing and the
fact that several reviewers said that it
really feels like it wants to be on a
desk you know it wants to be a wants to
be a computer with the with the touch
you know keyboard deployed like I don't
know I i I've been kind of damaged by
the ipad 3 i've felt the pain of
carrying around a tablet that is too
heavy for me to carry around comfortably
in my daily use I'm not saying it's very
heavy thing and you know commenters like
are you got a blue sweets if you think
that's heavy and shut up shut up but
like I called you puny me exactly man oh
man what you think that's big you gotta
do some hand stretches if you go on
Carrie that's you know I think I think
that I remember I'm trying to remember
when I saw this documentary about how
important design is to a product yeah
you know I think that you know certain
the reasons I think that tablets are
made in landscape orientation for all
the wrong reasons why do you use a
tablet the most for and the most you do
use it for or at least in my particular
case is to consume content like visit
websites like the active thing of
looking at Twitter looking at Facebook
and usually i'm doing that standing up
holding the tablet and moving around the
kitchen or moving around the living room
or stuff and if I am forced by the
design of the tablet to only be able to
hold it one way then it just becomes a
cumbersome experience particular that I
would like to choose my orientation and
to not have the tablet-optimized to
watch a movie that i rarely do yes I've
agreed and when you are doing you are
using it one-handed if you're walking
around you can deal with that in
portrait because of the you know physics
be holding it in landscape orientation
you've got all this weight just
extending out and you're only anchoring
it on one side with your aunt it's very
uncomfortable it's very annoying okay am
I the only one who likes the design of
the surface yes oh let me just make a
point here I like the design really like
the design of the surface to I like it
the design is cool ty where you love to
see a phone with that design bio me John
I think we most certain I'd will I feel
it's futuristic I feel it's cool I feel
my problem with the surface is that I
feel that it misses the point but well
or probably it's it's us that missed the
point about the fact that like you said
it wants to be on a table and we're
trying to look at this as a tablet man
it's it's not it's like
it's like a different category of
convertible more so than it has a real
tablet and that's you know I see they're
good or bad probably here's the point if
they would have made the win the surface
pro with the sharp edges and everything
um that I would have minded because it's
really a tablet that's designed to be
more on the table you're just you have
the option of picking it up but it
wasn't really designed to be used that
way but the problem with windows RT is
that it's actually designed to be a
tablet it's actually designed to cater
to users that guy to choose a tablet or
computer and the problem is that the
design is not really optimized for you
to hold it and carry it around and it's
funny because you see these ads and
these guys just make it look so easy and
they've got these beachbody sitting
inside their their their shirts and
everything that I'm telling you about
this but but seriously that that's just
the point the tablet it has sharp
corners um and I'm like you know when I
got the comments yesterday I'm like
listen man you want to buy the thing and
just hold it whichever way you want just
buy the damn thing I don't care what you
I'm trying to justify your purchase
honey you putting so many tablets um out
of owning I've owned six tablets already
I i want to tell you what it's like to
carry a device with sharp corners i own
the zoo yeah and it was probably the
closest analogue right to this device as
far as like a like a form factor
consideration goes and Tony you're
saying that you like the you like the
sixteen by nine you like the landscape
focus what do you I do like the 16 x 10
aspect ratio I'm a surface I do like the
outer aspect in in general on the
surface and I don't care about the
weight and about the weight distribution
I'm a big guy I can cope with that so my
biggest problem with the surface the RT
version is that it's running Windows RT
and so when my problem is with Windows
RT not because I would be or somebody
would imply that I'm a hater know and
not a hater I would love this to succeed
but then looking at Windows RT and I
think windows RT is the windows phone
seven for the tablet no y SI unit from a
good I want to talk software for a
second but for from a design perspective
I like how the two played together I
want to say that because you know as
like the consensus that maybe is being
forced on everyone is that by all these
reviews and first impressions is that
well the hardware is great the software
is half-baked like that's kind of the
theme that I took from maybe 6 out of 10
reviews but they play so nicely together
from a design perspective you know HTC
when they dropped their windows phone 8x
and 8s they were like so the design
inspiration was what if you took a tile
from Windows Phone 8 and stretched it
out into a phone yeah you know I like
that's like you know that's an awesome
cool like concept and I feel like the
surface thing the surface does that well
like windows 8 on like active on the
screen turned on on the surface all
those square tiles play really nicely
with the surface is really really square
design and sharp corners and I like that
they play well together in that respect
I agree that Windows RT is maybe a
little bit i have my have my
reservations about the Metro UI but I'm
not going to go into that because I'm
not take too long i I just I just want
to say this I just want to say this the
problem with the surface RT is that and
I as I mentioned that yesterday um
whenever the problem with buying a
crossover SUV is that you're not getting
the full power of full-blown as you
you're a truck but you still have to pay
for it and you're not getting the speed
of a sedan this is a good an option so
you're not really getting the full blown
experience of either one of these you're
just getting a mid-tier product the
problem with the surface RT is that
there are no apps um there are no apps
whatsoever it's it's like it's I can't
believe Microsoft can't figure this out
seriously you know we're talking about
the company that has a seal that stood
in front of people with a song saying
the developers developers developers
develop and where the hell is developers
now they're not let's not forget guys
this is a vicious circle I mean in order
to drive developers to a platform there
has to be a certain demands for that
platform and or not enter my subversive
yeah but the problem with this is that
Microsoft is not to be trusted we have a
company here who's changed their mobile
strategy twice in the last five years
they had windows mobile 6.5 they dished
it they came out with Windows
7 now they pretty much ditch that in
everything I be catered to windows 8 and
people are just waiting to see because
they clearly see that Microsoft doesn't
understand where they're going but they
didn't that that's just my point i think
is a disease is it the final step if
it's not if windows 8 and windows phone
8 are not the final the final thrust for
Microsoft and then then well there's
always windows 9 yeah but but to make
you see developers don't trust don't
trust them right to make my point and
the point that I was trying to make with
the editorial yesterday is this um if
you the good thing about buying an ipad
is that you're getting a tablet that's
not trying to be anything else but a
tablet that's what makes the ipad
special at the fact that it's not not
trying to copy anything it's time i
agree with you but i have read a very
interesting comment i don't know on
which of our boats was thankfully we had
lots of comments so regardless there was
this guy who was telling me and replied
to one of my comments that i am
physically incapable of accepting the
surface for what it is so he was he was
advocating for this idea that the
surface is a new breed of products of
the consumer electronics and that we
need to accept that as it is and stop
comparing it with ultrabooks on one hand
or tablets on the other hand okay fine
I'll accept that I just won't buy it
that's the thing it does it it doesn't
invite me to buy it free to my choice my
point is this I doesn't invite me to buy
it and it doesn't invite me to buy it
because the platform is I have to choose
over a product that doesn't want to be a
tablet and it doesn't want to be a
laptop so why am I gonna pay for Windows
RT if I could just pay for windows 8 pro
on a surface pro and get the full blown
experience of window that that's my
point and the problem is that that
they're trying to create a product that
doesn't need to be created it's like if
you try to create a car with three
wheels what's the point I I don't know I
I think that this is a very very
compelling compelling a strategy I don't
know if it would be successful I think
the idea the theory of like you don't
carry a tablet and a phone ice cube
don't care a tablet in a computer carry
something that can be both like this
almost never works
I get it it's so hard to do because you
like you like you're saying the better
product is the product that knows what
it is and does the one thing it does
well this is why them had phone is such
a ridiculous ridiculously cool concept
that's never going to work because you
know i don't think the it does well in
either of his configurations not that
I've held one just a disclaimer they're
just from from everything I've read so I
I I would love to see this work someday
because I don't like carrying multiple
devices if i'm going to write to write
something i don't want to carry a tablet
and a computer but i have to that's
annoying so i would like it if it could
work what what is what is your saying i
have two sayings first one is in
romanian and it goes like this she
colada she bezels which means both on a
horseback and by foot it's not possible
and the other weapons in hungarian which
says that edge again I'm LED module
midooni Kate Lovett and it goes like you
cannot write put your ass on two horses
you called in between I I listen I
understand I understand no I think
you're absolutely right i think those
are those are perfect perfect analogies
that's like that bet calls are a shot
right now where's my scotch let's move
on our fun that's that's great quest
that sequence in RT poisoning oh where
would even anyway so regardless we'll
say we're gonna have a lot more on the
surface i want to ask this question
because this is such a cool head line
and i love the question this is from
steven with so much surface interest
who's buying the other windows 8 tablets
I am fascinating idea and you know what
I I am I am too because I'm I'm i want
to buy the envy x2 I love I would
probably the bait you would give us one
I look stupid raising my hand right now
but I'm actually get to your I am now no
I get no comments in mind so here's the
thing like we know about these other
products right we know about these these
convertibles and tablets running Windows
8 from other manufacturers I don't think
anyone else does yet because of course
the marketing hasn't kicked in yet in
whatever whatever but in a way it's a
valid question surface is going to get
the most buzz out of all these I think
because it who's excited about a
product out in the regular world nobody
HP doesn't excite people in the consumer
way they even said it when Apotheker was
like we want to be as cool as apple and
we're not maybe the only the only good
thing he got no but I'll make a point
I'll make a point and I'm sorry to
interrupt only just a small point I
think that a sous made a really
compelling design with a transformer
prime with making a keyboard dark that
brings the addition of a battery and a
USB port and just making I think they
made the perfect concept for what a
Windows 8 tablet has to be it has to be
a product where if I get the keyboard
that keyboard actually has to mean
something yeah it has to give me extra
battery if you don't use usb when you're
on tablet mode because you're not going
to be carrying the tablet with a wire
but you use USBs when you have it on the
table so that's like the perfect idea
you have the keyboard dock where
everything is and then you use it as a
tablet whenever you don't need it that
is the perfect windows 8 design and I am
the one that's gonna be getting one nice
it's a solid point tell me what were you
gonna say I was going to ask you one
thing and one thing only if you remember
back in Berlin when we were there with
the occasion of IFA how many roughly
windows 8 devices did you see God with
around five to ten so many yeah there
are a ton ok envy x2 aside which one
would you buy now I don't remember any
of the other well that's my point yeah I
remember chase for w5 something MW if I
remember him like i tend to samsung's
but but still none of those appeal to me
i'm not necessarily because the hardware
because because we we don't know that
much about this entire windows 8 /
windows RT thing I mean Microsoft did a
piss-poor job letting us you know what
they are doing or they made a fantastic
job and keeping us in the dark yes it
was it's one of the two and yeah would
do we whether it's a good or bad they
definitely did it so yeah we I don't
know you know we'll have to see how this
how this goes like moving forward but i
think it's it's really cool and I think
we get tangled up in the details a lot
and it's i just want to mention that it
is really cool to be watching a new
platform kind of try and take take hold
obviously windows 8 itself it has to be
a success Microsoft will make it a
success on the desktop but to watch it
try and like filter into this tablet
convertible category and to watch
Windows Phone 28 try and grab some hold
I mean that's awesome and it doesn't
matter it's not that it's from Microsoft
it's not that it's a windows but it is
just leave all that aside it's a it's a
platform that doesn't have much share
trying to trying to get to a place where
they are significant and that's awesome
it's it's cool to watch that happen true
so great i'm excited for the next couple
months i'll give it to them I'll just
ask Joe Belfiore please if you're
listening to this doing a favor whenever
you stand and do a presentation talk
about anything else that's not the live
tiles please you know there is so much
more to Windows Phone than the little
tiles you know and and do me another
favor you know that people hub whenever
I see somebody that I have a thousand
comments on my a thousand people on my
facebook and so whenever I see an image
of somebody that I remember I'm like oh
here's this guy and i touch my windows
phone seven people icon and it takes me
to just the whole list and that it
doesn't even remember me remind me of
who that person is i forgot their name
I'm like damn this tile should be
smarter draft letter draft a letter will
send these deer meat up yeah please Joe
talk about anything else that's not the
live tiles a sword spin him I got the
point so let's move on speaking of
Windows Phone this just very quickly to
touch on this steven has a cool piece
from yesterday okay microsoft exec
blames smartphone missteps on desktop
security focus very interesting Tony
asked me to to include this in the
rundown and I just took a look at it was
like wow yeah well this is what happen
when they're having it here yeah this
would have been the perfect topic for a
role play oh god I'm buddy it's the only
time this is the only time I will ever
say that I'm glad Brandon is not here at
this very moment I'm not gonna force you
to do one let's just imagine this
situations only I want to make it third
only because of the role play i love
Brennan I love having them on the pocket
I'm just saying I just want to do a role
play right now go ahead time we're not
talking Microsoft in the late 70s when
they are doing things in their garage
we're adopting Microsoft in
2000s when they are one of the biggest
companies in the world with dedicated
sections of their company for every
aspect of Microsoft so when when
somebody says excuse me nonsense because
I don't want to use the c-word like this
I just come to think of it that the
entire windows mobile / Windows Phone
team who was working allegedly on
something got a memo and they said I'm
sorry I've talked to the big ones and
we're now shifting focus on security so
what did that team do did they just go
to work and do nothing for like two or
three years I mean I can't really
understand this as an excuse you have
hundreds of people working on the phone
segment hundreds of people working on
the Windows desktop segment just because
you're shifting focus to computers it
doesn't mean that you are ignoring fire
ring or just bring your people in the
windows phone segment to work and you're
paying them for nothing this is this is
a lame excuse and and it's not working
with me yeah yeah but blackberry must be
like really laughing at this you know
the guys at room who figured it out
before they did yeah well they're I
don't think they're laughing about
anything these days true but but what uh
I mean Apple figured it out with iOS too
so come on yeah it's it's that thing
that companies do where they're like you
know hey we need to talk about how we
fell off the you know fell off the top
of the mountain and now we're coming
yeah trying to climb out of the motor
for a phone sure man any excuse right
this is a corporate thing and I like
peeks into companies and where stuff
goes wrong but I I agree with you that I
don't but I don't really buy it yeah
yeah no it's a good call um dia the last
thing i want to touch on in Windows
Phone and Windows is jessica alba famed
famed actress who has been spotted with
a Nokia Lumia 920 on the scene normally
this would not be terribly newsworthy
but the as we know windows phone 8 is
heavily dependent on the Nokia Lumia
push and to see a pre-release device
which by the way which we have been able
to touch but not without but with strict
understanding that we're not
damn thing in the software like they are
so so paranoid about anybody getting a
hand on the software that it's
interesting to see a pre-release device
in the wild and I almost wonder of this
920 is running of Jessica Alba's as may
be running windows phone seven eight
that's a dummy did you think it's a
dummy well I think she's carrying it
like with her white iPad which is ending
justification here so I don't know I'm
cool to see it's good to be a celebrity
as the headline says let me tell you
this much if this would have happened
somewhere else you wouldn't have spotted
Jessica although with the Lumia 920 the
Lumia 920 would have spotted you with
Jessica Alba that's a good point did you
really and that's all I'm gonna comment
on this well um that's I I'm looking
forward to more and just I think I just
got it looking for on the on the 920 and
other windows windows devices there's a
lot there was a lot more news from this
week but we've we have done something
that I don't want to do very often but
we have to sometimes that we would last
week we had to skip listener mail I
don't want to do that again we've got a
got a couple pieces to read I do want to
say to listeners that unfortunately the
we're getting enough listener mail now
which is so great it's so awesome but
the dream is kind of over we can no
longer read all of them on the air and
we've actually run out of time to reply
to all them personally so I'm sorry
about that sistance i was saying this
last night i was just sick when i was
like i have to get up early to do this
podcast and the girl i'm seeing is like
what why don't you get can she get an
intern or something i can go that'll be
great Tony let's get an intern yeah sure
give her my give her my email okay all
right good yeah she just volunteered no
um the thing is that there's just so
much of a volume of message traffic we
can't deal with it also thank you so
much everyone think really it's awesome
so just a tip and this is something that
I wish somebody had told me when I used
to write into podcasts and my stuff
would never get read if you want your
your your piece of mail to be read on
the air it should typically it should
not be too long we get a lot of essays
that are really interesting but we can't
read them they should probably include a
question and it
should be a topic that's broad enough
for many people to be interested in so
if we get too specific we can't really
and should be up to 100 words long yeah
that's that's a good good threshold and
if you are a constant writer in we will
try and get you on the rotation please
understand if we have to skip you in
favor of somebody new we got to get you
know give everybody a chance but please
keep writing and I cannot emphasize that
enough we still need your mail so let's
get right to it we have a piece of mail
from mark in limerick ireland i love i
love when people from Ireland or people
from Europe save sale ads well lads love
the podcast I love it listen to it in
bed the day it comes out i love the
topics opinions and personalities my
question is why do you think carrier
prices in the US are so dear and this
isn't translating too well to my slang
filter but I think I sort of get it mark
is making the point that with three
Ireland which is a carrier you can get
the the galaxy s3 for free on a two-year
contract paying about eighty dollars a
month and you get 15 gigs of 15 gigs of
data a month Jesus awesome then this is
something called flex units which is one
minute of a call or two SMS that's
awesome so the this it's cool to learn
about how other carriers bill stuff but
I think that the question is why why is
the price of ways our phone pricing so
out of whack is it population network
maintenance or maybe even something to
do with your culture or maybe you just
have a lot of money it's actually look
it was it the last one we were just yeah
we're just swimming in money all the
time ya know if Anton is on the podcast
ask him about prices in Romania that's
that yeah who say again that you should
ask you next time yeah so uh you know I
don't I don't know I there is a carrier
here in the US and maybe it's telling
that it's one of the carriers that has a
strong international influence t-mobile
USA which is owned by Deutsche Telekom
is the only carrier nationwide carrier
in the US that offers this kind of pay
for the phone as you go kind of thing
where it's like you can get a very
high-end phone for very cheap but you're
paying off the cost of the phone over
the course of the contract not just
paying off the subsidy through your
monthly bill so i don't know and the
rest of the guys yeah the rest of the
carriers are like yeah pay us 299
that's the subsidized price and you'll
get a galaxy note 2 I don't know why
that is I don't know what what the
difference is I think it might be
cultural I think it might be that
Americans um you know we're a little
late to the cell phone game and we got
used to high prices and then the
carriers were like well we're going to
take advantage of this i don't i don't
think so i finally was prices to be
rather cheap and since I've been asked
about the prices in Romania I'm gonna
bring you this example so mark write
this down I'm talking about the galaxy
s3 we don't have the note 2 just yet so
the galaxy s3 on a certain carrier here
who uses animals to describe its
contracts you'll know who I'm talking
about so first option 159 you rose
two-year contract 49 euros per month 199
gyros with two year contract 39 euros
per month and 360 rose two-year contract
23 euros per month you can make a
calculation and see what the end price
will be for this phone yeah yeah would
see that's interesting because in the US
and I want to hear if this is true in
South America like in the u.s. it
doesn't matter you don't have to pick a
certain rate plan to get a certain
pricing on the phone like the phone if
you get a contract you can get a forty
dollar a month planner you can get a two
hundred dollar-a-month plan it doesn't
matter the subsidized cost of the phone
will remain the same yeah um which you
know I guess makes it easier to talk
about but makes it a little more
frustrating if you're like I'm gonna be
spending 200 hours a month with you guys
why am I paying the same amount for the
phone I get that that's confusing and
weird is that the same case in in in
South America no no and here it's it's
different you can either go for a
subsidy but the subsidy price changes
depending on the plan okay um for
example the iphone the the higher the
plan that you get you if you get like
the one hundred dollar plan you get the
phone for like two hundred dollars but
the problem is that free paid here is
actually much bigger than postpaid than
credit and the reason why is because you
know the the country sadly if you know
it's not economically a stable country
so a lot of people don't have very good
credit scores and so it's hard for them
to get you know to either pay the bills
for keep the habit but
you know the country is just boom with
prepaid and so what they do is that they
they offer you the phone on 12 months no
interest on your credit card or whatever
you have any sort of means and then you
just get a prepaid plan and that's what
they do mostly and the reason why is
because for example an iphone 5 here a
brand new iphone 5 you want to get it'll
cost you fifteen hundred bucks whoa
1,500 bucks that's how much the phone
costs here and that you know it's just
the way it is but I you know in my point
but I studied business and retention I
feel really bad for Canadians because
they have to face so much more money and
sign in for three-year contracts to keep
a phone yeah the three-year contract
yeah that is that is like crazy but
they're the only reason why carriers do
that over there is because they can't
because people are actually willing to
pay for it but I think in Canada they
also have the option to go with one year
or two years they have the option when
they got a mere equipment they mostly go
for that I think that's what I've seen I
I'm no expert i I wish that some some of
our Canadian listeners would just chime
in on the comments here yeah but what
I've heard is mostly its three-year
contracts if you want to get like a full
subset of your stuff and that's just
crazy I mean it felt early last two
years it barely does but but the point
is they do that because they can because
you can get a galaxy s3 in this country
cheap you know you get it for a lot less
money and that's just because Samsung is
pushing it and they just want to push it
really hard are you get a blackberry
really cheap here so it just the you
know the thing like various states is
that you know possible sorry wrap it up
hi mate no I'm sorry I was making a
stupid joke um yeah you know I don't
know I think I think it is we have so
many different models and in so many
different countries and it all works
really differently III don't know you
know a mark I I wish which had more more
American insight into it other than my
initial complaint which was yeah i think
we pay more and then hi mate comes along
and says $1,500 for an iphone 5 that's
ridiculous yeah we pay we pay a lot more
for everything so the point being is i
think that they tropical eyes each of
their strategy is depending on the
market that's just the way it is if the
market has the capability to pay for
something they'll charge you more that's
the way it is well let's um let's move
on a little bit here we got a
have mail from from Kenneth meadows in
Ohio guys love listen your podcasts
while I wash cars at work that is an
awesome replace to listen or PI oh
that's that's sweet that's a dirt thing
to say to the podcast it definitely
makes a day fly by so my question i
bought my blue galaxy s3 back in june
from AT&amp;amp;T sadly 30 plus days after i
activated the red one was released i
hate it when that happens I was not able
to get it because my 30 we were terribly
30 day return period was up I was
wondering if you would have a solution
to changing the color without a case
thanks you forget about it no I do have
one I've got one I do have one will exam
paper no no so Kenny go on to pocket
naka and search in the search box for
this HTC touch diamond Adam lying
edition oh yes it's you are in the car
wash business you most probably have
somebody who works at a paint shop so
just paint that phone you can take the
the back of it and and if they're pros
they can they can paint it real nice for
you mascot fans you can have whatever
color you want oh it's awesome and it is
see what if a bill unicrone this sounds
like it's really funny ridiculous
solution and that sounds it sounds like
something and it probably cost a little
bit but if you look at Adams special
edition touch diameter I remember asking
I'm like where did you get that that's
outrageously cool so yeah automotive
detailing shop will do that but there's
also some some retail outlets color
where is probably the most well-known
they only do color changes on the iphone
and on the blackberry and they're not
cheap but there is there were rumors
that they were going to do the s3 who
knows they don't do it yet but anyway
the name of that site if you want to
keep an eye on it Kenny is color where C
olor wa re and I was also looking at a
quick google search gave me gelaskins
gelaskins calm GTL a skins they have a
lot of wraps that are kind of graphical
they're not color-changing wraps
necessarily but they're you know so it's
like decals yeah they're like decals and
I think a lot of commenters were saying
that like those will peel off on the
galaxy s3's curves and you know they
might expect probably yeah but they're
really cool and you know the problem
with the galaxy s3 have you found out
how much swapping the the housing costs
I mean the
screen assembly alone costs like 250
bucks yeah so don't try to go that route
just get a gelaskin or get a color where
and just get a couple of them and swap
your colors every week or something yeah
yeah so or you know if you if you if you
want to go the cheaper route just get a
different color battery door get a
couple of those and swap those out and
unfortunately the face won't be fixed
but hope that's or you can get a samsung
cover that thing which i hate so on this
book thing that comes with with a
backplate and I am Boba's like look it
adds bulk but at escala ruptured that's
a good no I go by the way Kenny I have
the blue galaxy s3 by choice i find it
to be the most beautiful one so i think
you got a cool phone there you probably
she wants to be unique right yeah girl
that's a good fun uh I'll give it to him
all right let's move on to our second
last piece or emails from mike bates
who's written to us before hey Mike this
is a cool 1i like this I did not know
that Mike was currently a freshman in
high school congratulations good luck in
the next four years that is a difficult
time and go easy on stuff yeah he's
helping to run an android mobile
technology news site he writes an
average of 35 articles a day in addition
of daily video news sites been up a few
months and they're starting to get
awareness and that's awesome that's cool
he says I'm really liking tech
journalism I'm wondering what kind of
things you guys studied in high school
college that you think helped you get
where you are also do you've any tips
for getting more well known in the
community thanks Mike cool question um
iid I'll tell you what I studied Mike I
studied acting so I think we are all
spot on the way I see the team we are
all I mean the the thing is I think this
is one of those industries that requires
it requires a lot of different types of
skill sets a lot of people with
different skill sets and I think that it
also has a lot of room for people with
different skill sets some of us on the
team are really good at one thing and
not good at another others are the exact
opposite of that so I think Mike it
doesn't it ultimately doesn't matter
what you choose to study the industry
has seems to have room for a lot of
different types of people do you guys
agree agree yeah
I and I think I am the same as everybody
else on the team with one maybe
exception and nothing in common with
with this field i'm working in right now
I finished pathology on law school so
I'm by no means a tech-oriented from
school person but I think what it takes
is dedication and love for the industry
for technology for gadgets an open mind
and if you want advice try to always be
as unbiased as you can this is the key
to success and the community will
recognize you for that charlie'd true
and my case I well I studied business I
worked in Airlines for 15 years and
before that I had a ton of odd jobs so I
honestly my experience with this pretty
much had to be that I was a contributor
in just about every form you can think
of and you know the way I learned the
way I landed in pocket now was because I
actually bricked my HP ipaq nineteen
forty years ago and there was this guy
on the format pocket now that actually
helped me out and so you know it doesn't
really I don't think it requires a
specific you know skill set I just think
that like Tony said you require an open
mind if you wanted to and the second one
which is the tip that I'll give you and
with it's something that all of us at
pocket now share and it's be a
perfectionist and you know it's funny
because a lot of people have negative
things to say about perfectionism but if
it wasn't for perfectionism you wouldn't
see them the Michael Jackson videos that
you see or the way the guy would dance
or you know music videos would be
totally different in movies would be
totally different if there wasn't a
perfectionist guy that came and just
raised the bar of how things have to be
so if you see a certain you know at
parking now we've been this way we've
seen people do video in a certain way
and we're like no we want to do video
better we want it to be good we want
people to like it we want it to be a
pleasant experience and we've seen it at
orioles in other ways and I think the
perfectionism really helps you raise the
bar and give readers you know more4 for
their time obviously it's going to
require a lot more effort well you know
sometimes I end up converting a video
four times just because I get a green
flash at the end or something
stupid I know but but you know that's
you know that level of respect towards
your readers and your viewers is would
really grow up Garner's you Garner's you
can popularity the fact that you care
about ya know that's that is that's that
a solid I think you said it better than
better than I could so Mike I hope that
is a that is helpful thank you for for
following us and let me know shoot us a
shoot us an email with your site I
didn't I didn't omit your site name for
proprietary reasons I just didn't didn't
receive it so shoot his name up with
your site will check it out and and good
luck to you and finally we've got an
email from John Abrahms hey guys love
the podcast John his contract ended on
his blackberry 9630 finally ended a few
months ago he says he's finally able to
get his first super phone he says pretty
clear you got her choosing OS you got to
choose an ecosystem with that in mind
which OS he asks I a cos Android Windows
Phone or other do you think has the
brightest future in terms of continuing
to grow innovate and have the best end
user experience in other words if you
had to choose one operating system you
use for presumably the rest of your life
which walled garden would you choose
that's from John Abrahms of the planet
Earth got my answer do you guys yeah I
got mine too yeah fire away Tony Tony go
for it okay so my answer the way i see
it i have three questions here and i
will give you three answers the the
brightest future of continuing to grow
is one answer innovate is a second
answer and have the best user experience
is a third answer because you won't get
all of these in one platform so as far
as I see things right now innovation now
let's start with the terms of continuing
of to grow I think android has the power
to continue to grow so that's Android
innovation I'd say go with Windows Phone
and if you look for the end user
experience go with iOS I know it wasn't
helpful but your question was phrased in
such way that these are my thoughts
that's a nice that's a good rep good
roundup and I can't disagree with your
conclusions yeah what about Jaime agreed
in my case I'm you come from a
blackberry John and so do i I used
blackberries for work for like five or
six years back when they were bricks and
you know for me moving
from from from windows mobile to a
blackberry was a big change in paradigm
but I actually liked it because you know
it was really smart you know messaging
and everything is blocked in one place
you have to be looking around with an
apps and everything but for me switching
from that to iOS really helped because
the learning curve was small and you
know that's what I tell people isn't it
for your first smartphone i do recommend
you probably consider an iphone just
because it requires a very small
learning curve and everything is calm
calm part to mentalize how do you say
that any good apartment elastin yeah
right so it makes the learning curve
easy you know I've learned of a lot of
people that have adopted Android
initially but they don't really have an
open mind you know probably because of
their age or whatever and they just
block themselves and return the phone
and they're they're not doing justice to
Android because it's a really great
platform the only problem is it's
catered for power users so my advice do
you probably try an iphone first and and
you know if you feel comfortable with it
just move on to a galaxy phone
eventually or you know something like
that so I I think that um you kind of
taking all these points that you raised
John into into balance and trying to
find a happy medium many of them aground
I think in terms of continuing to grow
Android is is definitely the one to to
look at there i mean it's just a
juggernaut and it shows no sign of
slowing anytime soon as far as
innovation goes google is no slouch when
it comes to innovation either you know
you just need to look at the various
unlock options and stock android to see
that and that's just a minor point and
then you've got the the OEMs
contributing to that too if you want to
go with the Samsung device that does
crazy stuff like smart stay and whatever
and yeah yada yada yada and have the
best end-user experience while yeah i
feei think iOS delivers that right now i
think i think jellybean is really
interesting and its stock configuration
and starting to get so clean and i
cannot i'm going to sound like the
fanboy i am the retired webos fanboy am
I think with matias duarte continuing to
exert his influence at Google Android is
going to get even more acceptable from a
user interface standpoint and it might
even grow excellent yes so I think
android is probably the best bet
make their which is not too that is a
little bit of a judgment against iOS i
I'm annoyed that it hasn't changed in
five years and I'm worried it won't
change for another five and that Apple
time I said earlier in the podcast Apple
is is doing the blackberry thing now he
was saying that in a different context
but i think that apple is doing the
blackberry thing from a UI perspective
and that's very annoying a windows phone
I can't say one way or the other because
haven't used eight yet so Android would
be my my vote for you that would be the
walled garden that I would choose yeah
the commenters are probably going crazy
right now pleased with what do you mean
windows phone and was not proven until
you get the low man on to what are you
talking yeah and by the way I'm still
planning on buying a 920 just in case
then just just get Jesse girl by instead
let's go yeah all right well I think we
have we have gone well over time this is
the easily the longest podcast in our
history but we had a lot of news to

final thoughts Tony it was like no here

nothing specific comma but should I say
this I love it no I'm just giving you
good news crap i may know in my case I'm
just you know this is probably the most
competitive year that I've ever seen in
the platform as smartphone platform as
it isn't even tablets I I feel is a
great year I mean I seek companies going
crazy they want to launch the product
before the other and they've got so many
products and I I feel this is just the
