don't believe that every rumor will make
the cut it seems that there is an extra
Samsung Galaxy as in the works and it's
not the active and it seems that there
are a few things that are kind of
backwards about the 1+5 I'm hiding that
Iveta and about the only thing that I
need flip today is either the data in
the calendar or the day of the week
this is far going out daily
the official news today begin with deals
and sort of crazy deals if you think
about it mainly because the spy and
Sprint have got iPhones at I think it's
kind of crazy for example in the case of
the iPhone S II if you grab it for 24
months you're going to end up paying 249
a month I did not miss any digits 249
and then if you go for any other device
like the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus some
of these models are at least $250 off
again Best Buy Sprint learn one a
description now let's talk about the one
plus five as these whole jelly effect
issues were dismissed by the company but
certain people have found that there
might be a cause and the cause is kind
of weird weird because apparently
somebody's claiming that the display is
backwards on this phone I don't think it
has to do anything with hardware mini
because there's just no way you're going
to install it backwards unless something
has to be really wrong but they're
claiming the display is backwards which
we're hoping there's a software bug
because other people have discovered
that that's not the only thing that's
backwards if you record video on certain
devices the audio is backwards it's
recording things from the right that are
actually coming from the left you can
learn more on certain videos there in
the link in the description because you
have to listen to them with headphones
now let's talk about market share
certain companies are already providing
preliminary results of which devices are
performing the best in the United States
according to them the device that
continues to sell like hotcakes at the
galaxy as eight and that is completely
understandable this is a great device
another device that is actually bouncing
back into popularity as the iPhone 7
iPhone 7 plus makes a lot of sense Apple
has been doing a lot of marketing and
obviously Iowa's 11s brought a couple of
changes that are kind of compelling but
the back problem here is that apparently
the LG G 6 is not doing well at all up
to the point where the device is being
considered a flop obviously these are
preliminary limbers we will let you know
as soon as we learn more
and speaking of predictions KGI is
famous for getting a ton of things right
when it comes to iphones ipads Macs and
well the firm has just chimed in over
what to expect with the next generation
iPhone according to the company yes
the bezels are going away according to
the company yes the 3d facial
recognition is coming you know what's
not coming apparently that such ID on
the display is not going to make the cut
obviously this throw schematics off the
table here we're not exactly sure what
to expect anymore but this is regular
we're kind of too far off for that to be
something that we can consider confirmed
that we continue to see dummies here and
there but yeah stay tuned as this might
change over time and finally the very
interesting rumors that they have to do
with the fact that apparently there is
another Samsung Galaxy s8 in the works
not the active apparently there is of
many in the works but listen to this one
because this phone is actually not so
many we're talking about a 5.3 inch
display that's obviously sandwiched into
a 4.7 inch chassis which makes a lot of
sense this is pretty much going to be
the size of a regular iPhone 7 that's
great
but most interesting is the internals
because we're getting a Snapdragon 820
one 32 gigs of storage we're not exactly
sure what Ram we're getting here but
apparently we're pretty much holding an
LG g6 and for those of you that know we
really do recommend the g6 this is
actually a very good smartphone the
sanitarian 821 is still a great
processor so this is not necessarily an
underpowered version of the Galaxy s8 I
consider compelling but it leads me to
the question today what do you think
would you consider this Galaxy s8 Mini
in my case I would that thing would be
perfectly sized but leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
