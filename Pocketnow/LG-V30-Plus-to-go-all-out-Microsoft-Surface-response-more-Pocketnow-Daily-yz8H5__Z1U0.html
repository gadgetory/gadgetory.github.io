seems to be an extra V 30 up in the
works we get more details on the future
of the Moto X become and Microsoft
insists that there is nothing wrong with
its surface lineup I'm high metal Iveta
and if you like these t-shirts that come
from ripped apparel there is a link in
our Instagram in addition to a coupon
code for 10% off
this is out daily official news
that I have to do with deals those of
you in the market for a relatively good
smartphone from last year it's 9:00 p.m.
Eastern right now you still got a few
hours on Best Buy for the Samsung Galaxy
S of an edge it's currently for $192
meaning $7.99 a month that deal is crazy
and that is actually still a very good
smartphone you can learn more in the
description if you have a hard time
telling your uber what is your exact
location
I think uber finally figured out the
fact that I deal with that all the time
up to the point where the company is now
rolling out an enchanting service that
will allow you to communicate with your
driver to let exactly where you are or
whatever particular communication
reasons there are so that is a good
enhancement for uber can't wait for it
to reach lift and other services as well
have you missed all the drama yesterday
of consumer reports withdrawing the
recommendation of the surface lineup
from Microsoft because of lack of
reliability Microsoft has just come up
with a blog post stating that well
Consumer Reports is entitled to their
opinion but they stand behind the
Microsoft Surface the product they
consider to be great and you know what
after using the Microsoft Surface pro
for about a year and using the Surface 3
before that I have to agree with
Microsoft and hey you know when it comes
to our world of reviewers this is
subjective some people have some
opinions other have others I love the
surface for what it is you can learn
more about everything in the description
as well now let's talk about the Moto X
4 we've been wondering exactly what has
happened with this smartphone lineup
particularly because the Moto X moto
maker just got everything brought a lot
of innovation that has been lost with
the death of Motorola to Lenovo the
turns out we've got some very
interesting renders of the phone
apparently these are final and well it
looks like a Moto Z but there are some
disadvantages number one snapdragon 616
processor leaving this phone as a
premium
Ranger accepted dual cameras but there
is no moto maker here no moto mods you
can see the renders again in the
description as well and finally the very
interesting rumors today have to do with
the lgb 30 this is one of the phones
that I am anticipating most this year
the reason why is because I love the V
20 because of its camera and its audio
capabilities obviously the V 30 should
be a boost in that given the fact of g6
was good but not necessarily great as it
turns out it seems that there's not just
one phone apparently there are two
devices in the works that be 30 plus is
also coming 128 gigs of storage in
addition to a new audio system and
wireless charging and while I don't care
about wireless charging it actually
makes me worry a little and it's
actually leading me to the question
today do you think that it's a good idea
for LG to launch an extra V 30 with
features that the smaller a 30 is not
going to have because in my case I think
that that would totally defeat the
purpose of the V 30 I would rather just
have one phone with everything or two
phones and one just be larger than the
other but all features across the board
but anyways that's my opinion
