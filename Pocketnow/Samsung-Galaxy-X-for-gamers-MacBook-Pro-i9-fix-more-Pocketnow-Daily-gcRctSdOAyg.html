being the company's response to gaming
phones the whole Apple and CPU
throttling saga continues
looks like the Twilight movies but
apparently there is a solution and the
Trump tax war continues as well and this
time it might affect iPhones coming to
China and from I'm Jaime Rivera and
definitely this day is crazy
we had a great comparison less than
we've got more coming up soon this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with the Trump tax war in China
now including iPhones and I mean the
current iPhones it seems the US
government has discovered that iPhones
make nine percent of smartphones in
China which I believe is actually a
larger number and he considers that now
he can tax the phones going into China
and also the phones being sold in the
United States obviously this means that
if this happens smartphones will get it
expensive because if you think about it
how is Apple just gonna allow itself to
be taxed and not allow every other
company to be text after this what do
you guys think let us know in the
comments now let's talk about Samsung as
we've got some leaks from Samsung
actually where they show us the 42
millimeter Samsung Galaxy watch whatever
number that will be and interesting it
looks like the gear s2 or pretty much
the gear sport which is actually one of
my favorite watches because it wasn't so
large it was great for sports and this
is a rose gold berry and so it seems
that Samsung wants to play ball with
both the female and male audience with a
larger and smaller watch and different
color options we'll see what we get in
the end now let's talk about the samsung
galaxy note 9 we've got price tags but
these prices are in British pounds so
we're not exactly sure if there will be
a conversion or if they're gonna play an
apple where there is no conversion it's
the same number only in different
currencies very weird Apple but yes am
Sigonella wants to charge 950 dollars
for the base model of the galaxy note 9
and then we're hearing crazy price tags
that could range up to 1500 bucks if you
go for the 512 gigabyte variant
obviously these are just speculations
we'll see what we end up getting in the
end now let's talk about the Apple
MacBook
20 18s all that mess that's happening
with the cpu throttling we've got videos
claiming that it overheats we've got
other videos claiming that yes of course
it overheats but if you're using
premiere that's the reason you can use
Final Cut and you can invoice that and
that makes a lot of sense even though
people don't buy Apple products just to
use Apple software but the thing about
it is there is this feed on reddit that
shows that apparently it's a voltage
issue that if Apple would fix the
voltage problems that could actually be
fixed with software then the CPU would
allocate as much power as it needs and
therefore not need to overheat I'm not
an expert let us know in the comments if
you know about this hopefully that is a
solution and finally the hottest news
today have to do with the biggest
mystery of whatever we're gonna get at
CES in 2019 which is the Samsung Galaxy
X the rumors are that we're getting the
phone aka probable foldable tablet there
but we've been scratching our heads over
what the purpose of this product will be
and according to this sources and these
are actually very large sources we hear
that it's a gaming phone but the whole
purpose from Samsung is that this is
going to be the gaming flagship to
respond to devices like the razor phone
whether that is going to be the case or
not you know it actually makes sense to
me the fact that we can turn it into a
tablet and use it as a gaming phone if
you think about it you've got a larger
canvas but in today's question there's
no what do you think I mean would you
consider this a good idea for gaming
phone one and two what would the price
tag be I mean this is new technology and
you know the way things go leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
