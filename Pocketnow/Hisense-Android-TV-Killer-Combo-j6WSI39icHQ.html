years gaining significant popularity
around the world and it mainly has to do
with how the company has been able to
balance quality features design and
affordability into its products we've
seen their smartphones but the company
was nice enough to sponsor part of our
coverage for CES 2019 the show is their
new line of a 4k TVs all powered by
Android TV I'm Heidi better with pocket
now let's dive in
there are a good amount of highlights to
mention when it comes to high senses
approach to smart TVs but probably what
I like the most is its approach to
Android TV for those of you looking for
Roku televisions they do have the are
six in our seven in addition to others
but I actually spend most of my time
really impressed with Android TV Google
has really made a major push here to
begin for those of you that like the
whole new concept of smart displays
assume that Android TV has grown up to
pretty much bring part of that user
interface and blend it into how
televisions and Smart TVs are handled
this pretty much means that this is not
just a smart TV for content consumption
purposes you can communicate with your
Google assistant for pretty much
anything through the remote and let's
talk about that remote today these are
either too convoluted or too simplistic
I like the approach from high sense
where the remote has a slice that's just
about right
enough buttons for navigation and
shortcuts to popular services that
people actually care about and now for
the stars of the show
Hisense have shown as their new u9f h8f
and h9f lines of 4k android TV powered
televisions leading the list as the
company's flagship the Hisense u9f we
have an insane 75 inches on this display
but that's just part of the story what's
even more important is the company's
proprietary u LED technology and high
view chip it uses a I picture quality
enhancing algorithms to boost color and
contrast through the wide color gamut of
quantum dot technology and we have a
crazy 2,200 nits of brightness to back
that up yes
2200 this allows for more advanced
technologies like Dolby vision and HDR
tend to be supported which is hard to
find even today when compared to other
panels it's easy to notice how colors
like reds or more vibrant and just the
level of detail all around this
fantastic all packaged in an awesome
nearly bezel as design this model will
retail for $34.99 and launched in June
2019
now if you're on a budget don't worry
you can still enjoy the benefits of you
LED in the case of the h8f we have it
included which means support for HDR 10
and Dolby vision there's motion rate 240
for great refresh rates and best of all
asleep does
that's aggressively priced it starts at
399 for the 50 inch model and up to 749
for the 65 inch model and launch plans
are slated for May 2019 now if you want
to take things a step further there is
the h9 Neff to blend the best of both
worlds following on the u9f it also
merges you led with quantum dot
technology for the added kick in color
and an even more powerful refresh rate
through motion rate 480 the result is a
line of this plays that can go brighter
than 1000 nits with a starting price of
$6.99 for the 55 inch and up to $9.99
for the 65 inch panel and also launching
in May 2019 and going back to the
conversation the Smart TVs what I care
about most when buying one is not just
what it can do but how well it does it
usually Smart TVs are very clunky but
that's not the case here I spent a good
deal of time with the most affordable
h8f of the group an Android TV performed
fast and smooth and there's a huge
selection of applications and services
to connect them I feel that Android TV
has finally reached its initial promise
of being an all-around service that's
actually worth taking seriously overall
you know the way we work we do not
accept sponsorships unless these are
products that we liken are willing to
recommend and that definitely is the
case here these are very nice 4k TVs so
far I cannot wait to get one for review
to tell you more let us know what you
think about the offerings from Hisense
