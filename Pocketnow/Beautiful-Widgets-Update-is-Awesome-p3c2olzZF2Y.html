for about two years and there's one
question that keeps getting asked again
and again what's that widget that has
the clock and the weather built into it
I'm Joe Levi this is PocketNow that
widget is called beautiful widgets and
it just got a major update this is my
Nexus 4 and on that I'd like to show you
beautiful widget subversion five this
has been out for just a little while and
we kind of thought it's just another
version of the the beautiful widgets
package so why do another video on it
but you guys keep asking about it and
asking and asking so this is it and and
it's wonderful let me go over some of
the basics once we do the basics then
we'll go into some of the new stuff that
comes with version 5 I've just dropped
the widget on one of my home screens and
now it comes up with this widget
settings I can change to whatever I want
from weather to battery or nothing so
this if I wanted to will show my current
weather conditions or my current battery
conditions if I want either one but not
both location it can pick where I am
right now or you can predefined some
stuff so if you want to have one that's
predefined to Calgary and one that's
predefined to Salt Lake City for example
you can do that and have two of them
running on the same screen at the same
time very nice for travelers or people
who have relatives in different areas if
you want to change the widget name you
can do that and that helps you know
which one you're talking about again for
help with localization and whatnot if
you want to use the local time meaning
the time here I can do that or it'll use
the time of that location if you've got
it set that way I like using them 24
hour clock if you don't you can turn
that off to 12 hour clock and get your
AM and PM and if you like 24 you can
shorten the hours by dropping the
leading 0 off of it so all kind of basic
stuff let's go over to appearance now
you'll notice this is very nice and
smooth and fluid and a nice way to
switch between this before this was the
biggest complaint about this app it was
difficult to set it up and to get it to
work the way you wanted now easy
change the layout I like it with icon to
the right just like that it makes the
weather a little bit bigger we can
change the clock theme so right now I've
got default clock setup let's get some
themes it's got a showcase right here
where it's got kind
the featured items so this is kind of
fun I like that one I haven't seen it
before tap on that we'll hit get it's
downloading the theme takes just a
minute to do it once that's done it's
going to be available for you to apply
we're not going to wait and sit through
that you'll just take my word for it if
you want to go to all themes you can
look at it a twosie author name whatever
all kinds of cool stuff or you can use
the search feature so let's say we're
Michael Fisher and we like Star Trek
more than any person in their right mind
should just KITT and Michael I dig it
too there you go here's all our Trek
related themes and we can just go ahead
and let's say like that one it looks
kind of L car Z go ahead and get that
one I can even share it with whoever I
want via any of my sharing methods right
down there real easy real fast real fun
so that's kind of a new interface and
new look at how it does its thing
overall I don't I get quite a bit
changing the background and colors is
easy too you can hide the background
entirely or bring it back and change the
visibility down just really easy to
whatever opacity level you want hide the
time background if you want or not come
over here to shortcuts each one of these
areas is tappa beloit cat basically take
you into a different app you can
configure those however you want tapping
the time application tapping the date
tapping the the weather over there all
kinds of fun stuff I don't use that if
you want to you can I just go with the
defaults it's easier for me once you're
done hit the checkmark there you go it's
on your screen so that's cool I love it
you can resize this however you want
they've got new tablet sizes so it fits
better on a tablet screen whether that's
wide or narrow or however you've got it
set up but there's one more really cool
thing and it has to do with your
lockscreen so here's my lockscreen and
that you can see I've got my beautiful
widgets right on here complete with the
current temperature date time a nice
icon of what the weather's like today
and the forecast I can come in here and
set up a four by two or four by four or
whatever this one is on my regular
screen and then I have see if I can
swipe over the side this one is then the
full four by four
I've put two of them on here one on this
screen which expands out to full but
normally you're only gonna see it that
size and then another one just for
illustration purposes so you can see
what it looks like really cool but
there's more and I got one more thing to
show you back to the home screen we're
gonna go ahead and tap over here on the
weather and you can see it brings up
this really really nice animated what's
the current conditions where's the wind
all that cool stuff what's the forecast
UV index this is probably the most
complete weather app that I've ever seen
and it's all part of the the widget you
can swipe over to the side and you can
refresh your weather get all kinds of
stuff in here if you want to change your
location if you want to get your moon
phases moon phases come on guys that
that's just so cool but here's a brand
new thing that they've added in it's
called lifestyle what can you do today
based on what the weather is going to be
like well tap that and it tells you
using these nice little indicators what
you can do so over here I can ski it's
fair for jogging flu is well yeah that's
why I have my voice like this golfing
probably not so much hiking is pretty ok
fishing especially ice fishing good
probably don't want to go to the beach
so you can just tell at a glance what
you want to do it even tells you what
the frizz level of your hair is going to
be beautiful widgets 5 I love it I think
you will too if you don't already have
it go out and get it from the Play Store

give it a big thumbs up and if you liked
it a lot why not share it with your
friends on Facebook Twitter or even
Google+ or in all three places and we'll
have links for you down in the
description where you can get to our
pages quickly per pocket now check out
