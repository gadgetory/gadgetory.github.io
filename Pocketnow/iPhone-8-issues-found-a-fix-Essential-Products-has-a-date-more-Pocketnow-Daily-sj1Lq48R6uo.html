begun to already solve certain issues
new benchmarks have the future milk if
black ship bringing some innovation and
get ready for Andy Reubens essential
products very soon I'm Jaime Rivera and
I know I'm a day late traveling has been
insane but let's go through the news
this is talking out daily let's begin
today with deals and this is one that I
will not forgive you if you pass out LGG
$688 on best 5 you dilute that in 24
months it kind of say stupid amount of
money that you're going to be paying for
one of my favorite bones of 2017 learn
more in the description another official
news the Huawei watch 2 has just been
officially unveiled in the United States
$370 I've actually been using it for a
couple of days I don't know if you've
noticed on video got this really cool
band for it as well but you can't find
it in leather right now for 370 bucks
it's kind of steep but the watch is it's
a very beautiful watch remember
essential products that whole company or
whatever spin-off that Andy Rubin is
doing well set your calendars for May
30th I mean they've already created a
Twitter handle and within their Twitter
account they have just teased that
there's something really big coming for
that day so I can't wait to see exactly
what Andy Rubin is going to do for those
of you that don't know who he is he is
pretty much the creator of Android so
we'll see some very interesting rumors
have to do with the Nokia 9 mainly
because we had not heard of this unknown
heart device that just showed up on
benchmarks the other one is just the
heart and what makes this so special is
really the fact that apparently it will
bring 8 gigabytes of RAM that is crazy
so far we've known that 60 good bytes is
pretty much enough mainly with what
we've seen with the 1 plus 3 T but hey
we can't wait to be impressed and
finally is very interesting rumors they
have to do with the iPhone 8 apparently
Apple has just figured out a ton of
things according to some very trusted
sources so yes we are getting that
fingerprint scanner on the display as a
collaboration with synaptics and
apparently that is going to be an
optical sensor not capacitive don't
really know the difference we'll see
what that is but in other terms it seems
that this will be an AMOLED display 3d
touch will be included and that it will
be an 18 point
I find 9 aspect ratio pretty much taking
up most of the display just like we see
on the galaxy s 8 and the LG G 6 all
this is really great but it leads me to
the question of the day and I've been
using the HTC u 11 for the last couple
of days I really don't miss the lack of
eighteen point five by nine but let us
know in the comments is it essential to
