listeners of the pocket net weekly
podcast we asked you to vote for our
nomination to the 2013 stitcher awards
and like the loyal and dedicated fan
base we knew you to be you brought us
there so on behalf of all of those
who've worked on the show over the year
plus we've been on the air from the
traditional pocketnow crew to the
special guests I thank you very much for
your votes as a result of your tireless
campaigning and clicking the weekly now
stands alongside some of the truly great
names in mobile technology fellow
contenders for best tech podcast of 2013
and it's an honor to be counted among
them but there is work yet to be done as
much of those many of those shows have a
much longer history and a much larger
audience than our humble mobile only
podcast pocketnow needs your help once
again if we're to win best tech podcast
of 2013 we need more of your votes and
we need them every day until voting
closes on January thirteenth
unfortunately voting is easy it's
literally two clicks away all you need
to do is visit stitchers awards website
at the link down in the description and
after you hit the little facebook like
button we know it's annoying there's
nothing we can do about it just scroll
on down to the technology section and
click on the logo for the pocket now
weekly and that's it that's all there is
to it except we need you to do it every
day until January thirteenth because
this is one of those contests that
allows you to vote once per 24 hour
period and since once again we are a
much smaller show than our competition
we really need you to turn out as often
as possible for this one if you can
spare the time and we know that's a lot
of trouble to go through even for a show
you enjoy so it's fair to tell you why
we're so invested in winning this
competition why we're pursuing your
votes so aggressively it's not just for
an ego boost or bragging rights although
those would be nice principally it's to
make the weekly more visible we've been
very very proud of the growth of our
audience over the past 76
sodes but it takes a lot of time and
effort to put the show together every
week and frankly we just need a bigger
audience to continue to make it worth
our while also on a personal note
stitcher is the first podcasting app I
ever downloaded I used it for years ago
before I even got into this business and
I used it to stream some of the very
shows that we're now nominated alongside
which that in and of itself kind of
blows my mind but winning would be an
honor beyond compare so please lend us
your votes once a day for the next 11
days please forgive the endless barrage
of tweets and Facebook posts you'll see
for the same period and again thank you
for getting us this far we wouldn't have
a podcast if we didn't have an audience
and you folks are the best audience
anyone could ask for this has been
Michael Fisher with pocket now we'll see
you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
