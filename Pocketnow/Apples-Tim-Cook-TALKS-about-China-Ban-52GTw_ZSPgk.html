seems that he's very confident about the
whole possible China ban
Apple sign-in feature is good for us but
apparently putting developers on the
spot with certain regulations and while
we refuse claims that their production
lines are closing and claims that they
have been changed production at all I'm
high metal iveta and pre recording is
what you do when you have to travel
again I apologize for the face this
parking out daily brought to you by the
oneplus seventh pro the official news
today begin with deals the new iPad Mini
5 is exactly what it is it's new you're
not supposed to expect any deals right
now the current price is 399 and most
retailers but Rakatan currently has it
for $70 off which would pretty much have
it and the be like 330 bucks already
shipped and everything obviously there
are the hurdles of you in the United
States and everything you can learn more
about it in the description as you need
to follow a specific code to get the
discount now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 and cardinal red I
personally want this phone but it's not
going to launch of the United States
just yet it's now official for Western
Europe and Switzerland and Russia yeah
and well it's exclusive there for now
apparently you're gonna be able to buy
both the S 10 + S 10 and it seems that
the S 10 a is also going to be part of
the packet eventually we don't know
exactly when it's planning to launch
outside of Europe but we'll keep you
posted as I definitely want one and
since we're talking about Samsung let's
now focus on everything that's happening
in China particularly because it doesn't
necessarily just affect US companies
there are also Korean companies
manufacturing in China
Samsung being one of them 13% of their
production was happening in that country
now apparently the company is scaling
back to just 1% obviously this includes
layoffs
it seems that Samsung is being clear
that they're providing compensation and
everything but yes this is official
Samsung is moving away their production
as much as possible obviously they want
to make their whole situation less
complicated but everything that's
happening in the United States and
yesterday we discussed how even the
United States is pressuring other
countries in Europe to follow on the
band
and since we're talking China let's talk
about Huawei now as a well we know that
Foxconn is famous for all of their
production within China we have to
remember Foxconn is a Taiwanese company
it's not mainland China so uh obviously
Foxconn is looking for ways to comply
with the United States not exactly sure
how they're handling China but there
were rumors that there was going to be a
drop in production from Foxconn for
Huawei not necessarily for the whole
China ban but mainly because of all the
sales that Huawei is not being able to
capture as it turns out Huawei has just
confirmed that know that they're not
scaling back production that their
orders are still exactly the same and
yeah it seems that according to away
everything is still normal for them so
let's just hope that that obviously
doesn't permeate the future of launches
or we don't know exactly what to expect
here and let's talk about Apple now
obviously we covered a lot about
everything that was announced at WWDC
but we know that there are things that
fall through the cracks
not everything is covered in so one
interesting one is this whole signing
with Apple feature obviously Apple is
making this look like if they're secure
in other companies or not and this is
the reason why they're offering it
that's fine the problem is when we see
the policies that Apple is forcing
developers to follow the first one being
that developers are forced if they have
a sign-in with Google or Facebook in
their app they're forced to add sign
with Apple on their app as well if they
want their app to be certified that's
the first one
the second one is the whole topic of
well that they're forced to have the
sign-in with Apple on top of the other
services
they shown in a much more predominant
way which yeah that's come on Apple I
mean right now Apple is going through a
little scrutiny over the whole topic of
Spotify and the fact that they hold a
monopoly particularly in the music
industry and how they they don't force
users but they suggest Apple music more
than I suggest Spotify on their store
that's all clear but yeah I mean this is
getting rather weird I wonder how the
developers are gonna react because
whether they like it or not this the way
they have to get their apps signed
period and finally the hottest news
today have to do
with apple stem cook in a recent
interview he was in where he mentioned
two very important things the first one
being the scrutiny that Apple is going
through over having certain senators and
presidential candidates considering
Apple to be a monopoly the fact that
well the App Store is a monopoly there
are no other options to be able to
install applications on your iPhone and
we've got senators even asking that
Apple should split the App Store I don't
exactly think that they understand
exactly what they're asking for but
point being is that this would Apple is
going through and when interviewed Tim
was like you know what Apple can go
through scrutiny this happens but this
is definitely not something that's
constraining Apple so obviously they're
open to going through the process of
scrutiny but they don't think that it's
going to lead to anywhere and then the
second thing is obviously the China
banned the possibility of this what this
Tim Cook thing about the you know
everything that's happening and how this
can affect Apple according to cook this
is not going to affect Apple up to the
point where the company has not been
summoned by the government of China they
haven't been summoned by the United
States he totally acted like if Apple
was unscathed completely and that he's
not expecting for anything to come out
of all this it makes all the sense in
the world if you think about how much
Apple produces in China obviously I
don't think that China is gonna want to
lose that business and I wonder exactly
how they're handling that part with the
United States mainly because I know that
US products can't be manufactured to a
certain extent outside in other
countries but not fully at least when it
comes to cars but I don't know exactly
how that happens with tech if you know
about this let us know in the comments
down below but also in today's question
what do you think number one do you
think that Apple has a monopoly in their
app store and number two what do you
think about Apple not being affected by
everything that's happening to other
companies like Huawei in my case you
know I feel that whatever is not
affecting other companies is great I
feel that it should be a general thing
commerce should be open one and then
second one comes to the monopoly I don't
know I mean it's not like if consumers
can't just go out and buy an Android
phone so I don't think that Apple has a
monopoly I just it this is just the way
it is but leave us
and down below we'd love to know what
you think and friends this episode of
the parkin out daily is brought to you
