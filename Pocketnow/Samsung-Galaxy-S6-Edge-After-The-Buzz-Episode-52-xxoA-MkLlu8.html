over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it let's revisit one of the best-looking
tablets in the market and see if he
should still pay one of the most
expensive price tags for it I'm hi I'm
Eddie Vetter with Pocket now this is the
galaxy s6 edge+
and this is episode 52 of after the buzz
you can blame Samson all you want for
launching pretty much every product
that's R&amp;amp;D department can come up with
but can you imagine a world without the
phablets they invented people have
already forgotten how much we ridiculed
the first generation Galaxy Note but
five generations later Bab let's have
become essential that same story repeats
itself with curved displays I briefly
used the Galaxy Note edge and
immediately wrote off its newer Galaxy
s6 edge because I thought it would be
just as much of a gimmick but that was
really until I use the larger plus
variant see instead of following the
Note edge mentality of giving you a
secondary display Samson matured the
idea dramatically this year and this is
something you really won't understand
until you hold the larger s6 edge+
variant in your hand the edge display
contributes and to essential features
that you won't really feel on most other
phablets for starters it doesn't really
feel like a big phone in your hand yes
you can totally tell the 5.7 inch
display is huge but that's where the
edge adds value as it creates an optical
illusion of a display without bezels in
a word holding this phone is just
surreal and watching a video on this
gorgeous quad HD display is just
fantastic and then you have to add the
quality of these materials which only
contribute and giving this futuristic
feel proper aging yes you are definitely
buying one of the world's best
fingerprint magnets but that's the
reason why I chose the gold variant and
I don't regret it one minute I'm
actually the third editor that uses this
ATT review unit and you really have to
scout for scratches on the glass on
either the front or the back the 7000
series aluminum also looks brand new
even after extensive use and even though
a friend of mine recently dropped his
blue variant to a tile floor you'll
notice that the dent is barely
noticeable
Samsung has clearly outdone itself with
the quality of this design and I highly
suggest you hold one as there is only so
much I can tell you on a video
the company has also done a great job
with the software this looks like
TouchWiz when you unbox it but it
doesn't really have to if you prefer the
look of stock Android there's a
marshmallow skin for you to pick or if
you'd rather get cartoony about it then
there's another and then another as the
theme store is packed with three options
for you to swap the xno 64-bit processor
matched with the four gigs of ram that
are included on this phone both do an
amazing job at providing you with a very
fluid experience all around and if you
were bored of all the old Samsung
gimmicks that were included in the past
then that only parked down the
experience you're actually going to like
the ones that are included on this phone
for example if you find a display too
large just triple click the home button
you'll notice that it'll give you a
feature that's similar to Apple's reach
ability on the iPhone but with the added
benefit that here it won't expand until
you tell it to which is a definite plus
instead of having that annoying tab for
dual window it's a simple step from the
multitasking tray as well and just like
this everything else just feels more
refined the funny part is that about the
only thing you really won't use from
this phone is the edge features simply
put the last thing that anybody would do
with the phone this expensive is set it
flat on its face on a table just to see
the color hue of somebody calling them
on the phone and calling people or
applications from the edge is also
rather slow and clunky again you'll
enjoy the edge for how it feels not
really for what you can do with it
I've been alternating between the galaxy
s6 edge+ in the galaxy note 5 for the
past few weeks and I continue to feel
the edge plus as more delightful using
this phone to watch a video is just
plain gorgeous and given the click enos
of the side buttons you can set it on
the table and not worry about getting
these buttons activated the same can be
said about using the large display to
read a book or playing graphics
intensive games as you really never feel
the device heat even after holding it
for a while about my only complaint with
the edge screen on day-to-day use is
that holding the phone can sometimes
trigger controls
on the display accidentially but hey if
you're used to Samsung's annoying
capacitive buttons you'll feel right at
home here like with most acquired tastes
you'll probably fumble with it for the
first few days and then you'll learn how
to hold the phone differently after that
then when we move over to phone calls
these are just okay according to the
people I call I don't really consider
the earpiece to be the loudest that I've
used compared to other phones that I've
been testing lately but it's again just
okay the only problem is the placement
of the speaker that can easily be
covered by your finger and that doesn't
really do the loudest job possible
either in the case of data speeds these
are just as fastest you'll notice with
your average LT black ship but one of
the cool things I like about this phone
is just how well it clings on to Wi-Fi
even on the toughest areas and the same
can be said about the way it points the
LTE and then if you thought that you'd
be buying a phablet for its battery life
sadly in this phone it's rather mixed
I've always managed to get through the
day just fine but you'll end some days
better than others you do have the
advantage of fast charging and this
phone is rather quick at it and if you
are into the wireless charging thing
that's also an option if you want that
as well now when it comes to the camera
photos will do a better job at
describing the experience than I will if
you follow me on Instagram and know how
much I love photography this phone just
takes the cake
they photos are obviously excellent but
my most interesting experience was with
night shots because in this case in
particular what you see is not really
what you get the 16 megapixel sensor
match with F 1.9 aperture optical image
stabilisation and Samsung's
post-processing I'll contribute to a lot
of heavy lifting and very dark scenarios
all this to say if there's something you
like trust me just take the shot even if
it doesn't look as well on the
viewfinder more often than not you'll
notice that the resulting photos look
gorgeous afterwards which just tells you
how good Samsung's post-processing is
and the same can be said about resulting
video samsung stabilization is clearly
top-notch when filming and you simply
have to love the smooth action of the
device focusing in and out of subjects
probably the only experience I didn't
like was with the selfie camera because
true it's good but it doesn't really
perform that well in night shots overall
you will get some decent selfies but
again the primary camera is just the
best camera I've used lately and bottom
line that sums up most of my experience
with the galaxy s6 edge+ I can't
remember the last time that I truly
liked using a phone this much this is
one of the most refined experiences I've
had in years and even after testing a
few phones lately I always enjoy coming
back to this device every so often as
with every product not everything is
perfect and if anything I'd say that the
biggest flaw this phone has is its price
tag still if you want the latest and
greatest out there and you love flashing
your phone to show off I can think of no
better phone to recommend than the
galaxy s6 edge+
folks just like with this device off
