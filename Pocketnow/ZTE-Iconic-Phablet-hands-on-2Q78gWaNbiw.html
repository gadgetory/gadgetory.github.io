we've seen a lot of manufacturers make a
large screen devices that in some cases
are in some cases aren't extremely high
end on the internals Michael Fisher with
pocket now in at CES 2014 we're taking a
look at another of those devices from
ZTE the iconic phablet so ready to start
your folks we should tell you that the
iconic phablet branding is not
necessarily final this may come to
market with a different brand name will
hop around to the back this is a lumen
omit doesn't feel as cool to the touch
as metal usually does but ZTE assures us
it is real metal this is an 8 megapixel
camera with a mini USB port not a
hardware camera key as I was about to
say harbor camera key is around this
side private back around to the front we
can see this 5.5 inch panel this is a
5.7 I believe this is 720p and it is the
device is powered by a Snapdragon 400
dual core edition and with two gigs of
ram as you can see it is not the highest
end device this is an almost stock bill
that's not quite stock though because we
can hop in press the back button and you
can get a multitasking screen up here so
you can use that big display in any way
you would like especially if you want to
use two apps at once I wish we'd agreed
to the Google Terms and Conditions so
this look better but you get the idea of
folks you've seen it before otherwise
it's a very close to stock build of
android not at all like the Nubia skins
we were seeing before interesting to see
something different at mcd but not a
high-end device more of a mid-range
device for people looking for a large
screen experience and importantly this
is going to come to at least one prepaid
carrier and probably a great deal more
than that so a good option possibly we
until review it fully but possibly a
good option for prepaid fans looking for
a large screen device without the
massive with guts of other families
Joanie's behind the camera I'm Michael
Fisher with pocket now this is CES 2014
and stay tuned for a lot more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
