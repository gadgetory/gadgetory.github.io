Paco not calm and today i will show you
a neat little application called gps
spot and if you've ever lost your car at
a large parking lot let's say disneyland
or you've wanted to go hiking and you
found this one great spot but you lost
it afterwards and you couldn't get back
there again well this program will
actually solve those lows for you and
what it allows you to do is take a
picture of any gps location on Earth and
if you need to get back to that location
it will show you an arrow and give you a
little graphic in the center of the
picture that you took so a little bit of
information right here it shows us our
altitude right now we're at 510 feet
we're traveling 0 miles per hour and you
can also change that into kilometres and
I'll show you that in just a second it
also tells us how far we are from our
certain destination this one is ayers
rock and this is in australia and it's
8240 9 45 miles away ok so if I want to
take a picture something all i have to
do is go into edit and go into my camera
so my camera's loaded all i have to do
is take a picture of something so let's
say I wanted to take a picture of this
disk and take a picture and now I have
to just go back and it will load it into
the program right here and now I can
enter my let's say my location data
we'll just say a DVD or something like
that and use current location and add
and now we know that we r 0 feet away
from our DVD right here because it says
zero feet so if i go up here i had some
others that i took earlier today let's
see i took a picture of ps3 controller
says that were 29 feet we away from the
ps3 controller let's see else of living
room says we're also 29 feet away from
the living room and there's a few other
predetermined locations in here if you
ever want to travel but if we wanted to
go to the North Pole let's see it's 2953
miles away so if I click on the center
arrow here and I can change it from
either metric or
our American I have a couple of their
options I can either prevent suspend of
device and use high contrast arrow so if
I click on this and click OK it will
just show a gray arrow so this is
another marketplace pick and this
program is called GPS spot and it costs
three dollars and ninety-nine cents on
windows mobile marketplace but if you've
ever lost your car or have wanted to
save a location on a various track then
this program it will be invaluable to
you thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
