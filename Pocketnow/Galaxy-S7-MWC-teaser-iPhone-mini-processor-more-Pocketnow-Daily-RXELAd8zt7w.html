some mwc spotlight on apple iphone 5s
ian ipad air three rumors now talk about
specifications you can now get a google
chromecast for free if you're into
spotify I'm hi meri behna and I'm Han
doin who recorded this video in New York
City and then edited over the Atlantic
for it to be published in Barcelona talk
about globalization this is pocket out
daily if you're like me and you're a
customer of spotify premium that this
deal will probably make a lot of sense
to you as if you sign up for 90 days of
premium you will be getting a free
chromecast and well there are some
limitations this only works in the
united states and in the UK obviously
you have to pay upfront and there are
other details you should read about in
the links of the description as well and
recently some users were surprised with
a windows 10 mobile update on their
Lumia 535 for those of you that received
that I know you're probably upset right
now because I can imagine how bad that
can be but apparently that is because
these are beta tests these are not
official updates and we're not exactly
sure if these are accidents or what
exactly the case may be but yeah it
seems that we're getting closer to that
februari 29 launch for windows 10 mobile
on legacy devices and speaking of
surprises if you wanted to see that as
Susan phone 3 at CES well apparently it
won't happen until copy text which
happens on May 31st and up to june third
which is okay but even more interesting
is that apparently the reasons for this
delay is that this is n phone 3 will
apparently have something to do with 2v
our projects that a sous wants to
publish and that we've heard about
mainly because these are extremely
affordable according to rumors we will
see what we get very soon and speaking
of interesting rumors it seems that
Apple will do something particular with
this iphone 5s II we hear that for the
first time ever the company is going to
bring it's a 9 chip into you know
lessord hardware we should say which
does lead us to believe that this phone
will just be smaller but not necessarily
more affordable we also hear that the
a9x chip will make it to the ipad air
three that was something expected and
again we should learn more and March
when the event happens
and finally the very hot news do they
have to do with Samsung as the company
continues to tease its Galaxy s7 right
and Barcelona now the company has just
launched this new monument right beside
the apple store in beside the grass
again just revealing a statement that
this will be a major announcement to
expect and it does lead me to the
question of the day we're pretty much
just a few days away from mwc which the
vice do you think will be the hottest
for this event in my case that is a very
interesting debate but for me it's going
to be between the g5 and s7 leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion and friends you know how it
goes if we want to get these news
