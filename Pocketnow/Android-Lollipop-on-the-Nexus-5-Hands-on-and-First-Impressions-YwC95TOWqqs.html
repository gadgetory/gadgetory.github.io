well sort of I'm Joe Levi with pocket
now let's go hands-on with the latest
preview release of Android lollipop so
as we can see here this is Android
version 5.0 lollipop running on my Nexus
5 it's build number at LP x 13 d as in
delta so what's new obviously we've got
all the really cool animations and
whatnot that we had in the past but
let's look at some other things so we've
got the revisited look at some of the
icons the iconography and whatnot really
neat scrolls very fluid battery life on
this has been pretty good you'll notice
I've got this interesting little star
icon up here in my notification bar what
that is I had some people trying to
contact me and I decided you know what I
want to just silence some of those
things while I do this video you know so
I'm not interrupted in the middle of
shooting well what I did was came in
here and adjusted my volume down until i
get to vibrate and you can see here i
can now turn all of my notifications
down or none for 54 minutes i've already
set this a little bit or just get
priority alerts so no alerts priority
alerts or all alerts coming through and
then i could set that indefinitely or
for some amount of time i could set this
overnight if I wanted to so hey go to
bed for eight hours there you go that
should probably be a little bit more
than that like 10 or 12 but we might be
able to see some of that in the future
there are some of these where you can
set the interruptions for messages calls
not calls you know whatever you want in
here the downtime for priority
interruptions can set those so this is
kind of like quiet hours very nice I
like it a lot and it it's going to take
a little bit of getting used to you can
see I haven't configured anything in
here but I definitely will going forward
let's go back home you'll notice that
Google now has some interesting
headlines up here kind of dividing up
your news in two different blocks so a
nice way
it's done that a lot of other things
have stayed the same but one thing that
I really like I can't show you right
here I'm going to have to throw some
screenshots up here I haven't gone in
and configured anything okay what I did
when I went through and set this up it
went and grabbed all of my layouts all
of my icons all of everything down here
in the folders it did that for me but it
had little grayed out areas where you
know the apps weren't installed yet
ultimately once they did get installed
then they came up and had some little
configurations that I had to go through
to adjust the settings of the various
widgets and whatnot but I mean look at
that it's it's just amazing it carried
over all of my settings one thing I
didn't do that i wish i could have when
i set this up it was i had to wipe it
was a fresh install but it asked me
during setup hey if you're coming from a
new phone hold it your old phone up to
the back and through NFC it could
automate that setup process so making it
very very easy let's take a quick jump
into some of our settings a one finger
pull down shows you notifications that
you can swipe away and then persistent
notifications that you can't if you want
to get more information you can pull
down again or if you want to you can
pull with two fingers to get right into
that to go into your quick toggles
you're just right there we can turn our
flashlight on and off we can go into the
deeper settings that will bring this up
where you can come in here and modify
Wi-Fi modify Bluetooth data usage and
more what I really want to show you
though is right down here inside
security now I've got a pin lock set up
right now it's set to automatically lock
in my device after 30 seconds after it's
gone to sleep except when it's unlocked
by smart lock so smart lock over here
there are some things that you can do
I'm going to put my pin in off camera
if I can get it right now you'll notice
I've got some devices in here trusted
devices and then a trusted face this is
your biometrics so all of you Apple fans
out there that have the touch to unlock
with the touch ID Android can do the
same thing but it uses your face you
used to be called face unlock but right
now it's called a trusted face and I do
have that enabled trusted devices now
are any bluetooth or NFC devices that
you want to add in here so I've got my
moto 360 that I'm wearing on my wrist
right now and because that is there and
connected my device is never going to
lock now if my device walks away and the
two devices are no longer connected to
one another at that point then that
trusted device connection isn't there
and to be able to access my phone you're
going to have to put in the pin to get
into it you notice I've got other things
down here I've got my LG headset as well
which I have turned off I wearing that
around my neck but I wanted to show you
what it looks like so if I've got my
bluetooth headset on right there I can
automatically unlock and bypass that
that lock screen I still have to swipe
to unlock but I don't have to put in the
pin or password if I wanted to do that
we can add any trusted device that's
Bluetooth or NFC I haven't played with
NFC yet so make sure you stay tuned
we'll get some of that out I've probably
in an upcoming article but all you would
do is enable NFC and then set up your
NFC devices really kind of cool what
else do you want to see it's pretty much
what we've been through before just with
smoother animations and some more
interesting features and functionality
that we're going to dig into as the days
go by there's something else that you
think is new in Android lollipop that
wasn't in a previous version of Android
L one of the preview editions make sure
you let us know that down in the
comments along with what your favorite
new feature is so that's a quick look at
the latest preview release of Android
lollipop version 5.0 running on the
Nexus 5 if you liked what you saw here
make sure you give the video a thumbs up

version looks like along with other
