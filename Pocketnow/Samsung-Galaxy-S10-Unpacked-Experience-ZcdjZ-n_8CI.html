brand shows gonna start in 15 minutes
and we've got people with an anxiety
here already
it is Wednesday February 20th 2019 it is
about that time for another Samsung
Galaxy unpacked its Galaxy S 10 and what
are the main reasons why we flew all the
way over here is because we know Samsung
we know there is more inside so stay
tuned
but the galaxy cold you get a powerful
smartphone in the revolutionary tablet
all at a single premium package this
Fulton has a 4.6 inch display it's
compact and perfectly portable
put the s10 family for now as you take a
look at them and ask the question who
could they be for look at this guy
boolean character alright so the event
is over the experience center is open
our Galaxy S 10 is hands-on is live but
the problem is we don't have the galaxy
fold we don't have to we roll let's see
what we can get from that
alright this product experience area is
crazy there's a lot of people here
there's actually a line to get in good
thing our hands-on videos already live I
already heard the Galaxy fold is not
here we were able to spend some time
with the Galaxy watch act that looks
really nice I find that interesting that
they got rid of the rotating bezel but
then it looks so slim and so light it
looks really really nice hopefully I'll
get a review unit of that soon let's go
get advice and I'm hey is now recording
me recording this unboxing everyone
Samsung Galaxy unpacked is over and we
have a unit let's get to work
unpack 2019 is officially over which
means we get to unpack the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 plus now before we get to
that we just want to give a quick shout
out a quick thank you to mr. and abang
I'd say mr. Bourne at work himself for
letting us use his venue his space
rather in order to do this unboxing and
also a shout out to D brand for
sponsoring this video so what do you
think we got the same color this time
pretty sure we get with you don't get
that pipe oh boy yeah okay quick thing I
loved the purple when I got it now I'm
happy we got it everybody wanted to get
this white model mm-hmm for sure
you need know I'm all ready I'm ready
peeling off that tape all right don't
need any knives apologize and oh oh my
God look at the plastic so the plastic
is like that the one that we saw for at
in Hawaii
you remember that galaxy oh yeah galaxy
phone exactly it's like that cutout at
the top everyone was trying to get that
picture yes there you go and then the
reveal okay yeah perfectly if I'm I mean
this is a good looking colors a bit of a
oh my god am I the only one that
disappointed that the accessories are
white again no no really I like the way
I like the black accessories but fair
but they wouldn't they would clash with
this high contrast all right
also if you look at this sort of in the
light there's a blue I love this I love
this copy like that I really wanted this
color it's gonna be a nightmare to film
by the way just the contrast of the
white is a nightmare to get on camera
but all right do the honors
now let's do it
oh wow okay just gonna go and put that
on
don't worry I'll pick it up later so the
other side I can find the portion no
you're ahead of me sorry I am faster and
there it is
I I'm already pretty pretty happy with
what I'm like checking out here like I'm
already as a creative I'm super excited
to use this as a vlogging device granted
Adobe Premiere rush CC is not in the
Play Store here so I was gonna take a
bit okay but just using the wide angle
as the well you have the main shooter
which is great but the wide angles such
and then they're doing the whole action
campaign I really want to try using this
without a gimbal see how it is I wish
that it was on the front there's still
video stabilization but I don't think
it's that super study there's only one
way to find out let's see what what else
is inside we've got a wall adapter they
say this is a faster charging oh it look
does it say mmm it just says adapt the
fast charging okay that's 2.0 but - well
but it's Samsung's version of 2.0 and
that's a USB a port it's a USB a 40 yeah
but it's matte look at that it's not
shiny anymore I'm finally gonna alright
so we've got you know must be - OTG oh
and it's also mad like okay fine so
accessories being that is not bad cable
I'm looking at these headphones man go
for it go for it I'm looking at the USB
see the USB ace sadly oh alright these
are nice yeah they're textured oh the
the cables braided and the earphones are
texture they got that they got that
matted feel that's gonna get so dirty
oh yeah but that's fine by me I don't
mind oh this inner ear buds these are
great yeah these are nice stuff these
are gonna be high-quality these are
definitely the ones that I'll use only
one way to find out why don't we have a
look at the Galaxy buds yes
Oh stay off speaking of that's a great
little segue there good
right here we go oh this one I need yeah
Oh hold on where are my keys but I hear
I refuse to oh sorry
haha I know this is sparta mr.
fingernail over here yes I don't I love
my truly wireless earbuds I actually
recently bought another pair and then
this happened today so I was complaining
that we got the white ones but now that
we got a white phone and that it
wirelessly charges actually doesn't look
so bad we need some symmetry there all
right this is a small case it is a small
case sound by a qiji AKG oh there inside
I thought they were hearing there so I
was looking at David Amell by the way
watch Android authorities unboxing on
Instagram I actually assisted in the
unboxing dude the pairing process is
immediate these do look good they look a
lot like the icon X's which thank God
the branding is different now it's got
yes and it's a really small case I'm
really impressed with this look at the
wings are smaller one of the things that
I didn't like about those iconic 2018
was they were they were tight in the
feel hold on these wings come off don't
they they should there are extra well
yeah they do they do come off that's
nice there are extra Wings in the Box
extra buds and you get another USBC
cable in the box as well so what do you
think first impressions unpacked
everything one fact was nice I thought
the presentation was great I mean
they've really hit a stride with their
presentations I will actually say that
the experience on was awesome they had
so many devices in there so no one had
to so that's and that's the thing like
galaxy F mm-hmm I was like okay before
the announcement I could not care less
about it now I really want one because
of the thought they put into it yeah the
design actually looks really cool anyway
back to the s10 why don't we power up
together let's do that in sync we are
indeed but anyway so far the experience
has been fantastic before we end this
