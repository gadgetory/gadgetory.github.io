Juan Carlos bag now here for pocket now
and it's time to play here's our note 8
vs 1 +5 comparison brought to you by D
brand there's very little overlap a
consumer seriously shopping one of these
phones is unlikely to be seriously
considering the other this is most
apparent when considering design Samsung
pushing one of the most progressive
aesthetics of the year against the
oneplus which feels like a derivative
play against Apple's last
iPhone the one plus 5 is practical
functional easy to hold but it lacks a
certain charm Samsung wins this round
but it's not a clear-cut victory for the
notes focus on productivity slippery
glass isn't necessarily the best
material to flaunt and we miss the days
of companies experimenting with other
materials to denote quality the race
gets a lot hotter looking under the hood
where these two share quite a few tech
beds we've come to expect the top
Snapdragon chipset and oneplus was
aggressive in pushing phones with more
RAM though the note simply has more of
everything big storage
well how about big storage plus the
ability to add more scanner fingerprint
or scan a fingerprint and add the
ability to scan your iris and of course
we have the S Pen a wholly unique method
of operating a mobile device
it's a juggernaut of features how many
of those features you might use is part
of the game there's always one thing on
a samsung phone that a user will
eventually rely on and miss if they
leave for another manufacturer but that
often leaves a number of other features
out in the cold the oneplus mission is
to run lean and mean like comparing
displays the oneplus 5 ships with a
1080p OLED but that shouldn't really be
a deal-breaker it covers your main use
just fine and even Samsung now ships
phones running their displays under max
resolution just the basics but the best
pieces they can acquire to cover those
basics and that's easy to see you when
looking at software the note comprises
three different usage modes Android like
normal navigation Samsung's take on one
thumb shortcuts and a whole separate
interface for the stylus
there are numerous services running at
any given time and this is a fair bit
removed from what Android really is the
oneplus 5 isn't as exciting out of the
box it's a cleaner canvas to start with
closer to stock Android and with this
hardware generally feel snappier it's
less weigh down more responsive it's not
to say the oneplus can't score an
outright victory speaker performance is
fairly evenly matched for mono output
the note headphone playback is greatly
improved over last year
but the oneplus 5 still manages a win
for including a more powerful amp camera
tech flips us right back however if
you're going to spend more on a phone
one area consumers will want to see a
tangible improvement is photography
faster focusing better image
stabilization and crowd-pleasing
processing the one plus five is no
slouch but the no 5 represents the best
implementation of a zoom dual sensor
we've yet seen where the oneplus added
software stabilization for video the
notes Hardware stabilization retains
better image quality without cropping
the one plus five is good very good in
most situations it's just facing one of
the best cameras of the year
lastly cool features and screaming
performance won't mean much if your
battery can't hang and it's here where
the oneplus manages another important
victory just edging out the note 8 in
our streaming media test both phones
will handily last you the day but with
the same battery capacity under similar
use the oneplus will give you more room
getting into the evening so let's wrap
this up where's that leave us between
the 1 plus 5 and the Galaxy Note 8 it's
easy to declare the note 8 the better
phone because it is for pretty much
every bullet point we can compare the
note 8 offers a better solution but is
the note really twice as good as the 1
plus 5 because depending on where you
buy the note for the same price you can
just about by 2 1 plus 5s obviously is
mentioned at the top of this video if
you're seriously shopping one of these
phones you're on
likely to be considering the other worth
it Ness is a relative metric a personal
decision made by each consumer
objectively though the upper tier of the
premium market is getting a bit rough
and mid Rangers have never been better
regardless of the price you depend on
your phone to make it through the day
doesn't it deserve some protection
shouldn't it fit your sense of style
debrand has a collection of skins in
different colors and textures to prevent
fingerprint smudges and add a bit of
grip check out D brand comm slash Note 8
