together to get rid of SIM cards
Motorola cherche plans for a special
announcement very soon and 1 plus
promises you won't hate its new invite
system I'm hi Mary vera and trust me I
am not complaining about this week
almost being over this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
Motorola as the company has just shared
press invitations for an event happening
on july twenty eighth just just a few
weeks away and this is very interesting
obviously we are expecting the new Moto
G the new Moto X but instead the company
is linking stuff to a new moto match and
we also see that the company teases that
our relationship status will change
that's good news we'll see what we get
other official news have one plus the
company is already talking about its new
invite system and trying to address the
fact that none of us want it again
according to the company the invite
system will exist for the 1+2 but you
shouldn't worry because apparently the
company has built 30 to 50 times more
inventory than last time it just makes
me want to do numbers and be like wow 30
to 50 times how many phones that they
make the first time well we'll see what
happens by the end of this month other
official news have HCC I'm not even
going to try to bore you because there
are a lot HCC has just announced for
example the one m9 plus reaching Europe
the fact that there are new desire
smartphones and we've got video coverage
of them already in addition to the fact
that the one m8 is getting Android M yes
i said when i mate links in description
for full details on everything that just
got announced for those of you that are
in the market for the sequel of the ipad
air 2 later this year it seems that you
won't be in luck apparently Apple has
focused its guns on the production of
the iPad pro and ipad mini 4 we're just
going to dub it that way that the
company will not be building a refresh
to the ipad air 2 it could be that
they're going to keep the same design
and just boost the internals but it
could also be that it's just going to be
held for another year so that we can see
what these new tablets will be sad news
it could be but then again in declining
tablet market it's probably the smartest
thing to do finally for the very
interesting news of the day it seems
that Apple and Samsung are both working
on killing the sim card or in a way it
seems that what they plan to do is the
same thing that was done with the ipad
air 2 where there was just one sim card
that allowed you to activate whichever
service you want to be at sprint verizon
AT&amp;amp;T to activate the ipad it was a smart
idea but the plan here is to kill the
sim card for it to be a better than the
phone and it seems that carriers are
already signing up it seems that they're
already ten carriers on a list here in
part of the negotiations these are
really interesting ideas but it does
spike some concern particularly if you
travel abroad what happens if you're at
a place where the carrier doesn't
support this protocol and it does lead
me to the question of the day is being
able to swap your sim card important to
you when you buy a smartphone in my case
it's everything but it's particularly
because obviously I live outside of the
United States and I use us phones so for
me it is extremely important to be able
to swap my son but leave us a comment
down below what is your case friends you
know the drill if you want to get it was
