smartphone audio we're circling back to
one of the most popular phones released
this year Samsung impressed us with the
Galaxy s7 s focus on refining this phone
line and replacing features we enjoyed
like water resistance and microSD card
expansion this phone is one of our
favorite options to recommend is a high
quality Android all-rounder but how does
it handle audio like music and movie
playback conducting our benchmarks
plugging the galaxy s7 into our high
quality audio interface recording
speaker playback and listening to a
variety of musical genres on several
different pairs of headphones we've come
to the conclusion that it's not that
great to be sure it's not bad but in
this price bracket audio reproduction on
the Qualcomm powered galaxy s7 ranks
about second to last against all of the
flagship phones we've reviewed this year
yet even ranks below this one starting
with speaker playback it's loud enough
nice for alerts and notifications but
clarity is rather poor it's a somewhat
dull output where instruments get
jumbled up and obviously this tiny
single speaker won't deliver much bass
we just wish we could separate out
individual sounds a little bit better as
we can on a few other single speaker
phones where LG has improved
significantly this year with the V 20
and the oneplus 3 might not be quite as
loud but delivers a more pleasant
overall sound for those interested we
have our speaker test samples linked in
this reviews description if you'd like
to take a listen for yourself now no
one's really expecting a hi-fi speaker
package built into a small phone but we
should expect that an expensive
smartphone should properly Drive nice
headphones right
sadly the galaxy s7 fails to inspire
much joy here either
this phone is capable of playing back
24-bit audio files but the final output
falls fairly far behind competitors and
this amp is one of the weaker ones we've
tested near this price tag if you use
headphones with slightly higher than
consumer grade impedance the s7 will
struggle to properly drive them it's not
really fair putting this up against an
HTC or an LG V it also loses to our fee
okay one USB DAC which we use as a
baseline so to interpret these results
looking at a phone
punches above its price tag the galaxy
loses out in most tests to the one plus
three both phones offer great frequency
response numbers but the one plus four
is a substantially lower noise floor a
wider dynamic range less distortion and
a lot less stereo crosstalk in lay terms
this means the galaxy's headphone jack
produces more noise when nothing is
playing there's a much narrower gap
between the loudest and softest sounds
this Jack can produce and there's more
bleed between the left ear and the right
year definitely a bummer seeing a galaxy
s7 struggle in any way to compete
against a $400 phone literally the only
flagship which the galaxy can beat is
the LG g5 using the built-in headphone
jack which we expect LG used as a cost
savings anticipating people who cared
about audio would go out and buy the
add-on DAC friend now what we wanted to
know was whether this performance from
Samsung was an anomaly as the Galaxy
line performed better in the past is
this an issue reflecting the differences
between Exynos and qualcomm chipsets
looking to last year's Galaxy phones
which even in the United States used
Samsung not Qualcomm processors the S
line of phone seems to have always been
a mid tier performer but the Galaxy s6
is capable of outperforming this year's
as7 looking at the note 5 and galaxy s6
edge+
Samsung phablets could easily hang with
Apple hardware just nipping at the heels
behind HTC just as we surmised with the
iPhone 7 in our first real audio review
this audio performance isn't bad per se
it's completely functional but that's
not particularly exciting or inspiring
on a phone which still commands a
premium price tag again like the iPhone
7 it's also disappointing to see that
this year's flagship is a step down from
last year's when so many other areas of
this phone have been improved the final
word if one of your primary uses for a
phone is listening to music the galaxy
s7 might not be the best fit for you as
