calm we're going to take a look at the
hardware on the new 18 th TC HD 7 s over
here but we're also going to do a little
comparison with the old HD 7 on t-mobile
so let's check them out
so first I forgot the hd7 s this is
pretty much the same as the hd7 it's got
your 1 gigahertz processor 512 megs of
ram 16gb internal storage 4.3 inch wvga
screen this is a super LCD screen though
whereas the tmobile one is it regular
LCD will take a look at that soon and
let's just take a quick look around here
got your passive buttons at your 18 team
logo there's bevel 30 5 millimeter
headset jack Markell USB microphone
camera button volume controls power
button and here's your camera this is a
new camera actually I will do some test
samples with the hd7 so you can see
what's new about that and we have a nice
little gold color there I will just do a
little comparison here to pretty much
the same but actually this button on the
7s clicks a lot better it's a lot easier
to press half price is really obvious
there whereas on the old HD 7 it was
like is that a half press for oppress
you can tell same with the power button
this is a little bit easier to press on
the 7s so that's a good thing because we
didn't like that about the old HD 7 and
on the back you'll notice there's some
differences this one has been through
some tough times and lost the seat but
you can see the color is different on
the backing and obviously under the
kickstand we have silver over here and
gold over there so that's our
differences there now let's try some
benchmarks
use our Windows Phone benchmarking
program and we can just do performance
real quick
when two frames per second so really
close and here's the thing you really
want to see display let's compare these
this is super LCD and this is regular
LCD this one's supposed to be a little
bit better so we're going to look at
color bands all bands should be
distinguishable so that looks pretty
good this looks a little bit more washed
out that we have more saturation in the
color over here so a little bit better
color let's look at the black test now
all squares should be visible let's take
a closer look to see any squares there
pretty hard to see these black squares
on the 7s by over here I can definitely
see those and it starts to disappear
over here but in a more low light
environment these actually appear very
well but not so much on the 7s let's try
the whites this one's a lot clearer you
can definitely see all the squares up to
number one fades a little bit but number
one over here I can still see squares if
we can close up on that so I can still
see squares their number one it's very
faint it can't see two squares at all
there
now this one's kind of important to this
one uh what does it say all gradients
should be smooth let's look at this
close now I'm seeing some banding there
I'm seeing little lines and there's some
weird lines in the purple to know if
that comes through on the camera but I'm
definitely seeing some little lines
they're old hd7 couple little lines but
its overall it's a lot smoother much
smoother color transitions
grading tests these graders should be
smooth but I am seeing some little lines
there see some banding banding there as
well
this one looks a lot smoother and lastly
viewing angle
there's still color difference but let's
see what happens well we got some glare
I like it's a little bit darker as it
turns
I could just be the function but pretty
good viewing angles
not bad there as well
both of these are set to maximum
brightness by the way so that might
affect things or it might not probably
affects these guys but there's your
display differences hopefully you can
see that through the camera and so your
choice which one you think is better but
there's our Hardware tour of the hd7 s
and a good comparison with the old HD 7
hope you enjoyed this video give us a
thumbs up if you did that's it for now
