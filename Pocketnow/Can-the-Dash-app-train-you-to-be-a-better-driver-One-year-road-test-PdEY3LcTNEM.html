Southern California but with all of the
sunlight out it's probably gonna jack up
the exposure on the camera that I'm
using shoot on this but now over a year
ago before I had joined the PocketNow
team I started using the service called
- it's this app that lives on your phone
but communicates with Hardware connected
to your car to try and train you to be a
better driver sort of like a Fitbit for
driving every time you get in your car
it's tracking what's going on with your
car and it's trying to keep track of how
you operate your motor vehicle now when
I started using it it was it was a
really exciting experience because in
all of the apps and phones and services
that I've reviewed over the years it's
exceedingly rare that an app or a
service instantly becomes a part of my
daily routine and so this is one of the
few times that this has ever happened to
me was with this dash app because the
dash app fills some major glaring holes
in mobility products in smart phones in
and in how we use our cars so the dash
app connects to your car how does it
connect to your car well your car has a
computer and there's a little port
underneath the steering wheel you might
have seen you know a mechanic use that
port when they're checking your car's
emission so what you can do is you buy a
broadcasting unit and it plugs into that
little car computer port so the dash app
is free of course the developers would
appreciate it if you would buy the
computer plug-in through them I if you
do it's more of like an Amazon affiliate
kind of relationship but you know these
are the same products you could buy
anywhere else you're just kind of
kicking the - developers a little extra
cash for maintaining a really wonderful
service so this thing plugs in and it
starts broadcasting a signal your phone
connects over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and
you're all set up and running I the one
I got is a super basic generic Bluetooth
receiver class I think around 20 bucks
when I bought it I really thought like
oh well after I use this for a couple
months I'll probably have to get
something better this will probably burn
out well your later this thing's still
going strong so I've been really happy
with that it's not a very complicated
piece of machinery it's really silly I'm
driving a car my car has Bluetooth it's
connected to my phone too
my stereo and the app that my automobile
manufacturer supplies can do funny
things like hook up to my Facebook
account so guess what I absolutely never
need to do when I'm driving a car check
Facebook and as I'm often driving around
for work it would be really nice if I
had a system that could easily log my
mileage for me for example and so - came
about at a perfect time for me to be
experimenting with automobile tech and
it combined all of those things together
in this one really pretty app interface
now the whole conceit of the dash app is
that it's supposed to turn you into a
better driver you know it sends you
these little alerts when you are hitting
the accelerator harder than you probably
need to if you come to a stop more
aggressively than you need to then that
means you were probably driving faster
than you should have been what's funny
is initially those things are very
annoying while I started using dash for
mostly the mileage tracking features
every time you finish a trip it sends
all of the information from that trip
including your phone's GPS info up to a
Google Doc spreadsheet which is super
handy especially at the end of the year
I mean cleaning claiming my mileage at
the end of the year was really easy
because I had it all nicely laid out my
accountant thought it was beautiful
for example all of the driving that I'm
doing today just to shoot this video all
tax deductible but those alerts really
didn't start coming in handy and I
started getting a better feel for my car
I mean it's really funny those initial
scores every trip that you take you get
a score on how well you drove I always
sort of took it for granted that well I
live in Los Angeles so my scores are
never gonna be that high those first
couple weeks I think I was scoring in
the 30s for fuel efficiency and driving
aggressively and taking short trips and
no one walks in Los Angeles so we drive
everywhere it really did force me to
take a step back and look at how I was
driving and then I I would realize you
know like hey if I come off the line
just a little bit slower I can actually
get up to speed faster by getting more
sense in a more input from the
transmission as to how I'm driving this
car
so unfortunately I can't really give you
guys hard numbers on whether or not
Dash's mission of saving money by being
a better driver
accurate honestly I'm proper terrible
about keeping any kind of mileage logs
even trying to go back to what I used to
submit to my accountant before I was
using - I don't have good information on
really how much it costs to operate my
car over those years but my scores in
the batch app have climbed significantly
over the last several months where I
used to be tracking in the mid-30s I'm
now in the low 70 and I'm now kind of
running up into that wall where again I
feel like well I mean I'm in LA that's
about as good as I can do I think I
might be able to get that into the low
80s which is a little bit more patience
and a little bit more practice we've
been talking about some really core
features like mileage tracking and then
also a vehicle tracking but every piece
of information that comes off of your
Kart computer is going to be accessible
now to this - so say your check engine
light turns on a - has the ability to
read that engine diagnostic code and
give you a readout on what's actually
going wrong with your car and all kinds
of other miscellaneous data can be sent
to your phone for you to keep track of
and happily this really wasn't much of a
homework assignment I've been using the
- app as a daily driver service since I
installed on my phone over a year ago so
we should wrap this up getting back to
my initial question can the - app make
you a better driver and I'm inclined to
say yes just like any other fitness app
can make you you know can make you
healthier to help you lose weight same
thing goes here if we can treat this
type of behavior operating a motor
vehicle and turn it into some kind of
game where we get badges and scores and
grades and ranks we can share that
information with other people in our
peer groups it makes it so much easier
to stay honest so we'll leave a link
down below this video where you can get
more information on the - app what the
developers are up to where you can
download this app maybe run it on your
own phone you drive around a lot I would
recommend having some kind of solution
for utilizing automotive information
feedback on your phone this is one of
the ones that I've gravitated towards I
really like the app layout I really like
the design I think it's easy to use and
then it's got really great tie-in
features like being able to dump
information over to Google Docs which
means anywhere I have a data connection
I can get to really granular information
on every single trip I take with my car
as always folks thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this

for a little extra positive
reinforcement for pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos fag now you can chat me up on
Twitter and Instagram as some gadget guy
and I will catch you all on the next
review
