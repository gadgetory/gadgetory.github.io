hub service the galaxy has can even play
back the video that you recorded last
weekend of your son or daughter's soccer
game directly to your TV wirelessly or
you can even use it as your TV's remote
control in order to facilitate all of
this the Galaxy S features the all-share
application this service takes
interoperability to a completely new
level click on the touch screen to share
content between different consumer
electronics devices such as pcs TVs and
digital cameras now let's take a closer
look at the immersive nature of the
galaxy s last year we launched several
devices with the industry's first AMOLED
displays and this year we've again up
the ante we describe the Samsung Galaxy
S as immersive because it plunges you
into the rich world of multimedia
experiences on a stunning 4 inch Super
AMOLED display developed solely by
Samsung it's the largest Super AMOLED
screen available utilizing the
industry's most advanced technology the
number of consumer benefits are truly
endless when compared to our already
impressive AMOLED display is our new
Super AMOLED display is twenty percent
brighter eighty percent less reflective
in direct sunlight and increases battery
life by up to twenty percent Super
AMOLED is the most responsive
touchscreen experience available
something you'll be able to test for
yourselves just in a few minutes now
because Super AMOLED displays are much
much thinner by design it allows us to
deliver
the thinnest full-featured smartphone in
the industry the samsung galaxy s
measures in at a very sleek nine point
nine millimeters now for example as you
sit in the park at lunchtime in the
brightest of the midday Sun you can
enjoy high high resolution full-color a
magazine or newspaper content on the
beautiful display without squinting or
having to cover the display with your
hand to protect it from the Sun at this
time I would like to invite Gil fumes
Berg president of skiff a company that
is changing changing the look of you
reading content to share how Samsung
Galaxy S can provide a new platform for
their services
thank you for that kind introduction
Omar skiffs mission is delivering the
next generation of ereading to consumers
so it's fitting that we're here today
with Samsung showcasing the next wave of
smartphones when this store and service
launched later on this year will offer a
comprehensive selection of content from
leading magazines newspapers books and
blogs as the preferred e-reading service
partner across a range of Samsung
devices will feature newspapers like the
New York Times and Financial Times
magazines such as fours Esquire n for
the one or two of you who might care
about topics like technology and science
popular mechanics as well as SL and
ebooks from publishers including Random
House and Simon &amp;amp; Schuster stiff will
deliver premium content to dedicated
readers as well as tablets netbooks and
PCs but we want to make sure consumers
can read whatever they want whenever
they want and wherever they want so
perhaps most exciting to emphasize today
skift will also optimize e-meeting
content for wireless delivery to
innovative smart phones like the galaxy
s skiff and samsung are working together
to produce a great e-meeting experience
for the galaxy s featuring visually
appealing layouts high resolution
graphics rich typography and dynamic
updates devices that carry this gift
storage service must offer best-in-class
technology speed and performance and I'm
happy to say that the galaxy s
smartphone more than surpasses all of
these vital criteria in particular the
galaxy s is large library display and
elegant
to experience and navigate content will
allow consumers to really dive in and
engage with the newspaper magazine book
and blog content that they care most
about skiff is excited to be working
with Samsung and top publishers to bring
premium ereading content to consumers
and as the old saying goes the best is
yet to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
