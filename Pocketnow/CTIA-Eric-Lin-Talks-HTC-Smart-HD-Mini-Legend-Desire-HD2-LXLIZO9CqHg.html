collection of phones that we've been
releasing since the first of the year in
january we released the smart the smart
is our first brew MP phone that mean
that means it's running on an OS based
on brew but with full HTC Sense user
experience so it's got a lot of the same
features that you're used to on sense
phones like say the hero or the hd2 but
simplified the whole idea is that this
is for people who don't need a
smartphone or aren't used to using
smartphones need to simplify to
experience so we still have a home
screen environment that's customizable
that you can you can go around and we
have a set of applications here
including email of the browser friends
stream there are things that people want
out of a smartphone but we've tried to
simplify the experience in all cases
and this phone will be coming to Europe
and Asia later this year can you install
additional apps no it's not made to
install additional apps aren't occur
there's no outlet there's no marketplace
own
and then at Mobile World Congress we
started off by announcing let's see the
HD Mini which I don't think we like to
think of it as HD 2's little brother so
let's see here software-wise it has all
of the same features as the hd2 but in a
much smaller form factor smaller screen
smaller everything but still you know we
we believe that it performs just as well
and we'll meet a basically satisfy a lot
of those people who don't want to carry
around something is significant as this
there's been a lot of positive response
to the hd2 but there's still some people
who say like I don't know if I can carry
something that big around in my pocket
um so as you can see it's much smaller
the HD mini was one of the first phones
to come out of our new partnership with
18 company who originally designed the
touch diamond they designed this phone
as well they did a couple of things they
wanted to make sure that this foam
basically always felt like a quality
phone to the user right it's one thing
to pick up a phone and say like oh this
feels solid it's another thing to pick
up a phone and think not only does this
feel solid but this has visual signs
that this is a solid film that this is a
quality phone so they went to the
engineers and they said what can we do
can we like actually make the
construction obvious from the outside
you know normally when you look inside a
phone there's tons of tiny little screws
putting it together like what if we took
those screws and we moved them to the
corners and we made them always visible
and the engineers grunted and groaned a
lot and then they came back and did it
so these screws that you see here in the
corners are the screws that are holding
the phone together the other thing they
said was well you know when somebody
takes the cover up the phone to change
the SD card out or put their sim card in
or even replace the battery why should
that be an ugly thing to look at so
they've made the inside of the phone
just as beautiful as the
and we call that hidden power that's
also on your new evo let's correct that
a that is also on the EVO we also
announced the legend the legend is the
successor to the hero you can see it I
harks back to the hero in terms of its
form factor at least to the European
hero maybe not to the sprint 10 and it's
got the chin yes yes but it's an
improvement in every way so we've
upgraded to an AMOLED screen we've
upgraded the processor we've upgraded
the camera and we've also upgraded sense
so this is now android 2.1 with an
upgraded Sense experience as you can see
performs much better we've added a new
way for you to navigate through the home
screen because we realized it took so
long for somebody to flip from one end
to the other we've added leap so now you
can pinch and you just tap on whatever
screen that you want to go to the legend
was also designed by wanting company and
also designed with that idea of how do
we give the people who use it the idea
that they're using a high quality phone
besides it just feeling solid right so
it feels pretty solid tons of great i'm
gonna break it I'm not afraid oh the
legend is made out of a single block of
aluminum that's milled out so I can show
you this is actually what a legend looks
like with no guts inside
it's so unibody construction that keeps
its solid and that keeps it light and it
also keeps it small the legend is
significantly smaller than the hero even
though it has a larger battery and
maintains the same size screen for
people who really want this HTC Sense
experience on Android but when a bigger
screen we also announced the desire the
desire shares the same specs is the next
one which I'm sure your your readers
know well right so 3.7 inch AMOLED
screen with wvga resolution snapdragon
processor 5 megapixel camera with flash
all those things slightly different body
carries the optical trackball over from
the legend so something that we do also
physical buttons not touch buttons and
in addition to having the sense
experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
