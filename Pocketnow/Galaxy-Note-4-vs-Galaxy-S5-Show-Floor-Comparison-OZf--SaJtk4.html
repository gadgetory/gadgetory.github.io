new galaxy note the galaxy note 4 i'm
taylor martin with pocket now and this
is the show floor comparison of the
galaxy note 4 and galaxy s5 check it out
it's easy to jump to conclusions and
assume the only software differences are
limited to the S Pen features that isn't
the case here of course the galaxy note
does come with features not found on the
s5 solely due to the s-pen but it also
comes with a newer version of TouchWiz
with some upgraded UI elements for
instance the task switcher menu on the
note 4 is the new stack card view not
the old vertical card previews found on
the s5 the settings application has been
updated and simplified and multi window
is more advanced with a pop out window
feature for most compatible apps these
and more are all rather slight changes
that really improve the field and UX of
TouchWiz they're all welcome changes but
at the end of the day it's still touch
with and they're really not all that
different the major contrast here is
hardware obviously the galaxy s5 doesn't
have an s-pen because it's a galaxy s
not a galaxy note but more importantly
it's the metal trim that stretches the
perimeter of the note 4 and it's more
premium filling leather like backside
the galaxy s5 has a shiny plastic film
that does a poor job of imitating a
lightweight metal and the backside is a
dimpled plastic that many aren't very
fond of of course most Dalton design and
materials we be based on personal
preferences but the in henfield is a
notable difference few will argue with
the galaxy note 4 looks and feels more
premium than the s5 they have many of
the same connectivity options and
sensors fingerprint scanner heart rate
monitor NFC infrared and so on but the
rest of the internals are a bit
different the note 4 is definitely the
higher end of the two it has an
additional gigabyte of RAM double the
storage and an additional 420 milliamp
hours to keep the show running the s5
has the Snapdragon 801 chip while the
note 4 has the newer faster 805 and the
note 16 megapixel camera has 0 is the
s5s does not the one thing the s5 does
have that the note 4 doesn't is
certification for integrates protection
ip67 just close up all the ports in
sylva battery door and you're pretty
resistant to most elements size is also
a pretty big difference the note 4 is
over 11 millimeters taller 6 millimeters
wider and marginally thicker and it
weighs 31 grams more
the s5 is much more manageable with one
hand but I suppose the note 4 is meant
to be a two-handed device anyway in
short if you're after a device made for
power users the note 4 is easily the
better choice but the galaxy s5 is by no
means a bad device it's just for the
more active type
keep it locked on pocket now for more
comparisons straight from the show floor
here at Aoife and stay tuned for full
comparisons and reviews of these devices
in the coming weeks I'm Taylor Martin
casper tag on Twitter and I will see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
