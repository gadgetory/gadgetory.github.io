glass kidding now wait it's spy gate a
video has surfaced on the problem I OS 5
on a white iphone 4 an iOS 4.3 points
who gets an untethered jailbreak all
this and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi I'm everyone and
welcome to the pocket now I review the
show we go through all this week school
and they're not so cool inside the world
of Apple's iOS devices let's start this
week off with a cool now a video has
surfaced on a chinese website of a white
iphone for sporting 64 gigabytes of
storage which is really nice but the
interesting part you're seeing that iOS
is a bit different if you can notice
that the video you'll see that
multitasking is different it's no longer
at the bottom but now it's a sort of an
expose a feature that we find on all
macs and that we could probably expect
that to be probably an early build of
iOS 5 now I'm really sure if that will
be iOS 5 or iOS 4.4 4.5 or probably just
a jailbroken you know prototype out
there somebody that just found it on the
street or on a bar really don't know
what to make of it but hopefully if this
does come to iOS 5 let's hope it's soon
because everything seems to be working
well there are no sort of lag enos or
anything we could probably expect that
not to be a really early build now iOS
4.3 point2 was released a couple of
weeks ago it got a tethered jailbreak
just a couple of hours later and now the
untethered jailbreak has just been
released through redsnow it has the same
exploit that was used for iOS 4.3 point
when it seems that Apple did not patch
that with the release of 4.3 point2 and
well even though it was a little
problematic at the beginning with the
iphone for the fixes out there right now
i get downloaded from the dev team blog
and wealth happy jailbreaking now apples
quarter results were in a whopping 18.6
million iphones were sold in just one
quarter out of those 2.2 million were
sold and verizon not bad 3.6 million
were sold on AT&amp;amp;T and then the rest was
sold outside the united states now
interesting enough for those AT&amp;amp;T
figures is the fact that AT&amp;amp;T only sold
5.5 million smartphones in the period
3.6 million out of that is sixty percent
of the smartphone sales for
only the first quarter were iPhones and
then if you look at Apple's figures
fifty percent almost fifty percent of
apple's revenue came from iPhones now
for those of you that say that the
iphone is dying hmmm I call it a really
good business well if you remember our
last week I review where we talked about
the a5 chip making the next generation
iphone which is probably a given Apple
seems to be cutting a really cool deal
with developers where select developers
are getting in early on iphone 4 with an
a5 chip to allow them to prepare their
applications for the next generation
iphone release now call this the iphone
4s or probably the next generation
iphone is just going to be an iphone 4
with a lot more power that's rumors out
there but then again it's really cool to
see that Apple is working ahead to have
developers prepared for the applications
to be a 5 compatible before the device
releases now speaking of Sony they just
released an iOS application called
krackle which is really cool because it
brings you free TV and free movies to
your iOS device I will be asking what's
the catch well it's free but you'll have
to wait for 30 seconds on each video to
watch ads which is pretty much the same
deal you get on TV right now it comes to
compete with Hulu and Netflix which is
another really cool option but then
again let me warn you we're getting
close to the not-so-cool section and
what's not cool here it's that it's
buggy as bugs can come now hopefully
they'll update it and bring some better
options but for now it lags it sometimes
plays it sometimes doesn't play but it's
free
while others are for the coolest
continue on with the not so cool first
it was antenna gate then it was glass
gate and now we have spy gate why well
we all know that our cell phones are
homing devices you know anybody could
actually know where you are just by
looking at an antenna cell tower and try
to look for you with your number or your
unique device ID now the thing is when
Apple is using your iOS device ever
since iOS 4 was released and tracking
your every move and saving it on your
computer every time you sync the
question is what happens to that
information whenever your device sinks
does it transmit your information
somewhere is it there just for you to
watch but not tell you not really sure
what to expect out of this but it really
is ugly so if you have a jailbroken
iphone there is a way to cut this off we
actually posted about this but then
again you know not really sure what to
expect let's hope that Apple cuts the
deal or at least sends as a press
release saying hey we're not perfect and
we're cutting it down and well it was
bound to happen Samsung just got sued by
apple because of how their Samsung
Galaxy S line and their new galaxy
tablet the 10-point something inch
tablet looks exactly like the iPhone and
the iPad now well if we are honest about
this yes the Samsung Galaxy S line looks
like an iphone 3gs whether you want to
accept it or not it does and well I
probably call on to apple and say man
you guys don't really have really good
designers out there they could just come
up with something that's unique and not
looking like the iPhone but then again
Apple why do you have to be suing
everybody I mean you're already making
money no other company in tech makes as
much money as you do so what's wrong
with other companies liking to be
copycats that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching on high
meadow meadow remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
