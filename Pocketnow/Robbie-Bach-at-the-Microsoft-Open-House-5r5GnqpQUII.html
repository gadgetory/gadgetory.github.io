Entertainment advices Robbie bah
I think that music successfully aged me
Latino mature good morning everybody
it's gonna be back in New York I will
say those of us who flew in from Seattle
it's a tad early but I'm excited to be
here and if anything she started out I
think would be a great day now I grew up
in the Midwest in Milwaukee I moved to
North Carolina on what school Chapel
Hill but I did come to work in New York
and when i was here in New York things
with just a tad different thing just
take you back a little bit I actually
had a pager yeah this is better I worked
with an HP 12c no computers no
spreadsheets I was a financial analyst
working importance am now fastball and
come forward 20 little more than 20
years and look at Hulk interchange and
the technology we are working on today
is now about changing industries and
changing people's lifestyles and that's
what today is really about to talk to
you about the things we're going for
this audition to really bring new
exciting new ideas new experiences to
people so I want to welcome you to
today's open house I hope this event is
different in at least two it first I'll
typically a microsoft event I would talk
for an aunt Fatima be a lot of power
point at least four or five product
managers helping me do demo with all the
different products so we thought that
today we do it a little different I'm
going to spend
about 25 minutes giving you a brief
overview of the products and let's here
at the armory and then we were to let
you experience the product and go out
into the different sections of their
armor and see the products in their
environment and concluding a garage
treehouse and two other things but give
you a real opportunity to see the
technology in action and see the
experiences in action so that's the
first thing that's different the second
thing that's different is during my talk
I'm going to try to give you a little
bit of what I would call the director's
cut give you a little bit of background
about how some of the technology was
created some of the inside stories about
that hopefully you know if you're a
writer for t-mo or whether you're right
for newsweek you're in guys go with
something in there that will grab your
imagination give you a hook for the
stories that you want to write for the
things that you want to share with your
group let me start with one of those
which is about product creation and I a
lot of the bigoted people asking come on
I didn't come up with the same and this
is actually a charm this is a real
artifact for the windows mobile Valentin
which is about product creation
radiation the process they go through
throughout the product team to try to
come up with new ideas and you never
know when you're going to come up with
that aha that gives you something new
and exciting and different and as I
think you'll see today we have that
throughout all of our product and this
is just
one example how we try to be structured
the way we think about things but free
thinking in the way we come up with new
ideas so let's see what what the product
has produced what that energy is
produced as you can see from our holiday
wish list we have a little bit of
something for everybody cheap something
that in can experience in the way that
you want to live now for those of you
who are doing really holiday shopping
the good news is you've got some music I
hearts on your list we have some things
sadly if you have some work a holic try
to list we have some things for them as
well if you're a gamer or channel surfer
we had things to them if you're a busy
mom or like some of us are Twilight
obsessed we have things for you as well
out that means to each my first
embarrassing moment of the morning
perhaps which is that after that I am a
bit of a tribal a little bit of a family
tradition we have every kid and i have
read with my kids when they were growing
up and my younger sister team and she
not read over 30 books together and we
are currently part way through a
twilight series now i have to admit that
my daughter is certainly into this but I
got a little bit into the edward jacob
bill wolf triangle thing it's sort of
like Peyton Place going back to child I
pulled that climbing experience but for
the record we just finished the second
book and Bella definitely should
Jacob this other guy is just a little
too creepy for me so what do I get my
trihard dog what's the gifts that I gave
her cloud well I could give resume and
trick it out or the zune pass which he
has access to all the music to my 16
million ozune a subscription service or
I can trick it out with Stephanie Myers
favorite music from use of linkin park
with cole playing radio that's the music
you listen to when she was creating the
books and so this creates an opportunity
for a unique connection between me let
water about the things that we are
sharing together and certainly the
holidays is about those connections now
if you think about zune HD you might say
gosh come up to some of the things we
had in there so once I story about mixed
you which is a feature in to HD with
basically enables you to discover new
music we have this real challenge you
know six million tracks it's hard for
people to find the music they want so
one of our developers was literally was
actually living with the drawing we did
got a post-it note was scribbling on a
post-it note with a way to help people
explore and find music he then went away
with another pelipper and the two of
them created this feature called makes
which you'll see if you go into the zoo
section and product right and this is an
amazing way for people to explore in
five music and you start with Radiohead
and you never know where you might end
up and it's a great chance particular to
have escaped a subscription creatives
for blue the world music so this is like
I can introduce my daughter two tubes
from bike when I was going up stix
journey Alton Giada it takes us back a
little bit a little bit away from
distance but it really is an opportunity
to make a connection and that
software engine is driving innovation
but of course are also driving
innovations in with harbor and the zune
i would say is profoundly a beautiful
device not just because it have an
amazing oily these cuts tree which is
great for watching movies just a great
experience in touch perspective but it's
designed to have that same feeling you
know abella raw spot which are designed
for pylons of deep-sea divers bomb squad
experts as for whatever and it's that
funny combination of being a premium
device but also being utilitarian
interval it's what the team called
delicate but compositionally interesting
contract but when you get a chance to go
in there and feel the harbor and the
software working together you'll get the
context of what we're trying to create i
mean i think it with zoom HD we've
created something very very special and
the sales the stars are actually better
than that we are today for going to keep
up with demand that's a good problem on
that Bob we're going to require on that
for the holidays so I hope you get a
chance to try out to make see there I
think when the King maybe should have
gotten investment at my pal woody corner
and there's an HD families have take a
look at that as well visit the
entertainment zone enjoy singing into
ending things work for producing those
one of the other editions were making
with soon as we're actually taking the
zoom experience and moving into xbox as
well so this fall you'll be able to get
on demand movies and TV shows so in
1080p brought to you by soon contacts
clocks and i'ma TV now that lends me to
a whole other topic of discussion which
is the whole idea
take the content that our kids have
access to today and what I think about
this I said before I'm a father of three
kids I'm also chairman of board of
governors of boys and girls clubs of
america I care very deeply and
passionately about kids and so we've
been working very hard to figure out how
to keep kids safe and rid boys and girls
go to America we launched a site called
good game smart comedy his parents to go
see what things they can do to
understand what the pizza play what
they're using on their xbox are under PC
and understand how they can be engaged
it also features are ruined countless
etiquette hold on windows and imax box
which may be parents really manage the
content could pizza watching and i have
four older brothers and sisters some of
which are significantly over time they
have kids and kids have graduated the
grandparents their advice to me as a
parent was gosh you want your finger to
be the place all the other kids want to
come because then you can see firsthand
what they're doing and what they're
experiencing I think that whole concept
of a teen parents be more controls bare
escentuals what we're trying to do in
this entertaining space so you asked in
our family in our family what are people
actually see and watching and the next
box this year we have a great plan
promise you think you can go to the Xbox
oh this is great battles beautiful rock
band quartz of motorsport magnetical 10
halo 3 ODST Oh doing a whole sad
products that are really can be very
excited what's a lot thinking look just
quickly
chickasaw comment on my season better
sign what time is it
guitar
you can use facebook on your xbox 360
look mom savanna greco-roman wrestling
so we know this holiday season people
are going to be tightening develops a
little bit because of the economy in
many cases that mean a family's going to
buy maybe one large get set up a lot of
individual gifts and so we've actually
lower the price on our xbox elite
console by hundred dollars to two
hundred and thirty dollars we're also
introducing an elite unknown which for
219 adults also includes two games lego
batman and pure which is a motorcycle
which are already e for everyone and
this really will bring a tremendous
value to families and a tremendous
opportunity for excitement in the letter
now of course with xbox the excitement
doesn't actually really stop in the
living because xbox why is this super
important part of our offer what's the
largest social network and liver what's
the largest social network on the TV in
fact his xbox live now with over 20
million members really experiencing
gaming but also experiencing a social
experience around game not over there
playing games together with the chatting
we're not watching netflix movies
together in fact when we lost the
netflix service electronics a million
people over many people activated
netflix from our xbox of town so you see
real attraction not just in gaining but
on the places where dating crosses over
into social interaction in the movies
and into music we're going to be adding
facebook and twitter support this fall
which is very excited about this is
mostly us is but if you live in the UK
or france and be excited about BSkyB
coming to xbox this this fall be excited
about general clothes concept coming
back
so we have a great opportunity to expand
xbox live now one of the exciting parts
on xbox live this is extra little bit
surprises me is this whole concept of
avatars and this is a huge part of the
xbox live experience and people want to
dress up and view their avatars
individually so if you look on the
screen here you'll see I on guitar and a
few different outfits I don't know about
the cowboy I'm not exactly sure that's
my that's me but people really spend
time doing this I'll give you a news
flash but in God on a project mode xbox
live minnows change the world 150
million times pitch me Saturday and I
stated about many things i will say but
it certainly shows excitement and the
engagement people have now all the
challenges on xbox live of courses on we
match make people with people of life
skills and like interest and again this
is one of those challenges that the
developers took squirrelly on one of our
developers actually in cambridge of the
UK who's a halo fan wanted to be a
moment with people who have been already
so he actually started creating this is
literally
making algorithm that he started to
create so that we can do a better job so
if you're on ladies day nite family b92
playing one vs 100 which by the way
200,000 people participated every
weekend you're going to get a great dang
Matt because these developers took the
time to plow through 425 million game
sessions to understand the best way to
match the people to literally figure out
the mathematical algorithms to make that
all work in a successful way so this is
a clear example where there's serious
technology serious science behind
something that is a social experience
and driving home that social experience
in a very very rich way so our holiday
event upon which box is going to be
great you can go over the gaming arcade
check it out play some of the games
watch other people play the games
netbook Netflix facebook and some great
dates comment we're going to wrap up
this section with a quick look at the
recent title from us
this is new
this is for all things for real
the sort of jeans
racers
design because this is more than an
this is white knuckles at 93
this is more than simulation this is
rotation
free trial available on xbox live
so clearly in my being soon an xbox are
going to be repotted of products this
holiday season and techniques in general
even move the economy we think they're
coming very very often in fact those
recent survey that said 14 volts watts
to buy a new computer policies to do the
math that's 267 million people computers
and fortunately we have amazing product
market that's going to be perfectly time
for that because I'm october twenty
second we will launched windows seven
and we will seven really in one sense is
a pc simplified it's about making it
easier faster better to get things done
16 day people are going to be able to
see that an experience that states now
though we listen to project one of the
league's Allah cosmonauts kind of God
Jon Bon I worked with for almost 20
years and I talked to John about what
was making on the windows not a team and
it's pretty amazing scale with the
afternoon 3500 engineers tested to
program managers working on the project
for over three years they talked to
literally millions of customers to get
feedback from over 200 countries and
really what that feedback well down to
is as I said earlier people want
something simple easy to use and makes
it really fast to get applicants they
won't do so john told me said okay night
you know we do a build we need to a
build of windows so the next morning I
get up and install on my machine and I'd
start sees it and he said the testing is
was core things tough was it getting
faster was a performer pattern where
people get into their work and then it
entertainment faster than a better way
so the team actually came up with
something with it
call for strategy and the whole idea was
to determine whether they can make the
entire pride simpler more streamlined or
the existence at the start is the start
menu staff here come up and you right
click on the mouse to get how many that
comes up in a snap your way to sleep and
resume happened to snap your quicker way
the entire user interface and user
experience is just that much quicker
that much smarter that much simpler so
are we simplified tasked with middle 70s
is on CBS are we giving it to looking to
get out there information after
entertainment quickly easily answers yes
and are we making new things possible
and the answer that's just as well
windows 7 for us is clearly an important
milestone product for me personally I
mean they sort of entertainment guide
Microsoft news media center is an
important part of the product and new
capabilities were brought to the power
of course people today on the pc and see
videos and go to youtube and do all that
but the experiences of really says
windows media center Luna's nice have
tons of pieces basically
full screening makes it easier for you
to your core playback cause all the
video that you are in fact you can find
video at other pcs in your home through
the same window seven whole group so you
can play video around the house from
wherever you keep it where we store and
we've now just recently added netflix
support between those media center so
the same that looks important I to
expound on xbox is now available on the
pc so matter what screen you're working
on you're going to have access to this
video that you want so soon Xbox windows
7 all very very important products the
three feet of our final topic this is to
talk about windows phones and the phone
market now my family has a little bit of
channels and I think many of you could
probably relate to which is we are very
widely dispersed you can see the bottom
of the crest their continued into the
one goes plenty of the Xbox logo and the
zune low quad so late addition to the
family crest and you know I live in
Seattle my son's at school in California
my parents about a system mostly live in
North Carolina my white brother lives in
Ohio I like color the kids call Lola
lives in the Netherlands my wife is
Dutch we have eight very this first time
and so the challenge for us at how many
time is how do we stay together how do
we participate as a family together so
my son attacked he does not answer the
phone oh it is he never checks his email
a text I get response in 30 seconds no
time flat with my wife June of course of
the day will do quick follicles in the
course of the day you know sometimes we
have to do kadaj because of the bees
people know what I'm talking about six
day in the morning I working out three
or four days a week I gotta coordinate
out with my schedule at work all these
things are done on my phone and so the
phone really has become such a part what
would the pc of what i do and so when we
announced today the availability of
windows phones it's a very important
event for us and the first thing that
significant about windows closed is what
i just talked about historically our
phone products have been more about
business and about managed support for
exchange working in the enterprise
what's changing today is we add into
that integration with your lifestyle and
so the whole idea that your work style a
lifestyle are blended together and can
both be square from one product is super
super portable we want to connect you
with people you care about most we want
to connect you to the information you
want we want to connect you with your
entertaining whether that's facebook
powerpoint text messaging email outlook
whatever it is we're in the car the
grocery store had homework you want to
bring all those things going so the
first thing is about 13 work style and
lifestyle together the second thing that
significant about early response is
about a choice between now and the end
of two thousand five people should 30
windows
20 countries so pretty amazing the
product line when you can you actually
look at them and this is the best of
broadest portfolio products we've ever
had now a key thing about this is where
we finally talk to our customers they
think phones need to be deep and
specific to them some of the big screen
touch device some of them on a small
screen cheap berta device for those at
the keyboard some of them won a slider
that has Gustav touched and the best of
the keyboard they make those trade-offs
and we go around the room ask people to
pull out the phone gonna see Asians
right so one of the big benefits of
windows phones they offer that choice to
spend physical keyboards touchscreens
both choice of operators and I've been
to one upper 20 on horizon ATT tmobile
sprint all those work and of course
different president in particular in
today's common some people lost in the
money to get the higher end phones but
we have a lot of people who want a basic
phone and keyboards that it can do the
basic things and windows Falls fans that
entire breadth of the offer so you know
we're star lifestyle brand choice the
third thing we discovered about choice
is it actually goes a little further
than just the device itself so we've
actually done some very cool design work
with some very face of things design
Vera Wang is up is Rodney that about
furstenberg ron arad he's effect in
architecture somebody like rock and
republic and actually created custom
themes and screens and you in fact and
create your own custom theme and
screaming and in windows it's a whole
idea in here is holds a person you say
should be personal you should be
customizable you should be able to get
exactly the phone in line with all of
our windows technology building third
area of importance for windows mobile is
services applications on top the first
service we're announcing today is
windows marketplace to mobile this is
the one stop shops get added and
applications on top of what concert at
the disco so the little that would be
hundreds of applications facebook
twitter and others all the ones you'd
expect available to start and that
number will grow dramatically through
the end of the year will also be some
applications that are unique to Windows
Mobile critter which turns out to do a
mobile app with cats and dogs and kids
wanted to experience that or midomi
which is the fastest way to figure out
what music you're here to who the artist
is and then figure out go to sing either
RS so there's a whole world of
applications that we're going to add to
your Windows Phone experience again to
extend the making offers but the second
service ragtime a person pretty excited
about is myself now my phone is a free
service that basically aims you to
recover when you lose your phone now
people lose their combs in the other
places the refrigerator or freezer point
years of what i thought was quite
because some others that are doing as
well as we did include
in the in the PowerPoint but we have
free licenses greatly basically to take
everything that's on fall and put it in
the cloud on a server where its fans and
taken care of and preserve so if for
example if you lose your home you can go
to a PC click on your phone and the life
of service and it will map before you
can tell you literally out of that where
it is so do you see it driving down the
road you know the lesson to the taxi
that's where your phone is going blank
buys you can have the phone even if it's
on vibrate we can force the carburetor
so that you can find it as you see a
moment stop and the cushions of the
couch even when it's on my way they want
to protect the phone got sensitive data
the business ball so we can enable you
to lock it we continue to remotely wipe
it from a pc so all this ability to
customize your phones integrated between
the pc screen and the mobile screen in a
right way and if you
and you can't find you go get a new
phone that will sync to my phone service
to bring out all the things you have all
your content on your customization and
apply it to a pawn straight cool look
your phone is effectively alcohol when
you lose it it's a disaster my phone
service is there to make sure that you
can come up rice we always have a
tremendous experience with your phone so
what I watchings down I'm going to do is
intrusive video this will give you some
idea of all the things we're doing on
through those phones and hopefully
summarize that the last few points i
just made little that you can think
Robinson you chicks I have this
incredible project we need to throw us
on the rise let me talk
okay based on this Lisa I'm putting you
in charge of decorations Jason your
invitations and food I'll secure
location any questions just call it
sometime use my phone service perfect
make it
