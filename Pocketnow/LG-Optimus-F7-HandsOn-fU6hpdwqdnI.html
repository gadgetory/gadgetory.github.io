the camera still LG different phone we
have the lg optimus at seven to show you
which is the highest tier among them but
still admit to your phone let's take a
look at it closely and now in terms of
specifications
it has a 4.7 inch display it is a 720p
display it has a earpiece on top with
the obligatory sensors for ambient light
and proximity the webcam the home button
on the bottom back button for Android
back and menus now let's switch over to
the side we have a power button this
should not confuse you this is not a
stylus this is a extendable antenna
which is currently available on the
South Korean market version of this it
might or might not be available on the
global version we'll let you know more
about that once we find it out on the
back we have an 8 megapixel camera this
time this is with flash we have a
speaker grille and it's the same texture
it's the same material but this time we
don't have squares we have circles
in case my eyes sight that's good you'll
have to check it out for yourselves on
the other side we have the memo button
and the volume up and volume down rocker
let's jump to the top of it 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and a
secondary microphone for noise
cancellation while the bottom holds the
microUSB port and your primary
microphone for phone calls let's jump
real quick into the software Saturday so
we're still running Android 4.1 without
G's proprietary UI and everything is
seen on the lg optimus G pro and the
Optimus F 5 is available and we're
talking about the qslide applications
which allow you to have multiple
applications one on top of the other for
more productivity and also the
note-taking applications which are
exactly the same let's hop in real quick
into the settings once I can find them
right here and go to you have your
network shortcuts right here we have
tabbed appearance here shortcuts work
sound we have shortcuts for display and
we have your general all settings that's
not protocol to the about tone set for
information and as you can see it's
running Android 4.1.2 so this is the
higher-end among the F phones we had the
f5 this is the f7 at 7 and Ironman time
for pocket not have come Michael Fisher
is behind the camera tongue twister
names pocket knock down thank you very
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
