many was a common thing that we never
really applauded but if you had a look
at the new galaxy a3 and a5 or 2017
let's just say that we've got minis all
around sort of I'm hi never leave a
pocket now here with high ATO huesemann
on the edits and this is the samsung
galaxy a3 and a5 sadly the galaxy a7
wasn't on display but we did have a
chance to play a little with the new
galaxy a3 and a5 from Samsung if you've
ever seen the galaxy s7 and we're sure
you have let's just say that you're
looking at its many variants front and
center at to a certain degree they share
the same design language of a glass
front and back with aluminum on the
borders there are curves all around each
of them and about the only difference is
with the a-series are that the speakers
are on the side and can someone tell me
who came up with this idea that's the
only weird part though both devices are
ip68 water in dust resistance and the
differences are mainly that the a3 is
smaller at a 4.7 inch display versus 5.2
inches in the diagonal on the a5 the
battery on the a3 is also smaller at
2350 milliamp hours versus 3000 on the
a5 though fast charging comes standard
the internals are also different with
the a3 supporting in xno 7870 versus
7880 and 2 gigs of ram and 16 gigs of
storage versus 3 gigs and 32 the camera
on the a3 is also of 13 megapixels
versus 16 on the a5 and 8 megapixels on
the front-facing versus 16 on the a5
what's shared though is f 1.9 aperture
across devices now I've got to admit
that it's really hard to find a device
that's a premium mid-range er and also
ip68 water and dust resistance and it's
also as gorgeous as both of these
devices independent of what color option
you pick
for premium in Rangers these devices are
really good looking and feel just superb
launch date you're still pending though
markets are apparently apart from the
United States for now we've got more
