pocket now calm so we've already seen
how windows mobile 6.5 will allow for
themes different visual styles for the
main screen and the rest of the
operating system and we've also seen how
windows mobile 6.5 will allow for
widgets different kind of widgets from
the main screen dialing favorite people
or having weather but what about when
two of those get together well we're
going to show you that right now in a
theme that comes from XDA developers
it's kind of inspired by iphone and
apple products so let's get in closer to
the screen here so we have the sliding
panel interface of course we've seen
this many times before but added are
some new things so of course we have the
the photo widget we have the music
widget favorite people which is actually
a new widget that was released on XDA
developers which lets you flip through
some of the people that you call on a
regular basis we can go to phone voice
mail phone clock and what's new on this
one is actually the weather widget which
is super cool so the within a second you
can see exactly what the weather is
going to be like and this actually taps
into the msn weather widget as we know
windows mobile 6.5 will support widgets
and it's cool because if you keep
flicking your finger you get a day by
day forecast of what's going on in the
location that you've selected and of
course we have text messages we've been
here before emails and appointments so
that was just a quick look and what
they're working on an XDA developers so
that when windows mobile 6.5 dubs does
come out there will be a lot of themes
and widgets and and hopefully theme
packs available for your device that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
