prototypes that even include USB type-c
Santa example LED technology might get
more affordable as of next year and it
seems that Amazon won the battle against
ample with the Apple TV I'm hi meri
behna and finding news on a Tuesday
after the holidays is like trying to
find an open bar on a tuesday at seven
a.m. this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with samsung
customers as have you remember that news
we covered last week of the gear s2
software update that brought a bevy of
new features well it seems that users
are complaining that it's not working
meaning the update won't load on their
watches because their phones are
encrypted it seems that there is a
problem they're not really sure how
sansom plans to manage that and that we
tried to replicate it on our review unit
but because my phone was an encrypted I
didn't have a problem let us know in the
comments of you have and speaking of
problems even though telegram is not as
big as what's up when it comes to
messaging it seems that whatsapp is
playing hardball with a recent update to
its Android application apparently now
if you try to send somebody a link to
telegram what's happens going to block
the link you can send other URLs and
those are going to work just fine but
any telegram m.e messenger blink is
sadly not going to work you won't be
able to load it and it seems that it
doesn't even work when you try to copy
and paste the link to the browser we
can't really confirm if this is
happening but we'd love to know if
you're trying it out in the comments as
well I let's return the spotlight over
to Samsung you probably notice that the
premium mid range of smartphones has
been using AMOLED pals but what you
haven't noticed is that there is a
tremendous price difference between mo
let and IPS for those of you that didn't
know there is a 30-percent price
difference between the cost of an AMOLED
display to an IPS display which makes
sense given the fact that a mole it is a
sort of more complex according to some
experts but then again it seems that
because Samsung wants to get Apple as a
customer which are other rumours that
will might happen in 2018 see the
samsung press to drop the price
amoled starting next year only ten
percent difference between IPS let's
just see if that becomes more ubiquitous
and other smartphones as yes I do prefer
a mullet but I know other people don't
for those of you that remember that
battle between Apple Amazon and Google
over the fact that there wasn't any
amazon instant video service on the
Apple TV or the chromecast and therefore
that forced these other companies to
pull their set-top boxes from amazon
store well it seems that there is an
application in the works it seems that a
developer was able to confirm with an
amazon executive that there is an
application in the works we're not
exactly sure when it's going to be
launched but it does seem that the Apple
TV will at some point return to the
store because it makes sense more for
Amazon than anybody else anyways and
finally the very hot rumors today have
to do with Apple testing different
prototypes for the iphone 7 apparently
there are five different models and the
things being tested for example there's
a unit that has the fingerprint scanner
embedded on the display there is another
prototype that has USB type-c another
prototype that has a multi-touch
variance of 3d touch there's another
with a different camera modules and
different camera settings and yes
obviously the other one is the rumored
one that won't have the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack over the Lightning port
and apparently Apple is testing the
waters and this is common for Apple
Apple dust test different types of
phones and given the fact that we are so
far from the launch cycle of the iphone
7 it does make sense for the company to
experiment but it does lead me to the
question of the day at all the
prototypes he just heard which one would
you like most for apple to launch in my
case the USB type-c burien that would be
great if I phones were just standard
just like every other phone but leave us
a comment down below I'd love to know
what you think friends as always you
