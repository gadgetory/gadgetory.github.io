smartphone manufacturer partners with
camera manufacturer to improve phone
photography but do we really get better
cameras out of these partnerships we're
taking a look at three phones which
where their photography branding on
their respective shells the Lumia 950
the BlackBerry Prive and the Huawei p9
Nokia landed one of the most
high-profile partnerships working with
Carl Zeiss optics since 2004 starting
with N series phones and later moving
the Lumias these two companies developed
a reputation for bleeding edge mobile
camera hardware it's difficult to
imagine what the phone photo landscape
would look like today had these two
companies not joined forces looking at
Microsoft's Lumia 950 specifically it
continues a tradition of superior optics
this zeiss lens is wonderfully sharp
which is necessary when paired with such
a pixel dense sensor the downside to
this camera comes in the form of an app
which is falling behind the competition
and image processing which is
inconsistent at best what we don't know
is whether this relationship will
continue into the future
the Nokia brand will be returning to
smartphones but it's still unknown of
other Nokia created brands like clear
black or pure view will also make the
jump back to Finland will zeiss offer
lenses and guidance to Microsoft will
Nokia win back vices affections or will
we see high quality optics on both
manufacturers phones time will tell
while Nokia and Zeiss show us the
long-term benefits of a photography
partnership let's look at two more
recent adopters of this strategy
blackberry historically hasn't been
known for supplying great cameras on
phones otherwise excellent hardware like
the passport would include mid Packard
downright mediocre photography gear this
all changed with the Prive thanks in
part to a deal with Schneider lenses
Schneider is well known in the world of
cinematography and the privy benefits
from having higher quality glass
blackberry also took this opportunity to
supply its first Android phone with a
much nicer camera app the two
improvements working in tandem to
deliver something far more competitive
it's not a good enough excuse anymore
that labeling a phone as a business
device means a company can include a me
Yoker camera the business people use
cameras - and the proof demonstrates a
blackberry looking to improve their
reputation both in and outside the
corporate world as a brief side note to
this discussion snyder used to partner
with LG on feature phones back in the
day a relationship long since dissolved
while LG makes some excellent overall
smartphone cameras today lens
performances may be the weakest link of
their photography chains lastly let's
look at the new kid on the block
huawei got a ton of buzz after
announcing a deal with Leica and then
received a bit of a backlash after it
was revealed that Leica wasn't actually
making anything for the Chinese
manufacturer instead collaborating on
the image processing and hardware design
while certifying the manufacturing for
any quality issues if not a quote real
Leica this label should at least mean
that this camera performs up to Leica
standards so we're happy to see this
huawei deliver some of if not the best
still photos we've seen from any current
smartphone shooter while many feared
this is a cynical branding exercise the
combo of Huawei engineering and Leica
consulting does seem to have produced a
better camera than Huawei could make on
its own like Nokia and Zeiss before them
there's potential here with a long-term
collaboration to significantly influence
the future of smart phone photography
from these three examples we do see a
benefit for consumers when a phone
manufacturer reaches out to a camera
company for assistance does that label
mean a customer will receive quote the
bestest camera ever because of a
licensing deal not at all but we can be
fairly confident that we'll see tangible
improvements over previous phones from
that manufacturer this notion is
reinforced when looking at the shooters
on Sony and Samsung devices as those two
companies keep terrific cameras of
visions in house and their phones
benefit from that imaging access we're
hoping to see more partnerships like
this in the future maybe Olympus
entering this market or Panasonic
improving on phones like the CM one what
might inspire Nikon or Canon to join
this battle a smart phone with our red
ring of L glass could be very compelling
and of course we want to hear from you
who would you most want to see partner
up for a future mega camera smartphone
