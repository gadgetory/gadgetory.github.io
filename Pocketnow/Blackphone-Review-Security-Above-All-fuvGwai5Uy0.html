smartphone space your best bet is to
build a device for a niche market and
given the world's increasing concerns
about personal privacy it's about time
someone built a modern smartphone
focused entirely on security this is
that smartphone I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is our video
review of the blackphone bp1
folks our review device comes to us from
gsm nation a global smartphone retailer
that's offering blackphone for sale
right now if you want one of your own do
what we did visit gsm nation calm at the
link in the description below and tell
them PocketNow sent you the first thing
you'll notice about the black phone is
that well there's not much to notice
about the black phone from a fit and
finish standpoint it's about as
forgettable as they come with average
dimensions a light and insubstantial
feel in the hand and only the barest of
branding on the matte finish casing
which of course comes in black and black
alone the IPS display doesn't have the
highest resolution or the best viewing
angles but it's not horrible and the
Tegra 4i processor while a surprise is
by no means underpowered the single gig
of ram supporting it certainly is a
disappointment though is something we'll
touch on in the performance section in a
minute of course you don't buy a black
phone for the hardware you buy it for
it's secure software which comes in
three levels the first layer is the
operating system which looks a lot like
the Android KitKat build it's based on
but this is no Google phone
despite the interface being a very
familiar one there are no Google
services built into this special
platform called the private OS you've
got to download and install your own
application marketplace if you want one
we recommend the Amazon App Store and
the private OS makes its presence known
with the very first title you try to
install you get to individually select
which parts of your device that app is
allowed to access this isn't the first
time we've seen this but it is a natural
fit for a privacy centric device and we
wish it was standard on all smartphones
the OS also forces you to enable or
strongly and repeatedly recommends that
you enable certain security features
that other smartphones leave optional
like a pin unlock code and total device
encryption that's all in the first level
the second level is the embedded
security suite from silent circle which
also comes with the membership package
necessary to power it silent phone sets
up a secure sip connection over a VoIP
link to provide private voice
connections silent text lets you
communicate via instant messages that
can self-destruct and which can't be
screenshotted both apps give you tools
for manual authentication so you can be
sure you're actually talking to your
intended target and each one draws from
a central protected list of silent
contacts that can be locked anytime it's
all entrenched behind a series of pass
phrases and pin codes handled by a key
manager that silent circle also provides
finally the third layer of security
comes from third-party apps that fill in
most of the remaining gaps there's the
ability to remote wipe and force closed
particular apps from afar there's secure
cloud storage from SpiderOak and a duo
of apps from disconnect the one provides
a secure VPN connection so you can feel
safer connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots
among other things and the other allows
you to use your search engine of choice
without giving the search provider or
ISP any personal information if that
sounds like a pretty extensive list of
security features it is and that's black
phones biggest privacy advantage over
every other device it just throws a huge
number of resources at the user
effectively carpet-bombing
the security question into submission
but not into oblivion like any
communications device black phone is not
entirely secure and its implementation
in many corners leaves room for
improvement for one thing silent phone
requires a very good internet connection
to function properly and even with full
LTE signal on t-mobile here in the
States
it didn't function very well at all
regular voice calls fared far better but
sound was thin and tinny through both
earpiece and speakerphone
silent text also has an issue with
embedding photos which doesn't always
work well and the setup process for
everything from elaborate third party
security apps to pedestrian functions
like email and calendar syncing is much
more complex than you'll find on a
regular smartphone the phone stumbles
and the fundamentals to its small amount
of RAM causes it to hang and stutter at
points and we've had to completely
reboot the phone to save it from itself
more than once the lag and stutter is
especially bad within its camera
viewfinder the last place you want
software troubles and the photos
produced our marginal ones with
overexposure problems sharpening halos
and a generally unremarkable quality
from both the eight megapixel back
module and the five megapixel front one
despite its smallish powerpack battery
life is acceptable in that you can
definitely get a day out of it with
moderate use but leaving it in standby
mode off the charger overnight we've
sometimes seen the device randomly power
off or hang and require a restart so
well this is not a road warriors phone
by any means obviously a big take away
from this review is that to put it
crudely first gen phones gonna be first
gen phones given its complexity and its
finicky nature this is by no means a
smart phone for beginners which makes it
tough to recommend to the target
audience at least a portion of which is
regular consumers with a higher than
normal concern for privacy but black
phone has accomplished something
significant here it's packed more
privacy options into one device than has
ever been done before and it's thrown in
a lot of value with all the free
security memberships some of which are
truly excellent
so while black phone has a long way to
go to reach the perfect combination of
privacy and usability that'll make this
attractive to the average consumer it's
also the first company in this portion
of the space at least to take a
meaningful step in that direction and
based on what we've seen from the way
the company engages with the community
about security issues the people behind
black phones seemed genuinely interested
in fostering a dialogue and
quickly honing their product based on it
as a result while we can only recommend
the blackphone bp1
to very concerned people with very good
internet connections we are also very
much looking forward to the BP - if you
think we missed a few things you're
right
