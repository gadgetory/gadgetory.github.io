pocket now calm and in this video I'm
going to show you how to customize the
HTC home plug-in which is a free plug-in
available for any windows mobile
touchscreen device it makes your home
screen have a big clock on it it'll
allow you to flip through the icons you
know you can check your weather you can
launch programs you can play songs right
from your media card and you can switch
the profiles so I'm going to I'm going
to show you how to change it from this
to this which I think looks a lot better
so we have iphone esque icons on the
bottom here we have the clock clock tab
with a different clock weather with new
icons program launcher profiles and of
course the media player okay to get
started you need to download a free
piece of software go to pocket mu calm
and go to the top of the website where
it says pocket mu software from there
you'll find links to download the cab
which you'll need to load onto your
device and run on your device which will
install the program now right now I'm
using an HTC vogue or a verizon XV 6900
but like I said you can use any windows
mobile touchscreen device to do this
with so after you install it what you
want to do is go into your programs menu
when you where you'll see a new entry
for HTC home customizer here it is right
here
okay here we are on this first tab it
shows you all of the things you can
customize so we can change the
background and right now it's set to
original because this is a saved theme
that is the original that I wanted to
show you we can go down the clock we can
change the clock the different style of
the clock we can change these icons
along the bottom and then we can also
change what the weather icons look like
so let me go into some of these options
you get a fair amount out of the box a
lot of them are baseball themed for some
reason so if you click on any of the
backgrounds it will kind of show you a
preview right above the selection area
of what the the theme will look like so
let me just choose one I'm going to go
to carbon well that looks pretty much
the same a little bit different okay
that'll do it I'm going to go down the
clock and change the clock again you get
a few out of the box though i'll show
you in a second how to get even more
choices i'm going to do digital green
icons i want to change these icons along
the bottom here we have this stout see
what they look like they look pretty
good and we'll leave that and whether we
only have three choices but i'll show
you how to get more i'm going to change
it to cartoon so they'll kind of look
like that i'm going to change it to
shiny actually that looks better i like
that so when you're done you can click
save it will ask you are you sure you
want to save and this is the new today
screen that we just made we can click on
to the weather and see those new icons
that we placed and these icons along the
bottom are different and of course the
clock is green now the program does a
lot more than just that i'm going to go
back into the program and show you how
you can add different kinds of themes
and other kind of styles to your today
screen so there are several tabs along
the bottom the second one says themes
and this is where you save all of the
things that you did in in the appearance
tab so that you can come back to it and
apply it later for example if you want
to go back to the original HTC home
today screen you can just go to original
and it will change it back all of the
different settings to the way it was
before if you go to the tab that says
downloads it'll give you a warning
saying you know if you have a data
connection it's going to use a lot of
data and then if you press connect to
download server you'll actually be able
to download a plethora of other
style so if we go to clocks we have a
huge list of clocks much bigger than the
one before so I'm going to find one and
show you what to do with it let's click
on West and then I'm going to click
download here and then it's going to
proceed to download it and add it to the
list and here it goes it's been added to
clock so if I go back to the appearance
tab and go back into clocks I'm going to
find West and this is what West looks
like kind of ugly actually I don't like
it so how do you kind of get an idea of
what all these things are without having
to download one check it download one
check it well there's a tab over to the
right called previews and again it gives
you an edge that says be sure that you
have an unlimited data connection and
you're not going to use a lot of data
and what it actually does is it loads a
instance of pocket Internet Explorer
right in the program which is pretty
neat and you can actually click on
clocks and it will load all of the
clocks and i'm over at a video
connection right now show so it should
be pretty fast so that you can actually
get a preview of every single clock that
you have an option of this way you're
not wasting time downloading one and
checking it and that sort of thing and
then there's this applications button
which lets you download certain HTC
applications that are included in other
realms of other devices for example
streaming media will install a streaming
media player that will allow you to go
to Ma youtube com and actually watch
youtube videos out of the box of windows
mobile device doesn't support em you
tube.com because it doesn't have the
streaming software but with this you can
just click on it there and it'll
actually download it right from the site
which is great we've launcher which
allows you to set which programs open
with whip which buttons we have the tabs
tab which allows you to take away
certain tabs and bring them back from
HTC home so I'm gonna leave them all
there we've weather which lets you
specify the city then we've the options
tab which allows you to change the
temperature displacement from Celsius to
Fahrenheit you can have the weather
automatically update though that will
use up a lot of your battery I'm sure
because you can't specify how often to
update it and that is how you customize
the HTC home plug in if you like what
you see be sure to subscribe to the
pocket now video YouTube channel where
we're posting new vid
is all the time and if you subscribe you
can stay abreast of when new ones are
posted that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
