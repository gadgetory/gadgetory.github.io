now and we are here with the samsung
galaxy s4 zoom is it a phone was it a
camera well it's a combination between a
camera and a phone and samsung says that
this galaxy s4 zoom is the only phone on
the market phone with a huge optical
zoom will take a look at this first see
the front as you can see it looks like a
phone that's because it is a phone it
has a 4.3 inch qhd Super AMOLED screen
it's running Android fortitude a to
jellybean helped by 1.5 gigs of RAM it's
got eight gigs of storage of course
expandable via microSD card up to 64 and
a 23 30 million power battery and let's
flip it over to the back because this is
where the magic happens this is the 16
megapixel camera with xenon flash and
sin x optical zoom featuring optical
image stabilization this construction is
paired with a run facing camera which is
one of 1.9 megapixel but that's not that
interesting let's fire up the camera
application and I'm gonna go back try to
do that while keeping the phone towards
the camera so here it goes so I'm gonna
three
you think one
boom nothing as you can see these are
the lens which are extended and this
lens ring right here operates the zoom
and I sang as I'm rotating it you can
see the lens extend for a 10 times
optical zoom let's assume that out and
try to see how it works we are in auto
mode and the mode has been selected
let's try to zoom in on the gentleman's
hands on the other one and we're going
to continue zooming up until the point
where we reach this is the maximum 10
times tomb and boom and just for you to
see if these are my hands which are a
little bit shaky but once I press down
the camera button
the images don't come out blur of course
it needs to focus at the same time
and now I'm movin it so that you can see
the optical image stabilization is in
action once I let go of that you can see
it's more difficult to one more let's
try to focus there because it's kind of
difficult with the zoom and with the
subject himself moving let's try this
important here try to zoom in on that
gentleman right there focus anyways the
flash fired off so this was a very very
short look at the samsung galaxy s4 zoom
if you look at it like this it is a
phone if you look at it like this it
looks like the Samsung Galaxy camera
we'll be back with a comparison or two
and four now that is all it's been after
you've been watching bucket now thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
