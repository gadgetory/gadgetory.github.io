pocket now I'm in Salem Massachusetts at
the facilities of GT crystal systems a
company that's trying to make your
smartphone display a little bit harder
to scratch using sapphire let's find out
how they do it
if you watched our coverage from MWC in
Barcelona you might remember a demo by
Jeff Nestle Pat of GT advanced
technologies showcasing a smartphone
display two-and-a-half times stronger
than Gorilla Glass that was for all
intents and purposes unscratched ball it
turns out the primary GT advanced
crystal systems facility is just a hop
away from pocket knives Boston offices
so Jeff invited us for a visit to see
how sapphire smartphone displays are
made an important thing to note right up
front is that GT crystal systems isn't
as focused on directly producing
sapphire displays as it is Unseld
analogy that allows other companies to
do it the core of that technology is
these furnaces there are about 60 at the
Salem facility most of which we're
busily making sapphire at the time of my
visit inside these cylinders at
thousands of degrees is where the
material that ultimately forms a none
scratch Abul smartphone display is
forged so here's how that's done a
sapphire seed about the size and shape
of a hockey puck is placed at the bottom
of a single-use molybdenum barrel called
a crucible the crucible is then filled
with a mixture of condensed corundum
which is a crystalline form of aluminum
oxide and a material called crackle
which is uncrystallized sapphire
material left over from previous runs
the full crucible is then placed inside
the furnace where it sits atop a finger
a small platform cooled by liquid helium
that prevents the sapphire seed from
melting too early the whole shebang is
sealed the air is evacuated and the
temperature is brought up to 2,200
degrees Celsius to allow the materials
to melt together the temperature varies
as the material is put through a series
of cooling cycles over the next 16 or 17
days during that time the Sapphire
slowly crystallizes from bottom to top
and the end result is this a cylindrical
section of industrial sapphire called a
bull the typical recipe produces a 115
kilogram
chemically identical to the Sapphire dug
from the ground bulls are marked and
separated into more and less desirable
regions cores can be drilled and cuts
made for various applications like LED
production or the manufacturing of
airplane windows making a smartphone
display out of this sapphire material is
fairly simple a rectangular section of
specific dimensions is cut smaller for
iPhones and virtues and larger for
galaxy notes and the like it's polished
not just to increase clarity but to
strengthen it further then it's cut into
the appropriate thickness and polished
some more a few hole punches for button
and speaker penetrations and voila a
thin light screen protector harder than
Gorilla Glass harder even than any
material except for diamonds a
practically unscratched will display
coating Jeff told me that accessory
applications like that are already in
the works from other companies but GT
advanced is also hoping to coordinate
with OEMs to include sapphire screens on
smartphones right out of the box cost
continues to be a big factor but the gap
is narrowing where several months ago
sapphire displays cost about $30 per
smartphone the company told me that
current figures are more like $15 with
next-generation technology like reusable
crucibles coming in the next 12 to 18
months to bring that figure down further
to less than 10 bucks a screen it's not
the $3 per screen that Gorilla Glass is
said to cost but it's definitely much
closer again you'll see other companies
pushing sapphire smartphone screens much
more aggressively under their own brands
at first but get ready for a general
sapphire awareness campaign coming soon
GT advanced is committed not just to
creating more sapphire material but
creating more capacity for other
companies to produce it by selling its
furnaces to them that should drive the
costs down while pushing availability up
which means that sooner rather than
later
we might all be able to carry our
smartphones in the same pocket as our
keys coin change and even a handful of
beach sand without worrying about
scratching our screen to death that's a
future we can all get excited about
it's going to do it for now be sure to
check out our hands-on with the sapphire
material at MWC it's part of our
Barcelona collection there on YouTube
subscribe to us on YouTube follow us on
all the usual social media channels stay
tuned for a lot more from pocket now
thanks for watching
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
