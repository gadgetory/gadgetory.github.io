Samsung has proven that it can blur the
lines between the category with the
Samsung Galaxy s7 the only problem is
when it makes you question if you should
still consider it's already existing
phablet lineup I'm high memory that I
with pocket now and this is Samsung
Galaxy s7 edge vs. galaxy note 5 and
galaxy s6 edge+
brought to you by D brand
Samson they have not explicitly called
the galaxy s7 edge a phablet but if you
follow the terms on Wikipedia any
smartphone with a screen size above 5.1
inches in diagonal can be safely
included in the category a category
that's already well dominated by some of
our favorite devices of 2015 the galaxy
note 5 in the galaxy s6 edge+
if you recently decided to pull the
trigger on either of these or if you're
wondering if you should still consider
last year's phablets this video is for
you
in the similarities departments all
three look and feel almost the same from
a design standpoint you get premium 7000
series aluminum in all variants that
glass on glass finished that Samsung has
adopted for the last two years and each
device includes its own set of curves in
order to provide you with ergonomics in
the fence the last years phablets both
sports 1/8 of an inch of added screen
real estate when compared to the galaxy
s7 edge and given the beauty of this
quad HD AMOLED panel we know size does
matter for some of you where the galaxy
s7 edge shines is in solving pretty much
every single complaint that we had with
last year's Galaxy lineup it marks the
return of expandable storage via microSD
something we highly criticized from the
galaxy note 5 it also manages to include
ip68 water and does resistance and does
so without compromising in its beautiful
design it includes more powerful
specifications like a faster and more
efficient snapdragon 820 processor match
with four gigs of ram most important the
smaller chassis of the galaxy s7 edge is
able to fit a larger 3600 milliamp hour
battery when compared to the 3000
milliamp hour unit of its phablet
cousins the debate between these three
inclines more to the galaxy s7 edge in
the software front deciding between
these is also not complicated
after many broken promises last year's
phablets are still running on lollipop
at a time on the galaxy s5
edge runs on the latest version of
android 6.0.1 marshmallow there's also
no guarantee that Samsung will report
the features of the galaxy s7 edge to
its aging line of phablets either and
some of these are rather compelling
samsung's new always-on mode has proven
to be quite popular thanks to all the
customization options included the
company's game launcher also helps you
enjoy gameplay a lot more by helping you
forget about the capacitive keys at the
bottom the new edge features are also
more useful than ever thanks to a more
fluid operation and added options for
quick tasks shortcuts and even tools all
this just obscures the galaxy s6 edge+
from the competition and leaves the
galaxy note 5 hanging by its s-pen it
continues to be awesome to be able to
write a note by simply pulling out the S
Pen and the surrogate Mouse always comes
in handy
slow capture also continues to be one of
my favorite features of the galaxy note
5 but Samsung was nice enough to port it
to the galaxy s7 edge still if you're
not an S Pen fan as most of the people
that I know out there then all points
inclined to the galaxy s7 edge and day
to day usage the experience is rather
mixed the Galaxy Note 5 is the heaviest
and most commanding of the three given
its added thickness and weight if that's
your thing and some of us also argue
that the galaxy s6 edge+ feels best
during everyday handling given the added
thickness of its aluminum trim when
compared to the galaxy s7 edge the
competition gets difficult because it's
really hard to tell these devices apart
when it comes to the speed and fluidity
at which each can handle their
respective versions of Android even when
playing graphics intensive games all
three devices are able to handle
everything without a stutter believe it
or not even the camera debate gets
fairly difficult as all three devices
are able to capture jaw-dropping photos
will only use the Galaxy s7 edge and the
note 5 for this comparison given the
similarity of the sensors last year but
also because you really can't tell the
difference
during the day both color and saturation
is on par on each device and speed when
focusing is also just as good even with
the added focus pixel technology of the
galaxy s7 edge the main difference is
notice that night wear the new galaxy is
able to focus a hair quicker than its
predecessors and also let in more light
thanks to the F 1.7 aperture of its
camera lens when compared to last year's
F 1 point 9 still even this debate is
complicated because I can attest to last
year's phablets providing more accurate
depictions of the scenery when compared
to the galaxy s7 edge because of that
added light that wasn't really there
video stabilization was probably the
biggest shocker both cameras are
optically stabilized but it seems the
galaxy s7 edge does a better job when
you're walking where differences are far
more noticeable as in battery life and
for all the right reasons
the galaxy s7 edge has a larger battery
a slightly smaller display to power a
more efficient version of Android and a
more efficient processor as well though
further testing will help us provide
details on just how pronounced this
difference is and this is the best way
to conclude with such a mixed comparison
the galaxy s7 edge is not just the newer
phone but it's also a better phone in
most of the things that truly matter to
the average user add to that the fact
that the galaxy s7 edge is currently
priced at an even lower price point than
the galaxy s6 edge+ on certain carriers
and the debate is pretty much over if
you're scratching your head over and
already existing purchase of any of last
year's phablets don't our day-to-day
experience proves that these are still
great phones that are powerful enough to
compete toe-to-toe and if you're
debating over which one to pick right
now the galaxy s7 edge is the one we'd
recommend most
