and we are here in Berlin and Samsung's
unpacked event Episode two or it just
announced its newest flagship the creme
de la creme the Galaxy Note 4 which is a
phone that many of us have been looking
forward to and Samsung confirmed many of
the things that we've been anticipating
about this new Galaxy Note the design is
updated not totally redesigned like
Samsung is saying but it does have the
middle trim like we saw with the Galaxy
alpha and it also has those weird bubble
radius corners that we're not completely
sure about or sold on yet but being the
note this one also still has the leather
like back which is rubberized and around
front it pretty much looks the same but
the home button is now a fingerprint
scanner which we could have guessed and
the task switcher button has replaced
the old Menu button
other than that the display is the same
size but the resolution has been bumped
to quad-hd and it's still a Super AMOLED
panel so it's gonna pop and have really
deep blacks and just look good all
around and trust us it does pressure
sensitivity has also been bumped up for
the S Pen now to 2048 which is double
what it was before and higher than
pretty much anything else on the market
like it the cameras have also been
increased the rear camera is now 16
megapixels and it's smart OS so you do
have optical image stabilization there
instead of just software stabilization
and the front camera is a 90 degree wide
angle F 1.9 3.7 megapixel camera so
that's a really good improvement there
for front-facing cameras and taking
selfies and whatnot other than that
they're no radical changes inside you
get a quad-core CPU at 2.7 gigahertz we
imagine that'll be divided between a
snapdragon and an X and O's chip you get
Android KitKat onboard 4.4 3 gigabytes
of RAM 32 gigabytes of internal storage
and now you have a three thousand two
hundred and twenty milliamp hour battery
but it comes with fast charging and it's
supposed to charge roughly 50 percent
faster than before they were saying
roughly 50% in 30 minutes so that's
pretty impressive there are also some
changes here with the software
S Pen features have been upgraded so you
now have a smart select option which
will let you quickly add a
different screen captures together it's
very helpful and very useful and it's
very very easy to use and that's good
the interface has been kind of lightened
a little bit as well so we're very happy
to see that you know the widgets are
more transparent the task switching menu
looks more like Android L and all around
it's looking much better and much
cleaner but it's still not the
best-looking operating system out there
but it's it's getting there
Samsung is making an effort to make it
more like stock and that's a very good
thing the other thing is multi-window
it's been heavily changed and altered
and now you can go seamlessly between
having a split pane view and having a
floating window and dragging and
dropping and you can use your S Pen to
hold the back button to activate that so
you can you don't ever have to put the
s-pen down just to activate multi window
so so far we're very pleased with
everything we've seen the design is much
more like material design the foam looks
and feels better the internals are
better the camera is allegedly better
and it has pretty much the best of
everything across the board so if you're
an enthusiast looking for the best of
the best
Samsung believes this is going to be it
and we're inclined so far we can't say
for sure yet but so far this is a pretty
impressive handset the only thing we
would note is that it does not have any
sort of IP certifications that we saw it
will come in four different color
options black white gold and pink and
the metal trim around the edges will
match whatever color you choose so
there's a lot of cool stuff going on
here and we're really excited to get our
hands on with the Galaxy Note 4 for sure
so stay tuned for that and stay tuned
for more coverage here in Berlin at
Aoife with pocket now I'm Taylor Martin
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
