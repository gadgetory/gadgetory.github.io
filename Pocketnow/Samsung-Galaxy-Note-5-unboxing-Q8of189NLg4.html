choice for power users looking for top
shelf specs a great camera and a big
beautiful display this year's model
brings all those features and more but
it might not be for everyone this time
around I'm Hayatou Houston with
PocketNow bringing you a quick unboxing
of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 just like
the phone itself the note 5s retail
packaging is simple and elegant with
just a call out to the brand name and
storage capacity on the front and a list
of specifications on the back pulling
the phone out of the box and slipping it
out of its protective plastic sleeve
we're greeted with a 5.7 inch qHD AMOLED
display surrounded in an all glass and
aluminum casing underneath the phone
itself
Samsung has included the typical
documentation including a warranty guide
and a call out to some of Samsung's
other products they've also included a
sim ejector tool since you'll be needing
one to insert a nano SIM into the phone
though no microSD slot this time around
because the note 5 supports quick
charging and adaptive fast charging
wallboard is included along with a micro
USB cable and Samsung branded headphones
packaged into a familiar-looking plastic
box of course since one of the
highlights of the Galaxy Note series is
the S Pen Stylus replacement tips are
included as well to keep your writing
smooth for years to come with an
octa-core exynos 7420 chipset 4
gigabytes of ram and android 5.1.1
lollipop the galaxy note 5 is almost
undoubtedly going to be the phablet to
beat for the latter half of 2015 and
we're going to be bringing you
comparisons reviews and all the coverage
you'll need to help determine if this is
the phone for you this phone will
eventually be making its way to Michael
