pakka calm and today I'm going to a new
program that will allow you to learn
different languages on your windows
mobile device so this program will
actually teach you common phrases in a
few different languages so if I go down
here click on to and you can actually
see which languages you can convert from
so let's say you wanted to learn from
English to Spanish you can select
Spanish you have Portuguese Japanese
German French chinese simplified so
that's pretty cool and if I go into one
of them let's see I wanted to go into
the basics of English to Spanish and
just click on here load the lesson and
it will bring up simple phrases so if i
wanted to click here to learn hello and
click down here on this little volume
icon it'll say hola so then click next
and goodbye adios click Next again we
can go to another phrase so if i want to
say what is your name como te llamas
well apparently my Spanish is not that
great so I will need to continue with
this laying learner program so I'm going
to click OK to go to a different sub
category so if I was going to go eat out
i can click on this eating out here and
click load lesson this one says where's
the nearest restaurant and you can
listen to that if I didn't catch that
all the way I can click it again so we
can continue through the lesson and the
cool thing about this promes actually
shows you a picture kind of like rosetta
stone so if I just click next and see
another picture right here to coerce a
picture of a bar so L bar that's pretty
simple so just click next again and
let's try a different language let's go
back let's try um German so want to
learn the basics of German just click
load lesson hello okay click Next well
venus in ok apparently my German is not
that great either so
photo is free and it does only allow you
to use the first four of the language
lessons so we can only go to
conversations with the local on the free
version so this is liang learner and
stay tuned for more marketplace pics
where we review and demonstrate some of
the most useful applications on
microsoft mobile marketplace thanks for
