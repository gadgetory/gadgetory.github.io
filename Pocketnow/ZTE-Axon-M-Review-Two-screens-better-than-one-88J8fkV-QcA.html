ZTE this year instead of a follow-up to
the well-reviewed axon 7 we have an
interesting exercise in novelty the axon
M delivering dual screens on a hinge
potentially addressing a pain point for
some consumers a pocketable device went
on the go more screen real estate when
you need it the idea certainly has merit
large screen phones have surged in
popularity for their capability and
multimedia features an expandable foam
should prove even handier but the actual
execution of this idea isn't as simple
as just slapping a sometimes used second
screen on a regular phone starting off
with the hardware ZTE has done an
excellent job of addressing the problems
of dual screen devices where do you put
a camera where does the fingerprint
sensor live how do we simplify and
minimize the hinge you lose tremendous
gadget real estate when the back of the
phone is an active display even a
concept as simple as holding the thing
requires examination curved glass near
bezel assange are invoked but flipping
the second screen out means most people
can't hold the device from the sides
bezels serve a practical purpose here
where they look somewhat old-fashioned
in normal phone mode delivering dual
displays but avoiding a brand breaking
price tag meant dropping to last year's
specs you won't be paying for top-tier
performance against cheaper mid-range
errs you're paying for the raw
capability of more screen last year's
chipset isn't really a problem in daily
use in the Qualcomm 821 has aged
gracefully but we might be concerned for
the upgrade potential of year old
hardware as the market moves towards
more aggressive software and services
looking at the software on this phone we
see the next round of issues in
executing this concept Android and
Android apps are not as flexible as ZTE
s Hardware suddenly doubling screen
resolution many apps aren't able to cope
with the change ZTE solution is the best
possible fit a manufacturer could likely
arrive at this M button on your control
bar hides options
four single screen dual apps screen
mirroring and for the apps that support
it full screen view for my use dual apps
was a refreshing way to multitask
properly expanding on the split-screen
multitasking natively baked into Android
by contrast I found almost no use for
screen mirroring sharing a video with a
friend just felt awkward as if the phone
were a barrier between us compared to
just standing closer to share one screen
I was most disappointed by the
fullscreen view the option I wanted the
most even for the scene between the
screens there would have been
significant benefits to working on one
project with more space ultimately this
reminded me of the early days of LG's
split window view that you could only
use it with a handful of apps and we
were all doubtful that list would ever
grow the compromises of this phone feel
noticeable after revisiting the axon 7
audio for instance there's a poorer
speaker built-in and while headphone
quality is on par with the 7 it lacks
that amazing amp to really drive your
headphones mounted to the front face is
a competent if underwhelming camera
saving space for internals by only using
one higher quality camera instead of
bolting on an additional video chat
selfie shooter moving from normal
photography - selfie shooting is as
simple as flipping the phone around
though I was annoyed by some of the
small interface changes like different
flash options why have a different
selfie flash setting it's ultimately not
the phone strong suit anyway respectable
performance in very good light but
quickly falling apart in shade in indoor
lighting conditions and with two screens
the notion of protecting the phone
becomes more difficult I'm not the
biggest fan of glass pack phones but a
bumper case takes some of the edge off
daily abuse on the EMM cracking the back
glass means damaging another display the
ZTE offers this skeletal lingerie is one
solution but it doesn't inspire much
confidence to keep the phone dimensions
manageable the battery onboard is
adequate for a normal phone this size
the axon m's older chipset post slower
than average
members in our limited benchmarks and
using both screens unsurprisingly drains
the battery almost twice as fast between
app compatibility and the battery drain
that makes the whole design of this
device a sometimes feature like those
people who rarely use the S Pen on a
Galaxy Note a few folks who pick up an
axe on em might prefer using it expanded
almost all the time but I get the
feeling that significantly more people
will likely use it as a normal phone
only occasionally flipping the second
screen out the cost is high and the
compromises many for a feature that
can't quite reach main line use we all
want to celebrate ambitious moves
there are numerous foldable phone rumors
floating to the surface for 2018 and ZTE
beat them all to market this is a real
option people can buy today it offers
something truly unique in the smartphone
landscape and delivers it in the best
possible package for its time what we're
left with though are questions we can't
quite answer yet what do consumers find
lacking about their current phone is
this really the next phase of smartphone
and mobile computing is there a killer
app I just can't see here terrific
execution some solid potential but I'm
not quite sure the dual screen phone era
has truly arrived
