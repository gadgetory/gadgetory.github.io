expecting so much from the Galaxy S 10
oneplus has just launched a very
interesting roaming feature for your
oneplus six and the new bug has been
discovered in the Google of pixel three
that disables your camera I'm Jaime
Rivera and definitely Tuesday is deserve
a t-shirt I mean they're not as bad as
Wednesday's even from The Addams Family
but they're bad enough this is fogging
out daily sponsored by swap off the
official news today begin with teasers
for deals because Apple has just
announced that it'll have Black Friday
deals but the funny part is that there
were no deals actually announced instead
the company has pretty much told us that
we should expect deals on Black Friday
and that they will last for four days so
say your wallet says uh Apple's not
really famous for doing well with deals
now let's talk about oneplus as the
company has just announced its new
roaming feature that does not require a
SIM card and works on 1 + 6 devices
oddly unless we got something wrong on
listening I don't see the 60 on the list
probably it'll take some time for that
but yeah with the recent software update
that was recently rolled out in addition
to other enhancements that came that was
also included and well it depends on
each country and I still haven't been
able to see the price points but roaming
offered by an OEM that for me is awesome
I mean we saw with project Phi on Google
but alright I can't wait to see where
this is going now let's move the
spotlight over to Google since we're
talking about project Phi I mean there
are some new bugs reported on the pixel
3 where if you launch the camera
apparently you get a fatal error and
then you have issues launching the
camera over and over again and then you
have to restart your phone etc etc I
haven't had issues with that in my pixel
3 XL but it is really slow to launch the
camera which is a very odd for a Google
phone the company hasn't really chimed
in on what to expect or what but I'll
keep you posted now let's talk about
Samsung as obviously Galaxy S 10 rumors
are going to take the spotlight going
forward we've got some trusted sources
to pretty much confirm the things that
we've heard about that this place though
we've got three units coming up with
different display sizes but wait a
minute
according to the source it seems that
there are two devices at five point
eight inches diagonal one of them with a
flat screen the other with a curved
screen sort of like with the galaxy s6
and galaxy s6 edge of you remember that
both devices had the same screen size
and only curves on one in the other and
then there's a 6.2 inch display device
that's going to be the no holds bar very
and for those of you looking that are
looking for plus variants so this is
rather interesting I mean I didn't
expect two sizes of screen to be the
same we'll keep you posted but all right
let's talk about the hot news today
because in the same line of the galaxy s
10
we've got rumors from an even more
trusted source over the hot variant up
we just heard that apparently that one
is going to have a 6.2 inch display no
either there's a fourth variant coming
up or that hot Marion could have up to
six cameras according to the source four
cameras at the back two cameras to the
front what are they gonna do we don't
know but yes six cameras in addition to
a six point seven inch curved display
let us know in the comments I mean six
cameras what do you expect that thing is
gonna do I mean wide telephoto regular
and then what the other one is a depth
sensor I mean or shoot if they would add
monochrome that'd be fantastic think
that's more of a wall way in a lake of
thing so leave us a comment down below
