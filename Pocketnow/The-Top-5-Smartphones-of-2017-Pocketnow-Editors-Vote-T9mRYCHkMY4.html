ready to deliver our top five phones of
2017 produced through a secret ballot
sent to the editors at pocket now top
features best performance we saw some
surprising results especially from
manufacturers that had more than one
good phone this year splitting up the
vote we're not pulling any punches
here's our list of the best of the best
judged scored and ranked kicking things
off at number five pocket now editors
voted in the pixel to splitting up the
vote several voted specifically for the
smaller pixel over the XL this year more
confident in HTC engineering but
everyone on this team appreciated the
crazy fast performance stereo speakers
software and updates and the
crowd-pleasing camera processing google
is still finding their feet as a
consumer facing hardware supplier but no
one can fault their services and this
phone's performance it's no surprise
oneplus made the list this year at
number four the five T continues a
tradition of packing powerful specs into
a price friendly package a late addition
to the smartphone lineup in 2017 it gave
this company time to respond to the
market including some of those design
elements we enjoyed like the taller
aspect ratio display in a world of
thousand-dollar phones this is terrific
high performance bang for buck 2017 was
a fantastic year for specialist phones
and nowhere is that better exemplified
than in our tie for third place between
the LGV 30 and the blackberry key 1
while many phones claim to be general
consumer all-rounders these devices
focused in on specific audiences
blackberry wildly succeeded in
delivering a nostalgic throwback and
arrived with one of the best
communication devices of all time
LG tripled down on the V Series being
the premier multimedia content creation
platform which also lives in your pocket
for those who feel like the higher
selling mass-market solutions might be
getting a bit stale the specialist
market might be the way to go
and these two options absolutely nail
what they claim to deliver landing in
second place
Apple produced the single biggest iPhone
change since the phone originally
launched with the iPhone 10 this was no
small feat removing the home button and
fingerprint sensor transitioning a
well-established audience over to a more
gesture based UI all while moving the
industry forward on new technologies
like augmented reality better video
compression and better face scanning an
image recognition for anyone concerned
that this phone line was starting to
feel stale or that Apple was slipping
against more aggressive competition the
10 handily catapulted iPhones into the
modern smartphone era it's a tremendous
effort from the company that introduced
consumers to mobile phone computing with
a price tag to match taking the top spot
in our list this year the Galaxy Note 8
it's difficult to find a more complete
package than what Samsung delivered here
recovering from last year's issues far
more gracefully than we could have
imagined the note 8 blends gorgeous
design within everything in the kitchen
sink approach to the tech inside dual
cameras multiple security options fast
and wireless charging top-tier specs and
the best implementation of fine point
pen touch computing we've yet seen its
Samsung's complete vision for a
pocketable supercomputer and it
absolutely deserves all the praise it's
received and that's our list folks
plenty of honorable mentions this year
the may 10 pro pixel 2 XL and HTC u 11
all just escaping the final five one of
the more contentious votes we've had
splitting the points between Google's
pixels for example one editor genuinely
enjoyed the g6 better than the V 30 and
variations of the galaxy s 8 also
leached points away from the ultimate
winner
by contrast the 1 + 5 t faced zero
competition from the 1 + 5 and no one on
the team voted for the iPhone 8 over the
iPhone 10 did your phone make the list
who did we leave out for the honorable
mentions drop us a comment down below as
always thanks so much for watching on
behalf of the entire PocketNow team
we hope your 2017 was filled with techy
fun that you're getting to spend your
holidays sharing gadgets with people you
care about and we can't wait to kick off
2018 for the next generation of mobile
kit for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag
now some gadget guy on Twitter and
Instagram and I will catch you all on
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
