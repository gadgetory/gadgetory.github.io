even get news for windows 10 mobile will
translate goes real time with a bevy of
new languages and for those of you
waiting for the Moto 360 it seems that
were kind of close I'm hi Mary vera and
yeah I'm doing things backwards white
background with a green polo this is
foggy nowadays the official news today
has everything to do with Microsoft a
company is now rolling out windows 10 to
everyone the company started actually
rolling it out to some customers
yesterday because it wanted to keep
things low with the servers and
obviously not everybody is getting it
today because they want to keep the load
down but our real is already live so
make sure the description read what Adam
Lane has to say about Windows 10 other
news about Microsoft now talk about
windows 10 mobile Terry Myerson was
recently asked about what to expect for
windows 10 mobile and his response was
two things number one that we should
expect one to two hot Lumias by the end
of this year okay and then the second
thing is that apparently windows 10
mobile has already feature complete
meaning they all just need to iron bug
fixes and that should be it so expected
very soon it seemed other official news
have google as the company has now
launched a major update to its google
translate services for iOS and Android
and the cool thing is that that real
time deal where you point your camera at
something it'll translate what it's
looking at is now extended to 20 more
languages which is great news and
there's actually a really cool ad about
it the update should be rolling to your
device is very soon in addition with a
bevy of book fixes and other details as
will the spotlight over to Apple the
company has been really skeptical about
providing information on two things the
Apple watch an Apple pay they don't know
exactly how well Apple has so when it
comes to Apple pay but we've got some
very interesting analytics claiming that
Apple has found forty-two percent
acceptance when it comes to Apple pay
and that is according to a certain
survey of 500 users within a period of
about a month testing which is okay it's
interesting apparently eighty-four
percent of people are using it more than
once and then 70 something percent are
doing it online as well for
of Apple pay now what's most interesting
is that this trend is actually remain
the same for the last couple of quarters
so it's really hard to predictive it'll
get any better or if it will extend the
going forward we'll keep you posted and
finally for the very interesting rumors
of the day or should I say news for
those of you worried that the Moto 360
was not announced yesterday it seems
that the product is being geared for a
possible announcement at Aoife the
device is apparently already at the FCC
and should i say devices because
apparently there are three models of the
Moto 360 and the second cool deal here
is that it seems that the flat tire is
gone it seems that motorola or lenovo
has figured out a way to give us a full
circular display with moto 360 but
that's pretty much what the rumors have
it leads me to the question of the day
what would you change from the design of
the Moto 360 would you want to make it
thinner lighter other materials in my
case the only thing I would remove is a
flat tire and bring a better display but
I would love it as a you know Motorola
keeps the same design because I really
liked it leave us a comment down below
what would you prefer friends as always
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video is
still maturing full of argon out comment
subscribe changes channel as well and
follow me on Twitter hang out this
quarter iveta or on instagram at hi
never be better please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
high in that early then thank you very
much for watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
