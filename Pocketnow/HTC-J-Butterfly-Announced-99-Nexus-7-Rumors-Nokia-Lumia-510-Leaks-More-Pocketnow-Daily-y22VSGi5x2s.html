rumors of a $99 nexus 7 resurface and
the nokia lumia 510 makes the scene I'm
hi meri behna wishing I was living in
Japan right now seriously and this is
parking out daily
it seems as if getting a nexus 7 will
soon become cheaper than ever so hold on
to your wallets remember the rumors of
the 32 gigabyte model costing the same
250 bucks they currently pay for the 16
gig model well it seems that when that
takes effect the current 8 gigabyte
entry-level model will drop the price to
99 bucks and then the 16 gig model will
be somewhere in between so talk about
great competition ipad mini and hey
Black Friday will probably be the day
parts of the ipad mini keeps surfacing
just a couple of days before the
announcement this time we've got the
7-inch display available that we still
can't confirm if it is a Retina display
or not we've also got the battery that's
only got 60 watt hours and that's kind
of interesting because the current
generation iPad has 42 watt hours of
battery power and that's really not the
good news the good news is that
apparently it'll either retail on
November 9th or November second not sure
who to believe but stay tuned more nokia
devices hip rumor mill is we've got
photos of this some guy call them ugly
or whatever you want hitting picasa and
this is the nokia lumia 510 it's a
budget windows phone that runs windows
phone 7.8 the time of the photo was
taken it was windows phone 7.5 and it
does seem that nokia will continue their
budget minded devices to the market
though we're not really sure if that's
really good or deterring to the whole
Windows Phone brand you tell me in the
comments now some good and bad news it's
samsung galaxy s3 owners expecting
android 4.1 jelly bean the good news is
that if you're in Spain France Romania
or Austria you most likely already got
the update and if not well hit software
update now the bad news is that the
spokesperson already confirmed that
those of you living in the United States
expecting Android 4.1 jelly bean on the
carrier variants are going to be the
last ones to get it and it probably will
extend to 2013 so talk about some love
to the carrier's leave all your hand in
the comments down below please and
finally for the awesome news of the day
HTC has just announced their j butterfly
smartphone which is the same hdcd IX
device that was recently rumored it
packs that 5-inch 1080p LCD 3 display
along with a quad-core Snapdragon s4
processor and a beautiful just beautiful
design the device is currently exclusive
to Japan but it's expected to come to
the United States soon and that leads me
to the question of the day
what do you think about the HTC j
butterfly i honestly believe that this
is the device that HTC needs to get back
in the game so leave us a comment down
below what do you think now if you want
an earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
