official leaked photo shows an HTC one
mini in the works and the Nokia EOS
41-megapixel peer review smartphone gets
leaked and photos apparently I'm hi mera
mera and I'm using an 8 megapixel camera
to film this it's not 41 megapixels and
this is poking out daily let's start
your day off with some unexpected
product announcements blackberry and
AT&amp;amp;T have just announced their new q10
finally arriving to the United States
and as it turns out this is the same
phone pretty much it links down below
for full spec states and everything $200
after 2-year contract as well a typical
but there's also rumors of a blackberry
codename 810 happening in the fall and
apparently this will be the new flagship
to substitute the z10 so we're going
from A to Z and continuing on to another
weird product announcement Microsoft is
just made out look Artie official for
Windows RT and as with everything
Microsoft gets what's funny about this
announcement the problem is you can't
get it now you're gonna have to wait for
Windows 8.1 to be launched which is
happening later this year so I really
can't understand why this is being
announced why are they telling us that
they're offering outlook RT now when
we're not getting it until probably the
end of the year and that being said that
does mean that Windows RT will continue
sadly now let's talk a little about
nokia we've got some leaked photographs
of the probable eos elvis codename
smartphone that they're testing with
AT&amp;amp;T and this is pretty much looking
like a nokia lumia 920 only with a huge
hole at the back for the camera hump and
apparently this camera hump is kind of
interesting it's a full module but the
interesting part is that the leaked
photo of that full modulus proving to be
a fake so we'll keep you posted on the
news but so far it does seem like if
this product is real unless you actually
drill a hole on a Lumia 920 sadly and
moving over to HTC we've got some leaked
photos of an HTC One mini which is
completely unexpected i mean we thought
that the m4 codenamed smartphone was the
HTC Desire 600 that we heard about for
Asia
but as it turns out this mini is
actually better than that 600 I mean
it's got a 720p display it's got almost
every spec as the HTC One only that it's
smaller and it's got a dual-core
processor now obviously we don't have
any specifics as to when we will be
getting this phone but interesting we
are getting a smaller option of an HTC
one that has these in specs and a
beautiful design so stay tuned and
finally for the hot news of the day
Samson has just taken the wraps off the
samsung galaxy s4 active the ruggedized
version of the galaxy s4 and as it turns
out it shares almost everything except
some minor points in the design and
obviously you get a lesser camera here
being stuck at eight megapixels but this
kind of interesting because we're
expecting a samsung event to happen in
london in two weeks anton is going to
the event and then again what are we
going to see at this event if these
products are already being announced
already so stay tuned for that but that
leads you to the question of the day
galaxy s4 regular or galaxy s4 active
this question sounds weird but anyways
which would you prefer now that you're
getting an option to get both and my
particular case honestly I prefer
ruggedized phones I prefer to have the
peace of mind of knowing that if I
dropped my phone in a pool it'll survive
but leave us a comment down below what
do you prefer and of course for an
earlier scope of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tell the
