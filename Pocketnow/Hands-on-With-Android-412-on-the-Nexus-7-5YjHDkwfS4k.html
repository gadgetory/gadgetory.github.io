jellybean are running a version 4.1
point one recently we learned about an
update to the Nexus 7 that's getting
android version 4.1 point2 what's
included in it and what prompted the
change let's go take a look so this is
my nexus 7 it is of the eight gig
variety now i am running right down in
here you'll notice this is version 4.1
point2 and I cheated a little bit this
is a cyanogenmod 10 nightly in fact it's
the october eleventh version october
tenth and above they started integrating
the 4.1 point2 so google announced that
they were updating Android jelly bean
from version 4.1 point one which is what
most jellybean people are running to 4.1
point2 and that they were releasing it
out into the AOSP now this is just a
minor update so don't get too worried
about it it it improves performance
improves stability and has some bug
fixes that's about all that they're
saying now next thing that you're going
to notice here you go ready just like
that I can now go landscape now this is
not a cyanogenmod 10 thing this is an
Android 4.1 point2 thing so that's all
kinds of great and fun and nifty but you
don't have to worry too much about it
you're going to get it sooner than later
do you want to get it sooner than later
go ahead and come in here into settings
go down to about tablet if you weren't
running cyanogenmod 10 you'd have the
option to update right there and you
could get your update if you're in line
for it if you're not don't worry about
it you'll get it soon enough so why did
they do this is this just a bug fix
thing that they're pushing out no not
really there's a new version of the
nexus 7 coming out in fact it has a
brand new power management chip in it
again don't get too worried it's
functionally equivalent to the one that
you have inside your current Nexus 7
this new one however just needs a new
bootloader
and a new driver to handle it and take
care of it that's what the update to 4.1
point2 does now is this for the new 32
gig version of the nexus 7 we think so
is there a new sub 100-dollar Nexus 7
coming out maybe the eight gig version
is getting a price reduction I don't
know we can hope but that's where it
came from that's why it's out there and
you can see we're still buttery smooth
and all kinds of fun we'll have the full
changes in the git log link over at
pocketnow.com if you have gotten the
update let us know where you are and
what flavor the eight or 16 gig or maybe
you accidentally got a 32 gig version of
the nexus 7 let us know that in the
comments over at pocketnow.com as well
as when you got the update and we would
love to have that information so we can
aggregate it all together if you haven't
got it yet again hang out be patient
it'll be coming sooner than later if you
like this video please give it a big
thumbs up head over to pocketnow.com to
