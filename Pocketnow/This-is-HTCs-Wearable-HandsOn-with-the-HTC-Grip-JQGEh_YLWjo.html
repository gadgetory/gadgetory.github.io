an exercise companion either HTC calls
it a smart fitness tracker with GPS but
you'll call it the HTC grip I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is a
quick hands-on from MWC 2015 the grip is
the product of HTC's new partnership
with Under Armour with the latter
providing the phone side software and
HTC handling the hardware design and
manufacture the grip itself comes in
three sizes in a lime green and black
finish and it also includes sizing
spacers in the box for a more precise
fit it's a very rigid design with a
rubberized finish on the wrist it feels
less comfortable than say the gear fit
but more comfortable than the Microsoft
band HTC calls the grip water and sweat
repellent it's not designed for swimming
but with its ip57 rating it's tough to
see how you could drown the thing
it's fronted by a 1.8 inch
passive-matrix OLED touchscreen and
it'll last for 2.5 days on a single
charge or five hours if you leave the
GPS on that integrated GPS means you
should be able to leave your phone at
home and still track your workout though
without onboard storage you'll want to
at least pack a Walkman if you need
music for your run this is being
positioned as an athletic accessory
first and a phone companion second yes
it'll deliver notifications via
bluetooth just like most wearables but
the real focus here is on exercise
tracking with the Under Armor companion
app the grip promises a full profile of
your workout activity from walking to
running to lifting even to sleeping HTC
says the goal is to help people make
meaningful decisions about their fitness
by providing as much data as possible
though that doesn't include heart rate
tracking HTC says the technology isn't
mature enough to offer consistently
accurate measurements so it made a
conscious decision to omit it from the
grip it can pair with dedicated
heartrate trackers from companies like
polar though
the HTC grip will be compatible with
Android and iOS and it's slated to go on
sale in the US sometime this spring for
an SRP of $199 for more including a full
review by Jaime and Anton or someone
else on the team who works out more than
I do to stay tuned to pocket now in the
months ahead and be sure to check out
