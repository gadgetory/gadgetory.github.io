pocketnow.com coming up with the release
of the HTC touch diamond2 and Touch pro2
HTC will release a lot of new bits of
software such as the landscape touchflo
3d and the the new calendar and a lot of
other things too beyond the new devices
now we spend about eight minutes in a
video in our youtube channel at
youtube.com slash pocket now video and
I'll post a link on the video right now
so you can go back and look at that
but this newest rom from xda-developers
brings even more features from the
upcoming Touch pro2 and touch diamond2
that I wanted to show you in this video
for example the Start menu has been
changed so if I press on the start
button I am now taken to the HTC program
launcher instead of the ugly windows
mobile like you know iconic interface
and it's got very smooth flick scrolling
and we can add our own programs and
you're probably wondering what happened
to the regular Start menu well you
really can't get to it though if you
want to go to all programs you press on
this button here and we're taken to a
very finger friendly list of all of the
programs although this takes a little
bit of getting used to because if
there's a program at the bottom of the
page
that you want to get to you have to
flick all the way to the bottom but
unfortunately you can assign your
favorite programs here so that you don't
have to do that so we could you know
click Add there and we could flick all
the way to the bottom and add this item
here and there it is now what about
settings well if you press settings here
it doesn't actually take you to the
settings menu that you're used to to get
to that settings we have to or let me go
back here we have to go to all settings
and then we're taken to the standard
windows mobile setting interface
I think that's an S step too many and I
wish that there could be a link directly
to the settings menu of the main
settings menu from the screen but I
haven't found a way to do that yet
another change comes in the internet tab
so if we go over to the center here and
by the way these I'm gonna flip this to
landscape by the way the new version of
touchflo 3d will have push internet so
will it
precache pages so that you can access
them quickly without having them to load
meaning if there's a site you check
every day at 3 o'clock you can have it
reload itself every day at 3 o'clock so
it's ready there for you again we talked
about this on that 8 minute minute video
that I talked about earlier now what you
can do here is you can enter in a Google
search right from the screen so if we
search for you know HTC Touch Pro and we
click search and we'll launch Opera
Mobile quite quickly actually and take
you to the Google results page and from
here you can you know look on the
Internet and that's it for the tour of
the new ROM that comes from the HTC
Touch pro2 and touch diamond2 again I
encourage you to check out that eight
minute video that goes through a lot of
the changes it's the new touchflo 3d
such as the more advanced context tab
and the Facebook integration there's a
lot of good stuff there so we'll be back
with more later that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
