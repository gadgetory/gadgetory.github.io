and this is the software tour of the
AT&amp;amp;T Samsung propel Pro it should have
been called the blackjack slider for
obvious reasons but instead they went
with the name propelled Pro and we're
gonna take a look at the software now so
let's get a little bit closer to the
screen so here we have the standard
Windows Mobile sliding panel panel
interface which a lot of people like and
I like it a lot too it really helps to
put all the mainly used device functions
right at the main screen so you don't
have to drill into programs so of course
we have the time we can flip through
email or missed calls or voicemail or
text messages we can see our next
calendar appointment or make a new one
and we can change the profile
do other things like turn on Wi-Fi and
change the ringtone and things like that
from the screen now there are many
different home screens that come on this
device I'm actually gonna go through all
of them now and the way you get to them
is by going into the Start menu and
we're gonna go to settings over here and
we are at display home screen and here
are the choices for the home screens
there are many of them so we've sliding
panel which is the one we just saw
sliding panel media which will allow you
to play music right from your main
screen let's take a look at some of
these Samsung home screens see what they
look like okay so we've seen this one
before on other samsung devices and by
the way this is a email pop-up
notification I find it to be the most
annoying thing on the planet
I'll show you how to turn that off and
actually you can change the visual style
of the email thing basically it will pop
up anytime that you go back to your home
screen and the way you get rid of it is
by pressing on the home button there so
here we have Samsung's one of their home
screens and the way it works is that you
can flip through you can see missed
calls new messages how many emails you
have it's kind of like the sliding panel
interface just kind of condensed right
onto this screen so let's go and check
out the
second homescreen alright and this home
screen is called the Samsung pop-up home
screen and again that silly email
notification keeps coming up and the way
that this one works is that you
basically move along you can open
various programs or you can quickly go
to messaging or email or missed calls
you can go to your next appointment
again it's a very similar concept to the
sliding panel interface and the one we
saw previous to this just kind of
arranged differently and you can hide
everything if you just want to have the
date at the time let's check out that
other one okay this one's called whizz
pro and I think it's one of the more
usable home screens that is included on
this device so what we can do is we can
you know check our email check our
messages we can quickly launch a program
that we've opened recently or we can go
to the bottom here and we can go to
contacts and we can have people assign
their people that you call on a regular
basis we can go to over to the right
where we can see our calendar
appointments and we can kind of move
around on the screen this is actually
quite cool to the right of that is a
photo viewer and we can actually flip
through pictures this is really cool so
if you take a lot of pictures on your
device this is a good way to flip
through them if we go to the right we
have music and I don't have any music on
this device and if we go back to home we
are taken back to the the main screen so
this is probably actually the best I
think that Samsung has come up with for
non-touchscreen windows mobile device
home screens this is a keeper okay let's
move on let's go into the Start menu and
see what we have there
so we've standard stuff like messaging
we have all the typical AT&amp;amp;T stuff here
such as median at AT&amp;amp;T MA we have Ozzy
messenger so you can log into multiple
IM accounts at one time which is
terrific gps although you can use Google
Maps mobile if you like our windows live
my stuff allows you to see certain see
the files on your device going into
organizer we have usual stuff we have a
tip calculator what phone doesn't have a
tip calculator we actually have
something pretty cool here called IO OCR
which will allow your your device to
take a picture of text and convert it to
editable text so if you have a business
card you're taking a picture over you
see a news article it works pretty well
on will
more about this in the review we've
other things like stopwatch world clock
so that you can keep track of what time
it is in multiple places and of course
calculator and smart converter going
down the list we have applications and
in here we have Adobe Flash Lite we have
some Java based trial where you're gonna
hear me say that a lot through the rest
of this review we have this thus full
suite of office mobile programs which is
good
wiki Mobile which is a Java program
doesn't work terribly well on this
device if we go back we have games and
surprise surprise we have a lot of Java
based trial where all of these games
except solitaire and bubble breaker you
must pay for and 18t really likes to
include Java based trial where you would
think that when you buy a smartphone
they would give you the full version of
a game for free but no they're trying to
nickel and dime you never a fan of that
we have Microsoft voice command which is
good so you can talk to your phone and
say call Bob and you don't have to train
it and I put Skyfire on here because
internet explorer is not a good mobile
browser so checkout sky fire or Opera
Mini to get a better browsing experience
on your device ok so let's take a look
at the settings there are some settings
associated with the slider and some
other things let's go into there ok so
if we go into message ticker this is
that that's that annoying email pop-up
that keeps keeps coming up and you can
change the style of the notification the
idea here is that it's an in-your-face
notification when you have an email but
your phone will ring or make a sound or
vibrate when you have an email anyway so
there's really no purpose in using this
as far as I can tell here is slide
settings which will tell the device if
it should lock when you close the slider
which is a good idea and also for an
incoming call should you slide up to
answer the call or should you also press
the end the send key I think it's quite
convenient to have it set up so that you
just slide it open and you answer the
call immediately
this phone is video share which is a TTS
one-way video teleconferencing program
not many people are using it but this
phone is video share capable if
you want that to work now if we go into
key settings we can actually program the
keyboard to launch certain programs so
if we go to show list we can assign what
happens when you press function C or
function C what the other ones are
function H and so on so that's pretty
cool
one of the problems with this is that
you have to open up the keyboard first
to get or you have to slide open the
device first to get to the keyboard to
type function so you may bet it'd be
better off just having just going
through the Start menu to opening that
program that you're looking for so
overall I think the software on the
Samsung propel pro is actually a step up
from what we're used to seeing on a
teensy smartphone devices yes there's
still a lot of java-based trialware
but I'm really liking this new home
screen that allows you to kind of flip
through it reminds me of touchflo 3d
actually a little bit and how it it
arranges things by these these panels
and you can have favorite people or you
can look through your photos and almost
a 3d kind of way I think that one of the
best parts of using this device is the
taller screen as we mentioned in the as
we mentioned in the hardware tour the
screen is 80 pixels taller than a device
like the black jack and you can see that
visually here or if we go into certain
screens such as the settings screen you
can really get a feel for how how that
differs you can just see so much more on
the propel Pro than you can on the black
Jack thanks to this taller screen so it
really is helpful there coming up soon
is the full review of the profile Pro
where we're going to talk about battery
life performance and everything else
that we didn't cover in these last few
videos that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
