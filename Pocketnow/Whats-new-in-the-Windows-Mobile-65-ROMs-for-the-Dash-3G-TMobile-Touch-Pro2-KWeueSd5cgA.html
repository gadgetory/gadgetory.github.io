and i've got the tmobile touch pro 2 and
the t-mobile dash 3g right here and
they've both just been upgraded to
windows mobile 6.5 today Jeremy 15th the
new 6.5 updates have been released so I
will show you a little bit about what's
new let's start with the dash first of
all you notice there's not much of
anything new on the home screen go away
all this is same old same old but if
we're going programs you have a new
visual voicemail icon and my account is
not enabled but if I do this it won't
let me i have to you have to call in and
turn that on so i can't really try that
yet you also have a new internet
explorer it's the new 6.5 version it
automatically goes to full screen mode
all the time and you got to use your
trackball and you gotta press this
button to get the menus back that's kind
of annoying we also have
where are we we have a facebook app that
comes built in google maps still there
marketplace can download apps right
there you have a new messenger we have a
couple widgets amazon money and this in
weather take a look at that and you got
marks off my phone it's built for it in
now search widget not a whole lot of new
stuff all right just basically a 6.5
upgrade and mainly the same as 6.1 and
now let's look at touch pro2 so we see
same old blue background theme for
manila but now it's called sense we have
colored icons now and calendar says the
number of the day that's a good feature
welcome addition the internet tab still
not customizable but it now uses opera
as the default and it'll load operas
bookmarks I believe well maybe not
stock same as usual textures same as
usual
music time nothing new takes a minute to
load if you got a big playlist weather
has something new look at that this is
automatically locating me kind of and
getting the weather for that location
settings that's new programs same as
usual over here if we shut off my faves
like so and go back over here we have
Home tab and it's got the nice weather
as part of the clock however it is not
animated like other versions of sense
sometimes you get the whole animated
background with the HTC versions of the
windows mobile upgrade and got contacts
back when you shut off my favs then we
have the new start menu and for some
reason they got this purple background
here which is awfully different from our
blue sense UI and totally different from
this brown body that we have on the
touch pro 2 kind of odd color
coordination choices and we have visual
voicemail HTC calendar settings goes to
the settings page of Manila to get to
the real settings have to click all
settings down here and we have voice
command which now actually works see if
I set this to go to announce
notifications using bluetooth hands-free
it actually works now where as with the
previous roms it didn't because HTC put
this crazy bluetooth software on their
non-standard
version that introduced all sorts of
bugs and we also got my phone service
there that's new HTC calendar brings us
to the calendar tab of the Manila and we
have new Windows Live and new windows
live messenger some widgets and with
some weather amazon money internet
sharing is there of course contacts a
regular calendar bean is included is the
old bean the good one not the new one
that removes all your features facebook
is included in the rom google maps and
old variant of google maps mobile backup
your account for tmobile mo Desktop
Search Widget YouTube lots of the same
themes and some new things marketplace
of courses in there
so that's pretty great another thing
conference calling is still limited to
two people you got to use a registry act
to fix that here's our new lock screen
is nice but it uses this weird theme
from t-mobile that's all purple doesn't
match anything you still have your
weather in the calendar appointment
that's good
and the sense UI seems to take up about
ten percent more memory so I don't feel
like that and of course if we shut it
off
you can get
the other new windows mobile 6.5
interface and we free up about ten
percent of memory so there you have it
that's the new 6.5 roms from t-mobile
for the dash 3g and touch pro2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
