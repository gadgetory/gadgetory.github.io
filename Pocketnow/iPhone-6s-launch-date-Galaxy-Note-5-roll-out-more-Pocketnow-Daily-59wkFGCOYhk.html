success launch date and even a possible
five inch iphone LG goes on a trademark
spree this time with devices that
mention an edge and Google just decided
that an expensive Wi-Fi router is
something you need I'm hema to be better
on my way to five at least five Wi-Fi
routers for the price of one this is
pocket out daily the official news today
start with t-mobile and the galaxy note
5 or galaxy s6 edge+ if you want to skip
the free order window well t-mobile is
already offering the phone as of today
for orders and you can pick it up on
friday which is just another way to say
that this is just a shorter pre-order
but yeah the options there other
official news have google's
announcements of on hub a Wi-Fi router
that will be a smarter Wi-Fi router for
a crazy two hundred dollars if you
remember google i/o was all about
project brillo and weave and the
Internet of Things and well we've got
this router which will switch bands in a
smarter way and give you an Android
application to control it but then other
than that it'll just be a router and
then again you can get apples Airport
Express for a hundred bucks which is
still expensive you can find much
cheaper Wi-Fi routers but hey this will
be available on august 31st and let's
just see how cool it is whenever we get
it for review now how about LG the
company is currently on a trademark
spree for anything that has to do with
an edge so yeah they trademarked the
name g edge and dual edge and super edge
and just about everything that has to do
with edge except for my name but the in
addition to that we also hear the
company is working on bringing us a I
resolution SmartWatch at 480 x 480 and
resolution we don't know exactly what to
expect both things be it an edge or a
better SmartWatch but we will keep you
posted and for those of you that are
wondering exactly how well Apple music
is doing Eddy Cue set 11 million users
but that was weeks ago we've now got a
survey 5,000 people which is a small
fraction still something in the United
States ages 13 and up and they claim
that forty-eight percent of these users
are no longer using Apple music in
addition to that 61 percent of users
have already killed the option for the
is the auto renew so they are just
giving it a try for the trial period but
not really wanting to use it according
to the service or the surveyors it seems
that Spotify is so good that it was
really difficult for Apple to make a
dent they barely took thirty percent of
that market given though other sources
claim that it was more but anyways let's
see what happens in September when the
trial period is over and finally for the
hot news of the day this would be the
second time that we hear dates for the
iphone 6s when it comes to its launch we
heard that best buy was gearing up for
September 18 now we've got German
carriers preparing for except ember 18
though as it turns out it seems that
September 9 will be the announcement
date then we should see pre-orders on
September 11th at midnight and then it
seems that September 18th will be the
time when you will get your phone which
is interesting but even more interesting
we've got sources from Foxconn claiming
that there is a 5-inch mid-tier iphone
in the mix which is kind of late there
are tests conducted and things that
confirm there are only two iphones but
now it seems that there is a third one
that it's in the middle but interesting
the 4.7 inch model in 5.5 inch model
have the same specs this one has the
same processor and display but a lesser
camera so this could be the iphone 5c or
whatever but it leads me to the question
of the day when choosing the next iphone
if you will which model will you pick
when it comes to screen size in my case
i will stick to the 4.7 inch model
because 5.5 inches on terrible bezels is
not a good idea but leave us a comment
down below what is your case friends as
