and that we're big fans of the zoom
service at pocket now so now that we
have a kin to and the zune HD we thought
we would do a nice comparison but the
zoom features on both these devices so
come on let's check it out alright so
here we are with the King 2 and the zune
HD and we're going to start by looking
at the home screen so we have to swipe
to the left and then we can go to the
music and more on the kin to to open the
zune feature and now we're or a familiar
interface here pretty much exactly the
same except you see different menus over
here on the kin so you see videos
picture no pictures over here radio no
social over here podcasts settings so
you see there's some things missing
obviously pictures has another appt for
the kin but let's look at the radio so
that's pretty much the same we see
there's no back button on the kin to
because we have the back button at the
bottom and the zune HD obviously has HD
radio or as this one does not and if it
recognizes the song we have a add to
cart button so we can download those
songs right away so let's see what
happens if we go back to zune pass
oh this one has to connect the Wi-Fi
look at that see your card and there is
the song that we just added to the cart
it's going to see if we can find it this
one has one two hooks going for a
different song but there we are and it
looks like didn't find that song but
anyway if it was to find that song we
could just download it right away and
since the came to is a phone it's got
internet all the time I don't have to be
on Wi-Fi like I do with the HD over here
so there we go that's going to download
that album and nothing that's
interesting if I tap up here it doesn't
go back but this one does that's kind of
strange you have to use the back button
on the king so let's look at some music
very similar let's get back to albums so
that's how that looks I don't have as
much music on the Kin ours just tap over
there this doesn't seem to have the big
letters for navigating playlists the HD
has channels which we don't have on the
Kin songs are listed like that then we
do have the letters so you can navigate
very easily ok oh my god John Rah's
usual
so that's pretty good
let's see what we have for artist info I
tap the artist name
yep here you go we have a smart DJ
button on the zune HD which is awesome
we do not have it on the king so that's
unfortunate however we do have song
listings do have pictures same pictures
to have bio axis and related artists so
most of those things are the same now
again we got to do the back button
videos same difference
now podcasts will not show up on the Kin
until you sink podcast from the zune
desktop so let's see how that works
whoops a problem with that it's missing
and guess what kin has external speakers
and the volume controls work
you
let's play that to the thing
so unlike the zune HD which only has
just a railer button we've got a volume
up and down and that will bring up our
track listing as well as the play/pause
button and the forward or back and it
functions for volume which is great
let's get back out of here let's look at
the settings as you can see the zune HD
has a lot more settings and this is very
simple here on the Kin one thing you
notice on the cane it does not support
wireless syncing so you do have to plug
it into the USB port in order to sync
with your zune desktop so that's
unfortunate
one more difference between the king and
the zune HD is I can't pin my favorite
songs to this page if I tap and hold
nothing happens nothing happens over
here I can tap and hold and I can get
some options here and including penny to
my favorites listing that doesn't happen
on the king but that's okay we're pretty
close and definitely being able to
access the zoom past music is a huge
plus here's a here's the marketplace
zune HD has pics now which is going to
recommend artists based on my listening
habits whereas the Kin just loads and it
releases and one that if the verizon
network is working oh we're on one x
let's see if that works
there we go and we can you just press
the play button you can stream it right
away if you connects I guess we're on a
slow point
obviously the zune HD is going over a
Wi-Fi and we have a add to cart button
if i want to download that i just press
the add to cart and choose yes and then
i can download those songs to you just
notice the screensaver on the zune HD
the King does not have that capability
oh look at that I'm signed in with too
many zoom past camps that's why it's not
downloading oh well that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
