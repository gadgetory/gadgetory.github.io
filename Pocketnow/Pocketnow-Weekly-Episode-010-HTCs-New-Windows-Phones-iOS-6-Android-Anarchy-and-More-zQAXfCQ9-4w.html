weekly hello and welcome to episode 01 0
or episode 10 of the pocket na weekly
the once-a-week podcasts from
pocketnow.com we discussed news and
opinion from the world of mobile
technology tablets convertibles hybrids
smartphones lots and lots of smartphones
I'm your host Michael Fisher senior
editor at pocket now and I'm joined as
usual by editor-in-chief Brandon minimun
good morning to you hello there and our
semi regular companion the man from the
desert regions Jolie by the android guy
good morning to you good morning um guys
how are we doing today I'm tired I went
first it's two hours earlier here so you
don't have any excuse doesn't have the
Sun is just coming up he's a wonderful
working morning yeah that's right Joe is
joining us from a from a different time
zone as always and we're recording a
little earlier than usual so Joe is
definitely the the MVP of the of the
morning hours how about you Brandon how
are things down there and PA good and uh
you guys were talking about being tired
and I was going to say well oh I had my
coffee and I promised myself growing up
and hearing my parents say that every
morning oh don't talk to me to know my
coffee that I would never be that guy or
one of those adults that says you know I
need have my coffee before I can talk to
you in the morning but I traumatic yeah
miraculously turned into one of those
people so I'm feeling energetic because
I had my coffee isn't that incredible
how that happens you just become the
thing you said you never would yeah I
didn't get the coffee bug until I was
like good till I moved up to Boston
actually I didn't I never drank coffee
in college and now it's like it's just a
necessity of all day long so as today's
podcast gonna be all about coffee talk
and coffee to our
welcome to sell Quanah you guys are so
funny we add know we had a ton of news
this week and we have to get to it
before we do though I there's even news
that we didn't get to which I'll get to
when we get to it LOL i got that stupid
sentence ya know there's there's there's
so much stuff that that happened that we
need to talk about but before we do that
Brandon you have a you have a window
here to speak about what you will thank
you for providing you through later wow
so I wouldn't I want to do something
involving all three of us and a little
bit of role playing a role playing why
was he got iOS 6 yesterday like the rest
of the world and after installing iOS 6
is very anti-climactic if i said that
right like i look at my phone says
welcome to iOS 6 i'm like yes I've got
iOS 6 this is great a new version of the
operating system I swipe through some
screens I sign into itunes or whatever
iCloud and then I'm get I get back to my
home screen and it looks exactly the
same except this time this time there is
a new icon for passbook which by the way
doesn't even work it links to the to the
apple store and nothing happens when you
do that and and I think to myself what
about all of those other people then
stall iOS 6 maybe they're not upgrading
to the iphone 5 don't they want
something different maybe Apple should
have added a new wallpaper to say hey
something's new here or maybe tweak the
dock a little bit to say hey we spent a
long time on this we know that you were
waiting for your yearly software update
and here's what's new mm-hmm okay so the
average user you know doesn't really see
anything different and then they start
using some of the apps they see maps a
little bit different that the advanced
more advanced users will see that
settings have been updated with more
settings there's do not disturb there's
a 200 very little features and so
inevitably this is gonna catch up with
apple and they're going to have to do
something big for maybe iOS 7 or maybe
iOS 8 who knows and so I thought it
would be fun if we do a little bit of
role playing I will be Tim Cook Jojo you
can be Phil Schiller and and Michael you
can be Scott Forstall and we're going
go into a conference room and we're
going to talk about iOS 7 we're planning
for iOS 7 where we're gonna release it
in about a year and we we want to make
sure that we do something different this
time so that people like me and the
average user doesn't get disappointed
when they hit the hit the Update button
for iOS 7 so this is this is exactly the
cut the type of scenario I did not
foresee when it went when giving Brandon
the the floor this morning I am happy
that you're keeping me on my toes this
is great and I I don't I I don't want to
do this kind of poking fun an apple I
want to seriously have a discussion
pretending that were these guys on what
we can do to make iOS 7 different and
and and iterative not not it iterative
but something that's a true revolution
so all right so just just to serve
everybody knows what's going on Tim Cook
is the CEO of Apple obviously Scott
Forstall is the is the what here's the
Mac os10 and iOS 5 he's just the I the
iphone software guy is he okay all right
yeah cuz I saw it like I don't watch the
videos usually I just read the live
blogs or sometimes we write the lab I
was like okay okay cool and then um Phil
Schiller of course is marketing head of
marketing yes and those bits don't
really matter i mean you know the
marketing guy can talk about iOS
software and but you know just for ya so
i'm going to start off and I'm gonna say
gentlemen the reviews are in of iOS 6
and people are tired of the same old
stuff we need to do something big for
iOS 7 what are your thoughts widgets we
got to do wits finally after after seven
revisions we got to do wits everyone
loves widgets maybe gadgets we can't do
widgets android is widgets where anti
android we want android to be destroyed
we're gonna sue every company until
there's no android left and we can't go
and do what they're doing so we just
don't work they slow down the user
experience unless we can do the
difference well maybe there's a way to
do them differently maybe we don't do
widgets on the home screen the hood the
springboard is something that people
still like maybe we do widgets and we
call them something different like
enhanced
apps or mini apps and we put them in
that notification shade that we have
been using all that all that well up to
this point you know they're they're
accessible on demand we can drag it down
from the top at any point you can see
glanceable information there and then
when you're done you send the
notification shade away and there's your
there's your familiar springboard what
do you think about that well by gadgets
I gadgets oh yeah I gadgets nice write
it down write it down the problem with
putting them in the notification shade
is that for those that don't clear out
their notifications you'll get an
infinitely scrolling notification list
that's full of I I gadgets and a
shortcut to tweet and to add a facebook
status and then you get all your
notification so it's just gonna get too
long I don't think we can put a little
guys we can put it there we just have to
come up with a method that can
automatically figure out which ones are
relevant which one's the user wants and
then we can patent that and then we'll
sue everybody who tries to copy it I
like that that's actually a pretty good
night so give me an example uh Phil how
would that work I have no idea I'm just
the marketing guy oh well that falls to
me and software there well i think you
know algorithms you know we can we can
write some algorithms i can use some
fancy buzz words here and see how that
goes no I'm not really a software guy
III think that that is a solid idea
though there are ways to list the things
by order of priority Facebook does it
all the time whether it does it well or
not is up to you to to say but I mean
you know I generally get news only from
the people I care about once Facebook
actually learned who I care about
reading the news from I think it's
similar thing to be done with the
widgets in the notification tray so Phil
a new a new API maybe where for example
the New York Times could start to you
could you could specify your preferences
what kind of topics you like and when
news hits you get a brief in the in the
notification tray that shade or whatever
we're calling it so that so that you
know it's it's just like saya you know a
new iphone remote that doesn't make
sense well right whatever it is yet no I
you know what but I think there's an
even better way to do it I don't think
there need you need to specify it I
think we can say to people with the
phone will know you
like you know like Google does with
their that cards thing that nobody uses
and that just went down last night but
you know it's still that's intuitive
that tells you what you want to know
even though you didn't tell it what you
wanted to know because it takes all the
information from your interaction with
the phone and then extrapolates I think
we can do that yeah we got to be careful
though because the more the phone knows
about you the more creepy it's gonna
seem so we got we gotta watch that
creepy FAQ and make a good point there
Phil series not creepy at all so I
understand where you're coming from well
she sounds creepy but we meant for that
oh right right right that was my first
serie to ya ok gentlemen this look this
is a great idea i like this notification
thing but we have to figure out what to
do about these icons and and the look
and the feel of just the operating
system when you when you just are on the
main screen how can we differentiate
here how can we do something more useful
than what we have now make him round hey
come around we did yes if you can get
the ipod team in here they know how to
do that we tried that but our uh you
know fifth fingers aren't exactly ground
there if they're slightly they've
rounded edges that's why i'm trying
listen triangles bid that's probably the
worst interlocking hexagons has anybody
done that before oh that that's awesome
i bet the fingerprint fits into a
hexagon perfectly and then it wouldn't
be agreed anymore it would be something
no one could find anything on it would
be great thanks for products that
Microsoft guys tried that with windows
mobile 6.5 eggs we see what I see what
happened with that Reich's eggs means we
could do it better that's right to the
opportunity we first were just be better
it's fine no at all seriousness I have
no idea what to do this home screen
really I don't know I i I'm at a loss
for how to change this sufficiently that
it's more useful but not change it so
much that people will be immediately
lost because people value simplicity
that's why we build this thing right
that's why we sell that's why we sell
two million pre-orders in like a week
don't we sold two million pre-orders in
like an hour yeah yeah yeah I was being
modest Phil but you're right okay second
instance
here's what we're gonna do for ios7
we're gonna change the App Store icon to
be a little bit more a little less shiny
and the Safari icon instead of pointing
to the northeast it will point to the
southeast and the music icon wait wait
wait I got something on that one let's
make the Safari icon has nothing to do
with navigation let's make that needle
point the direction you're looking let's
turn it into a real compass and and
while we're talking about icon
customization I just want to make sure
we're all in the same page here boys
we're not doing a damn thing with that
weather icon right that that's staying
at 73 degrees all the time 73 degrees
and sunny it's that's we got ya good we
got to do that just got you may be
nervous they're all right good anyway uh
anyway that was fun one thing I won't
think I do want to say I once heard an
idea I don't know where I read this but
someone had this idea where each icon
and the weather i gots perfect example
should be live information kind of like
Windows Phone 7 but so for example if
you had a new facebook message your
facebook icon would transform into like
um some tau a mini preview or a symbol
or something but the problem with that
is if you have all those dynamic
information on your home screen it
becomes really busy really fast and it's
very anti apple yeah I mean it's it is
Windows Phone like you and that's great
that's that parallel is tiff tough not
to draw if you're thinking about making
those icons literally animate meaning
change all the time and that is probably
the number one thing that drives me nuts
about the windows phone interface if you
can take an icon that represents weather
and do that without putting on what
you'd expect to be actual weather data
great do that and keep it static but if
you're gonna represent actual weather
data 73 degrees and sunny you don't have
to animate the icon you just have to
have it get updates every however often
you want it to be once an hour once
every three hours whatever to reflect
the actual information the calendar you
only have to do the calendar icon once a
day and have that represent the actual
state but not animate not be flashy not
be distracting just elegantly simple
well I don't know if I mean
course and it comes down to what you you
know what your preferences are as far as
whether you think windows phone is it
does that an interacting way but I see I
see what you mean what does that do to
system load to I mean give you of all
these icons animating all the time I
feel like that's been apple's big excuse
right where they're like we're not going
to do that because it slows down
performance and we really really need
this thing to perform well you know is
that like still a thing in this era of
ridiculously souped up handset hardware
well you can dynamically create an image
relatively simple speaking as a
programmer now that doesn't take much to
do so creating an icon on the fly isn't
going to take much resources especially
if you're not doing it every minute
you're doing it every hour and then
you're just updating that icon and
refreshing the screen that I can't see
how that would add any more overhead
especially not that some new fancy a6
processor is not going to be able to
handle real easy for you r and you're
not doing them all you're only doing the
ones that are on the current screen now
of course you can swipe to other screens
full of grids of icons very easily but
your first priority is the one that's on
the screen that you're looking at right
now and everything else can be
background processes that happen
whenever it's got time to happen it
would be it would be very nice so either
of you think we'll actually see this but
that wouldn't win iOS 7 rolls around
about a year from now I think we should
patent it Brendan you've got a patent
guy maybe um well I mean they have to do
something because I like it's getting
almost exhausting now um for I think
even the most devout users and you know
you look at the sum of the viet the
iphone websites out there you know sites
at all about the iphone and iOS and
they're expressing fresh I mean they're
their defense of the simplicity thing is
becoming less and less effective as as
you know Android jelly bean is extremely
smooth extremely fast windows phone
continues to get better and iOS kind of
just standstill yeah yeah and that I've
made that point like so many times in
editorials that I've written
particularly even one just just this
morning that went up that like I'm just
so tired of saying it and
you know it would be nice just for Apple
to actually do something to be
revolutionary again I feel like it's a
very complacent OS and you know I
haven't updated yet I'm still running
iOS 6 beta because I just don't you know
I the other platforms that I run that
helped me in my day-to-day life are more
useful to me and that are more
interesting because iOS has been so
static for so long so I'm reminded of
the the galaxy s3 commercial and I know
we'll get to this a little bit later but
we're the guys in line they're like wait
a minute you were here last year you
have a galaxy s3 why are you here oh I'm
just holding with my place in line for
oh hi mom and dad here you go Oh iOS
sick bro s of your parents I have not
actually watched that commercial yet so
that sounds awesome now all that
commercials hilarious they're fabulous
flurries well let's uh I do want to Joe
Levi the android guy we I want to talk
android with you some more but let's get
this stuff let's cover some stuff that
you're not typically a not typically
vocal about first because it's been a
big week for Windows Phone you're going
to be able to hit handle this one huge
week yeah mess yesterday we saw HTC sort
of rekindle their their relationship
with Microsoft in a very public way by
announcing the Windows Phone rights
let's get this right the windows phone
8x and 8s which are its first Windows
Phone 8 models and the devices are
actually called the windows phone 8x and
8s not just the 8x and 8s that is a
right that apparently HTC had to
negotiate heavily with Microsoft to
secure the right to use the platform
name and the hardware I think it's
pretty confusing and really not
necessary yeah Brandon was there for the
unveiling hey Michael you running that
Windows Phone 8x or any of them are you
running the Windows Phone 8 s the
windows phone 8x well I run Windows
Phone 8 what why is Windows Phone 8x
better well it's got a better camera
wait what the what you mean the platform
is it has a better support for the
camera what do you mean now
does phone 8 I got 8 X and I got a
better camera well how do I run a tax
you gotta go buy it I gotta go bye but
Duke i just downloaded ah see here's the
problem it's it's I you know I was
sitting next to Adam yesterday if he had
the HTC press event I kept jabbing him
every time that you know I winced when
Steve Ballmer came on the stage it kind
of became a little bit more serious and
when Peter Chao was on the stage because
you know no whoa hang on Steve Ballmer
came out and it got more serious I know
that stopped me too it was like what no
I'm sorry I just had to stop for me to
go ahead go ahead it was you know it was
it was an all guns out at kind of event
and it's kind of weird because we saw
that with Nokia and um and to hear that
that these HTC windows phones would be
the signature windows phone devices what
are they talking about what about nokia
is Microsoft pulling a fast one over
nokia are they are they being what's the
word when you put it off yeah that yeah
are they are they being that it's it
sounds like nokia was surprised about
this which is you know yeah because no
nokia came out like not very long after
the release and issued this for this
statement of their own they're like yeah
we're very happy to welcome a new member
to the Windows Phone family right behind
the Lumia line and it's like wow all
right so yeah I think they were caught a
little bit off-balance there and this
that you bring up another interesting
thing Brandon this kind of in addition
to the windows phone 8 device branding
there they're being called Windows Phone
8 signature devices what does that mean
I mean we have signature windows devices
on the desktop right what does that mean
it does it actually mean anything I
don't think it does it you know and
here's here's a great point if you go to
Windows Phone calm right now these
signature devices are front and center
and then they then and then the 900 the
920 isn't even on the front page and
it's just so weird to me it's almost as
if Microsoft took advantage of Nokia but
but then again you know
HDC is right when they say they've been
partners with Microsoft for 12 years I
mean that that doesn't really matter
that was like almost in another life in
a different world and and you know it I
don't think that that counts for very
much well as Bobby said it for loyalty
them you know yeah but then you got you
have samsung making some pretty good at
making it pretty good windows phone 8
device and um and and what's what's also
feels and smells really weird here is
that HTC is what's the word they're
they're putting their brand second or
even kind of third behind the Windows
Phone and Microsoft brands yeah yeah
it's not the new it's it's a device by
HTC like it's a windows phone there's
first brand 8x there's a second one x
HTC that's the third one and it makes
HTC look very weak and it makes me
wonder like you know HTC has followed on
some tough times lately and are they
getting that tough to where they're like
yeah we'll just keep the HTC Brandon
afterthought or or did they see it as
sort of a strength uh you know I think I
think it's a very complicated situation
you're absolutely right HTC is not as
healthy as they've ever been certainly I
think they are really need to look at
the marketplace and you know find ways
where they can kind of stand out there
having a hard time doing that in the
Android space obviously the 1x kind of
got its milkshake drunk by the galaxy s3
so you know we're looking at this is
this new platform which which is still
kind of a wild west frontier Windows
Phone 8 is brand new the adoption rate
for windows phone 7 wasn't very good so
but you know there is still 40 something
percent of users out there who are not
on smartphones globally so I feel like
HTC is maybe betting on the fact that
Windows Phone is going to be successful
in capturing some of that and they
really want to stake and early claim in
this Windows Phone 8 space and I do you
think that this device is enough to do
it Brandon you had your hands on it Joe
of course leap in at any time but I mean
Brandon you handled it in your hands on
video what did it feel like well first
what do you guys think about the
hardware I'm just looking at the
pictures I mean you you might have heard
you might have heard that that
uh that HTC really talked up this design
they before showing it they refer to it
as a new iconic design when you guys
think of iconic designs can name some
phones that are truly iconic the Lumia
excuse me the m9 yeah 19 totally which
is just like the you know 920 and uh you
know different from the 820 but you know
it's got that different kind of sliver
design you know what else the iphone
galaxy s3 would probably be iconic even
the g1 or the the nexus one it's
something that represents the entire
family of of that phone mmm yeah not
just you know not just HTC not just
Android but all of that line you're not
just iPhone but well that's probably a
bad example not just windows phone but
of all the others here is the one that
when you think of this is where you
immediately go okay so that's
interesting so an iconic design carries
sort of a message like this marks
something that happened oh and the
design is pretty cool and unique too
yeah I mean yeah I think iconic is is a
really um I mean what's what is the
actual definition of the word iconic of
relating to her having the character of
an icon yeah thank you having a
conventional formulaic style used of
certain memorial statues and busts yeah
so like yeah defining a category right
yeah i agree i think joe joe said it
best yeah and and you know and then they
and then they talked about the they
really ran a video and now it's on
youtube about the painstaking design
process of the 8x and 8s cool video too
yeah i mean the very aspirational
quality to it very you know tugging at
the heartstrings of geeks everywhere i
like their video it was a good video and
you know I I think those videos are
becoming less and less effective because
every company comes out with a pretty
corporate video with a moving sound song
in the background right so so when they
were talking about you know phones are
looking the same they look but you know
I'm like yeah they all look like slabs
they veer pieces of the top cameras they
have cameras on them but they all do
look the same because always so many
ways you can make got a phone and then
they then they show this phone that
looks exactly like all other phones
they did do some cool stuff with it but
i think the 8x and a little bit less so
the 8's look a little bit generic to me
well and and i think wait wait less so
that's what i was going to say I think
the 8x this is kind of a symptom of a
larger problem that like small phones
have become you know smaller phones have
become kind of the ignored second-class
citizens the world and manufacturers are
afraid to take their big ass excuse me
and take their big headlining phones and
take a risk with them design-wise so
they'll make the 8x which kind of looks
generic next to the 8's which has this
kind of cool color band and these inset
alternating colors on the earpiece and
the camera bezel and like the 8's just
looks so much more unique to me than
anything else I see especially the 8x it
makes the 8x look almost fuddy-duddy you
know by comparison what he does he I saw
that saw that word in a review of the
Richard Gere film unfaithful and I've
been wanting to use it for 10 years
you're welcome yeah yes yeah that's
that's a really apt analysis I've been
wanting to use that word since I saw it
on the office guys a bunch of Dreams
being realized on the Pocket not weekly
this week's it's great yeah uh yeah but
that's a good point they were more
experimental with the aid s it's more
they call it a font more fun phone and
it is unfortunate that they downgraded
the specs for that I mean yeah but you
know what's interesting about the 8x is
that the screen is not that big it's
only 4.3 inches right right which is
which is hilariously the new small right
like 4.3 inches is now the low end
that's amazing but still isn't all that
small no it's historically okay so
something I gotta get off my chest
please um windows mobile way back in the
days you even in Pocket PC and whatnot
those were all relatively corporate
devices if your enterprise was running
an exchange server and you had Microsoft
apps in house chances are you were going
to be issued a Windows Phone device and
it was very tightly integrated with
exchange in your contacts and all that
stuff for us end-users and I was an
user who jumped on that bandwagon I
didn't get all of those benefits of
having an exchange server the devices
were utilitarian they were professional
looking they kind of carried forward
with what you thought of Microsoft adds
just this big corporate entity move
forward to where that kind of became
irrelevant you've got the iphone which
comes in two colors and one form factor
essentially you've got android which is
all pretty much the same you can either
get white or you can get black and the
they're just kind of understated but
they don't look out of place you know a
boardroom table and then you've got
windows phone and every Windows Phone
that I can think of at least is brightly
colored it's got bold designs the
weather the bezel is is brightly colored
or the the display itself is brightly
colored you know themed in blues or reds
or whatever it just doesn't seem
corporate anymore yet this is what is
supposed to fill in the gap at those you
know those big corporate people if you
will that they're going to be issuing to
all of their employees and I'm sorry I
love how they look I just don't expect
to see these around the boardroom table
or even at a meeting of executive
officers or you know people on down the
line they don't look professional they
don't look like I'd expect to see
someone who gets paid way too much money
to have sitting on the table they look
distracting in that circumstance I I
envision this guy sitting at a lunch
business lunch and he's like I was about
to acquire your company but then you
took out your purple Windows Phone and
the deals awesome well you know and it's
it's funny I haven't thought about this
argument in a long time but you're right
you're right Joe and this is something
that people think about I would get so
flummoxed in like message board
conversations when people would bring
this up you know and they'd say well how
am I going to bring this phone this
phone is fun whatever but how am I gonna
bring this out in a boardroom nobody's
going to take me seriously and it's been
so long Reed never that I've been in
like a corporate boardroom environment
that I never think about this stuff but
you're right if windows if Microsoft
wants to position windows phone is this
sort of
yet yes consumer thing but also maybe
this blackberry replacement thing which
I think a lot of us maybe want microsoft
to be trying to do but maybe they're
actually not trying to do that then yeah
then this kind of multicolored approach
that HTC and nokia are taking is not
really going to be the way to go but
there i made the point yesterday one of
my pieces that this color blast in
Windows Phone is actually somewhat rare
I mean the initial blast of Windows
Phone 7 handsets were all black or grey
they're boring it wasn't until nokia
kind of came into the scene and we're
like yeah hey check it out color and
then HTC arguably came along and was
like us to check it out you know what do
you guys what do you guys think about
color like do you want a black or white
phone or do you want your favorite color
in your in your phone ever since nokia
dropped that cyan on the 800 or the n9
then the 800 and the 900 I've been in
love with color I I used to value black
phones when silver phones were hip and
then I went the other way no I prefer
color now what about you Joe I'm looking
at your article right now and checking
out the phone 8s and I'm seeing the
black phone with a blue stripe on the
bottom and the the kind of light grey
phone with a yellow stripe on the bottom
yeah I'm thinking hey this is great
we've got what first responders and then
we've gotten mad people and maybe the
Red Cross yes and traffic cops there you
go it actually looks like European cops
not mention that but know what I think
we need to do and and I like the colors
personally i don't think i'd probably be
as bold i recently pre-ordered a pebble
watch yeah uh through kickstarter and i
had the opportunity to pay an extra 15
bucks to get one of their fancy colors
and i was tempted for a minute to get
orange and then for a minute to get gray
and i just said you know what it's a
watch it give me a black rock that's all
I won't yeah me too yeah so color i see
is customization so let's go ahead and
move technology forward to to full
screen displays where we go all the way
to the edge with the display and then we
can customize our displays how
over we want we can get our blast of
color there and then let's have
accessory back plates that are different
colors different designs so that we can
customize that and truly make it our own
rather than just saying my phones the
big bold red one sitting on the table
over there is that a thing like do
people still do the backplates thing
because i know nokia is doing it with
the 820 I mean do people still like buy
back plates and do that thing like it's
like it's you know 1999 or is that is
that just something companies wish they
did do we have any tighter I do it I
don't know if I would do I never liked
the back plate thing I mean it's it's
really frustrating if you have to buy
them i mean if the 820 came with four
color black babes back plates that would
be awesome you know I'm not much of a
fashionista but I did you know I'd
consider matching a badly to what I'm
wearing her you know on a hot night a
hot date with my wife um but uh I I
think I love that idea of switching the
back plate and the way that 820 does it
it's not like a cheap way of changing
the back but there's been some HTC
phones where you could change like some
color part of it but it wasn't really it
was just like snapping a thing in place
piece of plastic but 820 is like hey you
can take off the entire back literally
and put put a new one yeah I like that
and you know if you could build an NFC
chip or something into it to say hi I'm
colored yellow right or I'm this special
design and you could unlock a theme for
the front of the phone oh now that would
be awesome well an HTC tried to do some
of that on the software side some of the
stuff you're talking about Joe like I
think they tried to match like windows
excuse Microsoft gave them access to the
colors in Windows Phone 8 and they tried
to match their software colors to the
casing colors as best I can so when you
take like the yellow one out of the box
like it's pre-loaded you know to display
yellow yeah I don't know i mean i think
that's cool i think that's one of those
little things but they also
differentiate it on some other some
other things like brendan you heard the
speakerphone be with the Beats Audio
like there's a new amplifier Beats Audio
I think always featured a hardware
amplifier for the headphone jack but
then there's a separate one which is
either 2.2 volts or four volts I don't
remember for the speakerphone and in the
video you really can't hear at brenner
but you said it was like the one of the
louder speaker phones you'd heard
it's it well it was the loudest
speakerphone I've ever heard and I wrote
in my editorial but it kind of sounded
like the HTC surround but probably
louder and better it was really
impressive I mean it's a you know if you
put an amplifier and a phone it's gonna
it's gonna probably be the biggest use
of battery power of any other phone
function right um so you'll probably be
able to get through three songs but it's
cool i mean that's dad's dad's
innovation that's something different
and new that you don't see anywhere else
are we ever gonna see a vacuum tube
inside one of these phones just go over
those audio files for those for those
nights you just need the warm glow of
the old-fashioned radio lulling you to
sleep well high-end computer
motherboards for audio files are coming
with vacuum tubes on them for for better
sounding audio god they think we'll ever
get a vacuum tubes small enough that we
could get that same rich quality in a
phone be a sippy strong right yeah I
figured that would that's gonna be like
whoever virtue gets sold to that's gonna
be there next differentiator it's like
here's your ten thousand phone running
android two dot one but it has a vacuum
tube it's good with vacuum tube what
else are they what else is HTC doing
here just on the on the 8x and 8s they
got the beats and there we don't know if
it's the same exact camera module as on
the One X but it is the same image sense
chip or the image trip and the image
sense kind of firmware on that that
wasn't that was another time I I poked
at him and I rolled my eyes when they
said we've brought the acclaimed well
received and highly regarded image sense
technology from the 8x and we've put it
in the eighth and the 8x and I'm like
well ya know that would be great if that
was actually a good thing that the thing
they did that was actually cool with the
camera is that the front facing camera
is wide angle and that it really makes a
difference and you know it's a typical
scenario where you hold your front out
and phone out in front of you and you
take a picture of you and the people
that you're with and this this
tremendously improves the functionality
the front-facing camera I was really
impressed by it yeah I I was impressed
not because I care about the
front-facing camera because I never use
it I almost always forget it's there but
because someone a manufacturer looked at
this thing that no one looks at that no
but
cares about and they were like yeah
we're gonna do something different check
it out here's not only a higher
resolution and which is just a lazy way
to go but here's a wide angle lens which
makes sense because you as you demoed in
your video Brendan you can get an entire
like third or fourth person in the frame
if you want to if you're the whole
family wants to get together to talk to
Grandma and Florida or whatever and
that's great and and you know it's also
cool because you know some of these some
some camera software has a time a timer
so you can prop up the phone somewhere
which is very difficult to do and you
can do like a family portrait thing but
that's just that's first of all not not
wise because someone could steal your
phone if you're in the middle of a
public area so like this capability to
take pictures for what the front facing
camera is very important to phones and
they enhanced it you know they're you
know the wide-angle things unique
bumping the quality of the front-facing
camera isn't unique apples doing it with
the iphone 5 although this goes a step
further it can record 1080p video from
the front-facing lens and the the iphone
5 can do 720p um so so you know they
really have thought this out quite well
so I kind of I want to bring it bring it
back to a broad sense here because I
started just a little behind the scenes
info for the listeners here maybe maybe
an unauthorized leak from within pocket
now I was going to write an editorial
yesterday I've completely expected to
write the editorial titled you know
thanks HTC but I'm still buying a Lumia
920 like I expected to be able to write
that and then when I saw what HTC
offered and it took me like longer than
usual to kind of reverse myself on this
I was like no actually that is not
certain anymore so what do you guys
think in a general in a broad sense HTC
definitely has a little kind of upset
here an attempt to upset nokia on our
tans do you think it's going to be
successful because nokia still has some
differentiating ability that HTC does
not particularly in Windows Phone 8
software I feel like and in the optics
on the camera what do you think that the
what do you think is left for nokia to
differentiate themselves on like what is
Nokia's still winning on well yeah
yesterday when I was feeling the
feeling that's funny nine ways to when I
was when I was feeling up the d8x that's
even better yes yes I actually thought
it felt a little bit cheap um they've
got this wonderful soft touch plastic on
the back I was telling Michael didja
straight we were talking and it feels
very solid in hand I will not saw it it
feels like you know it's you've got a
good grip on it that's what I'm trying
to say but it doesn't feel as premium as
and I haven't touched it yet the the 920
as it doesn't feel at it doesn't seem as
premium as the 920 so if I had to choose
between the 920 without seeing it and
the 8x after having held it I would
definitely go with the 920 because you
know windows phone is is kind of like
that cool you know techy operating
system that deserves some like
substantial you know different hardware
and I I don't think that that is found
with the 8x it's nice hardware but it
feels you know it's and as we also
mentioned the call it is quite a bit
lighter than the Nokia Lumia 920 I mean
almost everything is lighter than the
920 but it's almost as light as a galaxy
s3 I thank the 8x so that might lend
that might contribute some to that cheap
feeling I'm just kind of riffing there
yeah and that's true they're both
running Windows Phone 8 they're both
nice bold colors so I think the only
differentiating factor to me it's gonna
be how good is the camera and front
facing camera aside you know if I can
take a really really beautiful picture
with that nice high resolution rear
facing camera that's the tipping point
for me so I have to say that Nokia
probably wins out in in this match yes
I'd say so you'd go PureView on that new
PureView and plus i mean they're nokia
once again can it's got that software
package with Nokia drive with you know
whatever nokia music and a bunch of
stuff that i think would be considered
bloat by a lot of people but is actually
really useful which I kind of took for a
test drive when I had the 900 for a
couple weeks thanks to our friends at
AT&amp;amp;T there and yeah I mean nokia still
got some some stuff that can that really
sets them apart so
I don't know for me it's still up in the
air I don't know I'm going to I'm going
to buy one of them this is a personal
thing this isn't like a review unit
thing like I'm going to buy one of them
and it's gonna be my daily driver I just
don't know which yet but it so in that
case I think I want to say to wrap this
up sort of for me kudos to HTC for
surprising me for coming to the market
and and saying ya know we've actually
got something of value here and we're
gonna maybe change your mind yeah and
and something I got to discover
yesterday was windows phone 8 for the
first time I've never actually used it
until yesterday and you know I always
kind of saw windows phone is somewhere
in the middle we've got iphone on the
right you know what you see is what you
get you've got android on the left you
can do whatever the heck you want with
it you got windows phone in the middle
you gotta get some live information but
it's it's that symmetrical design and
when I saw windows phone 8 at first and
screenshots and videos I I was kind of
upset that the symmetry had been lost I
mean you can make your your Start screen
looking pretty ugly and windows phone 8
if you really want to do so like you
could you could stack it with if you use
the little tiles you'd have like oh I
don't even want to know how many like 25
little microscopic type tiles to show
you nothing and um but you know but but
I think that's a good thing and I think
it's up to the user if they want to have
you know 45 little tiles are like five
big ones and 15 little ones and I think
that Windows Phone 8 brings the platform
a little bit closer to that left a
little bit closer to that Android where
I like to play because I like to change
things and so I after after yesterday on
I'm even more excited about Windows
Phone II and I can't wait to use it Joe
do you think do you think you'd if you
were to get one of these devices I mean
you know do you think you would actually
I mean would you would you is windows
phone 8 doing anything like Brandon just
said to entice you further as a as user
of another platform well just as far as
Hardware goes both no key and HTC have
definitely piqued my interest i would
love to see that kind of stuff on the
android platform as far as windows 8
over excuse me windows phone 8 over
windows phone 7 I like the live tile
console
I like getting information right on the
screen that's what I have my widgets for
I'd love to use it I'd love to have just
a week where I switched over entirely
and sit down and and use it the thing
that in every video that I see every
person that I see that has a Windows
Phone that home screen is constantly
jumping all around doing all kinds of
changes and every time I see something
out of the corner of my eye I have to
look at it it's just one of those things
I have no control over i look at it and
to me having that sitting on my desk
dancing around would it would be the
death of me I I would die from a DD
overloaded Joe's kind of like a cat she
sees some movement you chase after what
was that squirrel Don there's another
dog in that car um cool well it'll be
nice too I can't wait until windows
phone 8 launches we talked a little bit
about iOS 6 trapping everyone's excited
about that I'm very excited about
Windows Phone 8 and I'm particularly
excited because they didn't change a
whole lot from seven Joe in contrast to
Joe I what hold on a second I also have
that attention issue where it's like oh
yeah I have to look at this that's a new
thing there's a new thing every five
seconds but for me that's exciting i'm
like you know because i live in a star
trek world and I'm like gasps flashing
buttons that is what I'm into keep
moving you I so it's don't bastard yeah
so the Romulans are out ahead of you
there's another one that uncloaked and
you've got this little thing on your
console blinking that says oh the
coolant is down two degrees in the mess
hall who cares in the time it took you
to look at that and see it wasn't
important you just got quantum torpedoes
fired up your naselle what I'm glad that
quantum torpedoes fired at your nasal
was said on this podcast and check that
off my list I'm also fascinated that
there's a world that exists where
coolant is required in a mess hall let's
move on to to Andrew how are you gonna
keep the stuff cold line keep that soup
cold enough to eat there's only borscht
in the future I want to I want to kick
off our Android coverage by leaping into
something that I was supposed to cover
yesterday and didn't I got very
distracted by the windows phone stuff I
just wanted to keep writing about the
windows
and then I wanted to restart the bird
Leon his question corner with a question
that's been very popular today about the
iphone so I think not you just admitted
that Windows Phone distracted you from
doing your actual work on the podcast I
don't want to get that down for the
record it's those live tiles I just got
owned you're entirely right it did and I
take full responsibility but it would
the problem is this left a hole in our
coverage and this was my fault and it
that the LG optimus G dropped yesterday
or it kinda nounced yesterday re
announced I guess in the United States
Joe or Brandon if you were dying to talk
about it because I I would just somebody
talk about this thing because I can
someone tell me why I need to be excited
about this because I'm even if I had
covered it i think i probably would have
fallen asleep in the middle of writing a
piece about it i'm not you know i don't
mean to be too harsh but really why do I
care Snapdragon s4 pro okay so it so it
is the is the cpu story that is the the
most significant element of the optimus
G and you just wrote a piece on the s4
family yes yes I did there's there's
four processors one that's really lame
and sucky and will never mention again
and then the other three that are all
just completely amazing and 23
nanometers and to their manufacture on
23 nanometer process when most things
today are 28 to 32 to what 40 somewhat
each five yeah 45 is still a common one
out there right so what are the others
there's pro there's what's the crappy
one call I think that one's to play and
you play and then there's what media and
something else yes yeah I would have to
go back to my article and get the the
chart on that it's not important what
we'll talk about the pro that the most
beastly of them I think you mentioned in
your article at some point that
theoretically a pro could play to 1080p
videos simultaneously if you wanted it
to the exact quotes are a number of so
number that could be one or it could be
30 I'm dream it's some of the some of
the numbers that I've been seeing have
said that they can play for full 1080p
30 frame per second video streams at the
same time without a hiccup
now no one would ever ever do that
except one of us to say that we could
but it's the fact that it's got that
much not only video processing power but
also decoding ability to be able to
handle I mean that's just a huge number
of pixels that it's got to figure out
from a file someplace and decide how
it's gonna look on the screen and pop
that on to the screen 30 times a second
it's just amazing you know what's gonna
do that but think about how much faster
that's going to make everything else on
the phone if it can do that open up your
gmail scrolling around on the map
multiple tabs in a web browser I mean
that's just that's nothing it can do
that in its sleep yeah and you mentioned
you made a good mention also in your in
your piece about like yeah of course
we'd never watch for 1080p videos at
once or I think you use the example of
gaming it's like why should why should
non-gamers care about this performance
because I frequently have to ask myself
this when when we get into like really
in-depth talk about chipsets and stuff
and I'm like I god I never I don't play
call of duty 18 you know so it's like I
don't really care but no like wouldn't
because high performance stuff that
requires high performance helps push the
industry forward because chip makers
have to build stuff to accommodate that
those who do that stuff and as a result
we all benefit so that makes a lot of
sense I actually liked your point there
okay so I'm gonna geek out on you just
for a minute here I wish you would move
over to desktop computers so this is now
desktop now when you've got regular
desktop computers you can play games on
them in fact I'm a computer gamer over a
console gamer hands down you always want
to have a high-end graphics card and
those graphics cards are optimized for
3d where you have perspective where you
have lighting where you've got all this
stuff and your operating system itself
up until recently has been to D so it
hasn't taken advantage of all of that
extra processing power that you can do
with that GPU in fact up until very
recently the the entire interface
was not optimized for for running
through the GPU it ran through the CPU
so all of that hey my game runs really
fast didn't translate into i can write a
letter to Mom really quickly in word or
surf the web really fast right so what
does this have to do with pocket now
these mobile operating systems kind of
got the clue in Windows we now have GPU
accelerated we now have 3d it great
windows seven does that Windows 8 I I
guess does it I fed up with windows 8
but Android speaking just of Android
they now do that GPU acceleration in the
core OS so your home screen your core
apps those are all GPU accelerated so
they're taking advantage of all the
stuff that that processor can do in
games and giving that to you in
everything which is not it which is
something that I think everybody was
always was complaining about with OSS
for a while there I think in the webos
community we were annoyed that the GPU
that was present in the original pre
wasn't even being used to run the OS it
was all running through the CPU and that
as a result we had these crappy
animations and I think android people
were complaining about that for version
after version right yeah absolutely yeah
so it's so that all makes a degree of
sense i mean the in its implementation
in the LG the optimus G I mean once
again this is an LG first right because
no one else has used this processor yet
in a handset as far as I can tell this
is the the first implementation of the
s4 it at least the s4 pro but i believe
the s4 in general ok and yeah i don't
know what do you guys think is this
gonna be is this going to be another
case of LG saying hey we're first and
then everyone else saying hey that's
awesome and then kind of shrugging and
going back to buying what they were
going to buy originally because that's
happened with LG in 3d and that's
happened with LG and what's the other
thing that i mentioned on monday what
else were they first two quad-core
that's right so yeah yeah yeah LG
they look for these marketing off
opportunities to get a little bump but
then at the end of the day it's still LG
and unfortunately LG has a long way to
go um it let me give you a couple of
examples this LG intuition that I've
received for review I might actually
send back early and not review it
because I would probably give it a one
out of 10 is the optimist view for
verizon listeners yeah and it is just it
has no reason for being it is the worst
device I've ever used it doesn't make
phone calls well it doesn't browse the
web well doesn't fit in your pocket well
it does nothing well it comes with a pen
that doesn't do very much and you have
to carry it with you wherever you go and
yesterday I brought the I brought the
optimist view with me thinking that you
know if I had more time with the 8x I
might take it out and compared to know
such brought along in the gadget back
and I found myself taking it out as I
was meeting various people to say I I
would take it out and say you want to
see the the worst thing that has ever
been released in the world and I take it
out and people would put it in their
hand this wide massive device that is
just so horrible and they would scoff at
they would they would agree with me even
if I didn't preface it by saying want to
see the worst thing that has ever been
released the reason the reason that
intuition is so horrible besides the
things I just said it's not good at
anything is because the software is poor
the hardware's got some issues there are
spelling mistakes in the sava it looks
like an experiment and you know it so I
have very little respect your LG
products and I don't like their
interface and they have a lot to prove
to be a first first-rate contender I
mean right now they're what if they what
their fourth right behind motorola um
after samsung and HTC and yeah there's
something like that and you know this
Optimus G is just like it reminds me of
the optimus 2x right Oh first dual core
phone grade well huh was that was that a
good phone I mean it would it was I
guess okay but it was just nothing
special
anyway I I'm not excited about the
optimus G i think i think the s4 pro
looks awesome I can't wait to see it you
know in the next samsung or HTC or
motorola phone but i just-i can't-- get
excited by the LG sorry LG if that isn't
it frustrating like when it when a
company whether this is actually
ultimately true or not I feel like it is
when a company comes out and they're
like hey we're first and they do this
all the time and sprint does this the
united states where they were first to
4g sort of by a government mandate but
they did it with with my max and of
course that didn't really work out and
you know their first to a bunch of other
stuff and it's like it and that you
people do exactly what you just said
rent and they looking like oh you're
first awesome yeah that thing that
you're like demoing right now being
first on i can't wait until a more
competent company takes it over and does
it better you know like that's in that's
sad because LG used to make awesome
stuff as i said in the my piece on
monday LG used to be really cool in the
in the days of the dumb phone they
brought out some really really awesome
stuff for for verizon in particular so
yeah it'd be nice to see him get back on
their feet but I so yeah is there
anything else about the Optimus G can we
I mean what's up I I think I you know I
think you know I don't have benchmarks
by the way sorry Brandon oh yeah
absolutely kill the benchmark yeah 7070
200 in Quadrant yeah so if you buy based
on benchmarks you know this is a no this
is not a bad device to like look at for
a second then another benchmarks it
completely gets destroyed by everything
else like in a browser mark and
sunspider it's just like a nasty stupid
bad thing a lot of that's the browser
that you're using foot yang will stop
soon we'll talk a little bit about that
when we get to razor I in a minute and
which but yeah we're about to sizzle be
in before we segue into that I'm gonna
be the dissenting voice and I'm gonna
come to the defense of LG nice odd
pleased LG the company makes fabulous
products they make consumer electronics
that I would not hesitate by and hang on
my wall to buy and use around the house
I've got some LG stuff inside the
computer that i'm using right now I mean
they make good stuff
they made good feature phones chocolate
now when we're talking about you know
smart phones they're not really new to
the game which is kind of sad but given
their their history of really good
consumer electronics pieces it's just a
matter of time before they get the
equation right and we see a really
really amazing device from LG so you
think it's just a matter of time you
think that they're they're getting their
their ducks in a row still and they're
sitting on a pile of money because their
LG and they're a huge company so they
they kind of have time to burn here and
we're going to see something awesome
from them well time is against them and
and they're they're fumbling right now
we've seen that the last few things
hopefully this is the phone where
they've turned it around I haven't
played with it in hand so I can't give
you a definitive yes or no this is or
isn't it but inevitably they are going
to make a phone that is going to be
every bit as good as everybody else and
very possibly even better and there may
soon be a day where we have LG setting
the bar for samsung I know that that's
going to be a Hail Mary but I'm not
going to put that out of the realm of
possibility they have the ability inside
that company to do something truly
amazing a vote of confidence on LG's
behalf from Joel Eva I like it thank you
for being thank you for keeping us
balanced I hope you're right you I do
too because I don't yeah I don't have
anything against him certainly I just
want to be impressed I hope I'm right
too because if not I'm gonna look really
silly if someone listens to this and yes
a man that Julie like I didn't know what
he was talking about well that's that's
we're on episode 10 there's a there's
you know 15 hours of at least of all of
us saying something stupid at least 40
times the speaking of processors let's
let's segue into the razor I hear and I
don't want to spend too long on this but
it is a very interesting product
motorola announced the razor I the other
day it is essentially a razr m with an
Intel processor which is not a first
necessarily for smartphones or for
android smartphone but it is a first for
motorola android smartphones
powered by an intel atom what a midfield
process material yeah and it runs it's a
single core but it runs a two gigahertz
which is also a first for mobile devices
for I don't know Joad you start talking
over the minute I start saying
definitely some comments or come as long
as like you're an idiot and I get right
I mean I shouldn't be talking about
chips and sorry well the interesting
thing about Adam is it was never really
designed for phones it was never
designed really for for tablets I mean
that was kind of their target but it's
been more your integrated components um
some people thought hey this is this is
the next pentium i'm going to buy this
processor i'm going to put it in my
motherboard and i'm going to be able to
cut the power consumption of my computer
down by at least half probably more and
believe it or not there are some
adapters that you can use that you can
plug an atom processor into and then
plug that into your motherboard and
there you go and 20 minutes later you
might be booted up into windows so it's
just really sad when you get to
integrated stuff like an ass box or like
a router or or anything that you could
plug in that just kind of sits there and
does its thing and you don't care about
it it just works that's where Adam is
fabulous so now moving this stuff over
into tablets solid-state tablets that's
a logical progression moving it over
into smartphones okay sure you know
smartphones are just small tablets but
let's go ahead and do that the thing
that makes this unusual is its x86 it's
not 64 bit but then again nothing right
now really is in the mobile arena but
it's x86 so all the instruction sets for
x86 stuff carry over so what does that
mean for an end user like you know who's
gonna buy this thing and you know what
what what can you do with this that you
can't do with say the Rays RM absolutely
nothing haha is that true yeah that's
exactly true and the reason is they came
out with this on and and
platform mm-hmm now if I say hey it's
x86 so now I know how to write programs
for x86 architecture great I can now
write for this phone sorry guys this is
Android go over to Android power user
watch the last couple episodes where
we've talked about the JIT compiler and
the dalvik VM and dalvik cache all
you've got to do is write your stuff in
Java and deploy it and it will work on
any platform whether that's x86 whether
that's so your snapdragons right whether
that's some new processes that we
haven't even heard of that runs a
completely different instruction set as
long as that operating system and the vm
are poured it over to run on that
particular instruction set everything
else is just going to run it doesn't
matter what's humming along underneath
it doesn't matter what doesn't matter at
all so you have no advantage at all that
it's x86 so all right so yeah so
Motorola and an Intel have made a big
deal about this of course obviously from
a corporate standpoint it's their first
partnership and you know whatever but so
that that kind of plays into some of the
questions we were asking earlier in the
weeks like why did Motorola choose or
water Motorola and Intel choose this
kind of unremarkable device to launch
this partnership on and I kind of just
theorized that it's because they kind of
wanted to soft launch their partnership
on a not very blockbuster a device
they're not they're obviously not trying
to move millions of these units no way
you know so I just don't get why it's
why this is significant it except in the
in the sense that formoterol and Intel
for Intel especially this is a nice
foothold to have in the mobile world
that they've been sort of absent in
right yeah they're being modest and I
think they should be I mean as as Joe
just described it doesn't seem like as a
power user or someone who likes things
to be fast I I would want to choose an
Intel processor on my phone over a
Qualcomm or or nvidia chip um but and
that that is so surprising to me because
it's 2012 now and we've been hearing
about
for mobile for like what four years now
that leads to and it finally comes out
and and there's just Intel does one
thing very well makes really great power
friendly processors that are fast and
like it would be cool if the razr m the
razor I had like 45 hours of battery
life because of this processor or it
obliterated every benchmarking and and
first indications were that in every
application and Android the whole
experience is just remarkably faster
that would be an intel mobile chip debut
but instead that is not the case so they
kind of did this soft modest launch with
the razor i and maybe they're working on
something that does all those things i
just said but i'm kind of i'm kind of
surprised by that yeah I'm mirror
Brandon's thoughts exactly this is not a
remarkable device it's not something
groundbreaking it's not something that's
gonna smash every benchmark so they
don't have to be looked at as saying
well the reason it didn't do that was
because of the processor they don't have
to get that black eye but they do get
their feet wet they get their processor
out there they get it into devices and
really I think this is going to be a
good a good chip like I kind of alluded
to earlier there's only one problem that
we've seen so far and that's
unfortunately with web browsing the
chrome browser doesn't work on this
processor so that kind of breaks
everything I just said about it just
works everywhere so consider that with a
big fat asterisk after it that's because
of I believe and I haven't seen anyone
who can contradict this so if you can
please comments down below let us know
but it looks like Google put some native
code into the Chrome browser for
whatever reason to make it faster to tie
tighter into the operating system I
don't know but it looks like there's
native code in there and obviously sisk
code is not going to run on a risc
processor or in this case vice versa so
they have to have a new version of
chrome to run on this or they have to do
what they've been
telling everybody all along and that's
just just write it using the normal
tools and publish it so that it runs in
the dalvik VM just like everything else
and then it'll run just fine anywhere
but it's ironic that that's the only
problem that we've seen is something
that Google themselves wrote yeah I
think this is a this is this is chip
talk that actually I want to continue
having but on a different device can I
can I just kind of segue this into the
to the to another cpu absolutely yeah we
have I didn't expect it to be such a big
like chip Newsweek or like hardware
Newsweek but it is samsung has announced
that the galaxy note 2 which is coming
the United States obviously is going to
be packing the the X and O's for quad oh
my god yeah so like previously when
Samsung bring stuff to us shores because
of the u.s. is like comparatively large
LTE build out the only I think this has
been the the obstacle that the only
lte-compatible chips have basically been
live Qualcomm s4 you know running the
dual core chipset but now the X notes
for quad has both LTE capability and a
quad core processor so and two gigabytes
of RAM and backed up by two gigs of RAM
well and it's gonna be just like the
galaxy s3 that's on us shores right now
so like what so you guys jazzed about
this I myself have found the performance
of the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 to be
really awesome on any device I've almost
any device I've tested it on and I don't
really need need quad-core and that's
unless it runs cooler which it probably
does because the s4 gets really hot it
is a 32 nanometer which means that it is
going to be cooler than stuff that's
bigger than that theoretically isn't the
s4 like 0 32 or 28 as well the s4 pro
and really the s4 Prime and the s4 other
one those are all 23 so they're smaller
everything else nowadays is yeah it's
this is a 23 or 28 crap now I've lost my
chart that's uh so 32 that's still
really small and it's really good so it
should be better for bad
life it should be better for for putting
off heat which the hot or something gets
the faster it sucks down battery mm-hmm
results should be a lot better previous
generation of X and O's was 45 nanometer
so X and O's 2 X and O's this should be
quite a bit better and I do i do hope so
branna DJ you jazzed about it I'm jazzed
the the fastest android experience I
still have ever had was cyanogenmod 10
running on the quad core galaxy s3 and
it's just it's just it's disgustingly
fast it's just so it's such a good
experience and even you know even
running a touch wiz on touch with jelly
bean on the quad core galaxy s3 is
pretty darn good so this is gonna be an
awesome device is gonna be a an awesome
device for power users I i wish the
development community would do some more
cool stuff with the S Pen because as
soon as you root the you know the Galaxy
Note at least in the first one the gas
spin functionality didn't work and you
know with 1024 levels of pressure on the
Galaxy Note 2 and a better tactile feel
and all that I just I hope that some
cool stuff happens with the with the
Galaxy Note 2 me too and yeah and
especially with the note 10 dot one with
this kind of side by side simultaneous
app running stuff I feel like that that
kind of application is just begging for
a for a quad-core processor right am I
am I completely off base there no you're
not the unfortunate thing that they
really gotta cross that hurdle is you
can't just have four devices excuse me
for apps that run on that you oh yeah
you've got to be able to launch anything
else that that's gonna kill it before
anything but that part right there yes
you're absolutely right the more the
more cores you have the better because
you're going to be devoting CPU cycles
to each one of them and you don't want
either one to lag right um well that's I
kind of wanted we do have a hard stop
today everyone so I kind of want to keep
us moving here not to be the I really
love to stay and talk about a lot of
this stuff but if we can segue really
clay into away from chips a little bit
but into another phablet we have this
sort of press render that we posted
three days ago of this HTC five incher
supposedly say the name okay the 1x5
know what save the cocina code name um I
would love to tell you the code name
unfortunately my ears are blasting me
with a commercial red now and I don't
know which one of my tabs it's coming
from I'm getting a trance American
commercial in my head I don't know why
that is this episode of pocket now
faraci but yeah um sorry so what is the
code name I was really thrown by that um
I'm being a second grader here sorry
tennis oh is it oh is it the the HTC
dicks is that correct yes it is the HTC
takes its di X for short for Dixon hill
obviously that's hilarious yeah this is
the HTC dicks / HTC possibly 1x5 HTC may
be trying to make a phablet like device
would you I'm looking at the press
render here if you guys listeners want
to look it up is from this is a story
from the 17th it doesn't look like it's
been debunked I I don't know would you
guys buy an HTC phablet I would have
said no right off the bat up until
yesterday but what they brought with the
8x and 8s excited me enough that I'm
kind of a little semi amped on HP again
what do you guys think the the the
phablet market is is wide open uh you
know Samsung right now has the has the
upper hand because they were first and
no one's really followed behind them and
you know I can't wait to see what HTC
does with a phablet form factor we
already saw what LG did with it they
messed up motorola I'm sure will come
out with if everyone can come out with a
phablet because if something sells
millions and millions of units then then
the next step is that the competition
comes in right Jeff so so I'm looking at
this and this is just a press render
like you said we don't have
tight specifications on it yet but I'm
noticing that bezel around the edges
getting smaller and smaller so although
we may be calling this a phablet just
kind of looking at it it looks like that
device may not be much wider than some
of the devices that were carrying around
with us right now which taking advantage
of more of that bezel space to give you
a bigger screen experience I think is
the the perfect way to go to get larger
screens into our hands without
necessarily increasing the size of the
device itself it does look a bit taller
than than some of the others and I have
no idea why you'd still have capacitive
buttons on the bottom of a screen that
tall what yeah you know it looks like
something yeah I definitely be
interested in in trying out HTC I've
always always loved HTC devices going
way back into my pocket pc days yeah so
i always like seeing what they have what
they're doing I like the chiseled edge
is the bevels it's very one Esk and it's
something that I think would be really
really great especially in a phablet
form factor and we didn't see it
announced at the the event the other day
which obviously is you know it's just
for windows phone so it is there any
speculation on when when they might try
and push this I mean I feel like this
this if there's a press render and if
this is real then we would be seeing
this before the holidays i would i would
hope yep back to school it's got to be
back to school and is Collins we're back
to school now though you know what I
mean like back to school has already
happened Cecily this will be a holiday
device yeah i mean with it with it I
mean I I really hope for HTC sake that
they're doing what Samsung is doing and
they're gonna have a release on all four
carriers I mean stick and by the way
that's a really amazing thing to note
that Samsung's doing again yes you know
it's simultaneous drop on all four
carriers yeah and the unbranded device
the same device over every carrier they
have the carriers by the balls at this
point and that's exactly finally yeah
yeah that's exactly where Samsung want
it to be and it's it's it's it's to the
advantage of the consumer because the
carriers can't say okay at a keyboard
you you know do all this other stuff but
I
fortunately the HTC releases this device
is probably be one or two carrier device
and it's it's good right off the bat
it's gonna be disadvantaged but maybe
maybe you don't have some features he
has a 1080p screen that'll be one thing
to see how crushed in know if anybody
can see it can see the difference rather
um okay I want to jump the thing is I
there is a one piece of listener me I
want to get to suit so we kind of
already dealt with iOS at the top of the
podcast here but we didn't I don't want
to do a couple days but I do want to
touch on the iPad many real quickly
we're kind of graduating from phablets
into smaller tablets is there any doubt
now that that this iPad Mini is
happening i mean the leaks are just
coming so so frequently and they're so
consistent and the thing looks on the
bottom looks as ugly in my opinion as
the bottom of the iphone 5 with the same
connector I mean we're pretty sure this
is coming out yeah it's yeah and it's
scary that we're seeing the exact same
period of time and types of leaks that
we saw with the iphone 5 which
unfortunately means that there's a big
problem of apples secrecy yeah and which
unfortunately means that we're gonna see
the device that we're seeing in weeks
and you know that might be a good thing
might be a bad thing it's just it's a
little disappointing and it's gonna kind
of soften the message when Apple has a
keynote event and says hey we've got
this new office of product everyone's
already seen it and it happened again
happen with the iphone 5 i've read some
very interesting speculation on that
that that says that very interesting to
me that says that this you know might be
something that Apple is doing
intentionally to kind of temper the
media backlash from from events like
this were like you know the press is
like oh yeah thanks for holding this big
event for like the 4s we're not
impressed and here's why and then
there's a week of this kind of
negativity and it so the conspiracy
theory goes that if Apple can leak
enough of the stuff intentionally early
then it like you know moderates
everybody's feelings and like oh well we
know what's coming and so maybe that
gets reduced I don't know if there's any
really crazy isn't that crazy but it
seems like the kind of thing that just
might be stupid enough to be true I
danced before
I'm glad I wasn't the only one who went
there Michael because yeah Here I am I'm
thinking what was new about the iphone 5
it was a step up in the specs and that
was it there really wasn't anything
super special about it taller faster
thinner Newport it just wasn't exciting
so somebody at Apple is going guys this
isn't all that exciting we're going to
take this we're going to present it and
we're going to be booed off the stage
then of course that wouldn't happen but
you've got this this buildup you know
people are expecting Apple to come out
with something new and fabulous and
great and just blow our socks off and
I'm sorry ipad mini it ain't it no i
phone 5 no so this is army well you just
I disagree about the the notion that the
I mean just by virtue of being a smaller
iPad it could be made out of garbage
cans and it would be interesting because
the iPhone the iPad is a life changing
device tablets are life changing device
they are and to take something that's
really life-changing and make it more
portable so you can fit it in a way you
know you could keep carried around so
much eat that that's that's amazing so
even if this the leaks are true that the
the implications of having a smaller
iPad are huge and and it's gonna sell
more than the original iPad i think i
think that i would agree that that is
probably a very safe bet to make i think
it would be something different if you
were talking about say the motorola xoom
which is like hey it's been this 10-inch
thing that some of you liked and here's
the zoom 7 yeah you know like that would
be one thing would be like oh stop it
but it's apple and it's the ipad it is
the category defining instrument you
know it people who took a pass on the
Nexus 7 and the kindle fire because they
love iOS because they're not gonna buy
an apple product you know some part of
them at least half of them maybe some
part of their brain was like yeah but it
would be nice to have a little more
portable device if only it ran iOS so
just assessing 7 catch bugs yeah 7-inch
tablets that that's where it's at I've
completely agree packed around tens
they're just too big seven yeah seven is
perfect and and this is a perfect year
for an ipad mini not last year not next
year because this year the world met the
ipad 3 which is a heavier clunkier
unwieldy device and and people are
singing they don't know yet they're
singing for a lighter version of that
2012 is a good year for the ipad mini
yeah um that's uh manoa we did it first
yeah and yeah and I care around the
nexus 7 like all the time now and it's
not necessarily because I'm in love with
jellybean it's because i love the form
factor and i'd like that the hardware so
i do also love jelly bean but anyway
we're gonna get to some miscellaneous
news on the next podcast i want to talk
once blackberry becomes interesting it's
starting to pretend to become
interesting and maybe they can become
interesting before they're bought but
we'll talk about it next I want to get
to a piece of listener of listener mail
that actually is like two weeks old but
it's perfect right now because Joe is on
the podcast and I think this is a
question uniquely suited to both you and
Brandon Joe so this is from Christian
from Germany who thanks us for the
podcast I'd love to listen to it thank
you Christian for listening and for
waiting for this answer now christian
says krishna asks how difficult is it
for the manufacturers to build an update
from let's say ice cream sandwich to
jelly bean for their phones and how much
real programming stuff has to be done by
them on top of the stuff from google
itself I was wondering because being
quite active in the XDA community I was
impressed by essentially he says he was
impressed by how quickly people cook
custom roms there and why does it take
the companies so long to develop to
deliver an update even when they have
all their device IDs drivers proprietary
things etc already around and don't need
to figure out how to bypass the
bootloader for example how much do they
have to do greetings Christian that is
an awesome question I think it's one
we've all asked time and time again what
is why don't we let Joe take a stab at
this first well first of all Christian
my wife was born in Germany so we've
already got a brotherhood there uh on to
the question on the question between ice
cream sandwich and gel
bean probably isn't going to be as
ground chattering as you might hope so
let's take a step back to do gingerbread
honeycomb to jelly bean and we'll just
kind of skip honeycomb because nobody
likes that that was a major major jump
in in the way the hardware was set up in
the way that rather the drivers that
talk to the hard room to set up
permissions we had new stuff we had new
substructures that everything talked to
without getting too techno mumbo jumbo
here there was a lot of stuff that had
to change and most of those were in
drivers when we're going from ice cream
sandwich to jelly bean we've already got
that good foundation there aren't a ton
of changes as far as back end stuff that
has to be done differently to make stuff
work from ice cream sandwich to jelly
bean so that's why we've seen for
example getting out cm9 just took
forever it took forever for an ice cream
sandwich cyanogenmod to come out but as
soon as we got source code cm10 is I'm
running Knightley's right now and
they're super super stable and it's been
very very fast has been that hard so
that's the first part of your question
you know going up to the jelly bean is a
lot faster from Ice Cream Sandwich than
any time in in the history another point
in your question why does it take so
long for for OEMs to come out with these
updates this is what I'm interested in
very much and he brings up a really good
point here they've already got the
drivers they've got the source code to
the drivers they can just look at it
make any tweaks that they need to plug
it in and go one of the major holdbacks
for custom rom errs aside from unlocking
the bootloader which sometimes is a very
formidable task is the camera believe it
or not the camera drivers are all very
very proprietary and they're usually
cooked into that camera app so unless
you can get into that they don't like
releasing that stuff which means now you
great your phone your tablet whatever
works except for the camera I'm sorry
have a nice day
so Google is trying to expose api's to
make that a little bit better the
cyanogenmod team is working on their own
api's so that someday in the future we
might not need a superuser permission to
run cyanogenmod just to install it the
more API is that we can get the less
proprietary driver support we need to
have and we can go quite a bit faster so
they should be able to do a quick earthy
oems that brings us to the next point if
you have one development team and
they're sitting down and they are
writing firmware their writing drivers
they are writing OS they're updating
TouchWiz or or since you I or whatever
that fancy layer that doesn't even have
to be there is they've got these
projects all slated out usually a year
in advance on what they're gonna do the
timelines they've got charts up there to
tell you who's on time what the in
dependencies are what the milestones are
they're going gung-ho working on the
next version of that for the next device
which they have to meet by the next
launch window so they can get it out for
Christmas and actually sell these things
and now you say well look jellybean just
came out and we just released this
device a couple months ago now we have
to pull people off of those already
tight scheduled teams where they
probably like me and I'm not operating
with enough manpower as is now we have
to go back open up another project
shoehorn that into place and go through
a huge round of a quality-control
usability testing make sure that this is
all nice and stable and sound and then
you think and then release it and then
the carriers have to get their hands on
and then the same thing happens all over
you exactly right and that's not just
the OEM a sling and barrier to account
if you're like building it for a
specific network like like Verizon
Wireless your sprint the united states
which have not only the LTE stuff but
also the CDMA codex which are so much
more proprietary than anything else i
mean there's like secret encryption and
 like that and then and then they
call up the can you hear me now guy
who's actually been fired probably and
says hey we want you to travel
every state in this country make sure
the software works because we don't want
verizon customers calling our customer
support lines and clogging them up and
custom has millions of dollars we have
to make sure the software works we're
gonna test it for two months get it
right thoroughly and then we're going to
put all of our apps on top of it and
we're gonna test it again I make sure
when it says to make sure the bloatware
doesn't break anything other than just
make everybody's lives miserable young
mr. toilet waste bloaty by the time all
of that is all done that new product is
not only been released but it's probably
also come down in price and why don't
you just go ahead and get that one
because that makes the OEMs happy
because they've been working for that
and that makes the carrier's happy you
know the OEM gets to sell another device
which is good the carrier now gets to
rope you in for another two-year
contract which they think is good so the
the deck is stacked against the end-user
for getting timely updates or getting
updates at all the OEMs don't
necessarily want to do it unless it's
going to cause a media backlash because
their two month old device isn't going
to get the the brand new OS and the
carrier's really they could not care
less they yeah they nurtured sell you
mine in and to help anyone yeah well
then that's why cyanogenmod exists
that's why k okay p exists that's why
all of these custom roaming communities
exist so that you can take your old
device and give it new life and make it
last and last and last as long as you
can that's well said we got that doesn't
man yeah I was gonna say we need to put
print that on a t-shirt or not a banner
that's Christian I hope that answers
your question there we were kind of
letting up against a hard stop here Joe
there was an awesome awesome answer I
want to use our final piece of listener
mail to kind of play us out or effort
will do it live LOL but but before I do
that Brandon Joe do you have some
closing comments I'll go first please um
it's a fabulous time to be alive looking
at the previous course of history I mean
look at what we've got today look at
pocket now when we started way back when
versus where we are now
I mean we're we're debating which is
better a grid full of icons a grid full
of moving icons or Android that you can
do anything with it's the full spectrum
we can do anything we want regardless of
what your style or preference is there
is something for you it's there it's now
it's today you don't have any excuses
come and join the party it's over a
pocket now that's nice that's well said
sir I like that me too Oh Brandon we're
gonna looking a little go out on that
one I don't have any closing remark
that's terrific that's awesome I like
that too great well our final piece of
listener mail very brief from collied
hello I absolutely love your website and
your podcast wants to know if there's
any other way to get our podcast on on
mobile by a nap he says he uses
doubletwist and can't find our podcast
yes there is kalid we are on stitcher
podcast radio which is probably not
available outside the US now that I
think of it will send you in a
personalized email but we're all aware
of course on iTunes the zune marketplace
and a bunch of other places you can
check out the post listing at pocket now
for all the places you can get us
including a direct download and
streaming and we will endeavor to get on
more apps the colleague clarifies he is
a listener from Kuwait a small rich
country in the Middle East will send you
gas if you want it costs less than
bottled mineral water wow that's that's
a good offer actually we should wait I'm
kind of back just gonna save for the
guys on the team with cars that's an
awesome thing everyone that is gonna do
it thank you for writing in accolade end
christian and thank you listeners for
listening that's going to do it for us
please be sure to find the pocket now
weekly and pocket now on twitter all
over the place where at pocket now
tweets is the official account i'm
michael fisher i'm at captain two phones
its captain the number two phones follow
me for absurdity and nonsense brandon
