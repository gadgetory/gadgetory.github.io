pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to talk about the honeycomb
interface paradigm that is how
everything is arranged on the screen
sort of the philosophy behind the
interface what you see in what you
interact with on the xoom tablet in
honeycomb let's get to it so we don't
cover tablets on pocket now calm we do
smartphones we like to stick to that but
I am a tablet enthusiast and I have a
lot of thoughts about the motorola xoom
so i thought i'd put this video up there
for those of you that watch our videos
on youtube because maybe you're thinking
about getting the zoom or you're
thinking about get is getting the other
android tablets coming out this year
because there's going to be a lot of
them just want to talk about a few
things here there are a lot of good
things and a lot of not so good things
about honeycomb so let's start with the
good things first good thing to talk
about is this home screen it's the
dashboard you wish you had on your iPad
from here you can quickly glance through
your emails you can see your next
calendar appointment you can scroll
through your your favorites you can look
through android applications that google
recommends you can look through youtube
videos you can add widgets to your
heart's content and get this active live
information on your home screen which is
really fantastic so you don't have to
sit there like you do on the ipad and go
into your email then go into YouTube and
then go into your favorites or Safari
it's just a dashboard a launching point
from which you can do really anything
and catch up on information that matters
to you it makes a lot of sense but then
there's stuff about honeycomb that just
doesn't make any sense let me show you
so we're going to bounce into the email
application here learning an email so
I've got a picture here somewhere it's
going to load the picture there it is
great HTC pyramid perhaps now right now
we are in the preview viewing area right
so we've got the envy the messages on
the right on the left and the preview on
the right I need to learn left from
right still apparently so let's say we
delete a message and when you delete a
message or when you check off a message
you get this thing that comes across
right that pops
something that wasn't there before you
can either click done and the check mark
goes away or you can action on it over
here so let's say we want to delete it
okay so i deleted one thing and it
stayed in this view but watch what
happens when i delete two things it goes
into another view when i delete two
things that makes absolutely no sense
it's very very confusing and it's just
kind of silly so let's go back into a
message and talk more about how the
honeycomb interface is laid out and sort
of the the philosophy behind it so in
honeycomb in the native applications
system menu options or program menu
options occur in the upper right corner
it's kind of an inconvenient spot
because you're constantly having to
reach all the way there to the upper
right corner to change certain menu
options whereas an Android for
smartphones the menu options come up
from the bottom right when you press you
know that menu button that is present on
every single android phone so it's a
little bit annoying to have to reach up
to the upper right corner and then in a
lot of applications you'll get a variety
of icons up here which you don't really
know what they are until you tap them
they're not labeled some of them are a
little bit unclear and then you get this
little menu option which is common to a
lot of honeycomb apps this is sort of
like the menu or the file that you would
get on a Windows computer or a Mac okay
so let's go into another application and
talk about the interface now you get a
totally different experience if you go
into an app that's not made for
honeycomb and because there are only 37
apps made for honeycomb plus the
built-in ones most of the time you're
going to be experiencing a different
kind of interface so honey comes kind of
inconsistent so now this application
york times is made for smartphones not
for tablets so we have this extra fourth
button down here which is the the menu
that you would typically see on your
smartphone so now the menu occurs on the
bottom of the screen where is an email
app which you were just in the menu
options occur in the upper right corner
of the screen it's very inconsistent and
it very much makes us think that
honeycomb was an afterthought android
applications from the beginning weren't
built so that they worked on a tablet
you could argue the same about iOS but
at least
iOS you don't have this problem where
there's the extra menu button that needs
to be there for legacy apps and again
this wouldn't be such a such a such a
big problem if there were more honeycomb
X there are only 37 honeycomb apps or
perhaps there are more but there are no
way of sort of just seeing the tablet
apps except through the feature tablets
app section when you see featured that
means that they are taking from the best
but there's no other way to see all of
the tablet apps I don't think there are
any so if we scroll down there's no
tablet section if we scroll down there
are there's no tablet section the only
tablet section here is right here
featured tablet apps and that has 37
items listed and some of these even
though they're listed in the tablet app
section are not optimized for honeycomb
I'll give you an example we scroll down
we'll see Kendall which I've already
downloaded here so I'll go back to the
home screen open up Kendall this is
obviously not optimized for a tablet I
mean no one's email address is this long
another password is certainly not this
long furthermore you know this is a
smartphone app because i put the
keyboard down you get this fourth button
here that's a clear indication that this
is not a honeycomb app so then why is
google putting it in the featured app
section i was hitting this button
because i was trying to hit that button
and so here's the multi-tasking menu
it's pretty cool it gives you little
previews it only lets you switch between
five apps at a time which is strange
because in Gingerbread and Froyo you can
switch between 8 apps and in iOS you can
switch between well depending on whether
you're orienting your device and
landscape or portrait probably about 10
apps or so but here in a honeycomb you
only get five and you always know your
most recent app because it goes to the
bottom of the screen here so a lot of
inconsistencies about where the menus
are and things like that now how about
some some good things about honeycomb
beyond just the the home screen
interface here sort of the dashboard
well over here in the bottom right
corner this collects all of your
notifications in one place it's like the
Notification Center and it makes a lot
of sense it's very similar to the
Android notification shade on
smartphones it's a lot better than you
get an eye
we're notifications just pop up in your
face all the time and really annoy you
here you get notifications and there's
kind of a an earthquake notification
because there's a there's an app
downloaded here called earthquake you
can see all the fingerprints on the
screen so that sends notifications and
when you're working on something whether
you're browsing the web or doing
anything else the notifications are very
unobtrusive they just sort of simmer in
the bottom right corner you can action
on them immediately or they will fade
away or you can press the X to force
them to go away for good so the
notification system is really awesome
let's talk about the web browser the web
browser I found to be incredibly
unstable about one out of every five
times I use the browser it crashes and
even when I'm not doing anything that
intense the cool thing about the
browsers that you get the chrome like
interface here with the tabs and the
buttons but when you start opening lots
of different tabs will just keep opening
tabs it gets really unwieldy to manage
the tabs you can't close them all in one
shot you have to click on them
individually oops and close them and
close them and close them and it's just
it's not that into it if they should
have the X button builds right into
every tab so that you can manage tabs
more easily and there don't have any
options you can play with here so we can
go over here to the favorites and it
shows cool little previews and you can
change the view to list view and again
I'm using this little menu in the upper
right corner you can see some sort of
foam that's what that is over here and
let's go back and we can also go to
search we can use voice search and say
turn on speech recognition pizza and of
course the voice recognition in
honeycomb in andhra and general is very
very good so you can use your voice to
search safari can't do that on the ipad
of course we can do a lot of other
things we can add as favorites with the
OneTouch we can go into the settings and
very basic settings so we can change the
homepage this is really cool sync with
google chrome so you can actually sink
your passwords and your bookmarks with
your honeycomb tablet now that chrome
has that feature it's really great
privacy and security
you can clear cache and do all the
things that you typically can do search
engine you can change that there's a
really cool setting in labs actually
want to cover so it's called quick
control watch what happens it shrinks
the the address bar and gives you a lot
more screen real estate it's better
demonstrated when there's nothing on the
screen now to access the functions of
the browser you slide your thumb over
this is cool this is innovation right
here so you get a big full screen view
you can do that from any side you got to
kind of learn what these what these
icons mean but they're pretty obvious so
back forward refresh this one will show
the URL bar put the keyboard down see
what else we got favorites new tab and
the menu options here from the upper
right corner so the browser is pretty
good as long as it doesn't crash on you
it would also be nice to be able to have
a better tab management there halfway
there with the way the tabs are shown
sort of like a browser on a desktop but
they're not all the way there because
you don't get the X button and it just
there's no way to rearrange tabs they're
missing a lot of features or at least
what is what I'm trying to say let's go
back to the home screen and one more UI
element just want to point out here
nothing surprising here this is the
application tray this quite simply is a
listing of your apps and you can go over
to my apps if you want to get the apps
that you've downloaded onto your Android
tablet so overall Android Honeycomb has
a lot of promise but the interface
paradigm is a little bit confusing
sometimes you'll get buttons in the
upper right corner if you download a
non-native honeycomb at the menu options
will occur on the bottom of the screen
instead of the top of the screen email
does some weird things the browser does
some weird things and it crashes I think
honeycomb version you know 3.1 or
whatever is coming up next will address
a lot of these things but right now
honeycomb really truly feels like an
afterthought and even with this awesome
sort of dashboard of information the
ipad looks much better because it's so
much more mature than the zoom at this
moment in time so that's really it for
this video just wanted to talk a little
bit about some thoughts with the
motorola xoom and with android honeycomb
have any comments please leave some
below and give this video a thumbs up if
you enjoyed it thanks for watching and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
