phone the world is telling you you need
to want but is it worth wanting we'll
find out in our full review but for now
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is one of the biggest phones of the
year it's the Galaxy s5
let's unbox it so one of the things some
people are saying about the galaxy s5
these days is that it is an iterative
improvement a small step over its
predecessor the s4 and that's something
people said about the s4 with relation
to the s3 as well well when you look at
the packaging of the s5 it's tough to
deny some potent similarities in terms
of at least the messaging the branding
the initial impression that Samsung is
trying to make but there is one very
important difference here particularly
if you live in the United States this is
not just same old Samsung packaging this
is a carrier box that's right AT&amp;amp;T in
this case and AT&amp;amp;T is known for kind of
foisting these not necessarily
attractive packages on us but Samsung
has won the day here apparently an
agreement has been reached between the
carrier and the manufacturer not to
change the packaging which we think is
terrific this box feels great let's look
at the specs here LTE that 5.1 inch
AMOLED display 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor that's a Snapdragon 801 16
megapixel camera with full HD recording
and of course the stranger stuff that
heart rate monitor the s health suite
and so on having gotten the top sleeve
out of the way we can now pull the top
panel off of this this box which a
little tease this box still has the
little bisection in the middle just like
the s4 box did last year I think it's
just nice it's just one of those nice
little touches that's like oh yes this
is not only a premium product but
somebody actually thought about you know
getting a finger in there this makes it
easier it's nice attention to detail
folks do not underestimate it pull the
box top off there is our white Samsung
Galaxy s5 so the first thing I notice
here the first impression of the box is
that this device is well I don't I think
it's because it's white but yeah I don't
remember the bezel being that pronounced
certainly it's not a very thick bezel
it's just more pronounced than I
remember
but this is the s5 looks very similar to
last year's s4 we will have an in-depth
comparison there there's of course the
back which we will talk about more in a
second let's put this aside see what
comes with the AT&amp;amp;T version we take this
out that is empty we know from past
experience a QuickStart guide showing us
exactly what to expect on the phone you
guys don't generally like it when I go
through the literature but I'm going to
leave that for later easy way to
transfer content to your new device if
you're coming from another smartphone
which you probably are a warranty guide
ooh
fun stuff hey let's see what's in here
so I got a little more excited than
maybe I needed to I saw this QR code
down here
really yeah QR code on the USB cable and
I thought it might be a micro SD card
that comes with the device it is not
phone is micro SD compatible but it does
not come with a micro SD card it does
however come with the Samsung earbuds we
like these a lot they are the kind of
linguini version that I like to call
them with the extra gels yes of course
with the cord just a little thicker a
little more resistant to tangling
there's our power charger probably 2
amps and if I am not mistaken and yes
indeed there's that 2 amp output that I
like for quick charging my Samsung
Galaxy devices get all the stuff out of
the way and we're back to the device
itself no screen protector on this one
folks sorry no peel we were second way
of press on this one but nonetheless we
thank Samsung for sending this along as
quickly as they did here's the back
panel with that dimpled appearance we'll
get a closer shot here just to show you
what that looks like you're very
familiar with it at this point and the
white one doesn't look too bad I think
it looks pronouncedly horrible on the
gold one but on the blue one the white
one and the black one you know you're
not going to notice that quite as much
as as certainly everyone has been
talking about it but we'll have more
impressions on that once we've spent
more than five minutes with the thing
that's a heart rate sensor that camera
16 megapixels once again go ahead and
power the unit on once where while we're
talking about it come back to a wider
shot little buzz vibration there's that
powered by Android call out that we have
been talking about recently part of
Google's new arrangement with its OEMs
we're seeing that on HTC and Motorola
devices as well nice new Samsung
animation there's the ATT splash screen
with the distinctive thing
yes we remember now the multitasking
button down below the back button on the
right and there is the stock wallpaper
so not going to bore you with initial
setup but I will close out this brief
unboxing with a size comparison for you
and we'll try to have most of the major
platforms represented in our democratic
representation of the smartphone
landscape here that is the Samsung
Galaxy s5 the one we just unboxed let's
kick things off with iOS there is the
iPhone 5c obviously notably smaller the
Moto X another Android device the HTC
One m8 we will also be comparing the
galaxy s5 to that device and not really
enough room for it but the nokia lumia
icon I screwed up the spacing but what
you're going to do five devices in a row
galaxy s5 on the left going all the way
through to the Lumia icon folks were
later than we like to be on this
coverage but we're going to bring it all
