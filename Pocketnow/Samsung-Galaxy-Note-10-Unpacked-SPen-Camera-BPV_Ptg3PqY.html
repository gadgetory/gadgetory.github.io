tens unpacked event arrived then we
might be getting an S phone with a
camera it seems Huawei is waiting on an
answer from the US government because it
seems they still want to continue using
Android and we have new leaks of the
back panel of the mate 30 Pro that
remind us more of the Lumia 1020
I'm Jaime Rivera and it's Tuesday I'm
not supposed to have any more jet lag
but it's been a bad day we still got a
ton of news this is bargain out daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you're in the market for air pods
fine I know everybody's using them
they're not my favorite we did a full
video on that we will work on a video
for alternatives but still right now 145
dollars for the base model without the
wireless charging case they cost 180
with the wireless charging case so you
know for paying full retail price I'd
rather go for this on Amazon you can
learn more on the description now let's
talk about Sony as apparently the
company is already working on its own e
Xperia 2 even if we still have not
received the Sony Xperia 1 for review I
know
according to a you a proof file that
mentions Sony devices with model numbers
J 8 to10 just to give you an idea the
Xperia 1 small number was J a 1 1 0 and
J 80 10 the code names are Sphinx and
Horus and both bring 5 G motors
apparently even if the case of the J 8 0
1 0 will be the flagship that has the
screen resolutions that match the Xperia
1 which could mean that the other one is
more of a mid-range ur whatever the case
may be obviously Sony is not the most
popular fan right now when it comes to
smartphones and obviously this marketing
strategy of not sending our review units
is not the way to go we'll keep you
posted
apparently Aoife and berlin is the case
now let's talk about LG is the company
has just launched the LG g 8s thank you
I know and supposedly you would assume
that the S Varian means it's a better
one but actually it is and it's not see
it's still powered by the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 855 but the resolution goes
down to full HD plus though the screen
red gets larger at 6.2 inches diagonal
meaning less
pixel density the battery is also
slightly larger at 35 50 milliamp hours
and probably the most interesting change
is the extra camera I mean we saw images
of this film but we thought it worth it
was fake but apparently it's not the
system now packs a 13 megapixel super
wide at 12 megapixels standard and a 12
megapixel telephoto obviously we'll keep
you posted as we haven't heard from
those review units either it's very
interesting that LG is launching another
device just out of the blue and let's
move the spotlight over to Huawei s
we've got some very interesting leaks of
what we expect to be the huawei mate 30
Pro and here's the thing I mean while we
came up with the stove design but now we
see that the next generation iPhones and
the next pixels are also bringing the
stove so apparently Huawei wants to go
circular and remind us more of the Lumia
1020 or now the Moto X lineup pretty
much of the Moto Z I would be thing
about it is it seems that there will be
a circular cutout for the camera lekha
capabilities as well well we see as
leaks of the back glass and they bring
the shape I'm not necessarily sure if I
like this design more than the stove
because in the Huawei device it's
centered which is for me the ideal way
but we'll see and let's continue talking
about Huawei particularly when it comes
to the Huawei Ben yesterday we reported
over the case that the Trump
administration had mentioned Donald
Trump itself had said that they were
gonna lift the ban and we did not know
the exact status of where that lay now
apparently we do see after Donald
Trump's statement this weekend the
National Economic Council added that all
that would happen is that they would
give Huawei some additional licenses to
buy widely available products and we
don't know if Android is included as for
example AOSP is free now Huawei is
waiting on the Department of Commerce to
respond so that they can continue using
Android which they stated to prefer the
US government said they have nothing to
add just yet so yes we still don't know
exactly what is being lifted in this ban
or what the extent of it is if there
will be restrictions and what's the case
going to be for Android so yes we will
be reporting on that and finally the
hottest news that I have to do with it
email that I received very late last
night from Samsung with their invite for
the new galaxy and packets happening on
August 7th in New York City and I mean
there is nothing to speculate here we
see an S Pen so we know it's the note
but then the interesting part is that
the invitation has the s-pen draw a
camera and it could be a couple of
things one we hear the rumors that the
camera is going to be centered on the
display so we assume that that's going
to be the case but there is speculation
that there will be a camera on the s-pen
these were the very early rumors of the
Galaxy Note tentative ice with an S Pen
with a camera to which we still are
debating what is the use going to be for
so let us know in the comments down
below what do you think this means do
you think that it's the camera on the
s-pen or just the fact that the camera
centered on the display what is your
take on this what the meaning of this
invitation is because in my case I'm
hoping it's the camera on the s-pen even
if it's going to be the craziest gimmick
of 2019 but that's just me leave us a
comment down below we looked into your
opinion friends again if you want to get
the news earlier follow was I'm packing

channels English and Spanish for more
