generation we call it the Moto G 2015
some people call it the Moto G three but
that's confusing whatever you call it
the newest mid-range smartphone out of
Motorola is more fully featured than
ever before and it's price tag has
barely gotten a bump
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
let's see if that combination is a
winning one in our video review of the
new Moto G iterative upgrades are
usually the name of the game by the time
you get to the third generation of any
smartphone but the more I use the new
Moto G the more I realize how big a jump
it is from its predecessor by and large
this jump is a good one the new mid
plate detail does a good job of making
it look slightly more upscale there's
now a metallic accent around the camera
complete with Motorola's trademark
finger dimple and there's ipx7
waterproofing - buyers can now customize
the phone using Moto maker previously a
privilege reserved for the higher-end
Moto X which means there are over 200
color variations available
all told under the hood the engines got
no tune up as well the Snapdragon 410
processor is Qualcomm z-- 64-bit answer
to last year's 400 and it backed up by
either one gig or two gigs of ram and 8
or 16 gigs of storage we're testing the
higher-end variant but either way you've
got microSD expansion as well if you
want to add more storage on your own
also in any case you're getting a 5 inch
720p LCD under Gorilla Glass 3 a pretty
sizable battery and very wide a 4G LTE
band support appropriate for a phone
that's launching in over 60 countries
how's all that hardware come together in
the hand well here's where the Moto G
shows its price a little the plastic
frame feels soft and cheap in the palm
evoking memories of the lightweight
galaxies of Samsung past the volume and
power buttons are mushy the vibration
motor is very weak and the display has
poor viewing angles low saturation and
milky blue grey blacks around back the
cover has nice tactility with its ribbed
texture kind of like the fiberglass
non-skid on a boat deck but it relies on
snaps to keep its twin gaskets in place
and it's not always evident when you've
missed one
I expect a few water damage claims in
this phones future flip the phone back
over and you'll see the first of many
software improvements Motorola's brought
to the G moto display which shows you
waiting notifications and the time
automatically when you pick it up or
pull it from a pocket underneath that is
a very close to stock build of android
5.1.1 with Google now anchored to the
left of the home screen and everything
else you'd expect from a de-facto Nexus
device including excellent
responsiveness the Moto Suite doesn't
stop at the display either you can set
custom behaviors for specific locations
so if your phone detects that you're at
your favorite burger joint it can
silence the ringer and let you beast
down your grub and piece or if you're
home
or driving it can dictate texts to you
and let you speak your replies probably
my favorite moto features are the quick
launch gestures turn the phone sideways
and give it a choppity choppity taggle
the flashlight on or off or give it a
twist to rest to jump into the camera
that ladder gesture is a little too
sensitive turn your phone over on a
tabletop and half the time you launch
the viewfinder but it is a really quick
and easy way to fire up the camera when
there's a shot you don't want to miss
that camera is the same sensor you'll
find in the Nexus 6
that's Sony's IMX 214 it sports a
resolution of 13 megapixels and f20
aperture a dual tone LED flash and a new
IR filter to reduce glare there's no
optical stabilization and the viewfinder
is as bare bones as every other Motorola
phone but keeping in mind the price
point of the Moto G this camera is very
impressive on paper and it's very
impressive in the real world - as long
as you're pouring a ton of light on the
scene outdoors in daylight colors are
vibrant and detail is impressive there's
plenty of sharpness here a particular
note is how dramatic a difference the
high dynamic range mode makes while some
phones barely do anything with HDR
switched on this camera really does a
nice
of brightening up the shadows also in
situations with a lot of hot zones the
manual exposure slider lets you tweak
the camera to prevent blowout you can
tease some really cool shots out of this
camera assuming again you have enough
light if you don't this camera is really
bad I mean truly that's to be expected
in near pitch dark conditions of course
but as we pointed out in last week's
comparison video the new Moto G is worse
than the old moto G in low-light
particularly when it comes to focus
problems and digital noise there's so
much noise in these pictures taken at
dusk that I had to check to make sure I
wasn't using some crazy texture filter I
didn't know about but nope that's just
how this camera works in low-light this
selfish shooter around front suffers
from similar problems it's got a nice 5
megapixel resolution but it often
struggles to bring enough light into the
scene and the level of processing noise
ranges from bad to comically bad focus
problems also dog photos taken with the
flash and there's nothing special going
on with video
we've used the new Moto G for six days
between Greater Boston and New York City
on AT&amp;amp;T and our test notes have brought
few surprises
the single front firing speakers --nt
the best or the loudest but it gets the
job done
a Motorola's famous noise cancellation
does great work eliminating wind noise
during phone calls I didn't have any
problem with cellular Wi-Fi or GPS
reception but I found the compass pretty
inconsistent and the lack of NFC will
bother people who are hoping to use
Google pay just like previous Moto G's
software performance is far better than
you'd expect given the mid-range
processor from day-to-day multitasking
to heavy gaming titles it more than
holds its own finally we got outstanding
endurance on our first cycle the Moto G
gave us over 6 hours of screen on time
over a nine hour period seemingly with
power to spare that's outstanding but I
haven't been able to reproduce it since
I tend to think that's because of an app
I've installed in the intervening time
or an update gone wrong or something
reports from other users and reviewers
seem to back up my favorable first
impression this phone lasts a good long
while
unfortunately the power saving mode
resulted in a hard crash of the software
on one occasion and there's also no
quick charge support here so going from
a dead cell to a full power pack will
take over two hours plenty of charging
accordingly motorola touts the new G as
its $179 smartphone but that's not the
one we tested our two gigs 16 gig
variant starts at 219 and with Moto
maker and accessory customizations the
price goes up from there
another question is is this a good $220
smartphone and the answer is it
qualified yes the qualification is this
it's not 2013 anymore and Motorola isn't
launching the G into a vacuum there are
competitors offering damn good value in
this price range now and with even
flagship phones coming down in price
these days the compromises of the Moto G
stand out more than they would have even
last year
still there's more than enough positive
here to balance out the negative the new
Moto G is a highly customizable
smartphone with excellent battery life
great performance and software that adds
usefulness without bogging it down if
you can live with its compromises in
camera and display it's absolutely a
solid Buy just spring for the
higher-priced here if you can
