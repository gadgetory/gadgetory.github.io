intera comm in this the software review
of the samsung galaxy note a cross
between an android tablet and android
smartphone so let's give to the software
so the samsung galaxy note comes bundled
with some pretty great software some of
it is a combination between tablet and
smartphone software so let's just check
out some of the widgets and i can either
use my s pen or i can use my finger to
just tap and hold and they can view the
widgets down here so i have all these
widgets that come stock on the galaxy
note and I can go through some of them
here let's just choose simple clock and
add a simple clock up here and let's say
that I wanted to add something else
let's just choose something let's choose
a picture frame and we can add that
it'll add it I can select the images
that I want and I hidden it ok so now I
can view the pictures then they will
display a slideshow on my device on the
home screen I have seven home screens to
choose from and I can have you some of
my favorite people up here so it can add
them so i can quickly just click on one
of them and it will begin calling or i
can send messages or whatnot I can view
my calendar which is pretty neat because
it is a widget directly on your home
screen and i also have let me just go
back here i also have my S Memo a little
widget right here so I can a view that
and I cannot begin writing so let's just
say I wanted to write hey how are you ok
so i can do that and i can save it
directly to my course my galaxy note and
i can view the memo right here on the
home screen so so many features about
the S Pen is it has a secondary button
and it will cause different action so
let's say I want to view the menu all i
have to do is hold down the secondary
button and slide the S Pen up if I want
to get rid of it all i have to do is go
back hold the S Pen and just slide over
to the left so this is pretty cool you
can also take screenshots of on any any
application or any program that you're
using just tap and hold and we'll take a
screenshot of whatever is on the screen
so then I can just go back home and I
can have you that screenshot if I'd like
so let's go into some of the application
and these are some apps that I've
installed and you can view the
applications most of them come standard
on most Samsung devices so here I have
the s planner which is my calendar and
it's pretty cool because if I turn it to
the side I get a tablet like interface I
can just click this button here and I
can view the week I cannot scroll back
and I can view the year if I'd like and
it's a pretty nice feature to have such
a large calendar on any smartphone so we
can just go back we can go into the
camera so the camera works really well
and we can go into the settings and
change some things we can have self
portrait which it turns on a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera we can have all
these different shooting modes so let me
go here I can have a smile shower beauty
panorama which is a nice thing that a
lot of Samsung phones come with we can
just go back let's say that we wanted to
add some effects we can do that and I
cannot just have it turn into a negative
and there we have a negative effect I
don't know if I have anything to
interesting around here take a photo of
but you can see it's a negative effect
you just go back and it also does record
in 1080p video we have social hub which
allows us to integrate our facebook
twitter and other social networking
sites directly on to the Galaxy Note so
here I can view some of the messages
from either Facebook or from twitter so
i can view some of these though i can do
other actions by clicking on here i can
reply retweet favorite and also message
this person and it can also be my
messages we can be music hub which
allows us to download music that's
either featured or some of the best
music available at this time so let's
say I wanted to be some of the top
tracks and just click on there and now
if I like one of these songs I can
purchase it directly from the galaxy
note readers hub allows you to view your
magazines and newspapers as well as your
books directly from the galaxy note and
the reading experience is pretty nice on
such a large display of course this is a
5.3 inch wxga resolution screen so you
won't have any eye strain for children
trying to read a small print or whatnot
so after the newspaper has been
downloaded directly to mine and Galaxy
Note I can either listen to the articles
or I can also click on them to read them
so let me just click on here we can
listen to this and some of the articles
have been read aloud so we cannot listen
to them directly from our device
nobody goes quietly in New York
movements two-month anniversary no will
show us some of the headlines and I can
also just click back to view the
newspaper itself just click on here and
we cannot pinch-to-zoom you can pan
another really cool feature about the S
Pen is the ability to take notes on any
application so all I have to do is hold
down the secondary button and double tab
and it will bring up a menu of these as
the S menu light and I can just take a
note here so let's say I wanted to write
down something so read rest of paper and
now I can save it and it will save it as
a no directly onto the galaxy no of
course so the video quality on the
galaxy note is phenomenal and if I click
on here I can watch one of the videos
because the screen is a Super AMOLED HD
display the colors are absolutely crisp
in comparison to other LCDs out there so
we'll just go a little bit faster let's
see here so the screen is absolutely
clear you have to realize that this is
the same number of pixels that is on the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 and also the samsung
galaxy tab 7 inch screen so fit into a
5-inch display it's amazing how crisp
the pixels are and the pixel density is
very a small very large i should say in
comparison to the size of the screen so
we'll just go back all share is a great
feature that comes on many samsung
devices what this application allows you
to do is to view videos photos and also
listen to music during network
connections let's hear in another room
and you want to listen to some music or
watch a video all you do is connect to
your remote device here and why connect
to my network drive and it will low in
just a second okay so now this video is
being streamed over my network
connection directly to the Galaxy Note
and of course it is pretty clear and it
doesn't buffer too much and comparison
to other media players because the
processor is so fast on this device if
you used a Samsung device in the past
most likely to use keys to sync up all
the content on your Android device so
here we can click on there and if I want
I can view directly that can view all
the files on my Galaxy Note by going to
this address on the browser of my
computer and let me just click stop and
there we can just go back out of this
application because the s-pen does use
walk on technology it allows you to have
pressure variances on various screen
gestures let me just go onto photo
editor and here if i want to write on
this particular photo and it just go
down to it these settings here and now i
can begin writing and if you see i'd
write something very light it shows a
very thin line and I there we go and if
I want to have a thicker line i can
press even harder and that's great if
you're an artist or you just want to jot
down something or even create something
pretty simple so i can also erase it
here let me just erase this i can change
the colors by going to this menu and i
can add select different colors and also
different writing utensils let me change
the thickness and f1 i have it read i
can go like that and i can try to make
it very thin on this one now if i want i
can also make it thick so a thin and
thick so there we go it's kind of simple
and it does work very well with the s
pen you can also use your finger but of
course you don't have the same pressure
control that you would have with the S
Pen video maker is probably one of the
best video editing applications that
I've seen on any smartphone or tablet
device so let's say I wanted to make a
video is all I do is click on one of
these let's choose a movie it'll select
this I can also choose between other
things so I can just click there who
click apply so if I want to add a video
to my timeline all if you do is tap and
hold and drag it down to the timeline
here I can scroll through the video
itself I can go up here it can add
photos if I like so let me just add a
photo and the essay I wanted to add a
photo there come on now I can just drag
and hold and drop it into this segment
here i can add a audio track I can also
add other photos and videos directly
from the camera so I can record right
now and edit the photo directly as I'm
as i'm recording it i can edit it as i'm
recording so you must click done and i
can preview the video and you can add
different transitions and different
effects you can change the lighting
features like going down here you can
add text you can do so many things with
this video editing application on the
movie maker mini diary allows you to
keep a journal on your galaxy note so
you want you can just add a photo here
like
choose something from the S menu or I
can choose something from the gallery or
the camera so I'm just going to skip all
this if I want to add a location i'll
just click on there it'll bring up my
current location and I can just attack
this and say done so if you want to add
text I can just go right here another
great thing about the galaxy note is it
does have writing a recognition so if
wanted to say hello of course I'm not a
very good writer I have horrible
horrible penmanship that is why I prefer
to type on a computer so as you can see
it was still able to recognize what I
was trying to say is I can click done
and then I can it'll just automatically
save itself I can just save it here as
well and it will save it onto my diary
Samsung Apps allows you to download of
course samsung apps for free directly
onto your Galaxy Note so just accept
this I just updated that particular
version of the Samsung absolutely okay
so i can click on the top apps and as
you can see all of these applications
are free so even angry birds seasons and
angry birds rio is free i'm not sure if
those are the ad supported versions or
not but we can also go to more and view
some other applications that are free
directly from these samsung apps with
the included headset installed TD 3.5
millimeter headphone jack i can go to
the FM radio and uses this headphone set
as an antenna so i can listen to music
and what not directly from the radio so
let me just us scan through a few
channels so there i can listen to that
station if I like either through the
headphones itself or through the speaker
and I can also change the alternate
frequency I can scan and add my own
favorite channels directly to this FM
radio Polaris Office is a full-featured
office application allows you to create
your own documents or you can also
search either through the device memory
itself or through your SD card so let me
just click on here and let's say when I
do add a document all I've do is click
on want to keep one of these and here it
can also use the writing utility if I
like or I can just type using the
keyboard and the keyboard works really
well it is kind of big so sometimes I've
noticed that I have to use two hands in
order to send a text message or to enter
document information cram physics is a
game that comes pre-installed on the
Galaxy Note so let me just zoom in it
for a second and we can just skip all
this stuff here and we can continue our
game so
if I want you can just click on here in
the object gets this game of course is
to I use various tools or what not to
get this circle over to the sub star so
if I want to just draw on the screen and
if I'm able to do that let me see if I
can knock something down here so I want
to bump the circle all the way over to
the star and you get the idea of how to
play this game if you're looking for
applications that work well with the S
Pen the s choice ties into the samsung
apps and has all these other free
applications available to download that
will use the S Pen or ever much are
pretty much a drawing or sketchings type
of application so i can just click out
of there so another nice feature about
the galaxy note is it does have the
voice controls that we've seen on the
galaxy s 2 s are Judy's double tap the
home screen and then I can use voice
controls memo make sure to pick up some
milk and some eggs from fred meyer so
there was able to recognize my voice and
then i can just save it directly to my
galaxy note and i have all these other
actions that I can control oregon's if
say hi galaxy and i can just go back to
this main screen here and select
something that i can input through my
voice so the galaxy note is an unlocked
GSM device so i can access AT&amp;amp;T 3g and
HSPA+ up to 21 megabits per second
speeds right now I'm toggling between 3g
and HSPA+ so let's just begin a speed
test and we can I see how fast this
device is able to access the network
speeds on AT&amp;amp;T and right now just
switched back to hspa+ so I've been
getting around six point seven six and a
half megabits per second download speed
around 2 megabits per second upload
speed so we can adjust allow this to
finish and it looks as though it's going
pretty fast so it's not too bad so it
can view the previous results right here
and this is in the greater seattle area
so you can see the most of the speed
tests are around 6.5 6.7 down line
around two up so the galaxy note also
has features that allows you to use the
gyroscope so if i want all if you do is
hold two fingers down and i can zoom in
and zoom out by tilting the device and
there's many other actions that are
available and i'll post those in the
final review are coming up next so the
galaxy note also has a great
email application it's kind of similar
to a tablet device in the sense that you
have your inbox over here and you have a
preview of your message right here so I
can just click on this and I can view my
facebook message or whatnot or whatever
message I have in my inbox in the
applications menu we can also add
folders to some of our favorite
applications so we can organize our
application screens we can go down here
and change some of our most used
applications and features on the Galaxy
Note so let me just go back I can also
change it to a list view so it will show
me all the applications that i have in
an alphabetical order from the list view
because this is an unlocked android
device we can access Wi-Fi hotspots
directly from our wireless and network
so if i want you can just go to
tethering and portable hotspots and we
can use this as a Wi-Fi hotspot through
a 3g connection the live wallpapers that
are included are here and we can have
you some of those and they're pretty
similar to the other ones that we've
seen on other samsung devices so here's
all the live wallpapers are included so
this has been the software review of the
samsung galaxy note and if you like our
videos make sure to give us a thumbs up
