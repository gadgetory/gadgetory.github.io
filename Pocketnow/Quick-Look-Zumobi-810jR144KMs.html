a quick look at
today I'm going to give a quick
run-through
asian works first just want to let you
know that I am running the application
on my 18 d tilt and using a Wi-Fi
connection so if I tap on the Z here
starts the application of the first
thing you'll see is this message to zoom
out you see kind of a reminder of how
the application kind of works once it
goes through that you get this end users
license agreement you only get this the
first time you start up the application
so I just accept it and you brought into
the sign in screen a few things I don't
like about the sign in screen is one
year on-screen keyboard obscures the
view of your password field so in order
to see it you minimize your screen and
there you can see it but the run you run
into another problem your option for
your soft input panel your on-screen
keyboard disappear there's no way to tap
on the screen to get back to it unless
you either one tap on the on the one of
the fields but that caused this proved
problematic because you can't see what
you're typing so what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to take off my tilt
off of the cradle i'm using and you can
see we can sign in here but there's
another problem i don't like about this
is when you type in your password it
actually shows all the letters that
you've typed in and then zoom in here
see if you can see that so it doesn't
obscure it with the normal asterisks
like most other applications do that's
problematic for me just because of
security concerns someone could look
over your shoulder and see a password
you're typing not that most people would
but again it's just a security concern I
have so I will be right back in a second
I'm going to sign into sumo be and
continue with the demonstration so now
I've logged into sumo be and what I
didn't show you was how long it took to
actually log in for the first time which
is about 30 to 40 seconds part of that
was because it was a first time login it
was downloading the content into each of
the tiles subsequent logins won't take
as long so now we see the 16 tiles here
across the screen
and in between every four tiles or
quadrant there's a center tile which
actually zooms in to show you a larger
view of each of the individual tiles if
you are using a non-touchscreen device
you can use the one the 37 or the nine
key in your keypad to zoom in or you
could also use a d-pad same with the
touchscreen devices and on the
touchscreen devices you can just use
your finger to zoom in one of the things
I didn't like about this was each of
these individual tiles looks like
another finger friendly size but tapping
on it doesn't bring you to that
individual tile just brings you into
this zoomed view so for touchscreen
device users that just means an extra
step for you to get to your content my
my opinion kind of a poor choice and
usability here so here we've got into
one of the quadrants and you can see for
larger views of the tiles and in the
center is another tile which is used for
navigation if you are using your keypad
you can use the 13 the seven or the nine
to access the individual tiles or you
can use the two four six or eight to
move into one of the other quadrants the
Z button there will actually just zoom
you out to the main screen across the
button we have a inbox key a menu key
and a help screen key the inbox in the
menu kind of bring you to the same area
sorry if I tap on the inbox it just
brings you to this and here you see your
inbox and in this inbox these are tiles
that you've sent to yourself either from
Zoo movies website or tiles you've sent
from zoo mobi itself or tiles that your
friends may have sent you scrolling to
the right we have a deleted box which is
tiles that have been deleted after
replacing them with new tiles on the
main screen you have also featured tiles
by this Moby staff you have an options
key here to update your data manually or
to exit the application
and then here you can access the help
screen which just helps you navigate the
the application to get out you just tap
this X key here and we're back to this
view so if I tap on one of the
individual tiles for example here the
Associated Press's international news
will get some contents like the new news
for the day and if i use my d-pad or the
scroll wheel i can pick one of the
articles so I'm going to pick this
article here and it just gives you a
quick peek at what the news article is
about again you can use your scroll
wheel or your d-pad to read the article
to get to other articles you can either
use the left right arrows at the top or
if you use your d-pad and then across
the bottom you'll notice a banner ad a
sponsor key and unlabeled 82 key and a
rate tile key tapping on the event the
banner ad the 8th or the seven actually
i'll do the same thing it just sends
that tiles information or that Bay that
sponsors information to your inbox so
you can add that tile to your your
screen if you want to why they need it
three of these I don't know I think they
could have used it for something
different something I also take notice
of is the rate tile key this just lets
you rate the towel if you know how much
you like it and then the other thing I
noticed was the windows soft keys don't
do anything here so it's again just a
poor usability design here the ok button
doesn't do anything it just actually
brings up the start menu which kind of
surprises me and actually clicking the
start menu button doesn't minimize it
you actually have to tap it on the
screen p is the Z key it just zooms you
back out
now if you want to replace content you
actually just go back to your menu here
and I'm going to go back to the inbox
as you can see this application actually
takes a while to just navigate through
the screens which again makes it makes
it a little difficult to use on a daily
basis but let's go to my inbox and
there's some tiles here and let's just
say if I'm interested in looks like this
one's called ap strange so if I tap on
it gives you a quick quick quick
synopsis of what it is just says ap
strange news and if I want to add it I
just click Add and then I have to choose
a title to replace that I don't want to
use you can use your keypad or you can
just tap on one of the icons here I'll
just tap it right here I'm actually
tapping on it doesn't work you actually
have to just use the center button on
your d-pad again another poor usability
is a design here and so now it's been
added to the screen
as you can see actually takes a while
for it to load that information on so if
i zoom in here I now have AP strange
news overall this seems like an
interesting design but the slowness of
the interface and just some of the
design features just don't make it easy
to use so this has been raved wand with
a quick look at ads and mobi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
