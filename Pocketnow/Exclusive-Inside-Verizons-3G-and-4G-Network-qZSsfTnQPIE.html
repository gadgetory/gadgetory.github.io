pocketnow.com when you hit Send
on your phone or when you try to access
a webpage on your smart phone device or
your tablet a lots happening involving
cell phone towers and switches and
networking and so much other advanced
technical stuff today we got to tour
exclusively the Verizon Wireless switch
located somewhere in Southeast
Pennsylvania can't even tell you where
it is it's the brain of the Verizon
network in this area it's where all of
the cell phone towers connect to it's
where everything happens when you hit
Send or when you go to a web site on
your device in this video we're going to
show you exclusively some of the
components of that system we're going to
find out a lot of information about how
Verizon Wireless is system works and how
cell phone systems work in general it's
going to be interesting let's get to it
so we are about to enter the switch room
and Dan's going to tell us a little bit
about what we're going to see inside
inside switch room - you're going to see
a 3G digital stylus which along with a
ecp complex also in this room is our we
call our distribution center which is a
data transport which handles all the
internet calls we hear and our sister
site located in a region we also going
to take a tour of the LTE equipment for
the new network and deployed in the last
year so this is the 3G equipment in here
3gn forging and for use in this room got
it so you make a call it goes to the
tower it goes up to the cloud down to
this place and then into this room
basically is that it is a choice of here
or one of two sites two sites got it and
how does the how does that get
determined which site it goes to just
traffic and
yeah it's very loud but hopefully
what are all these boxes in these rows
behind me is a 3G equipment that I
mentioned this is the climbing
complexes
so those are for 3G data behind 3G data
the waste and data
what is it about CDMA where you can't
make a call and be on the web at the
same time well
BMA world one per game
porgy
over LTE right right
and so voice over LTE is going to be a
big deal
certainly will be
which over ideas a common practice today
right
so bright pain that
ever signs on the hand
we face baby
voiceover LTE
the processing cow
which streamline
which a ride LTE
great any estimated year rollout for
voice over LTE we had Lowell McAdam and
made
right that we made
apparently it's very crisp and clear
have you heard voiceover LTE yourself
and personally I have not what has been
described to me is it's more of boys
over IP eight
hi
have background noise
it does that without hardware it's
because you can do newest cancellation
with a phone that has two two
microphones what you're saying voice
over LTE dynamically reduces background
the best correct that's amazing
very good so so what is inside of all of
these things a lot of stuff that's not
multiple servers
it must require a lot of power to make
all this run yes actually later Natur
we're going to tour the
battery backup systems
this is uh this is our voicemail
platform voicemail subscriber it is not
in service call
so there are a lot of hard drives in
there basically reporting there's a
so so these four boxes cover voicemail
for this region now this voicemail box
actually covers
what Regents does this building serve
when you're building the distribution
center actually covers from Delaware
to New Jersey for the future
so so if I'm in Delaware and I make a
phone call on a Verizon phone it's
likely that it's getting crowded through
here
50/50 chances and there's another
facility so my call goes to where in
this room first
for example
that's that's not easy to explain I mean
there's multiple different scenarios
you will layer
so it depends on time of day traffic
that's what you're doing
thanks like making the call from
Delaware I'm calling my grandma in
California the call arrives here and
then what happens to the call to connect
grandma's phone
we then connect to our distributions
it'd be routed to
are you use the
so how often to someone come in here and
change the switches and unplug stuff
Weston consoles are always were always
doing
so if you wanted to increase the amount
of users that can be I don't know making
a fall one-time or be online at one time
does someone come in here and move some
things around now
doing it do it at night but you would
come here to an emergency scenario
and so the technicians are sort of
watching from another location maybe
within this building some data on a
screen to see that the health of the
network and what's going on for said
what if they see something pop off they
come down here and they make it make an
adjustment
right
I would say I'd have his current LTE
devices can do 10 20 megabits per second
down if you wanted to go to a hundred
where where would that change happen is
that like a switch in here in all like
multiple places I would really would be
it won't be in here but it would also be
and and why not just turn that on today
I mean what's what's keeping you you
know at a certain speed until you go to
the next speed
because if you turn up the speeds on
there might be some problems
so in terms of the hardware what is the
heart what needs happen with the
hardware to go from 20 megabits per
second to 150 years so LTE
and specification does allow you to get
to those
and 100 eggs I went to normal
yes to our change that have to
one of the bigger issues is
the hardware itself
bikes 4j devices today vanished
to achieve the maximum
they actually say 40m taxes of the OEMs
to come out with hardware that has
before it a canyon in ten
low cost of manufacturing and right now
is that lte-advanced now healthy
and what are the theoretical maximum
speeds of lte-advanced
it's got to be pretty pretty oh it has
to be
so do you do you hear RV is actually our
network
so this is the LTE correct the
embarrasses of this network
another hard layer protection
what's different about this equipment
than the 3G equipment that makes LTE so
much faster
the equipment different how is the
equipment different
it's just new technology baby hurry
everyone
actually back to the issue that we just
talked about
there are
seems that around here peak benefits
the key differences
earlier is he
that's right there is
they're out there that's how we're able
to realize
so LT is really a combination of
technologies that allow for faster
speeds absolutely so we are in the
battery room and everything you just saw
is sped out of this room off of DC power
so these batteries and liquid are
constantly being charged and then
discharged the reason that they do this
stand is when we lose commercial power
the facility has a way for a
so there's there's two levels it goes a
battery power then it goes the generator
power if the main power goes down
because of whatever he's heading even in
the worst case scenario it's another
layer of protection
for several hours so
so that was giving my next function how
long did his battery last for several
hours below so all of these batteries
can feed everything that happened in
that other room that's what I mean is it
this is one of Ultimo better
so what are the other benefits of having
your own power supply here with these
batteries feeding the other room well as
we talked about electrons anybody that's
been in home and I understand you have
your
fluctuations power when you see what
go away on vacation they tell you to
turn everything off the applause the
need is not filter this design of
it helps the longevity of the equipment
that we saw in the other
but it is a great alternative where
everything comes through
and makes for a more cost
got it so it improves the longevity of
the equipment and also does it help in
any other ways helps with stability as
well yeah those pickups that you see out
there I don't know what the end result
would be what would the design that we
have here it eliminates any
as you can see we are in a much quieter
generator room where obviously if the
power's lost those batteries discharged
then they need more power these things
turn on right they actually power on by
themselves automatically obviously
trades for prints for power to our to
our DC power tonight
so both of these there are two of them
in here both of these would turn on or
would they one would turn on and then
load of not needed one will shut down so
kind of intelligently manages Wow kind
of an engine guy you know how much
horsepower is this eggs are quite loud
with her right you can't be here without
I hear - you love to put one of those in
a car
yeah really big car so in terms of power
management every cell phone tower or
most cell phone towers have their own
generating system that is correct
approximately 85% of our towers have
generators - so while everyone of them
is designed with battery backup and they
are designed for eight hours of support
they also have diesel generators in
there the reason for the delta between
naught and 100% is there are certain
towers that might be on top of a
building might be on structures that
cannot accommodate that so we put a lot
of effort a lot of time and effort and
planning into making sure that our
network stays up and is reliable so we
are about to enter the control room
although we're going to keep the camera
off what is inside the control room
inside the controller is where we
monitor all the systems that we just
toured in the embassy so there will be
lots of computer screens monitoring lots
of data rack yeah we see real-time
information on ours how our equipment is
performing and if there's any issues we
can react to them accordingly dispatch
your cell technicians cell towers as so
people are in here monitoring it 24/7
basically edit this this room is
moderate handle 24 by 7 and also we have
our network operations control center
can you speak to what data they're
looking at what stats they're looking
out for in order to respond to problem
the performance of the whole network got
it
the law is amount of a network engineer
very good so I've got some cell phone
tower questions for you things I think
most people have wondered when they
place a call on their phone when they go
to a website on their phone I guess the
the first question would be in the
design of the cell phone tower they're
all the same height it seems is that is
that accurate to say um vary between 100
feet to
right and and most of them at the top or
all of them have these what looked like
tentacles and sometimes there are
multiple levels of tentacles I know
that's a horrible way of explaining them
what what are they and what is their
function there's multiple array of
antennas and if you see different like
you said layers of them I guess
typically it's a co-located site like
Harry mentioned earlier Souls have on
this tower outside you have Verizon
Wireless you have ITT I think metro pcs
right as well so is there is there a
more favorable position like the bottom
tentacles are better than the top no I
mean that typically the higher the
better in row where is from welcoming
the higher you can see the more you
cover all right but I mean the
difference is in ten feet so it's not
much difference got it
and can you explain what happens when I
press send on my phone when I make a
call from transmission of the signal to
the tower and then what happens after
that
what dependent service we're talking
about but for a 3G service essentially
the cell site axes is relatively dumb so
it'll just send whatever you're
requesting on to as Dan mentioned the
RNC 3 video or for one action to come
back to the switching office and it will
determine what you're allowed to do if
you're allowed to have that service for
example right
it'll assign you what we call a traffic
channel to allow you to start talking
and it will relay that back to the cell
site and it will send that to you have a
call for G the sites are little more
intelligent they do a lot of that on
their own and that's part of the reason
why weeks one of the many reasons why
it's faster interesting and that all
happens in a second which is amazing all
the time
what determines how many calls can be
placed on a tower at the same time would
be the amount of spectrum are using
their allocated in chunks we deploy them
based on the needs in the area so if
we're talking about
a state of environment will allocate all
of our spectrum there we're talking
about a roller environment with those
fewer users will allocate less and you
know as we see the need increase we
allocate more and that's basically a
limiting factor and is there a way to
increase the amount of simultaneous
calls on a tower or is it just a matter
of putting up more towers oh no no
there's definitely ways to increase
there's a lot of sophisticated
algorithms that we can deploy that will
dynamically shift the traffic traffic
how its utilized that kind of thing of
course adding a tower will add a lot
more capacity but there's a lot of ways
to do it within the Clemente hub and in
terms of cell phone tower placement you
see them more than ever these days
sometimes they're disguised as trees
which is always funny to see are these
placed strategically based on you know
company anticipates they're going to be
X amount of collars here X amount of
cars there or is there like some formula
you use to say they need to be spread
one or two miles apart in order to
achieve a certain result it depends on
the goal of the site so for example we
have rural sites that we just want to
provide coverage and those can serve for
miles many miles sometimes right um so
we'll put them into Pat weep so we have
tools that will estimate propagation of
different sites so if it's the goal of
that area is to serve just provide
coverage we'll just run that simulation
and determine where we went into town or
we start the search process for a tower
there in the city it's more frequently a
capacity concern right so we find the
most loaded sites and we determine how
the best way to offload them would be
typically by deploying those like it's
combination of factors do you foresee a
future where cellphone towers are no
longer needed maybe the phone can
communicate with a satellite it has
enough power to beam up to a satellite
and the satellite beams down to a data
center or do you think we'll always have
to have cell phone towers uh well I
would say towers are going to be the way
to go
future uh they're getting smaller
there's
new technologies that are going to allow
us to have more of them and not need a
big piece of land or have to rent a
space or even smaller towers many cells
if you could have an atom for example
you want to see a lot of the towers
there you know 20 feet high and there's
a building for example right you often
see them on billboards sometimes and
sides of buildings very interesting
yeah the deployment of towers is our
last resort I mean like I said there's
lots of ways we can enhance coverage and
capacity with what we have today so we
typically go through all those steps
before we say okay now we have to go
into place so you don't want to have to
avoid you want to avoid building Tower
because it's disruptive to the area it's
expensive there's lots of opposition to
seeing towers people whose backyard can
you give me an estimation whether it's
in the tens hundreds or thousands of how
many calls a cell phone tower can handle
it's the one thousand interesting I'm
not sure what the perception is out
there but that's that's interesting and
is that the same for data it can accept
potentially thousands of data
connections at one time or is that lower
oh you know it's thousands of voice
those and thousands of data calls is
interesting and well LTE voice over LTE
when that becomes available will that
increase the amount of people that can
carry out a phone call in one tower yeah
that's the whole idea is you get a lot
more capacity games from whatever I feed
because of the nature of points of right
so tell me about spectrum I think I
think some people understand that some
people don't you know a long time ago
Verizon won the auction for the 700
megahertz spectrum which is what does
that mean 7r mega-rich is is a it's the
frequency range right so we operate in
within 10 megahertz well 20 makers total
the 10 megahertz on one one way in the
seventh megahertz spectrum so
your voice is at a certain spectrum when
you talk your your house phone is a
certain spectrum and your cell phones
now I'm going to be at the 4G phone
we'll be at the seminar members so so
spectrum back to physics class is the
frequency of the wave that your phone
creates right and so is lower better is
higher better fundamentally
fundamentally lower is better in terms
of the propagation so you because kind
of like a a subwoofer has a lower
frequency you can go through things so
lower frequency is better so 700
megahertz has good what's the word
penetration through walls and other
structures like that and so there
recently was more news about Verizon
buying spectrum what's what's that about
exciting news yeah we talked about
spectrum and we talked about the ability
to be able to support higher bandwidths
more spectrum means you know more
bandwidth higher speeds we were able to
secure additional spectrum with the
partnership that we are forming with
Comcast where they were able to free up
spectrum for us we spent 3.6 billion
dollars to be able to increase that
capacity in about 75% of the country
we're able to grow by another 20
megahertz putting us in a better
position to handle not only the needs of
2012 but deep into you know future years
so can you talk a little bit about the
adoption rates of smartphones and how
many people are using smartphones in
terms of percentage of overall users
great question and that number continues
to climb but the last statistic that I
have seen is talking about that
smartphones there's over 40 percent
penetration of smartphones meaning that
over 40 percent of those that have cell
phones are using smartphones one of the
interesting trends that we're seeing
today is many of those customers are
migrating now to the latest generation
which is the 4G LTE smartphones there
have been improvements in that space in
terms of battery life overall
capabilities which is an amazing thing
because you think about the 4G
smartphones they're now coming with
front-facing cameras to be able to
support video chat that is something
that's a growing demand that's out there
it does increase the overall usage which
is one of the reasons why we are working
real hard to stay ahead
that demand and if I'm a new user and I
want to get a smartphone for the first
time it's very likely that I'll pay that
a little bit of extra first time
investment to get the 4G smartphone
because caught the cost of ownership
long term between a 4G know 3d
smartphone is very similar great point
but let me off set that is terms of the
equipment itself yes you may realize a
premium for the 4G and those
capabilities with the increased and you
know two cameras on the device what we
have done though is we have a promotion
that's on right now called double your
data if you buy a 4G smartphone you get
twice as much usage for the same amount
of money that makes sense so the total
cost of ownership actually when you look
at it that way is either a wash or
better with 4G and it helps that 4G
technologies are more efficient on your
ends that was one of the keys that's how
we're able to extend that benefit to the
customer so that was a look at the
switch I hope you enjoyed it very
technical stuff certainly but hopefully
give you a better idea of what happens
when you press send on your phone and
that calls connected in two or three
seconds it's pretty amazing the
engineering that goes into cell phone
network technology of today if you like
this video please give us a thumbs up
and thanks for watching that's it for
now
