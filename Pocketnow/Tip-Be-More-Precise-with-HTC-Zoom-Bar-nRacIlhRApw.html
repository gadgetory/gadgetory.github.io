pocketnow.com so newer HTC devices like
the HTC tilt 2 or the touch pro two are
equipped with the zoom slider along the
bottom yet to see that on the HTC p or
two or the diamond to trouble is and
we've heard from a lot of our readers
that the zoom slider doesn't get much
use because it's not very precise so if
you go and zoom in on this page you're
zoomed to sort of an arbitrary position
on the page what if you wanted to zoom
in to the center section or the right
sidebar or something like that we've
come up with a way and some of you
probably already employed this method to
use the zoom slider so that it's more
precise it requires two hands which may
slow you down a little bit if you're
walking down the street and are trying
to navigate a website but it should
definitely help you out if you are able
to use two hands so we're going to go
into landscape and quite simply this is
what you do you use your right finger to
zoom and your left finger to pen again
this may seem obvious but it really
helps tremendously to be able to
position the page with your left finger
and zoom with your right and it works
quite well also in photos so let's get
out of this and go into the HTC photo
gallery okay so here we're on the photo
gallery let's just pick one of these
pictures let's pick the the fish picture
and if we zoom in we're taken to a
random spot in the picture sometimes the
center sometimes another quadrant but if
we turn the device the other way to use
two hands and we use the zoom slider on
the right and our left finger to pan it
becomes much more precise to zoom in
quickly to a certain area on the screen
so let's go to another one and say we
want to zoom into this area over here
makes a little bit faster and a little
bit more easy to zoom into a particular
area so that was just a quick tip on how
to better use the zoom slider that has
become quite common on the newer HTC
devices that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
