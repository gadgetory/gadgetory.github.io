pocketnow.com and today we're here to do
a hardware tour of the samsung fascinate
which is verizon's version of the galaxy
s so although you've seen a lot of us a
lot of hardware tours of the galaxy s
variants before there are a few slight
differences on this one that you'll
probably want to take note of so join us
please so the first thing you'll notice
about the fascinate is that it probably
resembles on t-mobile's version of the
synth of the galaxy s most which is the
vibrant the difference is that you'll
notice are probably slightly less of a
chrome bezel on the fascinate and on the
vibrant and of course the speaker
location is down here while on the
vibrant it is up here and while we're
around the back you'll notice that this
version of the galaxy s has a flash the
only other American variant to have a
flash is the epic 4g even the unlocked
version that is sold in europe does not
have a flash not it as a captivate and
not it as the vibrant so right there the
fascinate has bit of an advantage over
its sum over its competitors so to speak
now you'll also notice that unlike the
unlocked version of the galaxy s we have
four buttons down here similar to the
captivate and the vibrant and just like
those other models the buttons are
capacitive meaning they're flush against
the body which is kind of annoying in in
low light because they don't light up
until you press them but just feeling
your way around can sometimes trigger a
button and can lead to a lot of unwanted
actions so what else do we have
to compare here well as you probably
know the galaxy s unlocked version only
has two buttons down here along with a
center pad here and a samsung logo is up
top most of the u.s. variants have moved
that logo down to the bottom so that the
carrier can brand at the top where its
most visible so let's see power button
is over here as you would expect up top
is your standard 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and a little micro USB
port with a sliding door cover which has
gotten mixed reviews personally I like
it this is coming from someone who's
been using a LG expo for some time and
the way they cover the door is with a
little flap that you have to really dig
your nail under and then it kind of
hangs off to the side there when you you
know you have it plugged in for audio or
whatever and it can really be a pain so
I like the idea of a sliding door cover
keeps it dust free and it also keeps the
door out of the way so on this side of
the phone you'll notice the standard
volume buttons that were used to unlike
the captivate the fascinate has a solid
back this is more like the vibrant
actually where you remember the
captivate only a portion of the battery
cover comes off maybe that much but it
is solid metal as opposed to this which
is solid plastic looking inside we have
the samsung 1500 mili amp hour battery
that you're so used to along with the 16
gigabyte microSD card that comes
standard with all the galaxy s's one
thing that's a little bit different here
that we don't necessarily like besides
the somewhat difficulty and putting the
battery cover back on is the fact that
the speakerphone let's see if you can
see it here is covered by this tiny
little raised nub
and I don't know if you can see but if
you run your finger over it it's not
flat with the back and it has sort of a
chintzy feeling to it so we can we can
see that it might fall off over time on
the plus side that might actually give
you a little bit better speaker volume
because there's nothing blocking the
speaker grille also unlike the vibrant
there's no chin on this one so as far as
I'm just the body style goes the
fascinate is probably most similar to
the unlocked Galaxy S and that it's very
iPhone like and or I'm sorry iphone 3g
like in terms of its um you know curved
back and metal accents right here so it
really does it really is in our opinion
the most similar to the the original
Galaxy S let's see one other thing that
we noticed which we didn't like as
compared to the epic 4g is first of all
sprint includes a headset with the epic
4g which you don't get with the
fascinate in fact you don't get any
other accessories as you probably
remember from our unboxing except for a
wall plug and then a cable that doubles
as a sink and charger so you don't even
get separate done syncing and charging
cables they're both combined into one
the epic 4g does have a camera button
right here and the fascinate does not so
if you want to take a picture when the
phone is on you have to actually go to
the camera application like that and
then once you're in the app you have to
use the on-screen button to take a
picture it's really not very convenient
for um for just taking a for taking a
shot you know on the go without having
to think too much about it so we're not
a huge fan of that otherwise though the
body structure here is very
ice feels a little bit better in the
hand and say droid x was just just a
little too big in our opinion although
you know you can't beat that screen size
when it comes to web browsing so to
compare the two here you know there
definitely is significant size
difference but it's less noticeable in
the pocket because the Samsung is so
much thinner looks to us about you know
couple tenths of a millimeter thinner so
that's all we have for you right now the
fascinate hardware tour but stay tuned
as will have a software tour coming up
and then of course a full review where
you can see our opinions on the entire
package so that's it for now and thank
you for watching bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
