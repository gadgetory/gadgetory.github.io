Galaxy Note ending was already revealed
and it seems interesting because of the
timing we get some dummies of the Huawei
made 20 pro which have clear but
bezel as display and seems that Samsung
is picking Qualcomm technology in order
to bring their on display fingerprint
scanner I'm Jaime Rivera still in San
Francisco actually close to the YouTube
headquarters for something really
awesome happening tomorrow and we are
also remembering the lives of those lost
at 9/11 this is PocketNow daily powered
by qualcomm the official news today
begin with deals pretty much every
single retailer is currently offering
the samsung galaxy as 9 duo meaning the
plus and the regular for a starting
price that's crazy starting at 629
depending on the variant that you're
looking for and i'm talking about pretty
much almost every store out there and i
know i repeated pretty much like four
times already but anyways you got the
picture you can learn more about the
deals in the description now for those
of you that have been following all the
leaks of iphones lately and you saw the
leaked photos of the iphone prototypes
in red blue and white recently patriotic
yes i know apparently these weren't
dummies it turns out that trusted
sources claimed these are actually
prototype units so this actually spurs
the rumors even better remember tomorrow
is the event and by the way remember the
price of your current iphone is about to
drop significantly after that event it's
about that time to list it on swapper to
get the best resale value or get a good
deal for a current iphone right now you
can learn more about that in the
description as well now some very
interesting rumors have samsung already
working together with Qualcomm on their
fingerprint scanner technology for the
on display fingerprint scanner of the
samsung galaxy s 10 so yes the
technology is coming we're hearing that
it's going to come to at least to the
two of the variants are probably the
three not exactly sure but apparently we
are going to have this technology coming
over and we're really curious as to how
that works as a Qualcomm has proven
they've been doing some amazing job
lately so we'll see now this one's the
spotlight over to the huawei mate 20 and
mate 20 Pro we've got some leaked images
of the front of the phone on dummy units
and
my god like there are very little bezels
there's a significant notch I can't deny
that but the bezels on the rest of the
chassis are very insignificant it looks
extremely cool I can't deny that I'm
really looking forward to the stone
particularly with all the changes that
are coming and internals and everything
stay tuned on that one and finally the
hot news that they have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 in the comments
over why we're picking this topic as the
hottest one well we've got a codename
apparently it is the Vinci and the
reason why we have a codename now is
because sources claim that the note is
going to launch with the S 10 at the
same time and we're hearing huge revamps
here so of the Vinci what could it be
let us know in the comments down below
what do you think I mean we just got the
note 9 I've barely just reviewed it it's
a hot phone are you ready for another
note leave us a comment down below we
love to know your opinion what if I told
you that your future SmartWatch will
also be smart enough to know how to be a
regular watch when you need it to the
new Qualcomm Snapdragon wear 3100
platform has a cool new feature called
traditional watch mode if you're ever
low on battery this will switch where OS
off and keep ticking as a regular watch
for about a week without a charge you
can also switch on traditional watch
mode with a full charge and go for 30
days without a charger hit the link in
the description below to learn why the
new Qualcomm Snapdragon wear 3100 is so
cool
