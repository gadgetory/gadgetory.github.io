expected for both models rumored Google
now plans to expand and help you find
things all around you and Samsung start
suing publications / reviews of the
galaxy s5 I'm hi Nelly that and then
it's sad when somebody can't take
feedback or not lightly at least this is
parking out daily now this is kind of
interesting if we start today off with
the official news as always as Samsung
is currently suing the electronic times
because uh they did not like the review
of the galaxy s5 and the reason why this
is interesting is because first of all
review units have not shipped to
everybody yet it hasn't arrived with the
pocket now labs just yet so a lot of
these publications have gotten their
phones somehow i'm not going to specify
which way and obviously some of these
phones apparently had issues we know
about the iso cell camera issues and the
six lens that samsung is using for this
phone so probably the company wants
three hundred thousand dollars in
damages over that review and you know if
x2 wonder i mean why do you push out a
product that doesn't abide to a review i
mean you know what you're risking now
let's talk about apple as there are some
recent corporate shakeups we know that
Jony ive has taken over the design
portion of iOS ever since iowa seven and
it turns out that the company's lead
designer of iOS ever since it was
invented is now leaving Greg Christie
he's pretty much designed the lock
screens is about everything that has
become ubiquitous and smartphones lately
and apparently this is because they were
not getting along together so now Johnny
I will take over the whole design
portion of iOS 7 he will not be having
any more issues apparently which is odd
apparently all this has to do with Scott
Forstall we know that nobody really like
the guy so stay tuned let's see what to
expect for iOS 8 I thought about nokia
as we know the company is still waiting
for the chinese government to approve
the buyout of microsoft before going
ahead with a transaction and it turns
out the company has published a
statement today confirming that they
don't plan to become a patent troll the
company is probably one of the best
companies out there handling pens and
licenses to everybody I mean they do a
pretty good job at it nobody's actually
ever having issues with Nokia with this
and well the company has just issued a
statement just to confirm that they
won't be
does even after the hands of the vision
becomes part of Microsoft because nokia
will retain the patents microsoft just
keeps the hands of the vision so
interesting let's hope that after this
this merger happens now let's continue
talking about apple for those of you
waiting for the iphone 6 in either 4.7
inch or 5.5 inch models as rumors
haven't well it turns out that some
credible sources pointed the company
will not begin production of the 4.7
inch device until July and apparently
the 5.5 inch model will not be launched
until sometime it's a temperate I'm
talking about mass production so it
could be months after that for these
phones to be launched it could be that
we will be expecting the bigger phablet
until spring it doesn't really make
sense right now as we were expecting for
something to happen at WWDC and there
were a lot of big rumors out there but
anyway stay tuned we never know what
Apple could be planning next and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
there are some leaked documents in code
that show that google is planning to
bring new functionality to google now
apparently this functionality will allow
you to find your car in a parking lot
which would be perfect for some people
that i know that never find their cars
in a parking lot this would be great
apparently you just leave and Google now
will remember where you left your car
and eventually you could just ask it to
direct you and it'll do the job and
that's really interesting hopefully
Google figures out a way to do this
especially if you're underground as GPS
functionality is never really perfect
underground but that leaves you see the
question of the day what command is left
for Google now that you want what
command would you wish that Google now
did that it currently doesn't do but in
my particular case it's kind of hard I
mean it doesn't really good job for me
so far but hey I would love for it to
order dinner for me especially right now
but leave us a comment down below what
do you want and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
