get teased even if not all 2017 trends
will be followed users have begun to
complain about yet another thing about
the display of the google pixel to excel
and it seems that ipads might adopt the
technology of the iphone 10 but not all
of it I'm Jaime Rivera and my comments
yesterday about the lighting were not a
complaint for those of you in the
comments it was really because we love
to provide you guys with great video
quality and this can be frustrating
whenever the hotels don't have that but
hey it's not a complaint just a
disclaimer this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with deals
this time from Walmart for Black Friday
and this is when you really want to
write down Walmart is offering a $300
card for you to purchase either an
iPhone 10 an iPhone 8 or a Galaxy Note 8
yeah I think that's exactly where you're
supposed to be so that is probably one
of the best deals that I've seen so far
but we're just getting close to Black
Friday now let's talk about gigabit LTE
speeds t-mobile and Paul calm I was
recently part of an event here in San
Jose where we got to see gigabit LTE
speeds today on the t-mobile network on
devices being powered by the Snapdragon
835 and they're up to 430 markets that
can or will be able to harness this
technology if not now very soon you can
learn more about it in the link of the
description point about is a yeah if
you've got newer technology you will be
able to get crazy data speeds and if you
don't this is probably the best time to
upgrade and you should probably
reconsider upgrading to things like an
iphone antenna don't support this as
right now again only high-end flagships
with a snapdragon 835 on t-mobile will
be able to achieve these data speeds the
spotlight over to iPads that are coming
in 2018 people are still bored by
tablets for reasons I don't understand I
need a tablet for work all the time but
still it seems a 20-18 iPad will bring
apples face ID technology which is
interesting with all the yield issues
that Apple was having but the problem is
that even though you will be getting
this new technology you will
will not be getting apparently OLED
displays it seems that Apple wants to
bring this borderless design to LCDs as
well and we've been hearing rumors about
Japan display in everything we just
didn't think it would happen with iPads
we thought it would happen with iPhones
so stay tuned it's all about the Google
pixel to excel I have been enjoying the
saturated mode for two days and I think
this just became probably one of my
favorite phones now that the screen is
fixed but apparently that's my case
we've got people that are complaining
about screen flickering or screen
flashing and note we're not having it in
our units and I was recently in a room
with at least 10 people having a pixel
2xl nobody's had that problem but yeah
you might want to consider talking to
Google about that we will report more as
we learn more the only issue I have is
with the auto brightness it seems to be
very jittery but hey they had to rush
this update so I kind of understand it
and finally the hot news today have to
do with the 1 + 5 t what are the
flagships that we are waiting for those
of you that are wondering what features
you're getting well we have heard about
the 18 by 9 aspect ratio or two by one
we have been hearing about the
fingerprint scanner moving to the back
about less bezels on the display
apparently the only things we're not
getting oh yes you are getting the
headphone jack that was confirmed but
we're not getting where I was charging
and it's expected as apparently this
body will be aluminum but according to
one plus it seems that they're going to
stick their guns to - charging and focus
on wireless charging whenever it's ready
for primetime and you know that makes
sense I mean they're - charging is
second to none well second only to Buch
but hey it's pretty much the same thing
so anyways it leads me to the question
today in this day and age in 2017 is
wireless charging a deal-breaker for you
to decide if you're gonna buy a phone or
not in my case it's not number one
because only a few phones have fast
wireless charging and even then it's not
fast enough and second because again
it's just not convenient it only works
for me at night but then the rest of the
day I need wires just because I need to
continue using my phone leave us a
comment down below we love to have your
opinion friends again if you want to get
