even when they care less about the Apple
watch new rumors of the galaxy s
seventies that the company is jumping
into a new technology and Microsoft just
decided to get aggressive when it comes
to buying a new pc I'm Hyneman rivera
and i am being as optimistic as i can
because you know what day it is today
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with blackberry as yeah
if you want to get it in the UK it is
now available pre-order in the carphone
warehouse and panel you'll be getting
your phone on november six which is
really close by we got the same specs
that we talked about Sam dragon 808
three gigs of RAM but the the difficult
part here is that price tag as a
converted from pounds the u.s. dollars
we're talking about above 800 bucks
that's a ton of money and for those of
you that are doubting exactly how
aggressive Microsoft is being on this
new administration well as of today
there is a buyback program you can turn
in any PC or Mac that's at least six
years old or less and you'll be getting
between two to three hundred dollars
back on your purchase of your next PC
running Windows 10 that's probably a
little low for max but hey that's an
option if you've got an older Mac
sitting there not doing anything we're
still a little far from the t's event
for the oneplus x or 1 plus many and
Chinese retailers are already going
crazy providing details they're teasing
this phone at two hundred and fifty
dollars which is crazy for what we've
seen in the leaks and specifications
seem about normal except that that rumor
of the snapdragon 801 is returning
that's going to be rather interesting
for a processor from what last year
probably even more we'll see how that
goes it's really hard for us to consider
USB type-c as a standard and android
devices because yeah even though one
plus and Google Nexus devices already
include the technology the biggest
player is Samsung and they haven't
jumped yet rumors have it that it's
going to happen with the galaxy s7 that
we're going to get all the fast charging
bells and whistles that we've seen all
great news and let's just see if we get
the phone by January as is being teased
and finally the very hot news of the day
have to do with more iphone surveys this
time with demographics particularly
teenagers if you're wondering what phone
they want most sixty-seven percent of
teenagers want iphones and this has
actually grown significantly compared to
last year which is great but even more
interesting is when it comes to the
apple watch as that has flipped its way
around in the past intention for the
apple watch was sixteen percent now it's
dropped to eleven percent and it leads
me to the question of the day why do you
think that teenagers have stopped caring
about the Apple watch yeah most of your
teenagers watching this video right now
what do you think is going on in my case
I think it has everything to do with the
price tag i would not buy this watch for
my 15 year old son it's too expensive
leave us a comment down below what do
you think friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the Rose
earlier before this video was filmed but
sure you follow us on pocket now about
comments a sharp change channel as well
you follow me on twitter i underscore
turi better on instagram behind every
meta please give this video thumbs up if
you liked what you saw i am high netting
better thank you very much for watching
we will see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
