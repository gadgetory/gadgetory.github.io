name of the Huawei Nexus phablet the
blackberry Venice shows up on video so
yeah it's pretty much confirmed the Moto
X pure edition seems to be off to a good
start I'm hi Mary betta and Fridays
aren't your thing then hey I'll just
have to celebrate for you this is
parking out daily the official news
today start with the Moto X Pierre
edition those of you in the market to
buy one you might as well look around
because best buy apparently is already
sold out when it comes to its online
shipping and what we're talking about
all variants just extremely interesting
we're not sure if this car city
marketing or anything but hey it's just
great to see that this product finally
gets a break hopefully and for those of
you wondering exactly how much has
microsoft change with satya nadella's
administration the answer is a lot it
was recently on a keynote showing off
the iphone pro which is an iphone that
was running entirely microsoft software
and the amount of applications is just
crazy and these are not just half-baked
application some of these like for
example the new outlook probably some of
the best email clients out there for iOS
so Microsoft has changed it has changed
for the good and we see its software
everywhere good start for those of you
fans of the name Gorilla Glass it seems
that you will have to move away from
Samsung phones in the future or not
necessarily Samsung has just filed a
patent for turtle glass would show well
yeah turtle shells are hard so it does
imply that this will be a very hard
glass makes you wonder why exactly that
they ever use the name Gorilla Glass but
then again we get the point of why point
is that it seems that Samsung is working
on its own type of glass and let's see
how soon we see it on its future
products now we've been seriously
following those leaks of the blackberry
Venice at the beginning because we
thought it wasn't going to happen but
well a canadian carrier just showed it
off on video pretty much and yes this
thing is a reality and it is actually
gorgeous there is no denying on it you
know blackberry design was a really
iconic years ago and it seems that that
has been molded into this
smart phone we just don't know exactly
when we're getting it but the video in
the links of description shows us
exactly everything about the phone from
how thin it is which is actually
significant to the fact that again it's
design is a completely different and
actually knew and finally for the very
interesting rumors of the day we've got
some trusted sources already claiming
the final name for the huawei nexus we
heard that the LG Nexus was going to be
the nexus 5x it seems that the huawei
Nexus will be the nexus 6p and yeah I
know the name is horrible but the P
could stand for either phablet or it
could stand for pro or 4 plus it could
stand for many things which is not
necessarily a bad thing but it does
leave me to the question of the day what
do you think should be the final name
for the huawei nexus should it be Nexus
6p or would you recommend any other name
in my case I would just call it the new
Nexus 6 just like they did with the
nexus 7 but in my case that's just me
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to hear your suggestions friends as
always you know the drill if he when I
that was earlier before this video was
filmed make sure you follow us on
parking outcomes strep show youtube
channel as well you follow me on twitter
Jaime underscore be better on Instagram

thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
time that'll be better thank you very
much for watching we'll see you next
