the kind of specs that typically
accompany a super high-end smartphone
but that hasn't stopped Google from
pushing it as a flagship contender on
contract the suggested retail price of
the Moto X starts at $1.99 the same
price point as one of the most popular
smartphones in history Samsung's Galaxy
s4 how did these competitors fare in a
head-to-head challenge let's find out
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is motorola moto x vs samsung
galaxy s4 last week we brought you a
comparison featuring the Moto X up
against the Google edition HTC One and
will follow the same format when
comparing the X against the stock galaxy
s4 running TouchWiz atop Android jelly
bean we'll do that in four categories
build software camera and test notes to
make sure you don't miss future reviews
comparisons and features subscribe to
pocket now here on YouTube and follow us
where we tweet post snap and share these
smart phones differ not just in terms of
their design but in the philosophy
behind that design Samsung's Galaxy s4
is largely a refresh of last year's
Galaxy s3 but made even lighter and
thinner
by contrast the Moto X is a complete
departure from the hard angular motorola
of old it's tangible proof that Google's
acquisition of the company has had a
significant impact the X features a
curved back with a finger friendly
dimple and a soft touch finish while the
galaxy s4 offers the now familiar glossy
plastic hyper glaze coating that looks
good but scratches easily while our Moto
X is black the highly customizable
device will be available in over 250
color combinations and it's fully
assembled in the USA the galaxy s4 like
most other smartphones is manufactured
outside the US and it's available in
just a handful of colors a much more
visible difference between these devices
is found in the display while the Moto X
manages quite a feat in packing a 4.7
inch 720p AMOLED screen into its petite
chassis the galaxy s4 is no slouch here
either a 5-inch 1080p AMOLED panel has
the exes screen beat in size and in
resolution we found that the X does
offer higher saturation and warmer
whites regardless of the display mode
selected but neither of these screens is
hurting for color vibrance or black
levels there's no getting around the s4
s higher resolution and pixel density
and if you try hard you can probably
make it out but only if you're looking
for the difference taking a look at the
engines the most notable difference here
is that only one of these phones lets
users get under the hood the galaxy s4
includes user expandable memory and a
user replaceable battery while the Moto
X doesn't the 50 gigs of free google
drive storage that you get with the Moto
X purchase helps but sometimes there's
no substitute for a good microSD card so
Samsung wins the power user points in
this regard in terms of raw power our
AT&amp;amp;T Galaxy S 4 here also packs the more
conventional chipset which is also
widely regarded as more powerful
it's a Snapdragon 600 clocked at 1.9
gigahertz and backed up by 2 gigs of RAM
while the Moto X offers a customized
dual-core s4 pro at 1.7 gigahertz a hold
on though that application processor is
backed up by the same Adreno 320 GPU as
found in the galaxy s4 and it's also
augmented by two independent cores one
for linguistics processing and the other
for contextual computing motorola is
calling this home cooked system the x8
mobile computing system and it's so
different from the system inside the
galaxy s4 and almost any other phone out
there that you're left thinking the
performance just has to reflect that but
that's not really the case sure there
are some deviations in benchmark results
but not necessarily what you'd expect if
you're a hardcore gamer you'll want to
take those into account but on a day to
day basis common tasks like opening and
flicking between apps general
responsiveness overall and so forth
pretty comparable in fact the Moto X has
a slight edge here you rarely see the
hiccups and stutter on the X that you'll
occasionally get on the s4 that's
probably because the X is running an ear
stock build of Android 4.2.2
while the Galaxy s4 also has to run
TouchWiz samsung's heavy third-party UI
on
that UI completely changes the look and
feel of Android and offers a whole
catalogue of special features to go on
top of it that catalog includes
everything from smart stay which keeps
the screen on while you're looking at it
to air gesture which allows you to use
your finger like a hovering stylus and
much much more whether those features
are worth anything to you depends on
your own taste see our galaxy s4 full
review to help with that but there's a
lot of them with the s4 the name of the
game is quantity of features not quality
now Google and Motorola have opted for a
completely different approach on the X
emphasizing just a few added features
these make use of the Moto X is special
processing course to allow for such
add-ons as touchless control which lets
you give the phone verbal hands-free
commands even when it's in standby and
active display which detects when the
phone is removed from a pocket or
flipped over on a table and displays a
quick summary of received notifications
each suite of features is meant to make
its respective phone more useful and
user-friendly but we think Motorola gets
closer to achieving that goal than
Samsung does the Moto X is not flawless
in this regard some of its features
could use some honing as we mention in
our full review but we think it offers
more value in its smaller focused
assortment of improvements than
Samsung's shotgun approach does in terms
of the camera the Moto X is view finder
is brilliant and beautiful in its
simplicity a toggle wheel slides out
from the left only when you need it
offering only the bare essentials for
customization and touch to capture and
flick directly to gallery and make the
X's 10 megapixel camera as easy and
usable as a Windows Phone shooter by
contrast the viewfinder software
controlling the galaxy s4 s 13 megapixel
camera is pretty complex with drop-down
menus and sliding toolbars that take
some getting used to and there's no
quick flick of the wrist to jump into
the camera as there is on the Moto X but
where the x's software shines it's let
down quite a bit by the hardware with
both cameras and 16 to 9 shooting modes
10 megapixels for the Moto X and 9.6
megapixels for the galaxy s4 the s4
shots are significant
they better colors are brighter on the
galaxies photos and while sharpness is
sometimes comparable between the two
devices when there is an edge it belongs
to Samsung adding HDR helps with the
color to a degree on the X but Samsung's
photos still come out looking better the
Moto X does try its best to deliver a
sharper low-light experience than the s4
and in normal automatic shooting modes
it succeeds to a degree but the amount
of noise in the XS shots is almost
absurd while the s4 doesn't do much
better in illuminating very dark scenes
at least it delivers clearer results in
camcorder mode the Moto X brings some
fairly good stabilization and audio to
the game but again the colors are muted
and dead in contrast to the bright
vibrant tones of the galaxy s4 shooter
here's a few seconds of 1080p video from
each the galaxy s4 video stabilization
disabled at normal walking pace on a
brightly lit day outside of Boston with
a slight breeze breeze and we'll end
this with a focus test using the typical
iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts
everyone's favorite coffee if your name
is Michael Fisher so while the Moto X
delivers ok results that can be cleaned
up after the fact
along with fast shutter speed and a
wider field of view those advantages
aren't enough to overcome the better
results of the galaxy s4 the Samsung
shooter trounces the Motorola camera and
that's not even taking into account
Samsung's more customizable shooting
modes if optical performance is a
priority for you there's no debating it
the s4 wins hands down but the pendulum
swings the other way in terms of voice
calls afield motorola has quite a bit of
experience in this shouldn't be a
surprise if you've watched our other
galaxy s4 comparisons but the Moto X
delivers much better quality on both
sides of the call and much better noise
cancellation as well it's also more
pleasant to talk on thanks to that
curved construction in phone calling
it's the winner all around that
advantage persists in terms of
speakerphone though we are dealing with
a very loud speaker on both of these
units if pressed we'd probably prefer
the speaker on the X due to its slight
edge and bass and a slightly fuller
sound
that advantage also translates to the
headphone listening experience as well
you'll probably be able to listen to
your tunes a bit longer on the galaxy s4
though not just because of its slightly
larger battery but because that battery
is also replaceable as mentioned before
still each of these devices should get
you through a full day of moderate to
heavy use with no problem the story of
these two devices is one of
fundamentally different concepts
resulting in totally divergent and
results they both have their ups and
downs and where your priorities lie will
govern which is the right one for you if
you need a smartphone with the maximum
possible amount of features a solid
camera one of the best displays on the
market and the conventional powerful
heart beating under it all the galaxy s4
is your phone if on the other hand
you're looking for a more palm friendly
more rugged build and more polished
features and software excellent voice
quality and more customization than you
can find anywhere else the American
assembled Moto X is the better fit
either way though these are both
excellent products in their own way so
the money you shell out will be well
spent
