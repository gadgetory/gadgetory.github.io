seem to be better than google glass we
get more reports of new changes to
expect in Windows Phone 8.1 in a new
case maker plants that give the iphone a
more effective heart rate monitor I'm hi
meri beta signing off from Romania and
headed back to a country where sweaters
are kind of unheard of this is
out daily Romania edition let's search
they off with some official news as
Samsung and Verizon have silently
launched the Galaxy Note pro 12 dot 2
and probably this is like the third or
fourth time that I record this segment
because I get confused with these names
but this was actually a very good tablet
we saw it at CES 2014 make sure you hit
the link to the description for details
on this tablet and also make sure you
catch our coverage for reviews of the
galaxy tab pro 10 dot 2 and some other
tablets that are already arriving at the
pocket now lapse review now let's talk
about Windows Phone 8.1 as we get the
first leaked renders of the Nokia Lumia
630 and this is not a hot device by any
means but probably the cool thing here
is that for the first time we do see a
Nokia Lumia device without hardware keys
so this is something that is coming this
will be probably the first device and we
have actually some rumors of a mid April
announcement where we expect these
looniest to be announced and hopefully
we do get some higher-end models with
Windows Phone 8.1 as well as I found
that we also get some leaks of a
keyboard for Windows Phone 8.1 that's
actually shorter so let's see exactly
what we get hopefully in the first
hardware batches by April or May now
even though we rarely use the pocket now
daily to announce a case this is
actually a very compelling one as I has
just announced the new willow case for
the iphone and this is really
interesting we do see that the galaxy s5
has a heart rate monitor but this thing
is actually a full medical great sensor
for just about everything you can think
of from blood pressure to your heart
rate to your lungs to a whole lot of
things and this is actually a work in
progress that actually has additional
add-ons that you can buy to pretty much
do absolutely any medical tests that you
could think of this is really
interesting we hope to have one of these
devices ready for a review in our pocket
now allows very soon as we do want to
confirm if it's worth two hundred
dollars
speaking of fitness let's talk about
Samson obviously they're making a big
bet in this category with their gear
lineup and also the galaxy s5 and we do
get a new FCC filing for the S circle
and actually all we know is that it's
called an ester no we don't know exactly
what type of wearable this is but
apparently Samsung is betting big on
this and obviously we will be keeping an
eye out to see what exactly they're
planning with this specific device
probably it's a wearable probably it's
not we're really not sure but we will
keep you posted as it does seem that the
company wants to try harder and
hopefully it goes beyond sensors that
are actually kind of questionable and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day Samsung is just patented galaxy
glass and it is what you expect this is
a ripoff of google glass with just about
everything that Samsung does but this is
really interesting i mean the google
glass is really just the heads-up
display with features but this actually
is augmented reality or at least the
patent intends it to be meaning for
example you can lift your hand up to
your glasses and you can turn your hands
into a virtual keyboard where you can
use your thumbs to type on your fingers
obviously there are more things that you
could probably do like look at a surface
and it will turn into a keyboard and
other things and it's really interesting
to see what samsung plans to do with
these glasses as yet these are more
James Bond type something that we really
really want to see though obviously this
is just a pen we don't really know if
it'll ever happen but that leads me to
the question of the day would you use
the galaxy glass as the patent ends
looks of the scripture for details on
what they want because in my particular
case I'll be honest with you google
glass is creepy and if it's just a heads
up display it's really not as useful as
I'd want it to be but you know augmented
reality the real deal is cool and
probably galaxy glass will mail it they
could launch it sometime within a
lifetime but it was leave us a comment
down below what do you think and friends
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video was
filmed sure you follow us on parking out
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
