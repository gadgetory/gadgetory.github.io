preview on an iPhone 6s for a little
more than a day and we've had the
Android and preview loaded on our Nexus
5x since its initial availability looks
like it's time for a showdown gauging
the state of betas between Apple and
Google over the last several years we've
watched these two mobile operating
systems meet in the middle so to speak
very generally speaking Android has been
getting prettier while iOS has been
adding deeper functionality now playing
with iOS 10 it would seem that trend
continues starting off with just basic
navigation Google and Apple betas aren't
like other companies Vedas while neither
should be expected to perform at the
same stability as a finished consumer
facing release both Android and iOS 10
perform well with few lags or stutters a
both phones now respond to gestures like
being picked up we get a simplified high
contrast view on Android which wakes to
full color on a screen press Apple
instead goes bright with the lockscreen
giving you full color notifications and
widgets iOS 10 now uses a slide to
launch the camera without unlocking the
screen we prefer this to the icon you
had to hit on previous versions of iOS
Android does have this icon to select
here but the Nexus will fire the camera
from a DoubleTap of the power button
Apple has caught up significantly in how
apps are recognized by iOS now so long
as developers built-in support sharing
options are greatly improved Google
leads here though through necessity as
phone updates are largely out of
Google's control on most manufacturers
handsets we've seen substantial parts of
the Android OS moved to Google Play for
more timely updates and bug fixes while
neither operating system will let you
completely uninstall core first party
apps the iPhone might have a few more
programs which can't be hidden or
disabled it's curious that you can
disable the calendar iTunes music and
maps but news and health are completely
untouchable pretty much everything is
fair game to disable on the Nexus but we
wouldn't expect that to hold true for
manufacturer branded phones from the
home screens it is kind of funny to see
how both companies have arrived at a
cards layout for at a glance updates to
content you might be interested in and
for navigating each interface Apple is
pushing forward with more
3d touch enabled gestures which will
help streamline interactions from lock
screens and notification trays though in
many ways this largely just makes up the
deficit for only having a home button on
the iPhone back in multitasking buttons
on Android offer a different metaphor
for navigation but one that's been well
improved over successive generations of
Android and just another funny
difference while Apple beat Google in
delivering true split-screen
multitasking on the iPad that feature
doesn't seem to have made its way into
the iPhone and it's something we're
stoked to see an Android n even on the
smaller Nexus 5x screen looking at a few
individual services Apple's messaging
app is still King
updates here provide richer content and
more playful interactions but the
ecosystem is very well refined for
organizing instant messages and text
from all of your contacts Google's still
a bit all over the map with hangouts
messages and will be adding a low-end
duo to the mix as separate options
Apple's photo app takes a big step
forward in providing on device photo
scanning and tagging for faster search
and fun features like memories will sort
your content and produce fun short
movies to share with your family and
friends but even on an iPhone Google
Photos is still solidly ahead in
delivering a prettier app with pinch to
shift scaling and the assistant to
produce your mini movie memories it
should also be mentioned that the cloud
backup for Google Photos is a bit more
helpful in offering unlimited
high-quality photo uploads while Apple's
photo backup still depends on how much
iCloud storage you pay for Apple music
received a brilliant update in this beta
simple big bold fonts for navigation
reminds me a little of the classic zoom
UI and simple tabs move you through new
music discovery curated playlists and
streaming radio though music loaded onto
the phone from CD rips or from other
downloadable services seems to lack
album art and support for the new lyrics
feature play musics interface is a bit
busier moving options behind a hamburger
menu panel but this app serves as a
better catch-all incorporating podcasts
and providing direct options for folks
who still like to buy individual music
tracks those last two points fulfilled
by separate apps on the iPhone on a
personal note though this isn't a
problem many consumers will face but as
a reviewer on
over my limit of authorizations for play
music for the second time and I'm kind
of tired of fighting Google on letting
me listen to my own uploaded tracks I've
been using groove lately as its tied
directly to my onedrive but I digress
we'd be hard-pressed to find much
difference between the news apps on both
phones a magazine layouts lots of
photography content pulling traffic from
largely the same sources they'll both do
you fine now Apple delivered some great
updates to the iPhones mapping app but
longtime Google Maps users will be
well-acquainted with zooming during
navigation with traffic reporting though
the new layout for search and
points-of-interest is very pretty
lastly Siri is getting smarter while she
still lacks the breadth of commands that
Google now can perform she is starting
to be able to chain commands and search
strings once developers start
incorporating her API it should be a fun
race to see who produces better
third-party app integration by contrast
Google is pushing now throughout more of
Android with now on tap long pressing
the home button scans a screen and
delivers contextual search results
though we still long for the day when
we're able to interact with apps
entirely through voice commands so let's
wrap this up this was a fun fight both
Apple and Google are delivering welcome
improvements to their respective
platforms but it shouldn't come as any
major surprise that we're seeing parody
on a number of features both companies
arriving at similar solutions when
addressing similar situations which is
to be expected given the maturity of
smartphone computing still we see those
slivers of individuality and how each
company still manages their ecosystem
and that's where this fight stays
interesting which beta looks like it's

Twitter and Instagram as some gadget guy
and I will catch you all on the next
comparison tell me a joke</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
