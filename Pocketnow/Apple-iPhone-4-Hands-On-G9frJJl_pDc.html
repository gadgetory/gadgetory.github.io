we're looking at the iPhone 4 which
today will go and load both black and
white we have the white model here at
the top you have the what Ximena sensor
which turns off the screen this is a
very high resolution screen that's over
300 pixels per inch there's a
front-facing video camera for FaceTime
video calls the earpiece speakers at the
top and then at the top here you have
the headphone jack along with the noise
cancellation microphone there's a
sleep/wake button on the other side and
on the left side you have finance the
mute button along with the volume up and
down II this the phone is made from
stainless steel and the front and back
pieces are made from strengthening glass
which according to Steve Jobs is classy
quality of sapphire crystal
and it has a very slim profile you do
have the home button on the bottom as
well as the microphone and speakers
along with the dock connector on the
bottom that we can go ahead and take a
look at the high resolution display and
maybe the photos app and you can really
see the colors popping out does have the
IPS technology from the iPad so the
viewing angle is quite wide and text
looks gorgeous on that and you can
probably see that best in a webpage
the New York Times
the great thing about the iPhone chorus
you can shoot edit and render videos who
iMovies which is designed for the phone
and we can see a high-definition movie
playing fullscreen has been edited and
rendered using one of the custom beans
that came with the phone or with the app
the video was shot in 720p
five megapixels
I guess the laughing that we wanted to
look at we're wise which stands me
for someone ILS which supports
background processes and multitasking in
which two different tasks and they
Pandora in the background control it
while you're doing other tasks is
browsing the matter pecking female so
this is the iPhone 4 and white</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
