unveiling of its new Galaxy Note 5 last
week but it also stirred up some
discontent for all the style it brings
to the lineup the newest note also omits
a few features the line has carried
since its inception alienating some of
the fan base that catapulted it to
popularity this week rival smartphone
maker LG capitalized on some of the
controversy trying to entice fans away
from the note and onto its newest
smartphone so we thought it worth asking
if that's a jump worth making I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and let's
find out with galaxy note 5 vs. LG g4
you know those comparisons where the
phones are practically the same - a few
little details yeah this isn't one of
those about the only thing the note 5
and g4 have in common is that there are
each roughly rectangular and even that
falls apart from some angles let's start
with the note 5 Samsung's handset does
retain some elements of the Note legacy
one of which is the philosophy of bigger
is better its display is larger more
vibrant and much brighter than the
GeForce it's powered by a burlier
processor with more RAM it's got a wider
range of sensors including blood oxygen
and fingerprint readers and the close
range radios for Samsung pay and in a
purely physical sense it's more massive
which joins with the glass and metal
construction to make it feel
significantly more lavish but more
fragile and fingerprint prone than the
g4 naturally the Samsung phone also
packs the accessory that makes a note a
note the S Pen Stylus tucked away in its
silo on the bottom edge which makes
possible everything from quick memo
jotting to contract signing to precision
scrolling the g4 may not pack a stylus
but it does offer something just as
compelling to some folks a removable
back panel that opens the way for a user
replaceable battery letting users carry
a fresh pack around and swap it in when
they need to there's also an expansion
slot here providing a path to more
storage for the price of a micro SD card
the removable backplate itself is
another standout it allows a user to
customize the g4s look and feel or add
features like wireless charging like the
cover glass up front the battery door is
also slightly curved making the girthier
g4 a more comfortable to hold than the
note 5 unlike Samsung LG has also
retained the venerable IR transmitter
allowing you to flip channels with your
phone rather than your remote as with
any feature faced off you're going to
need to decide for yourself which of
those you value and which you can live
without and that degree of personal
preference also extends to the hardware
controls Samsung keeps it consistent
with physical home button and capacitive
companion keys with conventional side
mounted volume controls LG gives up some
screen real estate for software buttons
and expands the camera bezel round back
to accommodate its rear key control
collective it takes some getting used to
but it's cool once you do on the
software side both LG and Samsung hold
on to the past but only one of them
pulls it off Samsung retains the look
and feel of previous generations of the
interface formerly known as TouchWiz but
it's substantially sleeker and smoother
in this generation with a more modern
look partially inspired by Google's
material design and if you don't like
the look you can change it up using
Samsung's built-in theming engine and
it's attached store LG offers its own
theme store for the g4 but its themes
are less impressive and don't hook as
deeply into the interface moreover the
stock themes mishmash of circles and
squares earth tones and pastels was
already pretty struggling when it first
debuted and the three months scents have
done little to cure the beatings from
the ugly stick to be fair it does offer
some stuff that Samsung doesn't like the
context-sensitive smart notice widget
and the quick toggle to some of the
notification shade but the note 5 hits
right back with a wider assortment of
multitasking choices and a more cohesive
and consistent feeling overall while LG
is Q memo might earn it a convenience
point or two in any other comparison the
note 5s S Pen just destroys it and in
the higher density
dpi setting of the notes display and
you're left with the sense that only one
of these is a true phablet in the
literal sense that is a smartphone that
can take the place of a tablet Samsung's
earlier galaxy s6 made a big splash in
the Android camera space and the galaxy
note 5 basically imports that same
shooter an optically stabilized 16
megapixel sensor with an F 1.9 aperture
and a view finder offering both
automatic and manual controls not to be
outdone the g4 brings an optically
stabilized camera of the same resolution
with an even larger aperture and laser
autofocus
as well as a viewfinder that provides
even more granular control of manual
settings you can take exposures up to
three times as long and set the ISO over
three times as high with the g4 both of
these are also capable of raw shooting
and the size of those dmg files is one
of the most compelling arguments for the
g4 s microSD card to hardly add results
these are so close that sometimes I
can't tell the difference the g4s laser
autofocus does help but resolve the shot
in very dark settings that the note 5s
phase detection can't quite deal with
but Samsung's manual focus is available
to correct for that otherwise sometimes
I prefer the note 5 shot and sometimes I
favor the g4s one isn't consistently
better than the other in fact these are
so close then I'm going to take a break
from talking for a minute and let you
see for yourself
these are just stills by the way video
samples can be found in the full reviews
as we tie off the loose ends with some
test notes these phones trade punch for
punch sometimes in the same category so
get ready for some butts the note 5
speaker is in a better position for
facedown listening and speaker phone
calls but it's a worse location for
gaming because it's more easily blocked
and it's not as bass E as the geforce
driver
if you stick to earphones you'll like
the note 5 better as it's capable of
louder output it possibly thanks to the
differences in audio controllers if it's
call quality that tickles your Tim
panics we can't directly compare these
as they're on different networks but the
g4s shape does make for a more
comfortable handset for what that's
worth the added RAM in the note 5 makes
me tempted to call it out for superior
app juggling and indeed the note 5 does
feel smoother and silkier than the g4
here in everyday taps and swipes but at
this point it's a little premature to
render a performance verdict here and
the same goes for endurance impressions
thus far the Samsung has been giving us
about four to four and a half hours of
screen on time per cycle which is
exactly on par with the battery life we
got from the g4 during our initial
review period but and this is the final
but remember that the g4 lets you carry
a spare battery in your pocket to pop in
on the fly so is the g4 as suitable
stand-in for disillusioned note fans
looking for an alternative well if you
noted all the differences we called out
earlier you'll probably already know the
answer now man despite the sacrifices
the note 5 makes it's still a damn solid
smartphone at the leading edge of the
high-end in some ways it's an even
better phablet than before and the
features the g4 presents as analogs
really aren't as good so if what you
want is an abundance of excellence the
note 5 is your ticket it's a different
story if you don't really care about our
tablet replacement and just want a more
versatile smartphone the g4 has some
concrete wins here in its chameleon
equality and hardware extensibility and
it brings a camera that's just as good
or better than the note 5 also the g4 is
$300 cheaper at least a t-mobile's full
retail price that kind of savings is
tough to dismiss if you can get past its
underwhelming software the g4 is a
better choice for the more pragmatic
purchaser especially if you can score a
deal on a spare battery and charger well
your
