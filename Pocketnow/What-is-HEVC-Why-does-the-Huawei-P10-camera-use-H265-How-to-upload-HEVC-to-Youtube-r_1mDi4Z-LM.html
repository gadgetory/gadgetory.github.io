I'm running out of storage a topic which
has been getting a little bit more
attention recently we've been talking
about new smartphones and the new
features which are going to drive
consumer sales think we're really
excited about and 4k video is one of
those topics that gets a little
controversial in our comments well a few
phone manufacturers are trying to
improve that consumer experience when
they pick up their phone and they try
and engage with something like 4k video
of course that's causing more teething
pains as we're looking at another format
shift first of all we should probably
talk about video compression
specifically h.265 or as it's also known
HD BCH EVC stands for high efficiency
video coding and it's a feature that you
can find on huawei phones and it's also
a toggle that you can activate on the
axon 7 as you'd probably be able to
figure out h.265 is the evolution of the
video codec that many of our phones used
known as h.264 it's 1h better but really
what this does is it allows us to
capture a higher quality video and
squeeze it down into a smaller file size
but grossly oversimplify h.265 does a
better job scanning video from frame to
frame using smaller regions to look for
changes in between each frame video if
something is staying put and isn't
changing from frame to frame the video
codec assumes that you don't necessarily
need to be highest possible quality for
that piece of the frame shooting 4k
video on the p10 or the mate 9 or the
axon 7 you arrive at file sizes that are
just a little bit bigger than half of
what you would get if you shot 4k video
on an iPhone and it delivers reasonably
similar video quality we're talking
about all the color and the detail and
the contrast and the whatnot but
whenever we have a format shift we will
run into problems in h.265 video files
are a little bit more difficult to work
with we've seen a bunch of people online
complaining about how they can't edit
them into project or they can't upload
them directly to YouTube well there's
nothing I can do with these videos but
that's not true these video files are a
little trickier to work with they're not
impossible to upload to your favorite
video streaming services while we're
waiting for cloud storage companies and
for YouTube to figure out what their
next generation video codec standard
is going to be it just means we're going
to have to take that extra step into
converting them into h.264 so those
outlets and those resources can utilize
the video from our phones directly from
an Android phone you can use an app like
CyberLink PowerDirector to just slap the
video file in there save it again as a
4k video file and upload that directly
to YouTube or save it on onedrive or
Google Drive there will be a little
video degradation but this is still
going to be a very high quality high
bitrate 4k video file if you can take
the extra time you can transfer this
video file to a Mac or a PC and run it
through a program like handbrake and
deliver a lossless version of this video
file which will be very easy to edit or
again to upload directly to your
favorite streaming services it's been a
little disappointing watching the
commentary on this is if this is some
kind of new thing that we've never
experienced before video files that are
more difficult to work with
back then we were talking about h.264
being this crazy resource on and then we
have phones that shoot even higher
compression video HEV C is currently
locked in a battle with vp9 that's a
standard that Google is going to try and
utilize on YouTube and right now we're
looking at licensing issues for a GBC on
a number of different platforms
unfortunately it's more expensive to
license this video codec which means the
number of our favorite solutions for
sharing this video are probably going to
slow play this for a while longer yet
but I wouldn't be afraid to jump in now
it's actually not that difficult to get
this video out and about and sharing it
with your family and friends I know one
extra step is totally a bummer when you
just want to push send but to put our
money where our mouth is this entire
video was shot edited rendered and
uploaded from a huawei mate 9 that's why
the audio for this video isn't quite up
to the same standard as what I would
normally produce from one of these
talking Bloggie videos we're using the
mics built into the mate 9 but the
entire process was eminently easy to
produce getting this thing cut and
finished and upload it I hope this brief
overview is at least started the
conversation off on what's going on with
4k video HEV C h.264 all of these tech
buzz turns that have been floating
around recently I know some point down
in the comments will expand on this
topic further and if there's enough
interest maybe we'll have to follow this
video up with some additional content on
content creation as always thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to the
and for more informational bloggy
rambling videos like these and help us
out with some sharing on your favorite
social networks for PocketNow i'm juan
carlos back now so I'm gadget guy on
Twitter and Instagram and I will catch
you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
