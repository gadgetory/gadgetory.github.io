be launched later this year reports from
the galaxy note5 claim more secure
fingerprint scanning the next Moto X
might bring the honest fingerprint
scanner ever I'm hi melody betta and
after three years of jokes how about
some suggestions in the comments down
below this is parking out daily the
official news said I have to do with
Sony if you remember the company was a
sort of having this secret project for a
new UI that it was testing out in Sweden
and now the company shares the
information this is pretty much a stock
Android version of its user interface
with Sony widgets and with so many
applications the approach that sub
companies like Motorola are already
following and even though the company is
not committing to the service coming to
future Xperia phones it would be really
cool to have the option and one device
that we are anticipating for an event
next week is the Moto G and we get some
leaks of how it will look at moto maker
and what you will be able to swap you'll
be able to swap a front color and black
or white in addition to back color
options twenty dollars apiece and you
will also be getting the option to get
different colored trims really
interesting things that might be coming
to the Moto G particularly for the price
tag now another highly anticipated the
vice is the Moto X 2015 you bet that
most of us a pocket now are looking
forward to it and we get two very
interesting leaks number what is a gold
trim color option which looks gorgeous
in that aluminum that's great but even
more interesting is the fact that it
seems that it will bring a fingerprint
scanner but that it'll be part of the
bottom speaker meaning you'll have to
swipe that fingerprint scanner at least
that's what we assume that we're getting
not necessarily good news but at least
the options there and speaking of
fingerprint scanning a company that is
boasting the fact that the galaxy note 5
and galaxy s6 edge+ will have better
fingerprint scanners is there partner
because apparently their new technology
will allow this new system to connect
directly with the application processor
meaning that it'll be a faster
fingerprint scanner in addition to more
secure and this actually leads to the
option of a better
Samsung Knox which is not something that
we're looking forward to particularly in
the case of trying to root the phone but
anyways it seems that yeah this will be
one of the features that will be
announced with the next Galaxy Note and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day LG CEO was recently on the core
results conference call for the company
and that the company is going through a
little slump when it comes to its share
value up to the point where while
investors wanted to hear what the
company was planning to do and instead
of saying that they were going to
experiment the new markets no he
flat-out said that they were gonna
launch a superphone later this year
that's going to be a premium device that
we should look forward to so yeah we are
expecting for LG to launch a very hot
device later this year and it does lead
me to the question of the day what would
you ask LG to launch in this future
super phone because in my case I like
the LG g4 as it is I probably just add a
fingerprint scanner but leave us a
comment down below what would you ask
for friends you know the drill if you
want to get to those earlier before this
video is Phil mushy follow us on parking
out comment subscribe to channel as well
and follow me on twitter i underscore
iveta for on instagram at high Meadow
iveta please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am high
memory better thank you very much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
