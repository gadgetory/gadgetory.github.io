with so many features even the jaded
fickle detail obsessed tech media can't
help but be impressed mostly but how
many features are too many how much
customization is too cumbersome how much
Samsung is to Samsung and does any of it
really matter these are the tough
questions we're tackling on this special
edition episode of the pocket now weekly
the once-a-week podcast from
pocketnow.com where we discuss
smartphones tablets and the state of
mobile technology in 2013 and today
we're talking samsung galaxy s4 i'm
michael fisher senior editorial director
at pocket now and i'm joined today by
senior editor taylor Martin good morning
to you sir hey everybody or Cleveland
Brown and I'm glad you finally did that
and chief news editor back on the show
after a very long absence Steven shank
welcome back to the weekly sir thank you
how's it going and that was inspired by
the way Taylor was to tell you doing
Thank You Brown impersonation better
than anyone I've ever heard visit my
weekly brought you my by fox by Seth
MacFarlane's Comedy Hour you could be a
stand-in you could be a boy stand-in for
Mike what's his name like and Mike
starts in age Mike Henry that's his name
Oh anyway uh well you know I thought it
was meeting and I just didn't know it
what some by my schizophrenia Omri
mm-hmm um we're off the rails already
and this is why they call me the
anti-poverty anti topic strikes again
but we have some that's okay because we
have some things to talk about they're
not specifically galaxy s4 related
Taylor and and Stephen and I had it like
freaking 10 minute discussion about
standing desks before we came on the air
and I was I understand you've changed
your you're set up a little bit taylor
and taylor martin if you have not seen
his videos at pocket now you haven't
been watching pocket now because
Taylor's it's some commenter on one of
my videos was like that pocket now is
becoming the Taylor Martin show
was like yes yeah pretty much i get that
comment a lot where where's Michael we
need Brenda mmmm-mmm a man yeah if a
single oh man for the first like two
months I was that pocket out every
single comment was like where's Brandon
minimun get rid of this guy you got it
earn the mint I know yeah you do and win
them over slowly only get two kinds of
two types of content or a comment well
it's mm-hmm I haven't taken a sip of my
coffee yet maybe how we do that yeah get
sibilance yeah so I get two types of
comments and that's where's Michael
Fisher where's Brandon minimun or your
hands are freaking huge so that's what
happens when you have in my hands will
get that way I've actually taken steps
to like frame my hands properly because
the the like depth of field on Mike the
camera that i use is it does something
weird so like if I'm holding a phone and
the shot if I'm not careful it looks
like I have this big meaty palm and that
just kind of like wraps around the front
of the phone you don't have giant hands
Taylor I've shaken here whoa well I have
a giant meaty palm and then my camera
makes it look like I have a giant meet
immediate palm on top of a giant meaty
palm oh so my hand the first coming I
got that was kind of like that was right
after the s4 was announced it was I
think the next day i did a video with
the note 2 and everybody's like is that
the s4 how do you have the s4 already
why because your hands my hands made the
note to look like the s4 apparently and
i still get that comment now like is
that this for i say you just embrace
this thing put on some of those green
the foam hulk hands yes and do a review
like that see how many comments you get
I had an idea like that a couple years
ago I Hulk reviews but I never went
through with it so its people ability
matters the note 2 as it relates to the
s4 it's funny because I've done I did
one of those comparison videos this week
is galaxy s4 vs no.2 and I found I had
to do camera tricks the note 2 is such a
tricky beast to film because it's tough
to represent authentically how big the
note 2 really is in the hand compared to
the s4 so i had to do these camera
tricks where I was like I was I had them
next to each other and I do have them
next to each other in a couple shots so
if you want to measure it you can see it
but the camera just
something funny that where it just
doesn't look the size disparity doesn't
look as Extreme as it really is yeah I
had the same problem with the first and
the nexus 7 or nexus 4 well no really
yeah because they're just they're
similar in size but not really like
there's a big difference in an old
camera they looked almost identical
right guys yeah yeah so yeah you gotta
be you have to have a little finesse in
the camera and I want to get to talking
about the s for the camera still add 10
pounds two phones ya know it does
something weird and it depends on the
camera and to steal a friends joke it
depends on how many cameras are actually
on you but ya know I don't know it's
aight aight i enjoyed trying to find
ways around how the camera messes things
up but i want to talk s4 and you guys
wanna talk has four and it's suhey do
it's exactly this is the problem I don't
want the I don't want the fact that I've
been spending too much time with the
galaxy has 42 to further you know to
further insight flames from the fanboys
which are completely unavoidable but
I've been kind of comment moderating
very heavily on all that flour galaxy s4
content and so I'm kind of more burned
out on on samsung defenders than I am on
on the device itself because it's so
funny like there's there's so much I
like about this device so let's let's
let's actually get into it this is I've
got I've got one in the booth with me
the other one is charging and i'm
running another battery test on it you
guys have read the you guys read the
review you've seen the comparisons and
stuff yeah right well sort of okay I've
seen the headlines yeah at the gist of
it right so Cass all the pictures and
that's all the counts right that's
exactly right right yeah oh it's
variants so I want it because you
haven't been on the air in a long time
Stephen I and I miss your voice I want
to know kind of your thoughts on the s4
in general and and and how it relates to
the rest of the market in these crazy
times before you start I also want to
note one thing in Tony's post last night
that he made for all of us where we all
voiced our opinions HTC one vs
as for right Stephen was the only one
the only one out of eight to choose the
s4 so I said I won't have yet it's there
yeah yeah where'd Stephen wasn't free
shot either yeah yeah so this was a
collaborative piece listeners if you
haven't seen him I was surprised to see
it post it post around for ray at four
a.m. my time Tony really went went early
on it I was like oh cool okay Wow let's
check this out and all of the editors on
the team I think it was all of us right
yeah contributed like two paragraphs and
explaining why power which one we would
choose because that's the real question
of the of the entire like decade not
really but it's the question of the year
in smartphones like HTC One or galaxy s4
which one is for you and yes stephan
zanter was definitely the most
interesting i was like actually I I
would have to be honest I was a little
dismayed that it wasn't a more even
balance because I'm glad that everyone
was honest don't get me wrong I just
wished that for the sake of the
appearance of balance yeah for the
little bit of PR that we had more sgs4
like proponents on the team and nobody's
really against it but I think when when
it comes down to the choice whatever you
can read our explanations on the post
but Stephen yeah why did you give the
answer that you did and what are your
thoughts on the s4 in general you know I
think the problem with the s4 it's just
not very cool I mean it's a fine phone
it did pretty much what we expected
Samsung to do you know spec wise and
everything but it's just it's hard to
get excited about it whereas the the one
is I mean it may be you know rehashing
some old ideas but ones that never
necessarily got the attention they might
deserve and putting them all together in
one package it's it's fun it's
compelling and I mean the only reason I
was even giving the s4 the more
consideration than the other guys is I
am a big fan of micro SD and removable
battery I know for some of you Taylor
you were saying that micro SD take it or
leave it but it bugs me that I don't
have that on like my nexus 4 and with
the one I can see that becoming a
problem especially if this isn't if
we're treating it as a phone like you
know phone enthusiasts like us we're
just going to use it for a while we're
always going to be upgrading to the the
new hotness
it arrives then that's fine and get a
new phone with new storage fresh battery
but if you're going to be sticking with
it for the long haul I can really see
the lack of those options in the one
becoming a problem another a year two
years down the line so maybe the s4 is
going to be more flexible a long one
even if it's less you know
mouth-watering sure that's what that's
very well put and can we talk about
those two features I think right now
because that is so often I find myself
discussing devices comparing devices and
Samsung to its eternal credit always
bust out the gate with like yeah it's a
samsung phone so at this point it's
almost a given that it's going to have a
removable battery and it's going to have
expandable storage that improves the
utility of of its devices like tenfold
but you know it's funny to me because I
thought I was in the minority sorry I
certainly thought I was in the minority
when I wrote an editorial to this effect
almost a year ago when I said listen
these things aren't as big a deal to me
and I don't think they're as big a deal
too many people and then everyone come
there was a huge back some backlash but
that's the attack that HTC is certainly
taking and I I just don't know how much
they matter to regular consumers I I
sometimes find myself wondering how much
a regular consumer knows about micro SD
even existing in smartphones yeah I
think they're not a big deal until you
actually need them it's a feature that
you know if your battery is not losing
its capacity if you're getting through a
charge per day no problem it's not going
to matter but as soon as you hit that
wall all of a sudden it's a big deal
yeah yeah i'm i wrote an article a few
weeks back and maybe a month ago now and
we've talked out about it before but my
problem with expandable storage is that
for me it does nothing the only thing i
can store on it our pictures and
documents and those are the two things
that really don't take up that much
storage granted pictures are taking up
more and more storage but i can't store
my music on it because i listen to
Spotify that's where all of my music
comes from right you know and Jaime was
telling us that you know you
and move your Spotify files over to an
SD card but for the sake of saying I
listen to Spotify I don't you listen to
my own music necessarily my movies I
rent them or i buy them from the Play
Store or I watch them all netflix and
and so like and when it and also when it
comes down to replacing all the milliamp
hours that you're draining watching
these things on your device you carry
around a variety of external battery
packs right yes an arsenal people isn't
yet so you're just like a walking
lithium polymer cell yeah like people
see me at the coffee shop that I go to
regularly and they're like hey you can I
charge my phone there's an outlet here
you have your computer yes sir awesome
we see the wall that coffee shops so
much stuff that red thing you should get
your sponsorship going here I know just
like I should have sponsored by gunnar
optiks right my cpa owns the place so
we're close friends I'm closer at
everybody Holmes it and works there so
by the way the tax people i sent my tax
stuff to two weeks ago haven't returned
an email in 14 days taylor i might have
to talk to your cpa yeah he's much this
that's okay that's okay i'm in trouble
so that's all right so here's here's the
thing we the utility that the s4 brings
in in terms of that battery and microsd
card i was going to say can't be
understated but you know they overstated
rather but it really can be because i
thinkin series don't don't care as much
about about removable memory as the tech
masses to all right and I can agree with
that yeah and and but the battery of
course the battery is something that's
completely different and that's that's a
feather in Samsung's cap for real across
all consumer categories i think but yeah
i'm holding my tongue on all the battery
talk because I've got an article in the
making and I'm making I guess scheduled
for next week about this kind of battery
packs versus removable batteries oh
you're doing the same editorial I did a
year ago I bet we'll do it better I
don't know well we do the boys are at
the same piece is any longer yeah that's
a fair shot but longers are kind of
better right it's yeah just like my
review proof at 4,700 words whatever was
but wow I wonder
about how these how these features like
this kind of feature approach translates
to the s4 as a whole because yes Samsung
has included these things this expand
ability to you know appeal to a broad
range of power users and is the s4 a
power users device I mean what you know
I don't know Steven I think you might
not be the best person to ask on this
because I know that you're not a giant
fan of rooting your device is right no I
love that I just I tend not to because
I'm lazy but philosophically I am right
on point there no me too i agree we were
in the same boat but like I I don't know
I feel like there are people out there
who are going to go and pick up the s4
because of the global versions octa-core
processor which we still have not played
with yet it's not octa-core well now it
is it is its dual quad-core it's lots of
course yeah it's more than eight cores
don't run simultaneously when it's
that's what yeah but those get on that
later right um what in terms of it
having the great aspects or some of the
greatest pecs most of the greatest specs
it's it's like what I said with the
optimus g pro you can throw every
awesome specification into a phone but
that doesn't necessarily make it the
best phone specifications are only half
the battle um and this sounds crazy and
it's not because it's HTC but I
personally would carry the first over
the s4 holy why would you stick that is
and what yet is this statement of the
morning right there that's the podcast
why well what if the s4 was the size of
the first whoa muted my mic it's nothing
I thought you were just dumbstruck
question I was through my throat and
then somebody asked me a question uh
note I wrote the article last night and
my last statement in the article I just
have to read it because I want to read
it it says we're loading here Apple
despite what you've heard size matters
and yeah it's the yet the HTC first is
too small for me but I would carry over
the s4 because i just i don't i'm a
sucker for design and that's one reason
i didn't like the optimus g pro it's
like a ripoff of a ripoff of a rip off
and rights just yeah yeah yeah the
5-inch GPL might be a more interesting
phone the one in japan um i haven't
actually seen them it does i have better
build quality I assume it's the exact
same thing but just slightly a smaller
yeah probably is I don't mind the size
like I like the note 2 but the note 2 is
just kind of killing me because I just
don't like the build like I like the
phone itself I just everything on the
outside is awful I hate it so it can we
talk about build quality to tell her I
don't want I don't want to step on your
whatever you were talking about there
but I ideal gate wanted to kill every
one of your segues last week you did
every single one year the segue Slayer I
almost did it earlier too so I must talk
about the build I really do because the
I have a note to as well Taylor as you
know and I I loved the note 2 I still
every time I kind of go back to it I'm
like oh yeah I remember why I like you
like it just does everything so well and
it just doesn't it doesn't care that
it's a big dude you know it's like it's
it's just god it's great and the s4 has
taken some cues from the note 2 but it's
made that it's made them better visually
in the hardware and actually when you
look at the s4 it doesn't look bad I
mean it you know this some this kind of
thick Nessus if I'd thickened that's the
word this thickened mid plate the silver
kind of faux metal running the the
perimeter of the s4 looks good it makes
the phone look thicker than it actually
is but um it also looks high quality the
midnight black finish looks really good
the texturing under the eye typical eyes
looks really good it's and even when you
pick it up it's so light that you don't
even care about it being light in metal
that'll make some sense in in if you
remember my feelings about the gs3 which
is that this is to light it feels jincy
it feels like a toy well the s4 is only
maybe five or three to five grams
lighter but that small difference makes
it so amazed
that it's kind of like lifting the ipad
mini and being like oh wow this feels
fake so the galaxy s4 like has some cool
stuff going on for it in terms of build
but i agree with you Steven that it's
not as exciting as the one because not
yeah I think if the s 3 and s 2 and even
galaxy s never existed if this was
Samsung's first flagship Android device
smartphone we would be very excited
about the s4 it's just that it's very
familiar to us so Taylor what do you
think about whatever I just said well I
agree with the fact that if none of the
other ones existed that yes we would
probably be excited over the s4 or some
of us i didn't get excited over the s3 i
didn't really get excited over the
original Galaxy S and not the s2 either
I didn't own the galaxy s or guess to
and I just didn't get excited over any
of them and I don't know why it's not
that I don't like Samsung I do but the
design and it's just kind of it's never
appealed to me at all but the fact of
the matter is all the other ones did
exist and this isn't the first or second
time we've seen this design we've seen
it a million times every galaxy device
has the same device or the same design
and mind you the Galaxy Nexus had it too
ah I don't know if I can go with you on
that man I i had the Galaxy Nexus and I
loved it's designed so hard I did too
but it's it's really simply an offshoot
of the same exact design now the Galaxy
Nexus was had that it had the thing of
the tapered the convex screen it didn't
have no buttons on the front it was
teardrop-shaped on the back I think the
guys gnosis was was actually one of
Samsung's high points it was it in but
if you look at the sides of the devices
they in even the backs and ignore that
it's tapered it's the same thing yeah
but something about the net baby you've
nor the parts that are at the same yeah
if you ignore everything about it
they're exactly the same um no I agree
that the nexus was different and I liked
it but it's the design has just been
rehashed over and over it's just
so this is why I was was not as excited
about the for when it was announced
because I will take issue with you not
just on your Galaxy Nexus statement but
on the on the galaxy s3 because the
galaxy s3 was a real departure for them
now I understand listen I understand you
line all these up and an average person
is going to be like yeah they all look
the same but the s3 was a really
significant departure in that they went
to that you know palm pre place of the
nature inspired by nature but rounded
river pebble thing and whether you liked
it or not I think you had to respect
samsung for for going a different
direction with their their line and
maybe we kind of expected them to show a
similar amount of boldness this year and
they didn't and that's that's
frustrating now the galaxy s3 felt very
cheap in the hand to me but it won me
over in large part initially because of
the features we were promised and I want
to get into that a little bit but I want
to make sure that I'm not stepping on
Stephen who I didn't know if he had a
response to the design question yeah I
think that part of the problem might be
that in this industry especially we have
this obsession on moving forward and
that's important we want to see
everything improved but it were always
focused on companies what the growth of
their sales are now what the actual
sales figures are and I think that
translates over into design here if
something works for samsung and clearly
it has the the sales figures to back
this up why would it change it no we
want something new but if it's working
why fix what ain't broken exactly and I
use that very phrase and like in the
opening lead into my review and and from
a business perspective that does make
sense but I think you make a very good
point we are future obsessed and you
know maybe that makes a bit of sense but
I'm doing consumer market is separated
from the business side yes absolutely
and but it is still important that you
excite people it is still important that
you inspire them and that's what the s3
did for me last year because i SAT there
I at the time you know it's funny
history was like repeating itself a
little bit I at the time i was still in
love with the 1x because it was the
device that I just reviewed it was
actually the first device I ever
reviewed and I loved its build I love
blah blah blah blah blah and Samsung
comes out with this s3 and I hadn't
really paid much attention to
sung for a little while at that point
and what captivated me about the s3 was
the gist avalanche of features samsung
dumped on everybody do you remember when
the area was announced like that
everyone that live blogging from the
event was like what is going on I cannot
keep up with all the features samsung is
just throwing at us there's a video for
each feature and we know how weird
Samsung events gets events get but that
was the thing that I loved about the s3
was that there were so many incredible
features that sounded just too good to
be true I mean the s4 has a ton of new
features is it just that they aren't as
interesting no it is not that they're
not as interested they're just as
interesting and but my point is that
Samsung is doing the same exact thing it
did with you three it's it's announcing
a bunch of awesome features that sound
too good to be true and a lot of them
sorry guys a lot of them are too good to
be true ok I want to say that smart stay
a good go ahead stay was they used even
know that was those me I was just gonna
say that the king of interruption
interrupting you I was just gonna say
that the lot of them are gimmicky
they're things that don't appeal to me
or even a lot of people that okay all
right I go ahead I get you but
conceptually speaking they some of these
have to appeal to you right because like
smart stay when smarts VII was announced
I thought that was the coolest idea in
the world the screen I had been dealing
with devices for years who turned off
the screen in the middle of me like
reading a book or in the middle of me
reading a web page because the timer
went off and it was too stupid to know
that I was still looking at it it's a
smart stay brilliant idea but it it only
it solves the problem and breaks another
oh yeah how do you go would already have
was it your battery life so you're
keeping the display on longer which
you're gonna do anyway but you're also
running the camera and that's okay
alright counterintuitive they ever known
it's not gonna that's that's a sacrifice
that I would have been willing to make
my problem with smart stay is it didn't
work right in the number one condition
that you wanted it to work it didn't
work right when you were reading in bed
in the dark yeah known you were doing
anything in the dark it couldn't tell
you were looking at the screen and I
asked at the Samsung Note 80 event if
they had fixed that and they were like
no we didn't make any changes as Mark
Lee I'm like whoa
okay and then at the s4 not only did
they not fix it they introduced an
entire suite of features that that
criminally infringe on what I perceive
to be the good the good customer
experience they not only retained smart
stay they built upon it with features
that made me even more excited to try
them like smart pause you're watching a
video and you turn your head away it
pauses the video that is smart as hell
doesn't work unless the lighting is
great I'm like what smart scroll all
that stuff just doesn't work right go
ahead I'm just a quick little tip for
your screen backlight you know cutting
out hit the power button when you're not
using it and bump the the screen on time
to like a minute or two minutes yeah the
what I what I learned to do when I'm
reading something is just leave my thumb
on the display and scroll a little bit
and keep reading and scroll a little bit
and keep bringing in the display does a
timeout all right I've learned to cope
with the way things were before you've
learned to be almost old no idea
features are supposed to free us from
these you know coping hacks yeah exactly
exactly nervous oh right so uh so
Samsung has really over-promised and
under-delivered on a lot of these
features and you know what if you're
gonna if you're going to put them in the
phone and just kind of not say anything
about them and let people discover them
for them for themselves first of all yes
that's a dumb idea no company would ever
do that but second of all even dumber is
making a big deal out of features that
do not work as you say they will that's
just you pit do you think Samsung is
unaware of these failings or simply is
this like an apple and tena gate thing
we're holding it wrong and it's our
fault the conditions aren't ideal no I
think it's somewhere between there I
really don't think that Samsung is
oblivious to this I think that they are
I think that they're doing that thing
where I'm trying to think of a proper
analogy where it's like well you know I
i I've come home from school and I've
got homework and in six different
classes and I really don't want to
finish the job on any of them but if I
do I do about half my homework for all
six at least I won't get in that much
trouble like its kind of that that kind
of thing rather than just like focusing
on one
one or two things that it can really
really do a good job on um they throw
something at a wall ya see what sticks
right that is that is their tactic but I
and I get that and I understand that
that's the thing it's just that I can't
tell you how frustrated i am that they
activate my imagination they get me
salivating thinking about what life
could be like because of their awesome
ideas I can't I can't overstate it they
have incredibly cool ideas at Samsung
it's just this institution is off the
way I imagined that they come up with
these things is they have this huge
giant brainstorming session maybe an
all-hands-on-deck meeting or something
like this 5,000 employees something in
the cafeteria they're like give us your
ideas what would you like your phone to
do and everyone within like realistic I
guess like I I mean obviously a phone
can't cook your breakfast maybe it could
if you overclock the processor enough
but uh but um they take these hundreds
of ideas and they do every single one of
them they don't pick the best they do
them all right it's like no good idea
left undone write it and you can't my
point is you can't do everything great
um a former boss told me you know you do
a lot of really good things but he said
but you don't do everything great
because you do so many different things
jack of all trades master of none yeah
exactly yeah focus on a couple things
get them right and stop throwing
everything that ever comes to your mind
at a wall it's a solid point right and
and it feels like and you know this is
the point in the comments where we're at
time code whatever 40 40 minutes or
something like that or 30 minutes and
the people are gonna be like oh here
comes the Samsung ripping session and I
think that my real point of irritation
comes from the fact that if this stuff
worked well this really would be a phone
I would never I would never leave alone
but why do I want to what do I want to
pan around in my gallery photos by
moving the phone around and like
knocking my coffee off the table just to
like look around photo you know those
those motion things are the worst
implementation
ever seen like moving your widget from
one page to another rather than just
moving your finger move the whole phone
yeah yeah like that that's a fascinating
thing and yeah that that's one of those
really extreme cases of where that it's
like why does this make it to production
why does anybody need this this sounds
like that inaccurate like it's hard to
use it's it's like that Teeter game
where you have a ball on a plane you
have to it's like them amazed it's like
april fools keyboard joke yes yes
exactly wait wait the april fools
keyboard joke swiftkey it was swiftkey
tilt yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah and you remember the teeter game
that used to come on HTC phones right
but okay come on let's get to type with
that ball and tilt your phone let me
talk about is something with you guys
air air view Stephen if you had much
experience with a note too I know I was
supposed to ask this care that you're
better than no I have the first note but
I just barely looked at the note 2 okay
um and then first note refresh my memory
does not have air view is that correct
doesn't like that is incorrect it as it
has oh no it does i remember seeing a
little floaty thing i didn't own the
node 1 so I'm it does not with the old
firmware I have on it okay ya know it
required a software update to enable is
that right whatever the case air view is
something I really came to love on the
note 2 where you take the s pen out you
hovered over the screen and the thing I
used it for most often was I'm going to
use my note 2 after this podcast I'm
really excited riled up yeah but the
thing I loved about is you could hover
the S Pen over the bottom of a web page
or a Twitter feed or whatever and it
would it would scroll for you you didn't
have to do the flick thing they didn't
either i didn't find it or they didn't
port that to air to spend less air view
on the galaxy s4 so one of the best
features of earlier didn't work yeah
scrolling now maybe i didn't find it in
my exhaustive tour of all of the
movement options on the galaxy s4 I'm
sure somebody will come out of the
woodwork and say look it's this really
obvious thing and then even if it's not
there i mean the hardware is in place it
could be always been able to soften into
a future point right and if it is there
it needs to be more obvious but the
thing is the the port sorry
and complete you don't need to cover you
can just swipe your hand over the whole
entire phone and scroll that's right yes
you can just wave in front of it and
it's like how is this anyway yeah now if
you had a whole like desk setup and your
computer was fit like with that that
would be amazing like I'm getting leap
motion and may I can't not wait because
it's late it's amazing tell us what leap
motion is are you kidding me no I'm
kidding me it's just your based input
for computers oh yeah I can sit here and
write in midair like I'm writing with a
pen and sign my name on a document on my
computer it's kind of crazy that was
pretty cool yeah it's cool but I don't
understand the need for it on a phone I
understand there is at least one use
case there is at least one when you're
cooking or washing dishes or doing
something with your hands changing oil
in your car it doesn't matter you lay
your phone down and if you need to
scroll through something you just wave
your hand over the screen Julie that's
like ants come up my phone screen yeah
it like that works that's awesome and
yeah great but in the same respect
shouldn't we just coat all of our phones
in the nano coating you're not worried
about it probably and all funds should
be waterproof and all phones should be
done break upon you I think we should
get back this idea of cooking stuff with
our phone and replace like the Kevlar on
the razor with cap lon yeah the eggs
will get slide right off this is a
million-dollar idea let's just throw it
let's build a special edition HTC one
with an s4 pro in it and then just let
it let it cook right up here's the thing
i have a question about write a
statement to make about air gesture
taylor you were absolutely right and i
need to take a break from coaching about
samsung to say oh damn it I gotta go
damn it down oh and now I'm gonna come
in a square loop sign of up be get it
out of your sister I know kanae all
right 15 minutes in I got a second
section ah hey dad we need to need a
producer you like typing with your fist
angry at swearing you need those dream
it's now the Hulk myths yeah no I want
to say that Taylor you're right to bring
up air gesture because it that is a cool
feature that is implemented and fairly
well
a little annoyed that I have to get my
dirty crusty hands if I'm like cooking
or doing whatever close to that close to
the screen like three inches away I'm
gonna something on it anyway right
exactly i wish it could be a little
further away but but it is cool when you
actually enable it and when you wave
your hand aggressively over the phone
and it's like it kind of drowsily wakes
up it's like oh what oh yeah and like
the screen brightened it takes like
three seconds for the screen brightness
like here's you here's your messages man
you want to see those now sit okay I'm
gonna take them back away that's cool
and it's like the the stoner roommate on
your account it is yeah it's like you
want a grilled cheese Alex s4 is a
stoner roommate oh that's cool yeah so
uh and you don't want to touch the s4
when your hands are greasy because it
will retain the grease so I don't want
to turn this into another insult at the
s4 but because it really seriously air
gesture some of those features work
really well and that's one of the really
cool ones yeah you're can I can I jump
back to interview just quickly I'm so
yeah yeah of course it yeah yeah first I
felt like you were about to segues right
they interrupt you yeah I mean everybody
ever view on the note 2 and the original
note was was great i used it and it
would be better if it were universal
again you could preview anything like an
email in Gmail there's a way to do that
there's a simple way to do that but it
kind of requires the input from
third-party developers so I understand
why it's not universal fine and it works
great with an S Pen but there is no way
that I can imagine hovering a finger
over something is better than just
touching it okay so I will speaking like
yeah like hovering of S Pen is easy like
you you can guess when you're going to
touch the display like I don't know
because I haven't done it is it any
easier to just hover your finger or is
it just as easy or is it ridiculous I
mean it's about it's about the same it
feels less natural because with two
hands the s-pen requires that you have
to hands-free but just by its by its
essence when you are one hand like hover
scrolling on the s4 it feels less
natural because it's new right because
you really have to get used to it and
actually the sony ericsson I think beat
samsung to this on one of those
mid-range experience from last year did
not yeah they did yeah
and I remember everyone was making fun
of it back then I'm like I don't I don't
remember who was but people were really
just having a laugh at the expense of
that calling that a useless feature I'm
like no this was really awesome yeah and
on samsung it could be really awesome to
tailor you make a great point I wish it
were existed outside the stock apps also
i already said this in my future video
but I got I got the I got it wrong in
the messaging app but it's annoying
because like you hover over certain
message threads and it will expand them
if the message thread goes off the
screen but if the message is just like
okay or high then it doesn't need to be
expanded but the phone doesn't respond
at all then so it's like you it's like I
can't tell you how many times a day I go
up into the notifications bar and as see
if air view is turned on or not this
might be getting better in the future
because right now this is you know
pretty hard we're limited only on very
very few models but i'm pretty sure that
that the a gesture event is built into
android at this point so if more
manufacturers start supporting it will
see more apps be able to recognize these
things well that I would be awesome Oh
be phenomenal yeah email Gmail
especially and Lily google voice nothing
that ever comes out everything that's
awesome it never supports google voice
what makes me so sad to find the
redheaded use google is ms chat heads
but even more does it more i might fix
it who know babble might yeah actually
banned it might but more important than
google voice because so many more people
use it and because mobile video is the
play of the future youtube all these
awesome features that samsung builds
into it the video player like like pop
up play and and what is it smart pause
like it doesn't work in youtuber i feel
like i didn't i hack it to work on on
pop up play though can you do that off
top your head taylor can you do you
remember have you done that i don't know
i never used it because it didn't work
with youtube so i didn't try i finish
use multi-window and and used it that
way i feel like i did it i don't know
somebody out there is just screaming at
their at their headphones like yes you
do can't do that
yeah shake you learn paint I just found
one with my I just found one of my old
headlines pop up play on the galaxy s3
is preposterous comma awesome yeah
agreed michael fisher from june um what
are we talking about talking about
features i don't i don't know but i feel
like i need to give a little dis grant
disclaimer I'm like heated about this
because I've been discussing this very
heatedly with my friend so the s4 in
general what he's trying to decide
between the one and the s4 the question
of this season yeah and his reason above
every other freaking aspect of the phone
is that he can hold the phone up to his
ear while it's text messaging someone so
he's texting and just hold it up to his
ear and call him that is an awesome
feature as an awesome feature is that a
feature that would completely just
hands-down sell you on a phone it should
I'm like dude it takes one tap on the
screen maybe two to call him right but
Bunny's like more to taps are just hold
my phone up my ear and I call him as I'm
gonna get that phone I'm like ah so I
think calls anyone anymore right but so
that is a that is a really good point
actually because I don't think it's that
feature necessarily that's captivating
your friend now and I don't want speak
for your friend but I'm gonna use him as
a an archetype and just it is I'll just
spoiler it is yeah got some really
stupid logic so I understand I
understand but for me that that feature
where you just you're in the middle of a
text message you like this is taking too
long I just want to call this person and
you just put the fund your head net
calls that not only is convenient in
that moment but I think it does
something where it reinforces your
perception of the phone as an
intelligent companion a life companion
if you will and it really makes makes
using the phone more pleasant because
you have more confidence that the phone
actually knows what you want compared to
like a more conventional device so I get
why that would be compelling and I it's
one of those many features that and
that's actually one of the ones it works
you're justifying his crazy logic I am
absolutely yeah
knocking round his but no I think it is
important that you know I think that
that speaks to what we talked about
before and we won't talk about it again
but that speaks to a really I like well
thought out feature executed very well
and uh you know there's that
interestingly the reason he's leaning
towards the s4 and he is kind of sort of
not really what kind of a samsung fanboy
but I mean right now he carries an
iphone so he is open to other things but
what really is kind of pushing him
towards the s4 is that he got the s3 and
the One X so we got the 1x first
thinking hey this thing is gonna be
awesome because I talked it up because I
thought it was going to be awesome and
it was good but it wasn't great it was
ok and the s3 came out he also got that
and he fell in love right so it's it's
HTC's track record that's really kind of
throwing him for a loop and not saying
that he shouldn't like the s4 if he
likes it that's his thing but his
reasonings behind liking it or just
funny how can I uh can I go a little
broader hero kind of want to talk about
what they all right thanks for joining
us everyone will see you next know so I
want to talk about the the implications
of some of the things we're seeing with
Samsung because Samsung not only first
of all it didn't change TouchWiz like at
all touch was the same TouchWiz we know
and love or hate depending on your
feelings toward cartoony but responsive
interfaces so TouchWiz is still here but
there are more content offerings there's
the Samsung hub and Samsung is serious
about about this like they are offering
this hub has a movie store it is a
bookstore it as a music store as a TV
show store it hasn't I yourself into it
right if they want you to use that
Samsung Account they want you to buy
your apps in your games from them your
content and the visual language on the
Samsung hub is very different from
anything else inside touch with some
people in the comments have said it's
kind of a rip off of Metro I don't think
it is a ripoff of Microsoft's design
style it is something actually
legitimately distinct it's definitely
more hip than TouchWiz is but that's
kind of tertiary or secondary I
you am very interested in what Samsung
intends to do some people are
speculating that this is the beginning
of a push or maybe even the middle of a
push that Samsung is in 2002 get right
to get away from Android oh gosh well
I'm not going to necessarily agree with
that but they have said that they're
weighing their options few years ruin
this is something everyone does i mean
sony has their own store on the side
here everyone wants to you know end run
Google on the the Play Store content
it's not gonna work people will change
devices they want to get all their stuff
from a source where you can use it on
you know that LG phone you pick up next
year they don't want to get locked in
that is true but in the same respect
Sony HTC and pretty much all of the
other Android manufacturers collectively
don't have nearly the mindshare or
market share Samsung has this is true
that they could literally say we're done
drop the mic and walk away and they
would probably have a significant number
of people follow them now it wouldn't be
as big as Android because there are
people who use samsung specifically for
Android but they could not be they
wouldn't fall off the charts I don't
think I think they would have enough
following to kind of establish a start
yeah base right that that's the question
can they start this movement and we
start to see it in some of the public
vernacular already like you we've talked
about this a billion times but now
Android is no longer you know it's not
droid that's synonymous with Android its
galaxy and your to a greater extent it's
even Samsung I have people asking me
more and more often regular people from
the real world outside of our tech
bubble who are like oh is that the new
Samsung like oh yeah i have a samsung
phone it's like I'm like okay we're
talking about the iphone but it's like
yeah but oh my samsung phone like the
android doesn't even enter into the
conversation and samsung is not doing
anything to disabuse that notion at the
galaxy s4 event the word android was not
said once this reminds me of one of the
comments that we got on that piece
compare are getting our opinions on the
one versus the gs4
one mentioned that they thought we were
all siding with the one because we don't
want to backup Samsung now that it's
it's the popular choice it's you want to
you want to support the underdog and I
was totally thinking that when I was
writing my my opinion in the first place
are we just ganging up on samsung
because they got so big and powerful I
don't I'm not personally I'm not know
because I haven't really cared for their
devices for years personally speaking
yeah I've always been a hater hey so
yeah so i'ma send me fresh meat out of
myself ya know it says right on my
twitter profile that I'm an appreciator
of underdogs so absolutely i could see
how you could draw that conclusion and I
get that completely and you know maybe
next year if some amazing confluence of
circumstances occurred to throw Samsung
in the dumpster you know maybe I would
be a champion but I would only be a
samsung champion for that product if the
product was incredible to me that I'm
going to get a financial thing I'm only
going to get behind something that's
great I'm not gonna just back it for the
sake of packing and all I've never
completely agreed ya ever and yes I've
been an HTC fan since android started my
first android phone was HTC my second
android phone was HTC my third was I
think Motorola and then HTC HTC HTC yeah
I mean and it's not because i'm a fanboy
I just they appeal to my needs they know
what I'd like yeah so I go with them
assume that's not to say any galaxy
device isn't great I carried the note 2
and I loved it yes still love it I case
still carry it that's just oh go ahead
well yeah H don't finish htcs don't
finish no I don't want you to finish I'm
stepping on your your non segue so HTC
is not being as aggressive with this
content play because they have more to
focus on they have more to deal with
they just need to get to somewhere in
the vicinity of Samsung's success in
conventional terms so they're not really
as aggressively pushing this idea but it
interests me that Samsung is devoting so
much energy and effort into making the
Samsung hub making its own sub ecosystem
and not just that changing the look of
things I should have asked them about
this but I didn't they brightened up the
dialer like the dialer is
phone isn't it weird like it's it's
stark white on it is almost featureless
there's almost nothing it looks like a
like if jitterbug made a smartphone
that's what the dialer looks like it
looks like a Windows Phone not not
exactly but but to the know the extent
of the minimalism yeah what I'm getting
at right it looks like if like I forgive
me it looks like if like a second-grader
like drew a picture of Windows Phone
that's what it looks like um but but
it's interesting because it doesn't look
like Android and nothing some people
have some very smart people have made
this point over and over and this speaks
to what I was saying before like about
Samsung getting away from Android
nothing in touch with even looks like
remotely like a modern version of
Android then it's so jarring when you do
experience the occasional raw layer of
stock Android like when you sign into
the phone and it's like oh hey Daire are
you a google user and I'm like oh right
this is what hollow looks like this is
this design language and it frankly
wouldn't surprise me at all in in a
couple years to see Samsung go Tizen and
just just leave Android behind but the
question I agree with you Steven is can
they establish enough of a an ecosystem
for themselves and I i don't think the
hobby i really think they're trying to
make a play for this if they don't do it
overnight like just BAM we're done with
android then yeah they will if they're
like hey this is our first tizen phone
and we know come out the store right
yeah and six more and then you know
they've got a whole lineup of their 50
different screen sizes right and then
they're like hey we're done with android
right these will be our final android
phones if you want samsung Goa Tizen I
couldn't see why it wouldn't work
they're not going to walk away with
every single Samsung you do they have
now which is why it would be stupid to
just drop Android but having a plan B
and having it in place before anything
ever happens to Android is probably the
most forward-thinking progressive and
and self-preserving thought samsung
could possibly have right now because
they are growing so large I see it as
guest saber-rattling it's it's is making
a play to seem more relevant than I mean
the Samsung is a big deal but it doesn't
have to control everything you know it's
okay for a platform to be
controlled by another party I mean the
whole the pc industry for years was
content to have you know microsoft
turning out windows Dells not trying to
make its own operating system of course
dell has seen better days so it's not
the best example in the world but i
don't know can you imagine if we were
this adamant about the pc market oh they
release of computer that looks exactly
like last year's model or last month's
model you know it's kind of ridiculous
how crazy we are about this stuff it's
like more appealing shade of beige right
yeah right like this is something that
you carry with you this is not something
just sits on your desk and you want
something that is on your desk to look
pretty but I carry build is more I'm
computer with me almost everywhere I go
is it your smartphone pretty much yeah
no so yeah answer calls i just opened my
macbook lit and hold it up to my head
it's just anyone who does there's an
image i'm glad that we got back to
hardware for a second because i want to
just very briefly touch on my favorite
accessory right now do you guys see my
video on the s view flip cover the
doesn't mean i think is beautiful check
that out i will say it samsung knows how
to do accessories their flip covers the
best idea ever every phone should have a
flip cover i I all right listen listen
listen every phone this is a multi-point
port one right Bertie phone little
members argue with me flip covers are
the worst things ever or were the worst
things ever they were a dumb idea that
were flimsy they were stupid looking
they were everything bad about
everything until this one came out that
is my argument because the old ones
covered up your camera lens if you
folded them back they covered up your
screen when they were closed you
couldn't see anything through them they
were tacky they were dumb the phone
didn't know whether they were on or off
the s4 flip cover fixes all that you've
got a nice window carved in there when
you close it you get a little preview
with your date and time and your
notifications you can talk with the flip
cover closed I could you do that on the
old one yeah alright nevermind and the
phone who knows when its open or closed
yeah those are some complaints like you
couldn't take a picture that was a big
one because I always found myself
holding the note
opposite of how normal they held it in
landscape to take a picture because the
flip cover would hang down anybody I've
got in the way of how you would hold the
phone because it was just really awkward
so yes that I understand and not turning
the display on when you flip cover open
that was also kind of crazy why not do
that right but other than that other
than that other than the yes I mean I
use I use a set up cover so to speak on
most of my devices if I could get one
for the nexus 10 right now if the Nexus
timber actually mine I would yeah I've
got one on my iPad Mini I would have one
on my Nexus 4 if I could yeah I don't
like cases cases with flip covers or not
the same thing but but were you gonna
say Stephen I'm wondering on the the s4
flip cover can you when you have it open
is it like flush against the phone does
it or doesn't sort of irresistible so
like when you when you when you fold it
back and you're using the phone and one
hand yeah yeah is it flush against the
phone or is it you know because of the
tendency to close is sort of buckling a
little bit it doesn't like buckle no not
necessarily it definitely wants to be it
does it neither wants to be open or
closed it kind of wants to be at a
45-degree angle which is annoying which
is why I shouldn't have a magnet in it
which is why it's not worth the 70 bucks
that Samsung jesting is the easiest
right now what there are some retailers
already selling it for much cheaper i
think clove has it for like 40 euro or
something like that only yeah it's a
piece of gambling but no but it changes
the way you interact with the device to
a large extent for me it recalls
memories of the flip phone days of yore
I like moving components on my
technology it's just the way I am and i
also like displays that know when a
physical object is near them and change
their behavior accordingly like if
you're a notification hound because this
window is so small on this cover when
you pull out your s4 and look at your
notifications you press the side button
it's only illuminating that little bit
of the display all the rest of the
display is black so in theory that
should do a nice you know that should
give you a nice extra five percent of
battery life over the course of a given
day which is pretty cool you can also
answer calls right in the middle of
excuse me without opening the
flip cover you can like you get a little
notification in there and you can just
swipe it I got I got a google talk
message in the middle of my sentence I
got distracted somebody sent me a link
to a BuzzFeed article but reasons kids
are pretty much just tiny drunk adults
that's an awesome headline i like it i
just did be clear you could do that with
the s3 wait i answer without answer
without opening the flip cover but if
you couldn't see who was calling yeah we
could just answer with your voice he
likes 19 I answer NASA answer just
answer the phone and then I see uh I can
see my friend he was he uses his phone
to play music in his car and that was
turned on by default he got an update
and that was turned on by default after
the update and he didn't know what was
going on now he's listening to music in
the car and somebody call it a dancer
and they just start talking he's like um
I didn't mean to call you and they're
like no I called you he's like oh well I
didn't want to answer like and stuff
like that would happen and it also plays
and pauses the music so he's playing the
music and sometimes it'll just say like
the right thing or the right combination
of words will happen in a song and the
musical Paul's or it'll skip a track and
he's just like ah and he couldn't figure
out how to turn it off because there is
no just straightforward way how to turn
it off it's in s voice settings but he's
never used s voice oh that's another
thing I want to talk about the samsung
when the s3 came out Samsung's had i
think it was like their second or third
attempt at revitalizing the the settings
menu or they they like changed it up and
it was so complicated like their
settings menu was organized so oddly and
i remember talking to ryan Biden
Samsung's marketing head for samsung
mobile us or Samsung Electronics I can
remember at the moment but he was like
yeah we've we've definitely already
gotten some feedback on that and your
feedback is well taken that's basically
all he would say and I was like cool man
well thank you thank you for hearing me
out on that he's a cool guy and then the
s4 comes out and it looks like Samsung
really did try to simplify the settings
menu some more by instituting some tabs
that seems to be the new thing that OEMs
to do they like to put tabs in the
settings menu but it doesn't make any
sense like under my device you do have
things like smart screen and air view
under connections is network stuff like
that makes sense but you cannot find
your phone number under my device that's
under more and then it's under about
device and then it's under status you
can't find information about your
battery and storage under my device
because apparently those things are not
part of my device they're also under
more it's just like the my device tab is
like criminally miss named and there's
some some strange stuff going on there i
don't know i don't usually don't get
like amped about settings menus but
that's not a fun settings menu to be in
between between LG and Samsung I think
they're competing for the most
convoluted confusing poor user
experience settings menu possible right
because LG's was separated by networks
and connections sound display and then
like an other tab that is everything
like why why a sound and display why are
they separated into their own task where
that yeah I like why not have a tab for
I feel actually hide behind that I mean
like if you had a tab for display and a
tab for sound like okay sure why not put
them together well because they're not
the same thing right one goes to your
ear ball and one goes your eyeball yeah
but it's just your job involve dear vol
Oh Tommy air boss just it was just like
it they picked some random things to
give their own tabs it must have been
some reason yes we can't fully grok I
mean they didn't just use these at
random no they didn't like I'm sure they
did they threw some darts at a wall with
different settings on the the paper and
they're like you have that one and you
know I want to talk about one of the
principal advantages of the first of all
i know we we don't want to get too
deeply into HTC one vs s4 again because
that's just a never-ending conversation
despite i want to say real quickly than
this unless you read our article well
yeah well i just go to the comments then
it's just a never-ending debate but the
thing with the s4 is that it doesn't
have front firing speakers which is
disappointing but i gotta tell you guys
the the improvement on the speaker had
cannot be overstated i have
sounds am I going to say that the show
that's a dumb I'm sorry to keep
repeating that but it's true they have
really boosted the amplitude on the
speaker and made it quite loud on the s4
samsung did this presumably by moving
the speaker down from its top position
on the s3 down to where the note 2 has
it but it is very nice to have a
loudspeaker on a smartphone that's kind
of along very nice a particular thing
but I want to ask you guys about the
about the camera here because this is an
area that we sometimes mobile sites
sometimes get criticized in because we
are certainly not a I think some of us
have more photographic alacrity than
others but some of us really don't know
what we're doing with cameras and I'm
just kind of trying to view it through
the eyes of a normal consumer who's
going to buy one of these phones so I
examine it in as much detail as I can
but I was on the phone with Taylor with
a test call from the s4 and I was out in
Boston on a beautiful day taking photos
which is one of my favorite parts of my
job is reviewing a camera on a camera on
a smartphone and I'm like Taylor Taylor
what is going on with this like I I
can't get the whole thing in the frame
at the time I had the s4 the four to
three yes I had the s for the note to
the s3 the HTC One and the Lumia 920 I
had them all and the majority of those
phones would capture a whole lot more
image they had a much wider field of
view then the s4 did and he's like it's
probably cropping I'm like oh okay
probably that was what it isn't I go
into the settings and I find that the
default setting out of box is 9.6 mega
pixels at sixteen by nine you could step
it up to 13 megapixels at four by three
but there was no option for a 13
megapixels at sixteen by nine now is
there a math reason I'm missing for why
there's no up no such option that's a
reason that's the shape it's a
safeassign sir yeah that's the maximum
output of the resin output resolution of
the sensor the only way to get 13 would
to be actually make a wider and shorter
sensor which is not practical because
they source these sensors by the
millions yeah so to get 16 9 what that
means is your sensor is actually larger
than its saying it is and they crop it
down aha
like an 8-megapixel that takes 16 9
photos is probably a 13 megapixel sensor
with a maximum output of eight because
it's doing max ate at 69 that's just the
way I I think that could be do kia had a
really nice graphic about this when they
released the 808 to show because they
know is an unusual shape of the sensor
it wasn't a standard aspect ratio I
think but it was designed so that it
could do either pretty well it was still
going to crop for both for 23 and 16 and
9 well yeah everything on that sensor
crops because you can't take like it's
got out what 42 megapix want to go on
takes it alone yeah 41 and it only takes
a 38 that's the maximum is like is it
its default resolution is not a standard
a spry ratio okay so slow alright so
that that makes a degree of sense and I
will admit that this is outside of my
Miley this is why we get comments like
you guys shouldn't be reviewing cameras
but it's like no that's not true because
so many people in the vast majority of
people who buy smartphones are also not
photography aficionados they just want
to take a nice picture I can tell you
whether this thing takes a nice picture
or not and if you don't believe me look
at the pictures yourself you know
whatever but it fascinated me that I was
stuck in this situation where every shot
I took with the galaxy s4 I felt like I
was too close to my subject I needed to
back up by two feet to get the same
width did field of view as the other
devices and I don't know does that
bother anybody else is it just me it
can't just be me right I think what what
that is is that's actually not the
cropping that's actually feel you write
that yeah that's your your your focal
length that's what that is so you're
actually getting explain this I just
ballpark to the numbers and actually
according to some other people i got
that actually pretty close to right oh
yeah the yeah the HTC One has I think it
was a like a 25 millimeter focal range i
think is somewhere in that ballpark like
25 28 something like that and the the s4
is somewhere like 33 35 something like
that so it looks like you're a lot
closer it's closer to what your eyes
actually see what annoys for i think i
don't know what the the focal length of
the eye is there there's like a
true to life but I can't remember what
it is oh we gotta get a message here
whatever Taylor went over Taylor's on
the show you can't you can't like
surreptitiously like text online on the
skype chat whoa hey there's a link to
this awesome this article from May
twenty-fourth of last year but that's
the southern end means our nixle here's
showing the total sensor size of the
PureView sensor and some of the others
from cropping discussion here that's
cool I should put that in the links of
the description of this podcast your
you're lucky you're lucky that I don't
like just just yell it like a yeehaw or
something it's I don't know what it is
but lately like my southern like my
roots have been coming out listen to
bluegrass all day and just chew on some
hay and a rockin out your truck I got
some swollen yeah laughs alpha so so
we're gonna have some more time with the
with the s4 here there is there's so
much that we we haven't gotten to we
have to start sort of thinking about
wrapping it up here but I I'm still kind
of getting a hold of things the lag
situation is not as not as bad as
everyone is is sort of making it this
sort of happens when you when you
introduce any criticism of a device that
a lot of people are motivated to defend
in that you will say something like I
can't quote myself exactly but you say
something like there was a little more
lag than I expected from a device like
this but you know it's not nothing
that's going to bother you in day to day
use and it kind of seized on that and
and and next thing you know 40
commenters are like how could you say
that thing is Lackey beyond belief
you're the worst ever and then the
conversation changes to something you
don't want it to change too so what's
interesting though what I've found the
reason I bring it up when you can
mitigate the lag a bit by turning off
some of Samsung's features wait surprise
surprise exactly right and so yeah it's
a guy thing why is to mimic so is the
system image is 1.5 gigabytes is it
really yes it's 1.5 gigabytes it has
point five gigabytes of software on
their the the stock 4.2 dot two images
like I think like a hundred and fifty
megabytes what does it have like a four
minute long 1080p startup animation he
like this lightning is a full feature
length film why can you not think about
that when you're making this stuff like
so but nobody's using the feature let's
just throw it away like I just cheap
Yeah right but also I mean you know when
you have a powerhouse of a device ours
is the Snapdragon 600 powered one that
we're getting the Exynos one or a couple
days or maybe tomorrow you know why not
throw everything in there i think is
this is what they're saying it's exactly
what we were talking about before but it
does slow the device down like you turn
off air view and and there is a not may
be detectable to everyone but there is a
small increase in performance you start
to see some of those animations between
closing and opening apps kind of get a
little smoother so I don't know you
shouldn't if you're going to throw
features on that impaired performance
maybe they should they should all work
really well and smaller they should all
be disabled by default oh but that is
nobody's they discover them god I think
it's funny though that we're complaining
about it you know if you have these
features on the animations between app
switching isn't as smooth that's another
one of these features that is killing
our CPU cycles where you know trading
one for another oh well that's true like
if you want to develop remote and
disable animations you really can have a
zippy phone but there you go it sure
does look like trash though yeah Sippie
but it just did it jumps from scene to
scene yeah stutters and quite quite
jarring yeah I have to say that your
your header image for the ps4 review oh
gosh I'm getting some crazy noise over
here well you ain't getting it over here
so you just keep on talking you sound
great my pebbles going crazy sorry oh it
wasn't all my wrist and I thought it was
anyway I hate that when that thing
vibrates and it's not on your side like
my house has fallen down it didn't
before I got this new band the new band
is what makes it just like is it yeah
yeah now that was amazing I was
recording audio one day and I had it
sitting beside the mic and it was just
sitting on the table and forget it oh my
gosh don't anyway your header image the
phone looks like it's like slate or
graphic like uh oh my gosh why am I
blanket looks like he's come at a
chemical bath or something crazy so that
we know the sunniest day that was the
same day I was out taking photos and the
Sun was out so bright and it just set
off the texture on this phone really
well I by the way I hate how this header
image plays with our bands on the top
and bottom that I think it looks stupid
but I there's nothing I could do about
it but ya did that texture if you get in
the sunlight it really shines like it is
a well like you say like you just like
it just came out of a chemical bad
that's awesome I just wish the hyper
glaze wasn't on top of it because this
phone even more than other more than the
s3 is so easily scratch abul and picks
up grease like it was made to pick up
finger oils and this is the part where
you know everyone everyone calls a
reviewer like a sweaty slothful like
french fry eating dude but it's not I'm
like my hands are clean but when i touch
the s4 the s4 thinks my hands have been
in the middle of some like bacon and
cheddar potatoes I don't know how best
to go baby oil bath oh that's funny um
what the I was just gonna jump to
something else I was I was kind of going
into listener mail to see if there was
anything else going on there Oh guys
Excelsior's SSD trade up program
maximizes your tech investment speaking
of spam nice um Steven what you were
saying about Flash being cheap there are
two sides to that yeah flash chips I
guess NAND chips that we see like
built-in storage is not nearly as cheap
as say a microSD card this is very true
yeah so there is that um now but I mean
it's there's so much of it though if
we're talking about difference between a
hundred Meg's and a gigabyte that's just
a fraction of what the total space is on
a 32 gigabyte phone I think they can
afford that sort of luxury with the the
operating system we still have plenty I
mean isn't like the surf
where it's taking up like forty percent
of the total storage by the default apps
and os but it's close hmm they said it's
just I mean but the storage before like
on a 16 gigabyte device you get like
that the storage the system image isn't
four gigabytes but you might only get 12
gigabytes of user available storage so
there's that that's just the system
image like when everything's packed up
not after in relationship yeah yeah you
know what we need we need like a we need
to do this on ustream eventually and
we've been thinking about this for
months and months but i will up i would
love a comment feed right now because
we're gonna be talking about the s4 on
the outer pocket now live tomorrow and
we're going to be getting reader
comments and questions and things like
that it's going to be fun and i think
next week we're also going to launch a
reader intensive review series starting
with the s4 so we're going to get reader
comment on this listeners and but we
would love to institute a system where
you can comment in real time on the
podcast and i am going to try and make
that happen FYI so yeah i was going to
ask you when we were going live yeah
well we'll be doing that do not worry
and almost i have experience with that
then we can't curse so much and edit it
out and well actually I so I don't think
that the live show like we can edit it
out later to preserve our itunes clean
tagging whatever but the live broadcast
i mean we can do kind of whatever we
want hey no hey accept town hey Griffin
I ever got it that's uncanny favorite
person right now let me look at I'm a
listener Melo here and you know I think
this is may this may be indicative of of
where our readership is coming from in
terms of devices because I'm looking at
our listener mail and there are many new
pieces of listener mail and thank you
listeners for bringing them in sending
them in shooting them to us but little
did he know that they're all meet with
fake accounts Taylor Martin a gallon a
lead William mark
so the thing is this though none of
these pieces of email not a single one
references the galaxy s4 wow that's
actually impressive is not impressive
like you would think that people
impressive in a weird sense god it's on
so and that brings me due to a question
that I will use to kind of wrap us up
here guys and listeners I'm sorry we'll
have to get to your mail on the next
show because i have to go shoot yet more
videos of the s4 i have to i get to i
get to but this brings me to it to a
question guys like we've talked in large
part this past hour so about kind of how
disappointed we are in the s4 how much
it got wrong some of the things they've
got right but i think the real focus
here for a lot of people in the jaded
tech media is that this is not bringing
what we wanted look at all the things we
wanted to the table outside of things
like the display and the and and so on
but how how well do you think this is
going to sell this is a real soft ball
of a question but i actually want to
hear your honest honest responses
starting with stephen because taylor
gets to wait this time i can see no
world in which all of these problems
we've been nitpicking about have a
significant impact on galaxy s4 sales
it's going to sell like golden hotcakes
i mean the average user is there going
to be impressed by all these all the
hype samsung's we doing about this
they're not going to care that things
don't work as well as they should
because well you know we have these
problems with a smart stay and all that
they do work and people will see that
and there's going to assume oh well i'm
doing something wrong but the phone is
is fast and looks nice so i can live
with it i'm not going to make a big
stink about it so i think it's gonna
sell fantastically this is going to be
another galaxy s3 the incident of those
yeah well yes yeah definitely it's gonna
still still it's going to sell really
well but the extent of what those
features are going to be used are when
they're being pitched on the device
there in the carrier store being pitched
on the device and when they're showing
them to their friends yeah yeah that's
the extent of what ninety percent of
samsung's new features are going to be
used and they will open up to demo like
that exactly um yeah that there enough
to sell the device and that's really i
think all samsung really cares about for
now maybe maybe an update will fix that
but right now from what you're telling
me and from what I've experienced myself
with Samsung devices I really feel like
those features are built to sell not
necessarily to use every day day in and
day out but just say hey look what this
can do and bam its marketing it's it's
marketing that is a fair point and you
are absolutely right that it is these
features do work well enough to demo in
the retail store they definitely work
well enough to demo to friends I do
enjoy one of them one of them it works
well enough they worked well enough to
hold a show like a Broadway show to show
off the device because no nothing works
well enough to sell that evening of
disaster every launch event should be
like that yeah but you know like one of
them no one of you I want to talk about
that I just touch on that very briefly
one of the most understated features
about this device is when you get close
to the screen the lock screen responds
to your presence it responds to your
like to your proximity and there's this
little Firefly like sprite that follows
your finger around as you dance around
the lock screen and that like that is
that we don't think I even mentioned
that in the review like it's so
completely innocuous it's so the 40
million thing on the list of things this
phone can do but that is the number one
thing that people have shown this device
to have been impressed by like oh my god
oh my god it's following me that's
exactly my point but yeah it samsung
knows marketing and that's why they're
doing so well they know ads they know
how to get the device in the carrier
store and the most important part of
that getting the people behind the
counter to sell it yeah they have all
these features that they can show off on
the HTC One what is someone behind the
counter going to show you the hardware
is great blinkfeed blinkfeed yeah Zoe
right boom gone yeah and so in those are
not demo friendly features they're
grateful
use they're not great to sell yeah
exactly so you look at those three
things versus the stack of about 50 or
60 maybe 70 or maybe even 10,000 things
the galaxy s4 does over the HTC One
that's where it's going to perform
better to people who don't know what
these devices are when they walk in the
store they just want a new phone the
based on the same price point and this
one does more it's hooky er yeah yeah so
so we see this this distortion field I'm
going to steal that term we see this
distortion field online in the comments
in in the articles a from our
perspectives we see that the HTC One is
a better device for you know specific
use cases and what our needs are but
these people who don't know anything
about it at all they see the more
features that's where their money goes
and that's where Samsung sells 50
million of these things 60 this might be
their best selling device to date I
agree and do you think that this will be
my last question here do you think that
samsung will change its direction for
the next generation of either note or s
device do you think that they're feeling
enough pressure from mainly the media
because consumers haven't really been
commenting too much outside of forums do
you think they feel enough pressure to
make the next Galaxy out of higher-end
materials or do you think they're going
to stick with their plastic plastic they
have no reason to change interesting we
are the we are the vocal minority yeah
absolutely as that shows and soda sales
numbers um their reasoning for using
plastic is because it's so durable in
and it isn't Lyla site resilient build
phones cheaply they hold up well enough
why make things more difficult for
themselves right right you drop a one
what happens that thing's gonna get
dented probably do you ever what I'm
told what do you have your one yet has
it arrived today no but from what I'm
told the one that I'm getting has a dent
in it has a big pit in the bezel yeah
yeah so so yeah right yeah there's that
but also Samsung is very focused on
making a light device like they their
argument their philosophy is it makes
sense if you're going
this thing around all the time then it
has to be as light as possible you don't
want everyone is going to be as big as
your head if money's better not pull
your pants down when you put in your
pocket what new closely a copy of our
new quote yes whoa pull your pants down
hold on actually hold on one second the
doorbell hold on Oh fedex time Taylor's
Stephen Taylor's expecting a shipment of
new Android figurines for his for his
videos lovely that man has to have like
like 50 or 60 figurines by now so
because this is fun hey Granger great
now I'm not saying it's a bad thing all
I'm saying is I'm sitting here in my
studio which I formerly felt proud about
but my fading angry birds need a little
you know I gotta ask Brandon to send me
some some more plush angry birds I don't
have any Android toys I have phones
lying around but you don't Reese call up
here but that's not the same you don't
you don't make make videos though so
it's all right like you can you know you
got your on the news desk like chain
smoking cigarettes like like pounding
whiskies slam and down coffee yeah
really Tony with the cigars all right
hey a tailor's back is it figurines or
is it an HTC one it is an HTC One are we
doing a podcast on boxer that's so
awesome first date or podcast unboxing
yeah listen to me when we hear the
unboxing tool yeah Daniel off this home
protector there is no skin protector
there's later okay here that great sound
yeah you hear the box ripping open yeah
I'm glad it to one and not the figurines
because I'm more excited about the one I
would have been pretty excited about the
figurines I'm not gonna lie and now you
out of it did you see the list of ones
I've all I did not bet it not oh gosh
look at the link Oh time you bought all
of these gonna listen you all right by
the way by the way yes I love that I
love I love that the HTC One is is
somehow somehow upstaging the galaxy s4
podcast with this live arrival that's
that's hilarious well yeah there's
plastic it was plastic there was glass
ago I heard it all right where's this
big Dean these aren't big dings
you guys had me all worried these are
tiny dings okay want a device that that
isn't mine I don't care oh there's a big
dent in the back there you go god what a
branded do kick the thing that I think
you're just like through this thing in a
wall let's see how it stands up HTC One
durability test yeah all right it is
funny just a little bit of like so the
drape the durability test was originally
part of after the buzz right it still is
really but then I just woke up one day
and Brandon had done this durability
test video I'm like oh so I guess we're
doing these now okay this is a separate
thing okay so I'm good hey champ boom
sound right there boom boom sound
hashtag boomtown all right we have to we
do have to wrap it up though Jensen I
I'm glad that your HTC one is in me too
I'm glad you will have so Taylor you I
imagine you will be getting one of these
galaxies as fours as well just because
we need to get other people's eyes on
hands-on with this device from other
members of the team maybe just so that
some of the heat can be taken off of me
for like grabbing some / samsung even
though five months ago everyone was
saying I was a samsung fanboy so make up
your minds jerks between editorials I
switched between an iphone fanboy and an
android fanboy so I between editorials
in the same week yeah yeah the same day
I do that last time like when I worked
for phoneDog I had two editorials in one
day I wrote one about you know positive
Android and what about negative Android
and you were I was I went from being an
android fanboy to an iphone BAM even do
you do you ever get any of this heat on
the news said absolutely because I am
you know all over the place doing you
know windows phone blackberry on what
not every people think that I have
allegiances everywhere and against
everywhere for less I was just gonna see
it just runs right off me yeah oh man
that's great but you see you're also do
editorials i should mention and they are
they're great i love your editorials
thank you i wish the readers felt the
