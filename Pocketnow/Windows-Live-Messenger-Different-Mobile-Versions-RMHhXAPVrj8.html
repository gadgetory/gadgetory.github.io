pocketnow.com
we're going to do a little comparison of
Windows Live Messenger and how it looks
on a bunch of different mobile platforms
so let's start off with the nokia so
here we are with the Nokia n8 running
Windows Live Messenger the NA is not
really supposed to support when does
Live Messenger but this is kind of a
trick to get it working and it is
supported on other Symbian platforms so
you can see at the bottom we support
pictures voice clips conversation
emoticons it's a little bit difficult to
type in there and you can add people to
the conversation if you have multiple
people in the conversation
this one really isn't designed for the
Nokia n8 but you can see it's there and
it has some decent features it does not
support multiple sign-in so you can
forget about that but we've got it on
the Symbian so that's that one and next
let's go to old windows mobile 6.5 you
can chat with people I'm just going to
bring up another window and over in the
menu you can do it mode cons it send a
picture or a voice clip or a file
and we can add participants so you have
multiple people in the conversation I
mentioned voice clips already and you
have a nice voice clip button right
there so you can really easily do a
voice clip and send it pretty much of
one hand and we have little tabs at the
bottom so that's pretty cool some good
features there I'm gonna text message
over there okay so that's windows mobile
6.5 and next let's do what the Zune HD
so here's the zoomed version of Windows
Live Messenger we have a social let's
wheel down the little Windows Live
Facebook LinkedIn updates so you can see
what people are talking about and you
can comment on what they're saying so
the recent you can put me very much like
Windows Live Messenger on the desktop
you can see friends and this loads all
your Facebook people as well so you can
chat with Facebook
there's the Facebook if we go over there
it's going to show Facebook people there
and we have all our categories so let's
see
chatting just supports sending messages
no pictures or voice clips or anything
like that okay there's some options
very nice Metro design unfortunately it
doesn't support notifications when it's
off so if I go back home that's the end
of messenger all right so that's the
Zune HD next let's do the BlackBerry I'm
already signed in here yeah I can do
instant messages here I can attach file
or voice clip or picture or a contact so
I can send contact information with this
blackberry Windows Live Messenger app I
also see the contact information and
under the menu we have auto text you can
block people you can send file you can
invite more people let's try that
so there you go and this does not
support multiple sign in either so once
you sign in there it's gonna log you off
with the other ones the Zune HD does for
multiple Simon and next how about the
iPhone here we are with the iPhone
rather iOS on an iPod touch and this
also supports multiple sign-in and it
supports facebook chat we have the
social button just going to download
your Facebook Windows Live Linkedin etc
etc all sorts of updates from there I
can do my updates my status updates for
Windows Live Facebook MySpace whatever
and I can add pictures there for friends
for chat we can do pictures and
emoticons and Oh voice clips so that's
that chats are there and we can see
online photos and this does support
multiple sign in I believe I said that
already but that's a really awesome
feature because you can be signed in
with the same account on multiple
devices on your desktop computer laptop
all the same time and just respond
wherever you want lastly Windows Phone 7
so here we're on Windows Phone 7 and
Microsoft didn't even make a Windows
Live Messenger app for Windows Phone 7
you know their own mobile platform this
is instead messenger by Miele and they
say that Microsoft contract with this
company to make it so it's here and it
works but it's not terribly great so
here's our contacts you can tap it to do
instant messages and you can invite
other people and you can do emoticons
you cannot do voice clips or pictures or
file sending none of that stuff that
everybody else can do so there's that
you see conversations over here status
update there are some cool settings you
can do a change in wallpaper and we can
have push notifications so if I go back
to the home screen my live tile should
update doesn't seem to be doing it now
but when a conversation when instant
message comes in it should have show a
little message bubble there and it
should show the online status so that's
Windows Live Messenger on a variety of
mobile devices you can see some are
definitely better than others hope you
enjoyed this video let us know which
Windows Live Messenger you liked the
best on which platform and give us a
thumbs up if you liked this video that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
