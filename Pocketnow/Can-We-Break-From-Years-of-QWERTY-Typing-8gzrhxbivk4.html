keyboard I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the eighth pin
keyboard that I used for about a week
and a half a few weeks back I made a
video about the best Android keyboards
the third-party solutions that make
typing on your Android device easier
faster more error-free
towards the end of that video I
mentioned two non traditional software
keyboards a pen and menuhim the creators
of both 8-pin and min UUM asked
approximately the same question before
jumping into their endeavors how can we
make typing on smaller devices better
the answer to that question was quite
different from each firm but both are
quite radically different from anything
widely used today
menuhim effectively squeezes a standard
QWERTY layout down into a single
staggered row of letters and eliminates
the need for utter accuracy a pen with
letters arranged in quadrants around a
center circle is an entirely different
and unique concept in itself one that
stems from the natural flow and ease of
handwriting
I first saw 8-pin in November 2010 and
the media swooned over the possibility
of a solution to the inaccurate and
frustrating ways of mobile typing I
immediately bought the keyboard and
installed it I used 8 pin for a few days
then everyone seemed to have uninstalled
a pin and moved on a little bitter
inside knowing in its current form 8 pin
was not the answer but before making the
keyboard video I noticed the company had
released an update to the Play Store the
keyboard UI look nicer more refined and
it sported a new layout one with more
finite science behind it after shooting
and publishing the video I thought to
myself could these non-traditional
keyboards ever be any more efficient
than your standard QWERTY could you
actually use one of them for an amount
of time and become as fast and as
efficient with them as you are with your
QWERTY something we've all been using
our entire lives since menuhim isn't
publicly available yet I enabled 8 pin
and dedicated an entire week to using
the keyboard to be frank the first few
hours are the worst i sat on my couch
practically typing one letter at a time
studying the keyboard and memorizing the
layout of the letters by force swipe out
from the center to the right drag up to
the left and back into the center for
letter a swipe down from the center drag
left and cross to quadrant lines and go
back to the Center for letter L I know
it sounds complicated and it isn't
exactly straightforward typing simple
letters is actually pretty difficult at
first learning to form words is the next
step and typing entire sentences and
paragraphs comes last through muscle
memory you begin to learn the loops and
they slowly become more natural I
started typing with a pen on Thursday
evening by Sunday I was typing
relatively quickly with a pen in fact by
Monday I had nearly reached the point of
being able to type without paying too
much attention to the keyboard sure just
like with swipe or other keyboards with
gesture input has to have to constantly
glance at what I'm typing but after just
a few days of dedicating myself to a pen
I was able to type with minimal effort
learning how to take advantage of word
suggestions is the key and still
something I'm struggling with as you
type 3 word suggestions are displayed
just above the keyboard to select the
suggestion from the left slide your
finger out from the center to the left
and back to the center for the middle
word upwards from the center and back
and slide to the right from the center
and back for suggestions on the right
making use of the suggestion certainly
move things along more quickly but while
I've been able to forcefully memorize
the keyboard typing with a pen still
suffers from three significant flaws the
distance your finger has to travel to
type a single letter no capitalization
key and no word prediction the lack of a
capitalization key may sound like some
silly oversight but this was done
purposefully by the developers to
capitalize a letter you must drag out
from the center and make a full circle
in the direction of the letter you want
then choose the letter as you normally
would
which sounds really confusing this gets
me to my other point just to capitalize
you have to drag your finger around the
keyboard at least once four letters
towards the outside you must drag your
finger around twice or one and a half
turns it's a bit much just to capitalize
a letter but even to type a Z W or Q I
often found myself asking if this was
truly more intuitive or efficient than
just sliding my finger over the actual
letter
a la swipe keyboards like SwiftKey the
stock Android keyboard and swype
all incorporate technology that learns
the way you type over time meaning those
keyboards can not only finish your words
but sometimes finish your phrases and
sentences for you
this would make 8-pin a whole heck of a
lot better and offset the extra distance
traveled to type those less commonly
used outside letters
all in all my week with a pen was a lot
more enjoyable than I imagined it would
be
I had a lot of people asking if I was
sadistic for wanting to use the
headache-inducing keyboard for more than
just a few minutes but it turned out to
be quite a fun learning experience and
truthfully I plan to keep using 8-pin
albeit not full time
Michael fester the CEO and founder of
8-pin tells us there is a major
announcement slated for early summer
hopefully this will bring some
much-needed language prediction software
and a capitalization key if so a pin
could certainly become my daily driver
which is something I never imagined I
would say just two weeks ago if you
liked this video and found it helpful
