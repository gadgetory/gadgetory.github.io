Microsoft fans the Lumia 830 is as close
as it gets to exciting in the opening
months of 2015 but does this so-called
mid-range flagship deserve its ambitious
title let's find out I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow and this is our Lumia 830
video review the Lumia 830 might be a
full hundred digits below Windows Phones
true flagship the 930 but the step down
in prestige also brings a step down in
size eight eight and a half millimeters
and a hundred and fifty grams the Lumia
830 is a very palm friendly very
pocketable little Windows Phone besides
our cool aluminum and the back is a
polycarbonate panel available in several
colors and adorned with the old Nokia
logo one of the last uses of the legacy
branding you'll see on a Windows Phone
popping it off reveals a removable
battery and a microSD expansion slot
increasingly rare customizations these
days and welcome news for those who need
more power or more storage up front the
display is nice and big at 5 inches
protected by Gorilla Glass 3 it almost
seems to pull at the corners on the hole
it's a very nice piece of hardware
especially for the mid-range dig a
little deeper and the disappointments
start to show first the display is IPS
instead of AMOLED now some might call
this an upside and not a disadvantage
but the lack of true blacks and high
saturation is a real bummer on Windows
Phone where colorful live tiles floating
on an expanse of pure darkness is much
better served by AMOLED also the
polarization filter that Nokia uses
means the screen starts getting pretty
milky viewed off-center and modes like
glance screen aren't nearly as dramatic
in darker conditions
finally the screen is 720p instead of
full HD it doesn't bother us much but
eagle-eyed buyers might pick up some
pixelization here and there the rest of
the hardware is a mixed bag the speaker
phones rear mounted position is
disappointing if predictable and the top
mounted USB port is just plain awkward
if you're using the phone when plugged
in fortunately there's built in wireless
charging here so you don't need to
bother with wires if you have a cheek
paddle charging pad like the dt 903 here
reviewed in another video and the
changeable covers offer a modicum of
customizability even if they do give
under the finger a bit more than what
we're used to peeling from a lumia the
830 runs Windows Phone 8.1 gd-r one with
the Lumia denim update which is
fantastic except it's not C while this
is technically denim it's not totally
denim early stop denim enough to support
one of the biggest upgrades to the
camera experience Lumia camera 5 whether
this is a symptom of carrier delays or
Microsoft being sluggish with the
release it's very frustrating and more
frustrating is Windows Phones perennial
pain point the ecosystem January 2015
saw two major blows in the United States
as two of America's largest banks pulled
their apps for Windows Phone citing lack
of users this comes on the heels of
Microsoft releasing office and outlook
apps for Android and iOS titles that in
some ways eclipsed their Windows Phone
counterparts so the app gap is still a
concern if you're any kind of power user
in every other respect
Microsoft smartphone platform has only
gotten better since we reviewed the 8.1
release last year with the most visible
edition since being the Microsoft health
app during the review period it worked
with my Microsoft band to keep me up to
speed on notifications while logging
everything from my steps to my sleep
yeah it's still an ugly accessory but
that's not the 830's fault
major third-party titles like Spotify
have also seen extensive upgrades while
high visibility apps from other circles
like NPR one have popped up too and the
star of the Windows Phone show is still
the animated information-packed Start
screen being able to pin pretty much
anything to home base and check its
information at a glance is still one of
this platforms key advantages along with
a visual design that's still fresher and
cleaner than most other platforms that
said it's pretty easy to trip up the 830
with more pressing demands on the
hardware this is just a snapdragon 400
under the hood backed up by a single gig
of ram and Windows Phone 8.1 isn't
always as silky smooth under those
limitations as earlier versions of the
OS
animations occasionally trip up and
restoring apps from standby gets old
really fast a good example is switching
from streaming Spotify to shooting a
video by the time you're done with the
camera Spotify has already been dumped
from memory and you need to relaunch it
to resume listening the hardware
limitations make having a conversation
in an app like Facebook messenger more
frustrating to thanks to the constant
need to reload upon restore maxing out
the snapdragon with a game like asphalt
8 you can see the hardware struggling to
keep up at points lighter impact games
everything holds together nicely the a
30 didn't have any trouble with jetpack
joyride or rise of glory and of course
the trivia crack and words with friends
ranch is fine though they weren't
without their own bucks a voice calling
is also win some lose some audio quality
was fine on my end about inbound callers
said they didn't have any trouble
hearing background sounds from where I
was either and the speakerphone is
plenty loud but again its rear firing
position makes it ill-suited for doing
much but listening to music fortunately
reception seemed on point in cellular
Wi-Fi and bluetooth especially the
latter even when paired to a Nokia
charging plate and LG headset in a
Microsoft band at the same time I had
almost no connection troubles in the
mid-range and high-end a Lumia phone
lives or dies by its camera and on the
spec sheet Nokia imbued the a30 with a
shooter to be proud of it's a 10
megapixel PureView sensor made it to a
six element lens and yes it's optically
stabilized when the Lumia 830 finally
gets its true denim update so we can run
Lumia camera 5 it's going to be much
more impressive possibly one of the best
mid-range shooters out there if for now
its output is just fine you don't get
the outrageous digital zoom the crazy
over sampling or the shallow depth of
field effects of higher-end Lumias but
color reproduction is much better here
than it was on the Lumia 1020 as we show
in our comparison going up tomorrow also
low-light performance is nice
thanks to OAS and if you do need to fire
up the LED flash you'll be glad it's
there as long as your subject isn't
moving too much you'll also be happy to
know the 830 is fully compatible with
the Lumia selfie app that allows
self-portraits to be taken with the May
shooter he since the front-facing camera
is nothing special
especially in low-light situations
around the world video output tops out
at 1080p in 30fps but it gets a boost on
the audio side from the three microphone
rich recording setup and as long as you
don't have the camera going the whole
time you should be able to get a day of
moderate to heavy use out of a full
charge on the 2200 milliamp hour battery
even while using Bluetooth accessories
rather heavily and thanks to the
removable power pack you can always
spend a little money on a spare battery
to get you through long trips without a
charger so what we have in the Lumia 830
is a starkly almost painfully average
smartphone there's just nothing truly
exemplary about this product in that
sense it's much more mid-range than
flagship and anyone seeking the latter
will be much better served by the Lumia
930 now in the United States the 930 is
exclusive to Verizon in the form of the
Lumia icon and that leaves the 830 is
the only sub 6 inch Windows Phone even
near the high end on AT&amp;amp;T so if what
you're looking for is the most modern
Windows Phone well the 830 sort of
becomes your default choice but it's not
cheap enough to be a budget phone and
it's not good enough to be a premium one
when it comes to Windows Phone it seems
you can have a mid-range phone or a
flagship but you can't have both
