longer than even smartphones we're
talking about almost a decade it seems
that tablets don't really nail a lot of
the aspects that a lot of us are waiting
for so I'm hi mera neta this is pocket
now and these are the top five things
that still annoys about tablets in 2013
number five is the lack of consistency
between tablets I mean computers have
matured so much that you know that every
single laptop that you buy out there has
a USB port but in the case of tablets
everything is hit or miss some tablets
have microsd support some tablets don't
some tablets have micro USB support some
tablets don't some tablets have you as
bees some tablets don't some even have
NFC and others don't it's always hit or
miss when it comes to tablet and it's
really one of those things that you
wonder why isn't there a sort of a
standard bike for example USB watch the
computers there should be the same for
tablets and Orient's will allow you to
communicate with other computers or
other tablets as well number four is the
whole application ecosystem thing and
this is a really big problem because
sadly tablets can't run everything at
least the mobile ones can't and here's
the prom for example in the case of
Android a lot of the applications are
built for smartphones and they don't
scale well to tablets and then in the
case of Windows even though Windows RT
for example doesn't run many of the
applications that you want Windows 8
does but then you have to Palm that
these are not really optimized for
tablets so in the case of you having an
atom based Windows 8 computer you can be
sure that those great applications will
not run well on your tablet even though
you want them to and even though iOS has
really figured this one out then again a
lot of the applications that you
probably want that are on Windows
computers are not available on tablets
because these are mobile products and
not really computers as you want them to
be and that leads us to the third thing
that annoys is about tablets in 2013 the
fact that they are really under powered
devices these are really bloated
smartphones they aren't really computers
and a lot of people can't afford to have
a smartphone a tablet and a computer
people either by a computer or a tablet
and a lot of people have bought tablets
because they want them for work you have
the problem that tablets aren't really
good I mean in the case of the iPad you
can't really use it for work there are
some people that can but not the biggest
denominator of people and
then in the case for example of Android
you have obviously the application gap
and then in case of windows again a lot
of these applications can run on Windows
8 but they don't run really well because
they weren't built for tablets so you
have that really big problem about
tablets the fact that people want to buy
the mass computers some of them are
priced even more expensive than
computers but there are more computers
out there that are much more powerful
and that will give you more
functionality than the tablet really
tablets for media consumption devices
and not really products for work number
two is the whole tablet UI in for two
reasons number one is because even
though companies want to sell them to us
tablets or computers they behave like
smartphones meaning the notification
shade is at the top instead of the
bottom where your hand is at the bottom
doesn't really make any sense honeycomb
had figured that out and they moved away
from that and then the other reason is
really because you have this big canvas
but you really can't use that display
for more than one app at a time you can
do it on some Samsung tablets but that
doesn't really look that good and in the
case of Windows tablets even though you
can that doesn't really necessarily work
great all the time and obviously Windows
tablets aren't that popular soap for
example the main screen is the ipad and
sadly the ipad is the least productive
tablet of all and we wish that at least
Apple would do something about it for
the rest of the tablet OEMs to do
something about it as well but they
aren't 10 and the top number one reason
why we're annoyed by tablets in 2013 is
the fact that there's still an
experiment I mean they started as tablet
computers then they moved them to mobile
tablets in 2010 then they keep changing
that keep trying different screen sizes
bigger when smaller ones and it seems
that these companies haven't really
figured out what you I is the best how
apps are supposed to work which way or
which size is better for tablets and we
wish that they would just find something
that's great obviously abundance is
great but if they keep trying they keep
trying and they're not consistent a lot
of the things that work for tablets at
the beginning don't work anymore so
whatever investments you make right now
are not guaranteed so that made you the
question of this top five what things
annoy you about your current tablet
because in my particular case multi
window support or the lack thereof is
what really annoys me the most aside
from the fact that i'm not really a
media consuming guy so i don't really
use tablets much because of that but
