third wearable following up on the G
watch our to be honest the watch urbane
is identical to the G watch our in terms
of specs so our review might as well
just end here luckily this says no
review and you know we've got a lot to
say about it introduced at CES showed up
at mwc it's finally available and we're
here to unbox it round as it is it's box
is squared and pretty much common it
wears no spec call outs just some
barcode serial numbers and the LG watch
urbane branding encapsulated in a circle
to remind you that this is one round
woman opening the box reveals the
wearable front and center and we opted
for the silver variant LG also has a
gold option both of which are available
to buy from the Google store right now
for 349 making this one expensive
SmartWatch on the inside you have the
same 1.3 inch round plastic OLED screen
with 320 x 320 resolution and 245 PPI
same screen as on the G watch are
underneath it you'll find the same
Snapdragon 400 processor flocking at one
point two gigahertz 512 megs of ram four
gigs of storage and 410 million power
battery on the outside however LG has
built the watch urbane from the ground
up and excuse our excitement but this is
one good-looking time page from the
screwless assembly to the polished
stainless steel body all the way to the
genuine leather 22 millimeters trap this
watch is elegant by itself than elegance
which is also elevated by the selection
of watch faces we've got plenty and
we'll look at them in depth in our full
review ip67 rating for dust and water
resistance has been maintained the nine
axis gyro helps the wearable orient
while the heart rate sensor on the
bottom reads your vitals for any fitness
or other activities you might undertake
the watch is sturdy and that 45.5 x 52.2
x 10.9 millimeters inside you don't have
to have huge wrists to make it look good
on your hand it feels solid it's got a
comfortable heft to it
which makes it feel substantial but not
in a bad way about the only concern we
have at the moment is how fast the shiny
stainless steel finish will start
collecting thin scratches over time you
know it will we know it too as far as
the box contents are concerned you've
got your literature a wall adapter a USB
cable and the charging dock which is
magnetic and snaps onto the back of the
device whenever you need to charge your
watch will spend a lot of time with the
watch urbane in the coming days on to
