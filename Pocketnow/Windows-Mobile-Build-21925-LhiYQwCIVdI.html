pocketnow.com in the last few months on
the pocket now youtube channel which is
youtube.com slash pocket now video we've
shown you the many evolutions of windows
mobile 6.5 from back to the Alpha up
until the recent most build and we
thought that pretty much by now windows
mobile 6.5 was mostly complete since
going to be shipping in just a couple of
months but then a new belt came out and
build 2192 5 which brought a different
change and it kind of throw us a
curveball because we're wondering if
this means that windows mobile 6.5 is
still under development if they're still
changing things if what we are seeing
now is part of the next version of
windows mobile or something else all
together let me show you what I mean
this particular rom comes from XDA
developers and actually this has a
really cool feature to it the reg the
edges of the screen are rounded like the
palm pre you see that whereas on other
devices or other roms the edges are
actually squared off so that's a really
nice elegant touch so anyway this is a
6.5 rom we go into the start menu and of
course you've seen this before we have
the marketplace which really doesn't do
anything yet of course it links to a
page that says you know marketplace is
coming soon we've seen this before
anyway so let me show you where the
change has taken place so we go back
into the start menu and go to settings
and we go to any screen where there are
multiple tabs so we can go into system
and let's choose memory and what we see
here instead of a bunch of tabs is this
kind of a rotatable list at the top so
you can swipe your finger to the right
or to the left or you can tap on the
next item to get to it so it's a
basically a more finger friendly way to
interact with your device and if you
remember the windows mobile seven weeks
that were leaked probably a year ago we
saw something very similar to this
function at the top and I can go into
another menu to show you what it looks
like there if we go into screen we
the same sort of thing obviously this is
a lot less elegant than we saw in
windows mobile seven which had kind of a
faded look to it so you can perceive
depth and that sort of thing but perhaps
this is the predecessor to what will be
windows mobile seven or again some final
changes to windows mobile 6.5 to make it
more finger friendly to look a little
bit more like seven we're going to keep
an eye on the speculation that's out
there and any other future built of
windows mobile 6.5 to figure out exactly
what this means for the latest in
Windows Mobile be sure to follow us on
twitter at twitter.com slash pocket now
tweets that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
