tried Huawei's oka less and it seems
Android has something to worry about
more Google pixel for leaks emerge that
come in conflict with what we've already
seen previously at least in parts and it
seems to the next arm model for the
iPhone is gonna continue being Apple's
battery champ I'm hiding that leave it
out reporting from Studio number two
where birds actually chirping there are
loud motorcycles and stuff but I love it
here this is parking out daily the
official nishta day begin with a deal
that I actually am considering
personally because uh obviously the 2017
iMac is two years old pretty much but
then again right now it'd be an H they
have that computer for $8.99 meaning $40
off the price tag we're talking about a
4k red to display eight gigs of ram one
terabyte of storage though that's a hard
drive it's not a solid-state drive but
still I mean it's not a bad computer per
se at $40 off is a lot of money to learn
more about it in the description now
let's talk about the Nintendo switch
probably one of my favorite products of
a couple of years ago meaning we are due
for a refresh we have not seen one yet
and we've got some new reports that
Nintendo was switching the strategy
mainly because of everything that's
happening with China Huawei and the
United States
perrolli Nintendo has moved its
production outside of China to other
countries we're trying to get
information on which these countries are
but the thing about it is we've got two
devices being mentioned so that's
actually the hottest part of the news it
seems that there is a higher end
Nintendo switch and then there's a lower
end device that's actually more focused
on portability meaning that it seems
that in Tendo is working on more of a
console device I'm not exactly sure
which is the better strategy I think the
switch is genius as it is I would love
it to be slimmer I guess better quality
but materials probably but then again
yeah it seems that we're getting to more
Nintendo switches when is the biggest
question stay tuned we'll keep you
posted as we get more information now
let's talk about the whole t-mobile
Sprint merger which we have been waiting
to happen for a while
we thought that I was going to probably
happen this summer and well we've got up
to ten attorney journals that are
completely against the deal it's a
twenty six billion dollar merger and the
argument from Sprint and t-mobile is
that we're gonna get better
five to coverage because of this and
it's gonna allow them to compete better
against AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon but the
Attorney General's don't think that's
gonna happen apparently three companies
will allow prices to go higher and tell
you what man
prices in the United States are insane
they're kind of stupid compared to
everywhere else in the world so yeah
we've got a couple of states being
mentioned like New York California
Colorado the District of Columbia
Maryland Michigan Mississippi Nevada
Virginia and Wisconsin all against this
and obviously what happens now is either
the Department of Justice approves that
or doesn't approve it whatever the case
may be I don't know I don't know what's
better I can tell you if I prefer for
the merger to happen or not we'll see
now it's will the spotlight over to the
iPhone 11 are we've been wondering
exactly what is Apple going to do with
this particular model which we here's
not going to very much when it comes to
design when compared to the higher-end
models probably a materials and as it
turns out we hear that the battery is
gonna get slightly larger 5% from 2942
31 10 milliamp hours and think about it
is even if yes by all standards on
Android this is a small battery by
iPhone standards the 10r has insanely
great battery life we just can't deny it
it's really good so we'll see what
happens because obviously I mean we're
hearing a larger battery better
processor that's gonna be more power
efficient but we're wondering what's
going to happen with a display which is
literally what stands the difference
between the 10 s and the 10 R and that
power efficiency we'll see what we get
and how about if we discuss what's going
to happen with the pixel for yesterday
we were covering rumors of the pixel for
including a notch and we were wondering
where the selfie camera was because we
couldn't see it and there were rumors
that there was probably going to be a
pop-up camera but probably the most
important part of the rumors were the
stove design at the back for the cameras
think about it as today we've got some
more sources coming in with the stove
design so apparently that's going to be
a thing in the back and you know what
I'll take it Google so long as you give
me more cameras at the back I'll be like
yeah whatever
but the thing about it is that it seems
that no we heard months ago that we were
gonna get sort of like an infinity o
punch hole that's a larger for two
cameras in the front and the now it
seems that that's going
the case now don't be confused by the
leaks that you see because it does look
like if the bezels are thicker and
that's not the case it's actually a pun
intended there is a case around the
phone and that's the reason why so but
yeah no apparently the bezels are
getting smaller which is a good thing
for pixels just bezels right now are
terrible we'll keep you posted obviously
this is going to continue to evolve and
finally the hottest dish that I have to
do with the future hongmen OS or arc OS
or Oracle soo whatever it's going to be
called as we've got reports that
companies like Xiaomi and Oppo are
already testing this operating system
that's one of the biggest concerns that
we had that also Google warned the
United States what happens if a company
like Huawei with the scale that they
have on Android is able to come up with
an operating system that's better and
the reports claim that these companies
that have been testing it have found it
to be 60% faster than Android the thing
about it is obviously Richard you
claimed this and it could just be a PR
move we're not exactly sure if that is
the case but it's interesting 60% faster
than Android I don't know about that I
do know that the operating system that I
tested on the Huawei watch GT is not
faster but it is significantly more
power efficient than where OS so that's
probably a good reference I mean even if
it's better power efficient I think that
that's a good thing in today's question
let us know I mean what do you think if
Huawei came out with an operating system
that is faster and more power efficient
than Android and also offers Android
apps for their app gallery would you be
enticed for this do you think that it's
time for Android to have a competitor
because I'm gonna be fully honest I
think that there is that there's a big
enough market for this that Huawei has
the scale I feel that it's time for
competition I feel that these companies
should do a better job in battery life
that they should do a better job in
having a faster experience a more
complete experience this is my opinion
obviously we would love to know what you
think in the comments down below as you
know for some people answer it is great
for me it's it's good it's just it's not
perfect and neither is iOS that's my
opinion we would love to know what you
think in the comments friends again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
us I'm talking downtown comment
subscribe to build our channels English
and Spanish for more videos
this one it also follows our social
medias our extended coverage happens on
Instagram and obviously my personal
handles are therefore weird photos of my
experience using these phones please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw
I'm Jaime medley thanks so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
