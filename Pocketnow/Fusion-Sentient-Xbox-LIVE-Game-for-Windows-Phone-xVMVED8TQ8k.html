we're going to take a look at this
week's new xbox live game for windows
phone let's check it out this week's
xbox live game is called fusion sent in
now here's the home screen and let's
just go straight into play so here's our
map and you can choose different planets
to do to go to the original Luna Academy
has a lot of tutorials that will help
you learn how to play the game it's
fairly complex so you got to pay
attention to those you'll have a notes
at the top that will tell you all about
all the things you can do with your sink
in and that kind of thing so let's go to
Luna and here's our planet so I'm going
to choose this place and now during your
missions you have usually three phases
so the first phase is usually taking
over a heart so let's show you that and
then the second two phases are kind of
defending it so here are my sentence and
I have to choose which ones I want to
use for this mission let's take them off
and here i can edit sentience this is
where i can customize these robots so i
can choose different weapons maybe this
guy can have this and this will show the
difference in what the weapon i have
currently versus the new weapon so let's
give them that oh you can't have it now
from here we're loaded into an
environment and only a little bit of it
is lit so i'm going to add some of these
at mall so there's my robots now I have
to press play and this guy can go over
there so he's going to walk and this guy
kind of want to go over there so they're
all moving at the same time and
eventually you'll run into some enemies
out there like so he's he's taking on
all those guys lets send them some
backup because oh you got killed ok oh
there's more and he can be fighting and
I can move these guys over there and
that's the thing that I wanted again so
it looks like we want it there we go and
you gain some loot so there's some more
weapons that we get and now we're on to
phase two so that's the basic gameplay
as you progress through these levels and
planets you get more skill levels in
your sentient robots you might be able
to get more robots more weapons
basically lots of options to upgrade
them and what you can do from that so
there's an auction house so from here
say I build up some of my sentient
robots pretty nicely
I can sell them so let's see how much
should i sell this for so there I am
making an auction
okay so I'm just going to sell that guy
for a point in this game and I'll be
able to use that to buy other stuff if
there was anybody else in the action
this game just came out so probably
aren't very many users and also this
interacts with the Xbox game fusion
Genesis which also just came out and
that's available for 800 microsoft
points this one is available for 299 in
the windows phone marketplace and it's a
pretty cool it's not your normal pickup
and go type of game you really have to
learn how to use it but it can be pretty
fun so that's our quick look at fusion
sentient now available for 299 if you
enjoyed this video give us a thumbs up
and that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
