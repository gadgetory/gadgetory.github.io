if you joined me in thinking that this
was just another color coding for the
key to it's not oh this is a very
different offering that's now being
dubbed the icon for all and let me
explain to you why we're pointing for me
find Berlin I'm hi I'm editing that out
with pocket now and let's go hands-on so
if the key to is the blackberry bold of
back in the day the key to le is like
the curve pretty much the aluminum
finish of the bolder sibling is now
replaced for a polycarbonate finish you
wouldn't be able to tell by holding it I
mean there's also the signature stippled
back now with a tint of blue depending
on the color option
seriously the feel of this phone is
pretty much like a key to in almost
every way yes the colors are now atomic
champagne and slate with atomic red
being my favorite aside from the changes
in materials the internals are different
we have a clock of Snapdragon 6-3 six
down from the Snapdragon 660 on the key
to with four gigs of ram and options for
32 or 64 gigs of expandable storage
there's a 3000 milliamp hour battery
down from a 3500 power pack on the key
to but with quick charge 3.0 still being
supported which is great the display
panel is the same 4.5 inch IPS LCD at
1620 by 1080 and the capacitive buttons
below still remain the same the
signature of blackberry keyboard is
actually slightly smaller than the key
to but still larger than the key one
which is also something I praised it
lacks the capacitive functionality for
scrolling but the fingerprint scanner is
still in the spacebar and you can still
program the keys for shortcuts and for
those of you that fell in love with the
speed key no worries it is still here
any party trick is that you can now set
the convenience key to work with the
Google assistant like push-to-talk where
you press and hold for as long as you
want the Google assistant to listen and
no worries the option is reaching the
key to in the future software update
just don't know when we are still
running on Android 8.1 oriole under
blackberry security focused skin which
means that all the applications and
services you enjoyed from the siblings
are also being offered here and the
experience is actually fluid it doesn't
really feel like if you're using a phone
with lesser specifications the camera is
also different now of 13 megapixels and
the primary shooter and 5 megapixels on
the secondary serving now as a def
sensor instead of telephoto the selfie
camera continues to be of 8 megapixels
and fixed focus though our verdict of
these will really have to depend on
whenever we review the product as we
know the key to didn't do really well in
this department and if you're asking
yourself why the key to exists well it
has really to do with two things number
one it's lighter nearly 12 grams less
than the key - so for those of you
looking for an easier to handle
blackberry this is a great option even
if I didn't find the key to to be too
heavy and the second really is the price
tag I mean our biggest complaint with
the key - was the 650 dollars that it
retailed for we're the key to le is more
around less than $4.99 though we're
still waiting to confirm that well there
it's worth it or not is still hard to
confirm but you bet that we will have
our review units soon to tell you more
