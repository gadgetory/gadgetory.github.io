iPhones are getting USBC I know the silk
white one plus six is back but it may
run out soon and for those of you that
have been waiting for tonight is finally
available for the switch I'm Jaime
metabee vera and deer epic games
why is there no fortnight for Android
like seriously this is PocketNow daily
the official news today have to do with
deals if you're in the market for the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 continues to be
one of my favourite phones it is
currently available at eBay for $600
which is definitely a steal but as
always there is a catch you don't get a
warranty for reasons we don't understand
anyways let us know in the comments who
is in need of an after the buzz video of
the Galaxy Note 8 I am now let's talk
about that silk white one plus six for
those of you that already got your
software updates and you can already do
the selfie portraits I haven't been able
to try them out just yet but I will most
important if you want that so white it
is currently available but we better
move quick you know that it is a limited
edition it is a gorgeous phone yeah the
price ranges depend on which unit you go
for but it is still one plus it is still
affordable now let's move the spotlight
over to the Nintendo switch and III as a
antenna pretty much stole the show for
those of you that have been looking
forward to fortnight on the switch it is
available for download today and then
the reason why I'm wearing this t-shirt
Super Smash Brothers has already been
teased for December I can't wait to try
that one out as well but yeah fortnight
let's give it a try now let's talk about
Oppo believe it or not we have been
talking about the fine series for years
no fine 9 when is it gonna happen the
company has just teased the find X or
fine 10 whatever that name is gonna be
it's an event that's happening in Paris
next week it looks a lot like the 1 plus
6 which is great apparently this one is
going to include a telephoto lens
instead of the you know just a def
sensor which is great with God blue
grapa charging etc apparently it'll be
powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
so this is a great flagship can't
to see more of it and finally the
hottest news today I have to do with the
iPhone 10 2018 and USBC part of the
rumors of the iPhone 10 for last year
war that we were getting USB see I know
it's a mess of your an Apple user right
now is there are so many different
connectors USB C would be great and
probably one of the major reasons for
the update is because Apple wants to use
a faster charging protocol so that would
be great I don't think it's gonna happen
and in today's question let us know what
do you think vote it up you think it's
gonna happen you think it won't I think
that Apple has so many companies locked
on that made for iPhone through
lightning that it won't but that's just
me leave us a comment down below also

difference because I would friends again
