one thing I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is a Samsung Galaxy
Tab 3 10.1 unboxing so what we have here
is the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 that means it's
the third generation of the Galaxy Tab
series and that's quite impressive but I
haven't even taken this out of the FedEx
box so before we get started let's do
that at least and take a look at the
product box itself and this is part of
an entire line of tablets so it's aside
from the note series if you haven't seen
those this is the Tab series and there
are many different sizes in this
particular lineup
there's 8.9 8.0 7.0 there might be a 7.7
there are all sorts of different sizes
in the Galaxy Tab lineup this is the
10.1 Edition this is the Galaxy Tab 3
and as we can look through these
spectrally quickly it's got a 10.1 inch
display obviously a dual-core 1.6
gigahertz Intel Atom processor so the
difference here is this is their first
Intel Atom chipset in a tablet 3
megapixel rear camera 1.3 front camera
and it's running Android 4.2 and I
believe I don't see it anywhere on the
outside of here but I believe this is
yes this is the 16 gigabyte model so it
comes in two different types 16 and 32
but without further ado let's get inside
this box and see what the tablet is all
about wah throw this aside really
quickly this is the tablet itself we
will also throw that to the back for a
quick second and inside this little flap
we've got your standard reading
materials nothing too fancy Quick Start
Guide and health and safety
a typical microUSB charging cable your
AC adapter which is probably 2 amps or
close to it maybe a little over and I
believe that's all we've got in the box
nothing too special in that front
there's just
your necessities I guess so we'll move
that to the side and look at the tablet
itself we've got a little bubbling under
the paper here the plastic so sorry
about that but this is the first time
we've touched this device right up here
on the top edge we've got a micro us or
a micro SD card slot volume rocker and
your power button that's going to be on
your left side when you're you're
holding it facing you that is an IR
blaster on the top as well get a speaker
on the right edge micro USB port on the
bottom and another speaker and your
headphone jack on the left edge on the
back that of course is your 3 megapixel
camera nothing too fancy there so let's
get the plastic off and then we'll move
this over towards the mic not a lot of
noise not a lot of noise the back might
be a little more fruitful in that
category maybe hopefully if we can get
the back plastic off it's kind of stuck
on there really well I don't know how to
get this off see what we can do no okay
so I got a little bit of the corner
peeled up so there we go still nothing
in terms of sound but uh at least we got
that off so as you can see it's got the
slick hyper glazed plastic on the back
and if you can see the pattern I don't
know if you can see it in the video but
the pattern is the same pattern you see
on the Galaxy s4 and other devices and
you see that same exact design that
we've seen on pretty much every Samsung
device in the past year maybe two years
and you've got the same metal faux metal
trim around the outside physical home
button and menu and back buttons are
capacitive flanking the home button that
is your front facing camera there which
is again 1.3 megapixels and that's going
to do it for this unboxing there's not a
lot to see here there are going to be
some comparisons and a quick review on
this device in the coming week we can
we'll do a quick powerup on the inside
it does have a 6800 milliamp hour
battery I don't know the watt hours on
that but the milliamp hours are sick
see 800 and yeah your watt-hours are not
listed anywhere so it's not really easy
to tell exactly how long this battery is
going to last because it's different and
it is running an Intel processor so you
got to keep that in mind with pretty
much everything with this tablet and
performance and battery life so we'll
skip through this really quickly and
then we're going to jump off here and
start playing around with it finish Wow
it's I just ran through that into
warming out
so here you have it this is the home
screen nothing too fancy your typical
TouchWiz interface so there you have it
for the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 unboxing stay
tuned for more coverage I'm Taylor
Martin and I'll see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
