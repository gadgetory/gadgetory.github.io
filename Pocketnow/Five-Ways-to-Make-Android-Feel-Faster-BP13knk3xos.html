slow I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and these are 5 ways to make your
Android device run a little faster in
the last major update Google introduced
project butter which incorporates vsync
triple buffering and a better touch
responsiveness in an attempt to snuff
out the performance issues that Android
has been associated with over the years
pair that with modern processors and
GPUs and you have yourself a recipe for
extremely well performing machines
however that's not always the case
sometimes phones don't perform as
intended and sometimes things are a
little slower than you would like
fortunately the fix for that is just a
few steps away you can achieve a faster
experience through applications and even
some of the stock settings on your
Android device one of the first things
you should do if you want to speed up
your phone and your experience with
Android is replace the launcher download
a third-party launcher such as nova
launcher or launcher pro atw there are
hundreds of these launcher replacements
in the Play Store and what they do is
they give you an extended set of options
that make the experience a little faster
for example when you're on your home
screen the stock home screen and you
slide left and right from your pages
there's an animation associated with
every move with these third-party
launchers you can disable any of those
animations or speed them up the
difference while it may not seem like
much is very very noticeable scrolling
back and forth between your pages is
noticeably faster if you want to switch
between your applications more quickly
there are a couple options the first of
which is glove box basically it is the
experience you would get on Ubuntu on
your Android device slide from either
side of the display either left or right
depending on how you set it up and slide
your finger over the icon of the
application you want to launch you can
do this over and over and quickly switch
between all the applications on your
device glove box is highly customizable
you can set different themes you select
which applications are in the dock and
you can select how sensitive the dock is
and other settings it's available for
free and there is an in-app purchase to
unlock more settings another more highly
customizable way to switch between your
applications quickly is called swipe pad
this one you can set up hot areas on the
corners on the sides or on the top or
bottom of the display and the way it
works is a quick swipe from one of those
areas will bring up a launcher from
there depending on which extent
you have installed you can open widgets
shortcuts applications all sorts of
things it's quick intuitive and it
really speeds up the experience using
this side by side with glovebox the to
really change the experience of Android
completely much like the animations on
the home screen there animations that
occur when you open an application close
an application or when you're switching
between apps this can be toggled by
accessing the developer options menu in
the Settings app navigate to settings
and scroll down to developer options you
may have to activate this if you haven't
already which is simply done by clicking
on about phone and tapping on the build
number until developer options are
unlocked once you go into the developer
options menu there are three settings
which you should be focused on window
animation scale transition animation
scale and animator duration scale all of
these by default are set to 1x but you
can change it to either a more
noticeable animation or completely get
rid of them and turn the animations off
what this does is when you close
applications they'll close much more
quickly they don't shrink down to the
middle and disappear they simply just
disappear
there's no animation anymore and
everything occurs a little more quickly
the final way to make Android feel a
little faster is to stop using a task
killer don't listen to what everyone's
told you you do not need something to
kill the tasks in the background Android
is not like your computer you don't have
to manage your tasks and processes
Android does it for you and you don't
think of RAM on Android like you think
of it on a computer it manages itself
and as its needed it clears it up having
your RAM full doesn't necessarily slow
your phone down when your phone needs
more resources it kills those
applications clears them from the RAM
and you're good to go
but as I'm showing you here however you
can go back into the developers options
and you can tell the phone to kill any
application as soon as you leave it so
even if you hit the home button or the
back button the application is
absolutely killed
whenever you back out of it what this
does is it clears it from the cache is
no longer in the RAM and when you open
it back up it has to redraw the
application has to reload any of the
information it's not there readily
available the problem you see with this
is every time you go home every time you
open an app anything you do the
applications and the home page even has
to be redrawn and it takes longer
it feels clunky stuttery and it's just
not smooth and this is exactly what half
when you do use a task killer so just
don't do it if you want a faster
experience if you've done all of this in
your phone just still is not fast enough
there are still options for you you can
route your device and apply a different
kernel one that has been recommended to
me many times is the franco kernel I
haven't tried it myself but I'm probably
going to this weekend and you can also
overclock your device if that's your
thing there are options beyond belief
you can install the AOSP browser instead
of the Chrome browser for a faster
browsing experience and so on and so
forth the options are unlimited once you
root your device I hope these tips
helped and I hope your phone is moving a
little faster now if you liked the video
