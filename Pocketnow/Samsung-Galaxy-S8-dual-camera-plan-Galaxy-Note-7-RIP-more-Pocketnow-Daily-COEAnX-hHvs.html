with a very familiar and competing
design scheme reports claim that you can
actually enjoy Google assistant without
the need of a pixel and let us just take
a moment of silence for the the miss of
the Galaxy Note 7 i'm high a matter
Iveta and let's all admit it's a sad day
from all technology the Galaxy Note 7
was a great phone this is pocket out
daily official news do they have to do
with deals to a certain degree if you
are a project by customer there is a new
family plan that actually allows you to
create group accounts that don't force
you to be family yeah if you have Nexus
devices and you have project file you'll
be saving $5 in groups accounts that's
limited to five people and even though
you're still paying the same amount of
money for data you're saving five bucks
and Phi is very affordable other
official news have to do with Google and
the fact that you do not need a pixel to
enjoy the services new assistant what
you need to do is have a rooted android
phone be able to install the latest
version of the Google application and
then simply edit a couple of lines of
code you know when I read that and I was
like simply right yeah it does involve a
little legwork I'm sure that there will
be some sort of an installer coming out
soon but if you've got a rooted phone
this is about the time to enjoy what you
can do with a system as well the
spotlight over to Huawei one of our
favorite watches last year was the
Huawei watch running Android wear and if
you are in the market for a new
SmartWatch I would highly suggest you
wait until after October 18 apparently
the company is going to announce a new
honour s1 SmartWatch and even though we
don't have details and we heard the
rumors that Huawei was going to adopt
eysan which some of us don't want but
anyways if that's going to be the case
Tizen is not bad I just preferred
suppression Android wear lets you want
to get now let's talk about Samsung and
finish off the news that we started
yesterday the Galaxy Note 7 according to
certain publications has halted
production permanently we haven't
received an official statement from
Samsung but we assume that this is the
correct deal and this is a very sad day
for mobile technology Samsung Galaxy
Note 7 to be honest with you was my
favorite front of the year just about
everything Samsung got right it's too
bad that this happened hopefully in my
opinion and something that I posted
on Twitter I hope this teaches companies
a way to figure out water resistance and
also be able to provide a removable
battery Samsung already did it in the
past with the Galaxy s5
a little bit clunky but I feel that that
should be the future the removable
battery should be the simple way for
everyone to be able to enjoy the beauty
of a device like the note 7 and all the
features that you had without all the
compromise in that mentality that after
that battery dies you're gonna switch
your smartphone which is really what's
gotten many companies in trouble right
now and finally the very hot news that
they have to do with the phone that
might fix things for Samsung Samsung
Galaxy s8 is rumored to launch in March
hopefully they don't rush this one out
apparently there are some major changes
to the phablet very entirely we are
getting dual cameras just like we get
with the iPhone 7 plus this is great
news it's great to see that for that
valid on that extra hundred dollars
you're getting more than just the size
bump sure you had edges with the galaxy
s7 edge but then these became gimmicks
the moment there was no palm rejection
in the software which was fixed by the
note 7 and that's just another story but
anyways it leads me to the question of
the day would you still be willing to
buy a Galaxy s8 edge or whatever the
phablet variant will be with all the
debacle that's happening with the Galaxy
Note 7 in my case to be fully honest
with you I admire the Samsung that we've
met this here a new company new
leadership I feel most sad with the note
7 mainly because of that because I have
seen a samsung that has worked really
hard to be better this year started last
year and it's just so sad to see those
efforts go down the drain like that so I
would be willing to believe I would be
willing to give him a chance but we
would love to know what you think in the
