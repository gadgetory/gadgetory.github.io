pocketnow.com and this is part two of
the video showdown of the q 9 global and
the blackjack two both on the AT&amp;amp;T
network to start I want to turn on both
devices at the exact same time they're
both configured identically they have
the same programs the same settings the
same context everything is identical
they both have the sim card removed and
I want to see which device it boots up
faster and of course the power button is
here and here and let me see if I can
coordinate this so it's right on time
and okay i press them at the same time
so let's see what happens let me get
this into focus here
looks like the q 9 1 by about two or
three seconds that's really negligible
that was interesting okay now what I
want to do is give you an idea of how
fast these devices are in terms of doing
everyday tasks so we're at the same
screen here and I'm going to click
contacts at the same time q9 was a
little faster there let me try that one
more time not the same so no difference
there what about getting to the start
menu i'm gonna click the Start menu
about the same click over about the same
I'm going to open up Internet Explorer
it has not been loaded yet so I'm going
to try to do this at the same time looks
like it was about the same up the q9 may
have been faster let's try making a new
text message because I know that that's
a source of lag often so i'm going to
type in Matt I'm gonna text message my
friend Matt I'm going to hover on his
name here it is press the right arrow to
get the txt there and now i'm going to
press the text button and see okay the
q9 is much faster bringing up the text
message application there's no doubt
about that okay how about launching the
camera application they both have
shortcut buttons on the keyboard I'm
going to press them now q9 is faster I'm
going to exit out of that how about
loading google maps they're not running
in memory right now and I've got them
selected so let's see
q9 is a little bit faster it retained
the image on the screen from when we did
the test outside how about getting into
the mail application I'm going to click
the keyboard shortcuts on both ok so the
blackjack is faster ok let's try
something else here I'm going to filter
my contacts I've got about 800 of them
by category so I'm going to choose 6 on
the keyboard which is the pocket now
category ok blackjack 2 is faster let's
start with the the blackjack 2 i'm going
to click use gps and start timing now ok
and here we are that was about a minute
and 20 seconds ok and the q 9
okay and here we are at about 45 seconds
wow so it looks like the q 9 wins the
GPS test acquiring a signal in 45
seconds less than the blackjack tube so
the winner for the speed test is the q9
it's faster at acquiring a GPS signals
fast direct trading a text message at
starting up so the q9 is the winner for
this round</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
