pocketnow.com here the huawei booth at
CES 2013 in Las Vegas checking out the
ascend mate Huawei's new phablet
contender which we saw yesterday and
didn't have much time with it because we
were sneaking a glance but pan on down
and we'll check it out we're going to
compare it briefly to the Samsung Galaxy
Note its closest competitor in the
phablet space just very briefly you can
see screen size here there's a giant
difference between the 6.1 inch panel on
the left on the ascent mate and a 5.5
inch panel is also a difference in
display technology this is of course
Super AMOLED on the right you can tell
them the deep blacks are really high
color saturation and on the left we're
dealing with IPS LCD more traditional
we've talked about this over and over
again just kind of depends on your taste
you notice we have a little bit more
screen real estate on the Samsung device
because we don't have the Android soft
he's taking up space in the bottom but
always demonstrated that those can
actually be hidden I can't do it right
now oh there we go it won't auto high
beams tap that when you want it back to
slide up we think that's a nice nice
little touch there under the hood here
this is running on a quad-core 1.5
gigahertz processor but the big takeaway
here is a 4050 milliamp hour battery
under the cover there which outclasses
the Galaxy Note 2 by a little bit and
while we also told us a little yesterday
about their energy saving features which
we call it which they call it i believe
stamina that's what it was called that
took me a second to remember that yes it
is this is an 8.0 megapixel autofocus
camera on the back of course the same
thing on the Galaxy Note 2 Wi-Fi direct
support 1080p video recording 1080p
video playback all that kind of stuff
the same stuff where we're used to
seeing here so let's just see if my if
my command
of foreign languages there is no stylus
on the huawei ascend mate at least
there's no duck for 1 i'm sure that
there is a there is a stylus available
actually don't remember at the moment
but even if there isn't one right now
there probably will be but there's of
course no Wacom digitizer so if you're
looking for the best and style of
support of course you can want to signal
the Samsung product let's just see if we
can there's no network support here this
being a typical seat yes let's just pop
open maps just to see if we get an app
launch idea boom there's Google 123 and
there we are in this of course driving
location fiction this says something
that I don't know but now we'll see
about that anyway it's just a very quick
comparison and looking at the hardware
as a final look and taking cleanser and
we'll see that this is actually a very
very slim device in spite of its large
proportions in other measurements
up top alongside and finally down on the
bottom and the huawei ascend mate of
course coming in white and black levels
as well
we can have a lot more detailed
information about this device this is
just a quick look at the two at the same
time in a very very very stressful
situation for someone who's just talking
off the cuff pocket now Michael Fisher
Las Vegas keep it locked to us for more
