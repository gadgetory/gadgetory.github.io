one honeymoon and many may argue that
every new iPhone brings a lot of the
same but this is not one of those cases
I'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter with pocket now
and I've just spent 24 hours with the
iPhone 7 plus brought to you by D brand
pocket now's iPhone 7 coverage is
brought to you by D brand to buy the
best fitting skin for your phone or
tablet visit D brand calm we live in a
society that continuously sells the
concept that bigger is better and before
we begin with the that's what she said
jokes let's be clear strapping the name
Plus on this iPhone finally makes sense
in the past the plus was just the bigger
iPhone with OIS but the iPhone 7 plus is
finally what I'd call a better one at
least to a certain degree setting it up
for the first time brings a blend of old
and new we've got the same hello screen
that later leads to the activation
through Wi-Fi or cellular you then set
up your fingerprint and then options to
set up your iPhone as new or restore
from iCloud I am a big fan of iCloud
stores given how easily it is to get a
carbon copy of your old iPhone so I
follow that route then you set up Apple
pay and this then switches to your new
forced touch home button setup you get
three taptic sensitivity options out of
which I chose the second one even if
none really feel as natural as pressing
a button more on this in a minute then
voila you're now restoring to your new
home screen or should I say your old
home screen the amount of time it takes
to restore depends on your internet
connection and the content load right
about here is where I started running
into a couple of hurdles over our base
storage experiment see I'm restoring
from an old 64 gigabyte iPhone 6s so
about halfway through the restore I had
to begin deleting games and old videos
just to make ends meet
and about everything else this is pretty
much an iPhone the similarities
Department you've got the same grid of
icons and I even wonder why Apple only
bundled one new wallpaper
yeah just one new one iOS 10 does
provide a bevy of new enhancements like
a new control center better options to
interact with notifications and other
improvements we've discussed on separate
videos
now even though Apple touts its new
retina HD display to have a wider color
gamut I'm really having a hard time
noticing the difference it could be
given my active use of the nine point
seven inch iPad pro that supports the
same enhancements but this is to say
that it isn't as saturated or punchy as
AMOLED but it's still a great 1080p IPS
LCD nonetheless and for those of you
that have been asking about that force
touch home button I'm having a love and
hate relationship with it C on the Mac
the trackpad vibrates in a way that you
feel like if you're truly pressing a
button and that sensation is really
phenomenal here the taptic engine
provides sensation more to the back of
the phone into the button so while I
find that natural when holding the phone
you'll barely feel it on a table and
that can be really confusing Apple does
do a good job and having these taps be
strong as to even make a sound like if
you're pressing a button and it's
awesome to get the feedback when you're
pulling down the notification shade or
pressing buttons on the screen but again
so long as you're holding the phone now
over a day of use what I've really
enjoyed the most are these new stereo
speakers they aren't really that much
louder than the previous mono speakers
on the iPhones of the past but the added
depth of the sound is amazing and
actually also feels amazing as you can
actually feel the chassis of the phone
vibrating the later builds on the
success of the s7 edge and combine both
to launch its next generation of talent
killer
the company claims to have reached if
you've ever held an iPad pro and felt it
play audio yeah that feeling pretty much
extends this iPhone as well and as for
the design I'm not regretting going gold
one bit as this does an amazing job at
deterring fingerprints I just wish that
there came a time when Apple would go
black on the bezels of the display for
these color options as what can be more
immersive for consuming content now as
much as the build feels great in the
hand be warned this is one very thick
and heavy iPhone and that new dual
camera hump is far more notorious to
wobbling on the table in the previous
iPhone now I'm not going to complain
about that camera hump because that's
the feature that makes the iPhone 7 plus
better than its little brother you get
the same wide-angle 12 megapixel shooter
up to seven on one side and then a
separate 12 megapixel telephoto lens on
the other that provides some nifty
optical zoom tricks and what better
place to test optical zoom than bringing
it to a baseball game right so far I'm
very impressed with the color saturation
and detail of the iPhone 7 plus far
surpassing its predecessors in low-light
performance and finally a worthy
competitor to this year's Galaxy
offerings the software enhancements
built to switch between lenses is not
really intuitive but the switch is
extremely smooth between cameras even if
while fully zoomed then you will feel a
crazy lack of stabilization in the image
just keep in mind that telephoto lenses
an aperture of f28 so don't expect great
low-light performance from it now
something that I can't say I'm really
happy about with the iPhone 7 plus over
a day is battery life it could be that
my restore process has hit the battery
hard but I barely scratched the day of
use yesterday and today hasn't really
been any much better to make matters
worse charging this thing is kind of a
pain barely going from 10% to 28% in 30
minutes
something really shameful when compared
to the fast charging of 2016 flagships
but hey to be fair this is just 24 hours
of use we've got a long and extensive
review period and
time will tell if this phone really
lives up to being a better I phone
because you're actually paying extra for
it we've still got a ton of features to
test like the ip67 watering dust
resistance and make sure you chime in in
