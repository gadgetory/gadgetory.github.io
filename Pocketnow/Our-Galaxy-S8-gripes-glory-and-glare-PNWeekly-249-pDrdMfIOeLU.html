it's a galaxy s eight world and we're
just living in it we're going to run
down our early coverage of Samsung's
newest hottest phone and plus we're
seeing more android wear updates getting
pushed down to smartwatches and jamie is
making a little noise with their next
generation of phones to these stories
plus your viewer emails so make sure
you're charged and ready for episode 249
of the pocket now weekly this weekly
podcast is where we detect and discuss
those gadgets that make our lives mobile
smart phones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and the most exciting
news you'd see about galaxies was
watching reruns of cosmos on PBS i'm
juan carlos back now senior editor
pocketnow.com blasting the signal from
sunny Southern California joined this
week as always by plexi podcast producer
Jules Wong how's it going out there on
the east carson allottees behind cosmos
are just awesome first you beg for it
and then freaking Tyson just close and
drops mic everyone acid and and
ridiculously awesome that that was
produced by what's his name for family
guy Seth mcFarland Luke almost forgot
that guy's name a terrible casting
director here in Los Angeles I can't
remember that guy's name but Before we
jump into too much of the tech
tomfoolery and all the fun conversations
that were apt to get into on this
podcast we do have to take a moment to
thank this week's sponsor and that is
blue apron and we get it you're busy but
that doesn't mean you don't have time to
put together interesting meals using
high quality ingredients a blu ray print
takes the guesswork out of cooking
delivering the exact amounts of food you
need for each recipe no joke I put one
together last night it needed one
scallion I had once Kathy in the box and
all ingredients meats and vegetables are
sourced ethically using sustainable
sources and those and those sources are
often very close to you supporting local
farmers in your area meals are delivered
to 99 percent of the continental United
States and the costs are under ten
dollars per serving now I actually have
recipe cards up here with me some of the
meals that are coming out this month
Swiss chard and potato shakshuka with
sweet peppers and garlic toast we've got
mole a spiced beef chili with
russet potato and lime creme fraiche and
spicy chicken sandwiches with Alabama
white sauce and roasted sweet potatoes
we put this one together last night and
it was delicious these recipe cards are
phenomenal because they have like this
full rundown of everything that you need
to do to put the the recipe together and
all of the ingredients that you're going
to use from the blue apron packaging
putting together rich flavorful meals
shouldn't be stressful or intimidating
so that kind of documentation is always
a nice touch each week you can customize
your menu to fit your particular tastes
dietary restrictions including
vegetarian options blu-ray print has an
extensive collection of recipes so
subscribers won't encounter the same
meal twice over the course of a year
unless requested cooking together can
help improve family bonds and blue apron
families cook together three times more
often and my little daughter is
absolutely fascinated by me thrown
around pots and pans I throw her in her
high chair I start cooking in the
kitchen and she also gets to kind of
sample and taste some of the things that
I'm putting together it's a fun way to
bond over food and often her favorite
Disney songs so you will love how good
it feels to it how you will love how
good it feels and tastes this is their
their end cap this is why I'm kind of
stumbling on this to create incredible
home-cooked meals with blue apron so
don't wait check out this week's menu
and get your first 3 meals for free by
going to blue apron com / pocket now
again blue apron com / pocket now for
your first three meals on us and we
thank them for supporting the pocket net
week you will love how feels that good
good it's just like I was getting ahead
of myself and like and yeah i kinda I I
didn't stick the landing unfortunately
but we've been using blue apron for a
little while it's a nice way we kind of
use it as a way to fill in fill in the
gaps on our weekly cooking and meal prep
and it is it's really great for three of
us one of us is a little baby that when
we get the meals for two that's enough
food for all three of us to eat so
that's just kind of a nice little little
side then you know like a little insider
info that i don't know the blue apron
wants you know yes if you got a toddler
they tend to not eat as much as a
full-grown adult
they put down and that's why you should
probably um get you know baby food yeah
that's that's the thing that's you
should I you know what I really thought
you know you have this idea of what
babies do I really thought she was gonna
be eating baby food a lot longer nope
she's like she eats the same things as
we do apparently toddlers are also
people who knew I mean you know human
still but they grow up to be
inconceivably weird like beings and then
you just started around toddler age so
yeah I mean what it yeah right about now
man so you probably already like
introduced her to pistachio ingrained
salami and and you'll just be infecting
her with other kinds of them weirdness I
haven't gotten there gotten there yet
but apparently my daughter is a big fan
of sweet and mild curries oh okay like
Indian food I have no idea where that
came from cuz you don't you don't have
in my why you don't have you don't have
like even like the Japanese or Chinese
styles it was more just like what we
thought we would be exposing or two in
that like you know flavor combo even a
very mild curry is a very powerful
flavor you know like we weren't
expecting her to really gravitate
towards that but you know we we sat down
at this indian place and she's just
going to town on a korma and she's got
the other like little dipping sauces and
stuff and you're like wow she's she's
ahead of the curve they're sickly and
tingle Oh exactly but I we're be able to
freely talk about this thing now that we
have a specific space in our in our
agenda to do so yes we're trying a
little format shift on how we we
normally go about talking about tech
news and some of the things that we're
working on your pocket now so hopefully
this is this is a fun way to consume the
pocket now podcast and also I mean for
those of you listening I'll go
technically the segment hasn't even
start here I still have to get through
like the the new news digest thing that
we would do yes so we should probably
save that but it's also for those of you
you know the little behind the scenes
here like Jules and I only really get to
talk once a week so part of the podcast
is you all did
having to deal with the fact that this
is how we catch up like this is happily
feels like our work and conversation is
our water cooler like I get to talk to
Kwan about my kids as well yeah sure I
wish okay maybe I should adopt anyways
I'm I'll just go through the news and
we'll talk again in four minutes whether
or not we would like to talk about
chicken korma curry but let's let's just
get through the news here and we start
with the galaxy s 8ns a-pluses some
Korean users who are just getting their
hands on the devices say that their
screens have odd wit tint to them
samsung says the issue should not be a
quality-control one and can be adjusted
within the device if users aren't
satisfied they can take over to s
service center plenty of new hardware up
ahead as well this week was shall be
eastern as introduced the flag should
meet six To China we're talking about a
Snapdragon 820 five six gigs of ram
stereo speakers dual cameras in a very
glossy or a very ceramic design and a
price starting above three hundred sixty
dollars sales comments April
twenty-eighth a few days prior to that
we're tracking LG's embarrassing track
record in Europe continuing on with the
g6 apparently 24 countries in the
continent will have to wait until at
least Monday that's April 24 for the
phone to launch that's after gate using
Korea the US Canada Australia earlier
this month mind you galaxy s eight
orders are shipping right now and the
similar availability problems have been
told over 320 and other phones so that's
not good beyond that we see invitations
that are out for us to squeeze for the
brilliant new and they those are from
HTC pocket now has been trucking a phone
codenamed ocean with a pressure sensing
you are basically it's like the side
bezels tentatively named edge sense so
we can expect a lot more about that on
age 16 to the summer now and sharps
newest phone it looks like a samsung
flagship of old but it brings us
Snapdragon 835 two companies decide
early May
rangeline up calling it the aqua park
it's being paired up with a funky robic
hole in telligent swiveling charge based
expect to hear more from the foxconn
owned OEM soon about that late May will
be when the last legacy Android wear
SmartWatch gets updated to Android wear
to point out if you haven't noticed 360
while a watch or some other eligible
device that hasn't been updated yet you
may be lucky to see the update coming at
the end of this month the time will tell
LG display's reported to be making OLED
screens for the shall we me notes the
next cleaner device and potentially for
LG electronics own v30 coming later
later this year the company's still
crying itself away from LCD
manufacturing though which may so be
fuel for a contract with apple to
provide for the iphone 7 hands of use 7s
which is not the fancier iphone 8 coming
out simultaneously speaking of that
iphone 8 could go without touch ID
multiple stories you can check out at
our website claim that Apple might open
it the tech all together put a sensor at
the back and this is the least likely
situation it seems successfully
implement one below the display there
have been trials about that we'll get
back to you as soon as developments
occur finally on the carrier side Sprint
is now offering global roaming data at
LTE speeds for its unlimited plan users
it's free in Canada and Mexico most
elsewhere for all customers except in
China and where it's more expensive it's
five dollars daily and twenty-five
dollars a week t-mobile offers a maximum
speed of up to 200 56 kilobits per
second that's included with their team
over 1 plus plan at semicon dollars
which is second tier above the basic
team and that is all the news you can
see full details on these doors and more
hip pocket now calm and look for the
podcast section to get to this episode's
to run down so with all that said what's
your feeling this week what like there's
been plenty of I I kind of wanted to
backtrack just real quick on
use front every Rica picked one of the
stories us yeah so oh yeah no so so one
of the things like I the the xiaomi
announcement that they're going to be
partnering with LG was for me one of the
more exciting quieter stories in in the
rundown and pocket now right now because
we haven't seen LG in the phone space
with an OLED panel since me relax and in
fact i was just commenting on this with
someone we were in a conversation on one
of the youtube videos for the galaxy s
eight you know like it's really a shame
that the last flex got saddled with such
a crap welcome processor on that first
generation the first batch of those
qualcomm a-10s because the screen was on
point i mean it was a great step in the
right direction for some competition for
samsung in the oled space and it's you
know it's kind of a bummer that we
haven't seen LG try anything like that
again even if you don't have a bendy
phone you can still put an OLED on a
g-series a ravine it was kind of a kind
of bummed that we haven't seen more in
the plastic OLED the film that's because
they've been working on that for the
flex apparently not faring too terribly
well for phones I guess but they have
been using them in their smart watches
um maybe oh yeah because the size
characteristics or something within that
system that really works out that
plastic OLED is more feasible for
smartwatches and smartphones but I mean
it's still do you think johnny is going
to go with the platico letter do you
think we're going to take some of that
allege sheet and put glass on top of it
for a more traditional I'm not sure if
this is the active matrix kind that
we're talking about here just they say
oleaga those sources don't really go
through if that is the source from the
the investor and it was like a couple of
agencies that compiled this report so
yeah it's a drawing I mean LG has lots
of competition ninety-five percent i
think is the key statistic here oulad
the Olin market for smartphones is from
Samsung and China is starting to get
into things to a couple of its suppliers
or
ramping up the factories hopefully they
can get multiple hundreds of thousands
of units per month instead of the tawdry
37,000 per month everything like aren't
things that I was worried about when we
were talking about the iphone oled
iphone back then we didn't know it was
going yeah either this year next year
but uh is that like we we kept seeing
members like in the tens of thousands
per month and even with that going all
the way like 18 20 24 months back that
was only going to provide you know a
couple billion units are best when we're
talking about a phone that would take a
huge portion of the 200 300 million that
apple would set in iphones that year so
now do we think that that's still on
point like if we're talking about a more
traditional iphone 8 launch and then an
iphone premium that because it would be
a more expensive iphone and a bit more
of a specialty item like i'd be able to
keep the numbers or sales lower to match
sort of oled production I don't know on
that end I mean does that make sense it
should make sense in in real world as in
like the place that you and I live in
but market analyst high street banks
that just like okay so this is probably
they're taking you know anywhere from
forty to sixty percent of you know new
model production this year as opposed to
the boring drab old iphone 7s which is
also going to be decided maybe the 7s
plus we did a story about LG display
perhaps being very interested in taking
the LCD contracts for those two phones
so then we make sense yeah this is a
trial period this is a transition period
this is definitely a rough time it's
going to be certainly interesting to see
which any of these manufacturers will be
able to make the most dense against
Santa so you know in speaking of Samsung
and screens
probably start shifting over into our
actual galaxy SI cover g stuff but to
backtrack to your very first story I
don't think this is going to show up on
my crappy web camera here but if you set
the galaxy s yeah delirium if you set
the galaxy SI to basic mode now on the
s7 that actually delivered I think the
most accurate screen tone ever measured
at the time by a smartphone if you set
it to bills from a display right now if
I said it to ya from from display me and
I might be misremembering that so
someone please correct me down in the
comments if I'm wrong because I didn't
pull up any kind of show notes for this
um but if I switch the s8 into basic
mode the output is pretty warm yeah that
is kind of reddish or i get up around it
won't impaired to and it's you know
we've seen this in other AMOLED units
from the one I remember them I think was
the Moto know the Nexus 6 from Motorola
yeah yeah very pronounced you know it
could go down really low it always seems
like you know like you know we made the
point of mentioning the low-light
capabilities were just drops down to one
knit you can it's perfect for load
rating and all that and it's also but
also has this red 10 which you know
sacrifice but you know it also have that
kind of indirect um benefit of blue
light reduction I guess maybe so it's ya
know better provide so that's not with
any kind of I filter or anything on
either that's taking it at its most
basic like there shouldn't be any color
processing happening on that screen and
it seems like that display is naturally
a little on the warmer side something I
just kind of curious i mean like we
never we didn't really get the true RGB
stripe we didn't get the 4k display
there are a lot of things about this and
shifting the form factor that I think
Samsung has kind of slowed played on the
rest of the phone but reading that story
you know that's kind of a bummer i'm
going to go back and go into an adaptive
brightness and color mode now just
because i don't like the look of that
important
nothin on my phone screen whereas on my
s7 I used that almost exclusively in
basic mode because I felt it really was
the most accurate from when I was
shooting photos and taking video so
that's that's kind of a nice spot like
it would be an odd transition for 4 from
one phone generation maybe that one of
the more outlandish theories that I've
just thought of the second is that we
are looking at like logs I think
infrared is shorter wavelengths right
now wait that no I ya know it'd be
longer because more frequently is the
blue and the ultraviolet and all that
stuff so if it's shorter doesn't that it
don't they like convey themselves longer
or like farther than blues usually
because it well yeah I mean if we're
talking like roygbiv then yeah reddish
tones are longer wavelengths you know
like so I'm not what little a little
high school physics looking through the
prism and that's it so like they really
make you read that are really
pronouncing themselves in just a given
like neutral situation i'm not exactly
sure of that but you know i mean it's
what we've seen in other devices so
maybe it's just a rule of thumb yeah I I
don't know i i'd be curious to see other
people spots like if there's so here
would be i think the one thing that
would make an actual difference in my
opinion of the phone if there's a
disparity in the consistency of color
tone from other galaxy SI units then
that makes me a little nervous about
samsung's QA if all if this panel design
really is sort of structured and it's a
little bit warmer naturally and they're
using some sort of adaptive code out of
the box to make it whatever brightness
or whiteness that you want then i'm not
i'm not concerned by that at all I mean
this is a consumer-facing phone this
isn't sort of a professionally
calibrated device we're not looking at
the same kind of accuracy we would
expect from a graphic design tablet or
something like that but if this is an
inconsistent issue with panels then we
know that Samsung has got
some issues and fulfilling orders from
the manufacturing side in trying to keep
other that opening scene from american
beauty is going to be lovely on that
phone are you know just like you know
i'll always fire up the scene of the
floating plastic bag because it's the
most beautiful thing thank you on that
bag are gonna be really popular yeah
this is this is my interpretive dance
version of the plastic bag oh man our
listeners miss out on so much don't they
the audio version of this show is the
word be sorry look look let's talk more
about the holistic aspect of the yeah
and we looks I mean do you have the box
with you we can I can pad out if you
need to and we could talk about the
boxing whoa look at that look at that
desk all the way back over there look
it's a black box and it's a interesting
looking and let me let me get out in
front of my face I it is a very dark
that's the retail packaging design I
mean yeah this isn't this isn't the
super awesome I are you joke about that
time a got a little bit I mean he got
his phones before me so I'm only going
into my second day of getting to play
with this phone but not only did he get
his phones before me he also got the
super awesome mega like I think it also
came with a gear VR the new gear VR or
something like that and I didn't get to
play with any of that I went straight
into reviewing the audio stuff so you
know that's that get down to business
I'm going to pay 99 99 for that extra
on-ear treatment with them I actually
haven't seen this whole video so I'm
trying not to be distracted but I am
like loading this you know is he's
unboxing with a little biofilm and the
huge oversized like super wide box that
you know I mean it's there on our
YouTube page it's darren pocket now and
includes everything that is bundled with
pre-orders well at least but gear VR and
the with the controller that we see on
screen right now
that looks pretty pretty quality stuff
and then there's the extra the on your
level here earphones that are paired
with a 256 so Giga has SD card 499 extra
dollars have you choose to these things
started chipping out today technically
so the stock pre-orders are like like
forced down pre-orders on April 17 and
then move them move starving shipments
t-mobile actually started shipping them
out on Monday of the 18th so that yeah
there early streak going for them and
you know overall is like you you get the
feel that they're nice it's a nice
something for reviewers yeah well that's
a nice that's a nice way to unbox a
phone and I'm definitely yeah i'm super
jealous i think especially look at the
boring edition what about quad at wine
what's a little i really don't want to
do this because this is going to take up
too much time it's going to be horrible
and not interesting at all but what is
the unboxing experience for you I so
it's well it's terrible right now
because like over there on the floor is
the charger and the cable so get a
charger and a cable that's pretty spiffy
really love and then you also i have
early and just throw it right on the
floor i mean spike it like a football
you do get the micro USB adapter so for
your existing micro USB cables you can
convert them to us bc i really do like
this trend of samsung including an OTG
adapter for a full-sized USB port so
it's supposed to be used the idea is
that you use it for transferring your
data from another phone but keep it
because it'll also plug in two cameras
it will plug into USB flash drives it's
a nice little handy add-on as we try to
keep our phones we start treating our
phones more like pocketable computers
and then of course you do get the the
premium earbuds that will retail for a
night will talk about and separated from
the phone which we're going to talk
about notice I didn't say that they're a
cagey headphones you get the premium
earbuds that's a tee
for what we're going to talk about here
in just a bit and that's that's what
comes in the box I think this is this is
a well a well accessorized device I'd
really love for samsung to include some
kind of clip on or snap on protective
backplate like we've been seeing from
Huawei I've been a huge fan of Huawei
adding that last little piece of
accessory and I think it would come in
clutch to have just a clear soft plastic
shield that can go on the back of your
galaxy SI because this is still one of
my biggest complaints with this arrow
they had last fall so um you've seen a
dumb no I keep thinking lamberti but
he's not dumb Esposito his video on that
oh yeah but to peace yeah yeah yeah $20
the bell $20 you watching him like no
means and yeah those are well and like
just hilarious like the worst case you
can find everything tactics you know you
seen grass what better kabuki knees on
so like there you go oh man well that's
I'll have to take his word on your night
and I'm trying I'm trying to do in case
well yeah I'm not interested in that
case but um you know it it should be it
should be disclosed that for all of our
coverage our galaxy SI coverage is
sponsored by d brand and the galaxy SI
that I got we did put on a dbrand skin
just to get a couple vanity shots for
for the ads which I don't even think
we're using which is kind of a bummer
but I was kind of sad taking the skin
off I liked having a better tactile grip
on the back of the phone and and like as
soon as we're done with this podcast I'm
going to be outside again to shoot more
for the real camera review and I'm
really anxious about holding this thing
out in public like I'm the one who's
rolling around in the dirt I'm holding
it over freeway overpasses like I i cram
I try to cram week's worth of shooting
into a couple days so it's a really
aggressive
of photo schedule to get all of the
setups of y'all going around you're
you're running for the crab pincers as
well sometimes because you got to get
the right aspect ratio have the respect
we should I orientation I like it's it's
it's the same it's the same criticisms
we've been having of these edge screens
for a while it's like to avoid any kind
of touching of the display where your
camera viewfinder is you start doing
this really light fingertip hold and the
new camera app has a zoom where you
slide the shutter button up or down
which means if you're trying to just
rapidly touch for a couple different
shots like especially if you're shooting
in manual mode you're very likely not
perfectly perpendicular tapping on the
screen you might have like a little
flick up and if you do that it doesn't
actually take the photo it then
initiates part of the zoom and it's like
you have to be even more careful in how
lose Inge early much and parts it it is
a little twitchy ER than the s7 was
again this is a muscle memory issue more
than anything else like I am not used to
this phone I've had it for less than 48
hours but I did not have this retraining
this retraining wasn't necessary going
from the s60 s7 that was baller and even
for the day that I got to play with a
note 7 um same thing like I didn't have
this kind of like relearning like just
barely holding it on the edges of my
fingertips and then having to interact
with slightly more precise pieces of
software so all in all this has still
been giving off a very positive first
impression but there are a lot of
philosophical questions that I hope
Samsung can address over the life of
this particular kind of getting paranoid
about how many times I've used my filler
word or words you know you know but um
Jackie you know but I'm going to ask my
question anyways because the do ahead OA
so just the length of the phone and like
I make you consider the Holy in new ways
because I've been able to find that like
a like a weird off like this upside grip
where it's you know you hold the phone
this way like a coffee mug and then you
just tilt it over and then assist as
needed with the volume buttons with the
other hand like that seems like a decent
idea for a fried bread but I don't
particularly know what kind of solution
so you're you're I think I think you're
you're totally right there and I think
the g6 is a little easier to do that
with and I think the regular sized or
the smaller si is going to fit right in
line with that kind of operation the SI
plus starts to get just that little bit
bigger that little bit taller that it's
just still not quite as handy to do that
kind of phone twisting turning shifting
kind of along a lot of this also comes
down to the fact that i think the LG is
just easier to hold on to because of the
flat sides so it's not like this phone
is so much thinner than a G then I like
the s8 plus some Waggoner's it's our
physics oh yeah feels yeah exactly
exactly it's because of the tapers the
symmetrical glass on the front and back
of the SI plus that it feels so much
thinner but because of that I really do
feel like in these first two days so
much more of my operation is balancing
this phone on my fingertips because I
know I'm going to have to reach up if I
want to use the fingerprint sensor I
know I'm going to have to slide down to
hit the home button from my thumb I know
I'm gonna have to slide back up or flip
the phone flat for my thumb to reach the
notification shade or if I want the
fingerprint sensor to use the
notification shade which I totally
screwed up in my 24-hour first look it's
like I couldn't find the setting and i
was looking at all the fingerprint the
fingerprint security settings and there
was no option therefore using the
fingerprint sensor to pull the
notification shade and it's in it just
it's in a different venue so that's
permanently baked into that video please
go to the pocket now YouTube channel and
make fun of me there plato deliveries or
they pull up here
haha no to be doing this right now ah
look at that dork oh so I this phone
makes me nervous because it comes from a
land down under and actually yes it does
watching the body yeah that's not that
much more than so audio tablet you and
you sit and there aren't any like real
full body like plastic cases for that
yet oh there there are actually um we've
got a pretty good relationship with urs
design and they're going to be sending
us out some cases just to kind of
incorporate into some of our other
reviews it's just again the phones so
brand spankin new that I think a lot of
those PR reps are trying to push two
different producers in fact we might be
bringing on a new pocket no team members
soon and hopefully he can start digging
into more of the accessories that why
what I've been told about I this you're
just getting the scoop now me we've been
trying to engage in a few conversations
with some other youtubers and some other
people that we want to partner with and
we're just now starting to get to that
point so hopefully by by next week maybe
he'll even be able to join us on the hog
and ethically it's another little T
there so yeah this is the I mean well I
want to go back to your 24 hour of first
impressions because I do want to include
the sense that it it's not all brimstone
and fire and you know there's definitely
some cream and chrome like ratatat has
described oh yeah and a lot of this i
mean again a wee we got a couple of very
frustrated comments like we were just
throwing shade part of doing a 24-hour
video isn't necessarily just to be wow
and impressed by an unboxing I didn't
get the box be impressed by an unboxing
it's to start asking some of the
questions that we need to examine as we
go through the review process and so
against phones like the g6 or the v 20
or a huawei mate 9 Samsung is asking me
to change my behavior and how I handle a
phone if I want to use the phone naked
or I'm going to have this beautifully
designed device
this is one of the most beautifully
constructed pieces of consumer
electronics you have ever seen when you
handle it in person but I'm gonna have
to cover it up with a case or put some
kind of skin on it for better grip else
it's just a really big Barb's slick
slippery soap so that's a part of that
review process we have to start asking
some of those questions and looking at
what is it that changes our behavior and
this is one of the things like I've not
been a huge fan of curved glass and
glass on glass design since I smashed a
note 5 that's the only phone I've ever
broken during the review I've scratched
some phones i dented some phones it's
the only phone I've rendered completely
inoperable and from a pretty minor drop
so I've been very anxious about this
kind of design philosophy and this phone
doesn't really change my opinion of that
but now I have to look at what is it
that is changing about my behavior when
I use this phone and especially when I
use this phone very aggressively like
shooting the real camera review or
taking it out and trying to do some
water resistance tests or something like
that and and I don't have those same
concerns with the g6 I no ratings or
whatever you know you can still smash a
g6 you can still break it but there's
just that little extra peace of mind
with the mil spec rating and I don't
feel like I'm really changing my grip on
the phone from the v 20 or from a mate 9
because of the flat sides on the g6 so
again it's just the 24 hours is my first
part of the review process and then
we'll be able to examine those questions
and find the pros and cons and and
selling celebrate a bit more of the
phone after we've gotten more of a
chance to get used to it we weren't in
on the early pre-embargo stuff so a lot
of the reviews that are out there from
people that have already spent probably
a week or more with the phone you know
I'm still playing catch-up there this is
still ran so there's a lot of coping
going on compared to other devices that
you view this is the most you would
think that you have done and not the
most for pocket now because you know I
made spent almost
all of his time with Samsung nearly
exclusively on the s7 edge I didn't
spend any time with the S Evan edge and
I did get a note and I got the note days
before the major recalls on the note so
I'm coming my last my last long term use
samsung phone was the regular flap front
s7 so that's that is kind of a little
bit of of a sea change you know if you
were coming from an essex a flat front
s6 not in s6 edge or a note 5 a flat
front no 5 and then you came over to
this s7 there is a little behavior
modification in how you go about using
the phone now I think for a lot of our
audience especially the people that flip
their phones from more frequently this
isn't going to be a difficult
acclimation but I'm looking at you know
like my mom's on an a galaxy s5 I don't
know that the essay is going to be a
phone she's really going to enjoy for
the way that she's been using her s5 so
it's those little things or Mike my dad
is still on a galaxy alpha yeah you know
it's like a little mini baby note for
design those those hard metal flat edges
and I was rubbery back plate I don't
think he's I loved that phone i really
wish they had kept up with that because
i just love the note for design language
in general but i don't know that he's
really gonna dig the essay coming from a
phone like that so again it's it's I'm
not worried about our audience and our
audience is already like a lot of the
people that are leaving comments
especially are people who already own it
already own the s8 and they're coming to
join the conversation it's more or not
and I hope it's not really coming across
like I'm trying to put it all over this
phone because I'm not it's just this is
this is something that's fresh for me
and this is something that's new for me
and I'm also trying to look at this from
the perspective of other members of my
family other friends of mine I think we
take it for granted that we're just
going to get used to some of these
changes and I think there are a few
things about this device not that I
would ever say that this should take the
device out of a purchasing wreck
mendation but there are a few things
about this device that I think are going
to be a challenge for some users out
there interesting um another I don't
mean to pile on this whole economics
aspect but one of the features oh no
please please do because I think this is
a fun debate you know what I mean like
like it's a fun thing to kind of me
because I'm asking I'm asking you the
questions but I don't get to ask like
the other side I guess questions like
because they're not he's right um there
and they might not even exist who knows
[Laughter]
anyway so one of the big feature
paradigms that was introduced with the
edge is the edge sweet like you'd swipe
away the edge screen and you would have
all the tools like contacts and and
other apps and whatnot how have you been
able to get along with that feature if
you ever use it at all because um one of
the features that i enjoyed from Chris
Lacey's action launcher and I believe
maybe or maybe not a one plus as
employment but it was like an instant
shelf where you from any points in on
the phone no matter what if you were on
the home screen or in an app you would
be able to swipe the shelf and get
access to any app that you would need so
that I feel like would be so I haven't
been the biggest fan of edge because I I
do somewhere in my bookcase full of
crazy old phones i do have an s6 edge+
um I actually haven't been the biggest
fan of that kind of you I edition so I
am going through I'm still setting up
like I just got all my apps last night
on my second home page set up the way
that I normally would and I'm right now
I'm trying to simplify I used to be that
guy who had seven full home pages and I
kind of whittled that down to five and I
kind of whittled it down to three and
I'm down to two and I like trying to
streamline what I can get to and a part
of that is because my usage is very not
like your average consumers
where the muscle memory of navigating a
phone kind of needs to stay the same no
matter what phone I'm on just that I
don't drive myself crazy so I'm still in
the process of setting up the edge panel
on this phone but so far I just don't
see where that kind of add on really
gets me to the services that I need or
the contacts that I want to communicate
with in any more efficient way than just
a smart streamlined approach to
customizing home screen panel so there's
so much kind of going on right now where
I'm looking at huawei was actually the
company that made me start taking a look
at this because there were so many extra
steps involved in navigating Huawei menu
they're like there's got to be a way to
kind of clean this up and then over emu
i-5 they've they've done a better job
but there are still a few things like
you've buried this setting three menus
even you didn't really need to so if I'm
gonna pull the edge panel you know that
it's a gesture and it's a gesture which
honestly might not always be perfectly
executed and then you slide through the
edge panel to get to the piece of
information you want whereas if I've
already customized my home screens for
the most used services and the most
contacted contacts that I've got I hit
the home button you know like in terms
of like programming muscle memory and
what I'm getting used to for myself
personally that's that to me sort of the
most straightforward approach for how I
can live my life while also being a
gadget reviewer again like should I be
trying to minimize even just
repositioning the phone in my hand to
interact with different parts of the
hardware or software so that's where I'm
kind of stuck like I've disabled bixby
from the home screen so like when I
slide to the right it doesn't pull up
fix be there because I just want my home
screens to be my home screens I'll play
with the edge panel I'm not I don't
think it's going to be something so we
have all those kinds of them
those elements where it's just dealing
with the hand feel of the phone I want
to move on in the short time we have
left to some of the audio visual
components of it um so let's go through
the camera because I think you're in the
middle of your process for that right
now so far so good yeah so far so far
very good um this isn't going to be
revolution uh for samsung I think if you
were on an s7 s7 edge I you probably
won't be seeing tremendous differences
in the photo and video output from the
s8 a couple key things that I've already
seen it because I've done mostly all of
my night shots so low light photography
night shot one thing I'm going to give a
thumbs up is that we do seem to have a
slightly better lens on the essay it's
not quite as Flair prone as what we saw
on the s7 and then a lot of the changes
I think are coming down more to image
processing more than some kind of
radical hardware improvement this does
use a different camera sensor than the
s7 but what I'm noticing is more samsung
I think following in the footsteps of
what like the pixel is really good at
not not necessarily in taking multiple
photos but in using software algorithms
to help reduce noise bring up more
detail better contrast better color
better clarity and this isn't radical
departure from the S Evan but it
genuinely seems to be improved across
the board when you look at to sort of a
shot from the hip quick photo here it's
the middle of night on a busy street so
you're you're lit by street lamps and
then you look at the photos and like oh
yes eight actually did deliver a better
photo in that kind of auto mode in the
moment kind of film differently um it
works where it counts the most I guess
you could say right now but it's an
improvement where it counts the most I
don't think the s7 I you know I think
the f7 still works there especially if
you've got a pretty good feel for your
phone camera the only other major
difference that I've been able to find
is
video now while shooting UHD there is an
option to software crop so that you can
further use software stabilization in
addition to the hardware stabilization I
haven't shot a lot with that yet so I'll
be curious to see if that really does
help improve handshake or if it's going
to be the same sort of weird distortion
that I find when you use a combination
of software and hardware stabilization
why not a big vana to have with the
sensor and the frame because it's if
it's very 816 yeah I'm soon i think it's
the 13 megapixels so okay we're talking
about like 5000 ish and you know 3,000
plus whatever yeah it's it's it's a
total affordable sensor and so that 8
megapixel image yeah it's it's a pretty
small window but we've seen where the
pixel and the iphone deliver phenomenal
software stabilization by punching in to
that 4,000 pixel border and so Samsung
could stand to improve their my big
problem is with hardware stabilization
always on that means the lens is
wobbling you know the lens is
compensating for the movement of the
phone that does create optical
distortions you know you see it a lot on
LG phones right you go handheld and you
see those big jello II swings because
there's such a huge range of image
stabilization on in LG there's a there's
a smaller range of stabilization on a
samsung but there is still optical
distortion happening so when you have
those wobbles happening and then you
crock this is the worst hand drive I've
ever done on camera but then you crop
that image in the the software is
panning to compensate for movement and
the lenses wobbling so you often arrive
at this kind of sub daughter really
wobble a multi-step like it's hard to
drive in words those of like the pixels
are all of a sudden yeah okay they're
kind of writing waves so your background
stands to be just a little bit smoother
but then you still see the swings of the
lens in distorting
field of view and I think that that
effect is less pleasant than if you just
had a little extra on shake in your
video you know like it you know you look
at a hallway and that's probably I think
the busiest looking video of any phone
from this year and I would still
probably take that over the combo of
software and hardware sort of mucking
with the scene I think it makes it look
kind of are we talking about too much is
a good too much of a good thing in this
case for the essay in particular I you
know it's I don't think it's a situation
of too much good things because I don't
notice ever looked good I don't think
this isn't this isn't unique to Samsung
a lot of companies especially when you
shoot HD video will combo hardware and
software and I don't think it's ever
looked good so this is just as something
we need to test is the Samsung have a
better solution for this like their
software processing better or if we're
going to use software stabilization
should we be more focused on like the
pixels implementation of it where there
is no hardware image stabilization but
that video in good light comes out
buttery smooth that video in medium to
low light looks really artifact II you
know it as the software is trying to
compensate for the longer shutter speed
of each individual frame you get blurry
streaky things happening it doesn't
really smooth the video out very well so
again it's all it's all compromises you
know where do we want to put that
compromise and honestly I think more
people will probably land on the Samsung
version of the compromise like if I were
to just show you a blind taste test of
low light pixel video and low light
Samsung video I think more people would
probably like the low like Samsung video
but it's still something that we need to
take a look at because i think in good
light the pixel video would probably
also we're expecting that a real camera
review tomorrow i believe or sometime in
the future i'm going to try and get it
out tomorrow it might end up dropping
over the weekend but it will become when
they say podcast drops as well so by
that time maybe you'll have different
judgments
what's this camera can do uh let's talk
about yeah like tune back in because the
the analogous will know your mind you're
going to say the exact opposite of what
you're talking about in this podcast so
everything I totally should let's uh
let's uh almost wrap this up with audio
now we do have a unique situation just
to gloss over I mean I don't want a
gloss over but um there is a bigger
issue with the summarized very
summarized word better audio not the
best internals are better than before
and kind of closing in on the upper
mid-range you would say speakers are
just the same ish because no definitely
situation so so so I I think that we we
I tried to address all of you in the
exact same sentence we um let's start
with the speakers so we have the real
audio review and we go into a little bit
more depth and we actually have like our
charts and graphs and stuff so that you
can see what's going on to summarize the
real audio review tldr over the s7 i do
here not not a humongous but a
noticeable improvement in quality
because the sm and speaker was pretty
weak oh I thought the S Evan was a step
down from the s6 the essay I think would
be a very minor improvement over the s6
and that's important because the common
knowledge was waterproofing a phone
makes the speaker less good and LG and
Apple have broke both disproven that and
now Samsung has finally caught back up
so that's definitely something that we
want to give them the thumbs up on
getting back on track there the
headphone output again we're coming at
this from the Qualcomm powered Samsung's
I don't think the XO knows powered
Samsung's have had as many issues but in
North America we get Qualcomm and they
kind of use just whatever normal audio
settings come with that chipset and it's
always been closer to the bottom end of
the smartphone spectrum this now gets us
back up into
Pettitte of territory against iphones
which is which is a very positive step
for samsung much better signal-to-noise
ratios yeah I mean for all of my griping
about Apple its they still deliver a a
respectably high quality audio string
even through that ridiculous dongle
adapter that they've got for the
Lightning connector so what's funny is
and I mentioned this specifically in the
real audio review what's funny is that
this is all positive for a company like
Samsung you know this is improvement
this this is a better audio output for
the headphone jack and it gets it's
nearly identical to the output from the
LG G six where a lot of people are
griping about the LG G six because it's
a step down from the LGV 20 and only a
few select markets are going to get the
v 20 DAC in the g6 where we know the v
20 is still one of the best headphone
phones ever created so I just think it's
a funny perspective where any minor
improvement to a North American galaxy
is kind of a big positive deal and it's
the almost exactly the same output from
the g6 which has been a negative talking
point for a lot of the people who leave
ganar videos there are some talking
words we want to um I don't know trade
bats with maybe if we want to get into
our discussion about the AKG situation
so I'm view if you will if you will
going on with the the bundled in
earphones from a kg so this isn't this
is breaking news this is bleeding edge
commentary did it did it did it um no so
we put out the the day I got the phone I
I was right on tasked to do the real
audio review and while I was digging
into that I felt it was just sort of it
was worth splitting off the headphone
commentary as a separate review and and
I'm glad we did because it it sort of
needed its own video space not to just
be lumped in with the rest of the phone
video review stuff that we've been doing
sorry excuse me so I they're very high
quality earbuds samsung saying that
they're going to sell them for ninety
nine dollars and i think they compete
well against other sort of fashionable
branded earphones your ear buds that are
around that same price territory like in
terms of actual output quality i would
put them up near say the bno plays that
i got with the v 20 and those retail for
around 150 so those h3s are not cheap i
I think Samsung's and spitting distance
of that I like the binos better I think
the highs on the binos could be a little
bit more sparkly and a little more
playful but I think Samsung's right in
line with this pricing and i would say
that they're competitive against other
manufacturers like a v-moda where v-moda
earbuds can often run around a hundred
dollars now what bothers me and we put
out a video today after we released the
AKG earbud review we got a message from
a samsung PR rep saying that our review
was a little inaccurate because these
are not a kg earbuds there samsung
earbuds tuned by a kg and that
disclosure actually did bother me a
little bit because there's huge AKG
branding on the earbuds all of Samsung's
primary discussion points have said that
these are earbuds from a kg that that's
exactly what they said wonderful errors
that we went to out in New York and that
that type of disclosure means something
to me because a kg is one of my all-time
favorite audio brands my absolute
favorite studio microphone is the AKG c
414 this is a company that it set the
gold standard for recording and
professional audio electronics since the
late 60s i believe and so this makes me
a little nervous with samsung owning the
parent company of a kg being so cavalier
with that branding that these are not a
legitimate earbuds out at all and that
that also the tone from samsung PR was
that we should have known this we didn't
know this not because we didn't do our
homework we didn't know this because it
really hasn't been disclosed in that way
you know this this this really I don't
feel like you know you have the AKG logo
on the earbuds that were supposed to
assume that this is not a cagey hardware
that this is Samsung hardware and so
that that the way that this was sort of
illustrated to us I don't to be a little
problem i mean we want to let's go back
as a step here so Samsung did recently
closed its acquisition of Harmon which
among all of its brands including Harman
Kardon and write it has a cagey JBL is
off I think JBL yep yep JP AKG and is
also one of them and you know there is
there is some sort of you know arm that
you put out for distance just to say
that what they do is not what we do and
so on so forth but there is also that
kind of desire to bring them in
partnership and you know leverage all
their expertise and what not to show a
strong combined brand or you know to
strengthen both yeah it's a win-win for
samsung they didn't have the best audio
reputation and they want to start
capitalizing on their acquisition
financial literacy Winkley is boss
exactly fair in its representation to
just okay so there's the we're dealing
with part I'd companies and you know we
can blow them away if we have to
absolutely like way we can just push
them away so I'm really getting a sort
of mixed sense of who they are they're
still separate entities I think still in
this like at this moment yeah i mean
this acquisition still has still has
fresh ink on it right yeah I can still
some mud the signatures from all parties
involved that's that's how recent that
this this move was finally approved
because I'm with you too this does not
change my opinion of the quality of the
accessory which is included in the box
but this does annoy me a little as a
branding and labeling exercise because I
feel Samsung is not properly disclosing
to
consumers what this relationship
actually is and we have a nearly
identical situation that we can point to
with the LG v10 the v10 came with
earbuds that were tuned by a kg and have
LG logos on them because LG made those
headphones and then reached out to a kg
for all of the final like special magic
sauce that went into making those good
ear buds we don't have any confusion as
to what that relationship was and I feel
Samsung is not in any kind of criminal
sense and not in kind of any duplicitous
sense but I feel like they're
misrepresenting exactly what you're
getting in the box by putting the lid by
yours wing-like here but take credit
like we don't mind it seems good good on
you for making it's a pair of earbuds
but you know to say that entirely yeah
made of an a it was all an AKG effort I
that's that's what's so frustrating is I
don't think it diminishes the reputation
or the product in the slightest to say
that these are Samsung designed you know
premium custom buffet you know not
custom fit but you know like premium
interaural super high quality earbuds
that would sell retail for a hundred
dollars and already is a part of our
partnership with harman we reached out
for them to do the final pairing so that
these earbuds were specifically designed
to showcase the power of the new galaxy
s 8 audio processing units on board I
mean like that's just such a an organic
way to talk about this relationship that
it's a it is kind of frustrating to me
that that's not what they did and in the
in the sort of rebuttal video it's not
even a rebuttal videos the correction
video that we put out for this for the
situation like I actually included the
clip of the Samsung unpacked event where
they they say these are from a kg and
that wording means something different
to me then these are Samsung premium
earbuds that were tuned by a kg that
that's something very different to me as
someone who
still has a love of high quality and
professional audio recording gear from
my sennheiser headphones to my blue
microphones and everything else in
between and i don't mean blue yetis I
mean like my $2,000 blue kiwi and my
thousand-dollar blue blueberry that that
that's a distinction that I still hold
to be very important one that I don't
think changes any kind of purchasing
recommendation for consumers but it
makes me less accurate in how I'm
talking about these products especially
for the few people in our community who
do care about that level of distinction
in that level of echo what do you think
i'm going to go fly to shenzhen and
order a whole bunch of generic odium
earbuds and then you know have them
plastered the pocket now Logan on them
and I'm going to fly it back over and
drive down to a Manchester Connecticut
to meet up with a Harman and an AKG or
whatever and just basically passed
through tuning the tuning processes from
all of their associated brands right
then we can go to market and say
anything pocketnow freaking earbuds for
the best your food but are like 1500
like um man hours of Hogan is a man but
damn Jules that's elaborate but you know
it there there are a bunch of bad
comparisons we can make it mean it's
like if i buy a toyota and just put a
lexus badge on it do I have the same
thing and some of the some of that some
of those comments I don't really feel
have been quite fair to the value of
Samsung's premium your your but you have
you have the metrics it's fast it's not
the exact it's past but believed yeah
yeah totally absolutely it's just this
is again I mean like I keep wanting to
stress for me this is a frustration of
branding and labeling and also because I
very much care about that AKG label IIIi
can't I can't stress that enough I love
their professional recording equipment I
love their mixing gear I love there
DJ gear this is a company that I've
grown up with in the world of recording
and I don't like seeing that branding
tossed around so cavalier because
there's a trust there's a trust in me
expecting something from those three
letters that I can't get somewhere else
same thing with sennheiser same thing
with sure same thing with audio technica
same thing with Sony I have an
expectation and if I just start seeing
the letters AKG popping up on whatever
Samsung wants to slap them on very
quickly that brand is going to fall by
the wayside I mean I'm not aware of any
Samsung toasters flying around the
walmart locally so I just like a you
know Samsung Wi-Fi connected AKG
speakers toasted radios man a they a
thing back in the staties I guess maybe
they were a thing i'm not sure said that
no one ever so let's um what are you so
overall at this point you've had it for
a couple days now the essay what what's
your yeah what you're going on a goal
date away from this so far overall this
is a very this is a very positive first
48 hours again one of the most
stunningly beautiful devices i think
we've we've ever had the pleasure of
reviewing a pocket now the aesthetics i
don't think anyone would call into
question the big questions I have for
the review process are how much
potential will we really see realized
from this change in form factor and it's
going to be a difficult conversation for
us to have it's going to be a difficult
question to answer because it can't come
just from that first review we still
have to wait for the final update to
bixby including more voice controls and
we have to see what app developers
really start embracing these taller
screens because right now the solution
is to stretch apps which means certain
things get cut off in the corners will
we see developers embrace this hardware
within the life of this phone
or are we buying a product with
potential that might never be fully
realized and that's always sort of a
difficult idea to examine so none of
this is fun none of this is me saying
like you shouldn't be hyped up about
this phone or you shouldn't be jumping
on board I know a lot of people who have
already picked their phones up and are
having overwhelmingly positive
experiences with their essay purchase
it's still something that I want to take
a look at philosophically because I feel
like something has to start changing in
the world of smartphones and I don't
know if taller screens are really the
killer app that we've all been lacking
from our smartphone usage is this just
going to be another step in the right
direction that's not something to take
my hands and just have all our content
in like 10 by one you you know me man if
we could go straight to neural plug
directly into my optic nerve I'm ready
sign me up let's do this well in that
case yet let's properly end this another
episode of the pocket hell weekly has
come and gone the show is over but the
conversation continues on Twitter you
can find Jules as at point Jules and I'm
roughly at some gadget guy pocket now is
around the web on social media YouTube
and our home site pocket now calm we're
basically everywhere and shows like this
cannot exist without your support by
sharing the weekly with your friends who
love mobile technology and by dropping
reviews on iTunes stitcher google play
and wherever podcast reviews can you
laugh once again we want to thank this
week's sponsor blue apron they're
helping us keep the lights on and
they're helping me keep my stomach
filled with delicious food but
ultimately there wouldn't be a show if
it weren't for our listeners and
subscribers who have kept us on the air

back next week with all kinds of
delicious technology goodness so make
sure you tube back yet
