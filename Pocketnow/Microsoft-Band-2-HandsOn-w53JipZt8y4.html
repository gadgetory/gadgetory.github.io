Microsoft's aim with its new band
wearable which has been completely
redesigned and now resembles something
you might actually want to wear for
pocket now i'm michael fisher with adam
lane behind the camera here in new york
city with a first look at the Microsoft
band too let's just come out and say it
the first generation band packed a lot
of sensors but it was cumbersome and
bulky the new band is still a little on
the chunky side but it's the opposite of
cumbersome every part of this hardware
is curved from the to access Gorilla
Glass 3 to its thermoplastic elastomer
silicone Vulcan aid casing it's got a
similar attachment latch which is still
a good design and the AMOLED touch
display is big and bright at 320 x 128
pixels battery life remains the same
that a rated maximum of two days and
there's an all new sensor here as well a
barometer for tracking elevation whether
you're running up a mountain or about
walking up a mountain I guess point is
this is a fitness band for fitness
minded folks who are probably spending a
lot of time outdoors so there's still
the integrated GPS here alongside our
now constantly operating UV sensor for
those sunny days as well as some very
specific golfing features like practice
swing omission intelligence scorecard
keeping and so on if you're not into
golf or running you can track your sleep
with the onboard accelerometer and gyro
the band 2 is still powered by the
Microsoft health suite which has a host
of new partners including Facebook
Twitter and a big one here lose it and
of course you still get all your
notifications on your wrists right
alongside your fitness information a
better integration with Cortana and most
of that works whether you're paired to
an Android iPhone or a Windows Phone the
man 2 will retail for $249 when it goes
on sale October thirtieth but you can
pre order yours today through Microsoft
we'll do what we can to refine our golf
game or at least try and run a little
bit more so we can get ready for our
full review
there's so much more from Microsoft's
Windows 10 devices launch event in New
York City including new lumias new
services and even a surface laptop what
