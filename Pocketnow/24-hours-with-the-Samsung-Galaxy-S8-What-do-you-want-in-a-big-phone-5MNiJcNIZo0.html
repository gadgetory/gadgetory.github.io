brought to you by D brand ah the
honeymoon phase that initial getting to
know you as you break in a new phone the
Galaxy S 8 plus gives off a brilliant
first impression but it raises a few
philosophical questions in early use
while we set it up buying clad in piano
black even wiping it down between shots
y'all are just going to have to get used
to some fingerprint smudges in these
review videos instead let's talk about
the next evolution of Samsung's edge
display a samsung took what they learned
from the note and stretched the display
for a dramatic infinity effect
symmetrical front and rear curved glass
terminate in ultra-thin edges on the
sides and it completely achieves the
desired effect this phone feels a lot
smaller in the hand then it's screen
size would indicate a sleek is sexy but
it makes me nervous I'll be the one
rolling around in the dirt and holding
it over freeway overpasses for our real
camera review
I haven't particularly enjoyed these all
glass experiments and minimalism since
smashing a note 5 so for all the phone's
beauty it'll probably spend most of its
life in a case or skin - that case are
covered the rest of samsung's accessory
game is on point
black cabling and charger to match the
piano black finish of the phone we also
get a micro USB to USB C adapter to help
folks make that transition using the
cables they already own and the USB OTG
adapter is another terrific touch it's
reported purpose is to migrate user data
from another phone but keep it on hand
as it'll come in handy for other USB OTG
situations lastly there's a pretty
killer set of headphones in the box and
we shot a whole separate video showing
those off which we have linked down
below this first impressions Samsung's
data transfer is a solid option for
migrating user info I'm a showed it off
during our note 7 coverage but I'm off
to start fresh with this phone to get a
sense of what this thing can really do
free of all my junk molesting it the
second phone to arrive this year with a
taller display this introduces another
issue in how we describe screen area
simply mentioning diagonal no longer
truly illustrates how it might compare
to the competition we'll be digging into
more detailed comparison soon but as an
early tease the 6.2 inch si plus gives
us a star
of extra real estate over a pixel Excel
or an iPhone 7 plus and just a bit more
room than the 5.9 inch Huawei may nine
or it would if the s8 plus was a true
rectangle without these pretty curves
I'm not entirely sure how to do the math
on that one happily this is one of the
better shapes out there for one-handed
use on a big phone the overall width
shockingly close to a phone like the
smaller Huawei p10 or the LG G 6 we're
also waiting on app developers to see
who will embrace this new form factor
Samsung will crop or stretch content to
fill the display but otherwise expect
quite a bit of wasted space what's
disappointing is that even Samsung
hasn't completely embraced this screen
yet the camera app for example has huge
pockets of unused area but fire up the
manual controls and they still take up
part of your viewfinder this screen is a
nice improvement for web browsers and
scrolling apps though is vertically we
get more info on the display in any
given moment Samsung's custom software
running on top of the phone is also been
spruced up gestures slide you into your
app drawer your settings menu features
new iconography it's a clean and refined
approach to making navigation as fluid
and as organic as any company can but
some decisions like swiping vertically
for the app drawer then swiping
horizontally for app pages are certainly
unfamiliar folks who flip their phones
more readily will easily acclimate but I
wonder if I'll be getting questions from
friends and family coming from older
galaxies getting back to the screen for
just a sec in firing the phone up it
would seem Samsung is by default
reducing resolution perhaps as a battery
saving measure or as a way to improve
performance or both it's not disclosed
during setup that the phone defaults to
full HD instead of quad HD so we'll be
curious to see how many people outside
of our learning audience of course will
notice that reduction in display
resolution now my first day of use was
largely taken up by audio tests where
this phone is a nice step up over
previous North American galaxies we've
already published our real audio review
for folks interested in a deeper dive
and I took a little time out to shoot
some night photos which will examine
closer in our real camera review coming
soon more than anything else this phone
feels a lot different in operation than
any galaxy we've used
like the home button the effort to
maintain a hardware or tactile response
is appreciated but we're not sure why
Samsung opted to make this more
complicated than normal on-screen
controls the pressure-sensitive bit can
always take you home even when the home
icon isn't on your screen but that's the
only difference we can find press hard
press lightly it's a home button and a
shortcut to the Google assistant and
that's about it a camera shortcut is
moved to the power button familiar for
pixel users and maybe a touch easier
than using the volume rocker on some
other devices but the bigger sin is the
fingerprint sensor location on day one
this is not a natural spot to go looking
for that sensor hilarious that Samsung
warns you not to smudge your camera they
might have helped us out there with a
better location for the hardware but I
digress
this has also been one of the more
finicky sensors I've set up recently my
right index finger went well but I had
to retrain my left three times which
should have been the easier of the two
now that I'm thinking about it and it's
still a bit hit or miss for unlocking
the phone since that sensor is so high
up on such a tall phone I just always
feel like the phone is balanced on my
fingertips lateral swipes are easier but
there's a lot of shifting involved in
navigating unlocking and using the
camera but I don't feel like I ever have
a solid grip if I have to slag the phone
in my hand to unlock it it would have
been nice if I could have also used that
sensor to pull down the notification
shade or scroll through photos another
missed opportunity I'm hopeful that the
iris scanner will help take some of the
edge off but holding the phone up to
your face is a lot more deliberate and
action to perform than a fingerprint
scan this is all mostly compounded by
the fact that I just don't have any
muscle memory trained for this hardware
its new it's fresh and I'm still getting
used to it
there's so much potential for this new
form factor that's yet to be realized
and so many questions we'll still need
to examine in what we really want out of
a pocketable supercomputer but the
galaxy s A+ is a stunning design
achievement it really is one of the most
gorgeous mobile devices I've ever held
even if it makes me a little nervous to
hold it sometimes you probably didn't
know that jello is older than the zipper
jello was introduced in 1845 while the
zipper was first patented in 1851 we'd
like to thank our sponsor deep brand for
reminding us that
times were tough in the mid-1800s yes
certainly couldn't zip up a bag full of
jell-o this bizarre add in all of our
Samsung Galaxy sa coverage is brought to
you by D branch check them out in the
link below as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for our full Galaxy s8 and s8
Plus coverage hi mate we'll be taking a
crack at the smaller s8 and one of
plenty of reviews and comparisons
uploaded soon for Pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos bag now some gadget guy on
Twitter and Instagram and I will catch
you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
