tell you all about it the google nexus
10 gets leaked in photos and apple's new
ipad lineup launches on pre-order I'm
Hyneman iveta seeing tablets everywhere
and this is parking out daily so if
you're wondering what the google nexus
10 looks like well look no more we've
got some photographs but word of warning
this movie is rated R and the reason why
is because this is probably one of the
ugliest tablets I've ever seen now that
said hold on here the device has a
really compelling spec sheet it packs a
new Exynos processor we've never seen
before along with a new display that
actually makes the iPads retina display
look like last year's technology we also
found this docking port for wireless
charging that apparently works on the LG
Nexus 4 but could also work on the Nexus
10 so this starts to get interesting now
speaking of Android 4.2 even though we
still don't know what the operating
system is going to be called we already
got some leaked images of certain
features that we might get starting with
multiple users report now this is
nothing new to the custom rom community
so I can't tell you they can't believe
these leaks or not but I guess we're
just gonna have to wait for monday to
see what we get and as expected apple's
pre-orders for their new ipad mini and a
fourth-generation ipad started today and
already the ipad mini is out of their
first stock of devices initially they
were shipping for november second and
now they're shipping within two weeks
then you have to wait for the device now
what's interesting here is that the ipad
4th generation still is available in
stock and it could either mean that well
they had enough devices available with
the ipad 3 being revamped as the ipad 4
or it could just be that there wasn't
enough bus to sell for different ipads
in one year that would be the third ipad
the fourth ipad the many in the ipad 2
now Xbox SmartGlass is one of the killer
features the Microsoft has launched this
year and already they've made it
available to Android starting today what
the application allows you to do is to
control your xbox 360 using a Windows PC
a windows phone 8 also an Android device
as of the day and in the future an iOS
device you pretty much use your android
device as a controller also use your
xbox 360 as a full entertainment center
using your Android device so make sure
you get your application today at the
google play store
and finally for the hot news of the day
the microsoft surface tablet with
windows RT has already begun reaching
customers and rather has already
published his unboxing and first
impressions of the tablet so far he
loves the hardware he loves some of the
software and he's also already saying
that you should instead get the touch
type cover instead of the touch cover
apparently the touch cover is not so
good on sensitivity now watch Brandon's
video and that leads me to the question
of the day what are your first
impressions of the surface windows RT
tablet do you like it don't you like it
or you just didn't order one leave us a
comment down below and if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on parking
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hime
every better thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
