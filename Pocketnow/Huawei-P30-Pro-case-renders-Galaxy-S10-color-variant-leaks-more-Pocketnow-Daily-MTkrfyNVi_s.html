30 Pro just emerged and all we can say
is there are a lot of cameras we get
more information on the possible color
variance for the galaxy s 10 and s 10
plus it looks like the Google pixel for
bring some tricks for dual-sim
capabilities that it's always actually
had I'm hey Matt we've at our back in
studio one and boy is it cold
this is pocket out daily the official
news today come with analytics from
Gartner that claimed that smartphone
sales aren't gonna get any better and
guess the reason why according to
certain analysts they figured that
people are now holding on to phones an
average of two point six to two point
seven years meaning the BET refresh
cycle that's been going crazy for years
in the past of a year is not going to
happen anymore and even though they
don't provide the reasons why why do you
think that's happening this for me the
reason is the price tag they're too
expensive for you to want to change your
phone every year now let's talk about
the whole AT&amp;amp;T controversy and 5ge which
we know is not real there are some
gadgets out there that are capable of 5g
but the network is not there yet and so
yeah this has gotten to the point where
Sprint is actually suing AT&amp;amp;T because of
well they're claiming something that
they're not really providing and they're
misleading customers and that's just not
fair so I totally agree with Sprint
let's see how that ends now let's move
the spotlight over to the pixel for it
seems that one of the features that we
should expect from that phone is dual
some capabilities the funny part is
actually ever since a pixel to the phone
has been capable of dual SIM that was
actually the first phone that I ever saw
with an e SIM in addition to a SIM card
the only problem is it's only working
for project Phi and it requires certain
things for you to be able to activate it
so yeah that's something that's finally
coming officially now let's move the
spotlight over to the rumors that keep
on coming the Samsung Galaxy S 10 expect
the rumor roundup from us very soon but
what's interesting is well it seems that
we have color options there seems to be
a black or a white in them I think
that's more of a silver in the case of
the larger variance and then a turquoise
but this turquoise one has this really
interesting great gradient depending on
the variant probably the one that I like
the most is that
ie where we see a canary yellow
available I hope that's more Ferrari
yellow than anything but yeah the color
seems to be interesting I wish they came
out with a red man they already did it
with the s9 + why not just bring it here
and finally the hot news that I have to
do again with the Huawei P 30 and P 30
Pro last week on Friday we covered
certain leaked renders today we see case
leaks and once there are case leaks this
is pretty much close call and we're
talking about a lot of cameras at first
I thought they were a Photoshop job in
the case of the p30 Pro no it seems that
from the front both devices will have
the same not in the same display design
which is different from the p320 and p20
Pro then in the case of a P 30 wha we
see a different flash arrangement it
seems that this might be I don't know it
looks like a Xeon flash I could be
mistaken that would be totally awesome
but anyways in today's comment let us
know I mean what do you think you like
this design or not and how many cameras
do you need cuz uh
I don't know man I mean Huawei has
really been killing it with their
cameras I'm not gonna complain there
must be a reason for that leave us a

opinion runs again if you want to get
