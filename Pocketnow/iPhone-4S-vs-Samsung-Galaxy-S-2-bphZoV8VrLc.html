another pocket now face off this time
Samsung Galaxy S 2 versus Apple's iPhone
4s all righty let's kick off our
face-off featuring the samsung galaxy s2
an Apple iPhone 4s first up we're gonna
run through the specs on both of our
combatants then we're gonna do our
unofficial speed test take a look at
voice command on both throw a little
gaming extravaganza our browser
comparison and last but not least attach
to the back end of this video I'll have
a video sampling from each of our two
contestants today so make sure you stick
around for that
all right let's kick this off Samsung
Galaxy S 2 weighs in at 116 grams it
sports a 4.3 inch Super AMOLED plus
capacitive display with a resolution of
480 by 800 also offers Gorilla Glass
upper left-hand corner 2 megapixel
front-facing camera for video calls
below the display you've got two touch
sensitive keys main menu key back key
and one physical home key on the back is
an 8 megapixel camera with autofocus LED
flash video capture is 1080p at 30
frames per second battery underneath the
battery cover 1650 milliamp power
battery rated at 8 hours and 40 minutes
of talk time taking a look around up on
top 3nf millimeter headphone jack along
with a microphone on the right hand side
is the power button on the bottom of the
other microphone micro USB port on the
left hand side is a volume rocker in the
lower right hand corner you can see the
phone speaker alright apples i phone 4s
wasted in 140 grams so definitely
heavier the 2 offers a 3.5 inch TFT
backlit LCD display resolution is 640 by
960 display itself a scratch-resistant
upper-left center you've got a
front-facing VGA camera for video calls
and below display of one physical key
home key on the back again we have an 8
megapixel camera with autofocus LED
flash video capture again is 1080p at 30
frames per second batteries all smaller
1430 milliamp hour battery rated at 8
hours of talktime hi
a quick look around up on top is the
turn off millimeter headphone jack alone
with the power lock key on the right
hand sides that cover for the SIM card
slot on the bottom is a speaker
microphone as well as the port for
charging syncing at transferring data
and on the left hand side you've got
your two volume buttons up and down as
well as the mute switch alright let's
talk a little bit about processors on
these bad boys on the Galaxy S 2 if
you've got the 1.2 gigahertz dual core
Exynos processor from Samsung on the
iPhone 4s you've got the one gigahertz a
5 apple dual-core processor as far as
memory Galaxy s2 comes to version 16 and
32 gigabytes of internal storage total
stores can be expanded additional 32
gigabytes to the use of a micro SD card
iPhone 4s comes in three models 16 32
and 64 gigabytes of internal storage ram
galaxy s2 is 1 gigabyte of RAM iPhone 4s
512 megabytes of RAM as far as Wi-Fi a
total of an ABG and n support for DLNA
HDMI on the galaxy s2 on the iPhone 4s
802 11 B G and n as far as Bluetooth
Galaxy S 2 version 3 with support for
a2dp and high-speed data transfer iPhone
4s first smartphone out there with
Bluetooth version 4.0 with support for
a2dp
both phones have GPS support for a GPS
both phones can be used as Wi-Fi
hotspots operating system on the galaxy
s 2 Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread on the
iPhone 4s its iOS 5 and the user
interface on the galaxy s 2 is Samsung's
TouchWiz 4.0 user interface on the
iPhone 4s I'm going to say is Apple's
iOS 5 it's going to fire up our
unofficial speed test we're going to
hold down the home key here on the
galaxy s 2 and open up the task manager
well exit all tasks we're going to ram
and we'll clear all the memory and we've
got that set so now we're going to go to
push twice on the home key we'll hold
down on one of the application shortcuts
and we'll push the little red dots until
we get to the end and we're done on both
what do you say we kick this off with
calendar it look like the Galaxy S 2 to
me but it's really really hard to tell
here's what I know that
iPhone 4s awareness to contacts bow I
thought for sure the galaxy or the
iPhone 4s with wind contacts I'm
surprised let's try them apps that
definitely seem to be the galaxy as to
as well let's go to let's try the
markets on both even though they're
different
that was the galaxy s2 let's try a gmail
on both look like a dead heat to me try
messaging on both that again looked like
a dead heat and I was looking at just
them opening I know the iPhone 4s
brought up a blank text message to start
with so a little bit different let's try
the cameras on both again once the
iPhone 4s gets done with all its
animation I don't know if it's quicker
than the GS 2 not honestly alright let's
try let's go over to Netflix try
third-party again they're both rowing
out the same Wi-Fi network now it shows
that this is loaded but it really isn't
there it just finished so that was
definitely the galaxy s2 all right let's
try spooling up a couple of videos
little mi5 and if you for watch this
show I'm thoroughly addicted to it now
and it looks like the Galaxy S 2 is
first to spool it up right behind it
iPhone 4s again as you can see the Wi-Fi
connectivity for both is not very good
so I think it's well obviously it's an
even race because it running off the
books in both off the same Wi-Fi network
sorry but there's a look at our
unofficial speed testing I have to say
it seemed to me that the Galaxy S 2 is a
bit quicker than the iPhone 4s but not
by heck of a lot
next up little artificial intelligence
navigate to Starbucks
I found 14 places matching Starbucks ha
here are directions to Starbucks add
Southwest on st. Thomas caught on a
Broadway so the Galaxy S 2 gives you a
voice guy to turn-by-turn navigation
whereas the iPhone 4s gives you a route
remind me in 30 minutes to call Craig
here's your reminder shall I create it
meeting October 18th 2 p.m. you don't
have anything on your calendar for
tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.
shall I create it yes
text Craig I'll see you at the meeting
tomorrow at 4:00
here's your message to crank Gillespie
how much is 20% of four hundred and
eighty five divided by six answer your
question as you can see they both came
up with sixteen point one six listen to
Michael Jackson I couldn't find Michael
Jackson in your music
all right four I gave me today we're
gonna take a look at asphalt six
alright let's ramp up today's PocketNow
face-off between the samsung galaxy is
to an iphone for us with our browser
comparison I've got the history cleared
on both cache cleared um both both
routes the same Wi-Fi network and I've
shut down the I want to want to say a
flash on the galaxy s2 let's kick this
off we'll head over to Engadget start it
up and we're off and it looks like it's
going to be pretty close come on iPhone
for us I know you're quick here we go
iPhone 4 Galaxy S 2 is nope not quite
done nope
galaxy s2 took it because you can see
that iPhone 4s is still loading up at
the top very tricky marketing by Apple
it makes it look as if it's fully loaded
when it actually isn't you can see just
how smooth the galaxy s2 is and you can
see how smooth the iPhone 4 is both very
very smooth let's go down here we'll
double tap to zoom in on both so you can
take a look the text again you've got
the Retina display on the iPhone 4s and
Super AMOLED plus the galaxy s2
pinch-to-zoom they're both very
sensitive as you can see both to a great
job double tap to zoom all the way out
and you're rendering issues doesn't look
like it both of them did a great job
although it no you know I don't see this
ad on the galaxy s2 and it shows here on
the iPhone 4s so that is one rendering
issue on the galaxy s2 and maybe that's
why it was quicker don't know for sure
but what do you say we head over to the
mothership so we're looking for
smartphone reviews on both there we go
and we're off and again we're headed the
mobile site on both and that was the
iPhone 4s was their first let's go down
the bottom and head to the main site and
we're off I think that was pretty close
so we've got to win from each iPhone 4s
one the mobile site galaxy s2 one the
fully engaged site now we're at
pocketnow.com and we're waiting for
things to load see the iPhone 4s says
it's done but it's not obviously because
it's less unloaded this galaxy s2 is
still loading galaxy s2 is actually done
iPhone 4s again is still loading it just
finished so that's some pretty tricky
marketing you got to watch those Apple
people they know how to market better
than anybody on the face of the planet
all right let's DoubleTap zoom in any
issues everybody still seems relatively
smooth no lag from anybody looks good
alright let's take a look at this and
then we're off and again we've got our
little thank you that it's done when
it's not we'll watch this up here when
that stops spinning we know it's loaded
so it's not that it can't win or not
that it's not I guess it can't galaxy s2
is finished and very smooth again so
there we go both I got to be definitely
to the quickest browsers on smartphones
available and two of the best without a
doubt the text is a bit small on the
ios5 iPhone 4s when browsing but you've
got a three-and-a-half inch display
versus a 4.3 inch display so I guess
that's to be expected so there's a look
or a comparison between the two browsers
on our combatants Samsung Galaxy s2 and
iPhone 4s don't forget to stick around
for the video 1080p full-hd video
comparison coming up next there's Ben
Craig for Pocket now I hope it's been
helpful
take care
you
