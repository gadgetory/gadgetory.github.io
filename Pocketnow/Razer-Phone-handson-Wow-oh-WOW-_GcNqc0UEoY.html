daily about seeing a product that I
could not wait to share with everybody
well it is about that time this is the
razor phone probably one of the coolest
products I've seen this year and also
one that leaves me with the most amount
of questions um hi metal even I was
talking now and let's go hands-on at the
time of my briefing my first question
was why a gaming phone I mean I've seen
Sony try and fail with the Xperia Play
and NVIDIA is not so popular shield
approach as well though remember these
happened a few years ago Razer responded
with some key elements to ponder first
that the company only enters a market
once it's ready for serious gaming and
second that this device is made for
gamers not just for gaming as such the
razor phone looks a lot like a Razer
gaming laptop meaning that it doesn't
look like this huge dinosaur with claws
like most gaming laptops do on the
contrary the same black aluminum finish
which sharp borders is here in its full
glory this is a very commanding phone at
197 grams and unapologetically large at
158 millimeters tall 78 of width and 8
of thickness now this is one phone that
you actually want to be large as
remember it is a gaming phone made for
gamers tiny details like the fingerprint
enabled power button and the volume keys
have all been centered to avoid yanking
you out of your game by accidental key
presses there are a few significant
party tricks to boost your gaming
experience as well for starters and
borrowing from Razer laptops we have the
same XO LCD technology on this 5.7 inch
quad HD display their support for a
wider color gamut and best of all this
is the first display that I know of that
supports variable refresh rate that can
range from 20 Hertz to an insane 120
Hertz
yes I set it right a hundred and twenty
meaning it can remain basic with
applications like Twitter or it can get
crazy fast and fluid with graphics
intensive games even cooler the refresh
rate is frame for frame determined by
the game and razor is already working
with gaming developers to unlock their
full potential second and disclaimer be
sure to lower the volume of your device
right now ready okay the speakers on
this device are jaw-dropping
each speaker has its own amplifier with
a porch size increase when compared to
the next bit Robin and tuned by both
Dolby and Atmos and no there's no
headphone jack to complement this audio
but the USBC dongle does support a
24-bit DAC third are the internals we
have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 a
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigs of expandable
storage and the whopping 4 thousand
milliamp hour battery that can charge
from 0 to 50 in 35 minutes with a
bundled 24 watt charger that's now
powered by the new Qualcomm quick charge
4.0 plus technology this 4.0 plus
technology is all about increasing
battery longevity by not exposing it to
heat and speaking of heat on the phone
razor has supported the same thermal
dissipation technology of its blade
laptop to avoid the need to throttle the
processor when gaming gets intense
fourth is the software you won't need to
install Nova Launcher on this phone it
already comes with a built in copy of
Nova prime meaning all the flexibility
of near stock Android is here with a few
accents to remind you that you're
carrying a product made by Razer I can
tell you from a few hours of using this
prototype that the phone is blazing fast
you'll get Android 7.1.1 out of the box
and the Oreo update will arrive on q1
2018 fifth and yes there are actually
more party tricks Razer will be the
launch partner of a couple of console
quality games one of the partnerships us
with Square Enix to bring the chapter 1
of Final Fantasy 15 and yes I mean the
console version the other is with $0.10
to bring its honor of kings from China
to the United States with the added kick
that you can choose DC comic characters
for the game bear in mind this is pretty
much the biggest game right now in China
six and most important believe it or not
the price tag you can get all this phone
for $6.99 unlocked and if you're asking
yourself why you get so much on such an
aggressive price tag well this phone is
not exactly perfect we already covered
the lack of a headphone jack which makes
charging this phone while playing a game
impossible the second is that this
device is not water resistant which is
already a common trait for phones price
of that tear and last but not least I'm
a little concerned about the cameras
given razors use of a samsung ISO cell
sensor but we hear that it's the same
sensor that Samsung provided with the
galaxy s7 variants so that should be a
good thing this is a combo of a 12
megapixel primary sensor at F 1.7
aperture and the second is a 12
megapixel telephoto at F 2.6 razor
claims that it's not doing any of that
half-baked portrait mode but instead
providing a fluid experience with
zooming in and out the selfie cameras of
8 megapixels at f/2 so yes this is the
razor phone pre-orders begin today and I
don't think I've been so excited about a
gaming device as I have today at least
on paper and from my experience today
this is definitely a lot of smart phone
but our final verdicts on its ability to
deliver will be determined in our full
review coming very soon while that
happens folks don't forget to follow us
