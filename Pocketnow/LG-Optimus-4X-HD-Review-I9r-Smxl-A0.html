Galaxy s3 and HTC's One X LG is fighting
an uphill battle in fact they all but
snuck into the high-end smartphone
market with the lg optimus 4x HD its
specs are quite impressive but how does
it stack up in real world tests can this
quad core HD smartphone give Samsung and
HTC a run for their money let's find out
the LG 4x is a powerhouse by every
definition of the term in case it wasn't
clear enough the 4x means it's got a
quad-core cpu in it the HD means it's
got an HD display and as well as an HD
camera the CPU is an NVIDIA Tegra 3
cortex a9 clocked at 1.5 gigahertz with
ulp geforce video powering a 4.7 inch
type true HD IPS LCD capacitive
touchscreen with 16 million colors it's
720 x 1280 pixels which gives it a pixel
density of about 312 PPI and all of that
is tucked neatly behind a flat sheet of
super strong corning gorilla glass
unlike Samsung that puts the antenna for
their NFC chip in the battery LG put
their antenna in the back cover and they
threw in a couple NFC tags for you to
get started playing around with some of
the cool things that you can do with NFC
the battery is lithium ion with 2150
milliamp hours of power which in our
test was plenty enough to get you
through an entire day with normal use if
you want to use this phone in the USA
AT&amp;amp;T is your provider of choice it'll
work on tmobile but until they roll out
more coverage you'll be stuck with edge
speeds voice however works equally great
on either provider so aspects are great
but how does all that hardware stack up
on the front of the screen you've got
what you'd expect your sensors your
speaker
front-facing camera very very modest
branding and a plentiful screen down at
the bottom you have capacitive buttons
this is one thing we don't particularly
like but you can go in and tweak how
long the backlighting stays behind the
buttons at the top of the phone you have
your noise-cancelling microphone your
3.5 millimeter headset and headphone
jack and in HTC style your power button
over on the right you have absolutely
nothing on the bottom you've got your
MHL and microUSB port all nice and tuck
together as well as your main microphone
on the left you have a very basic up and
down button very smoothly integrated
together flipping the phone over on the
back you've got your 8 megapixel camera
with LED flash again some subtle
branding and then your main speaker as
well the back is also very well textured
so it feels really good in hand
something to look at while we're here is
this double chrome ridge that wraps the
entire phone doing this kind of gives
the impression that you have a slide out
keyboard you don't but why would they
include it it actually helps
significantly when you're holding on to
the phone which is something that you
need because the phone is so lightweight
so how does the software in the user
interface stack up although the 4x HD
comes with Android Ice Cream Sandwich
four point zero point three the user
interface is LG's own Optimus UI version
3.0 which looks very similar to
Samsung's TouchWiz UI and is much more
colorful than stock Ice Cream Sandwich
the Optimus UI three point 0 comes with
some of the stock widgets that you've
seen in previous versions of the UI the
Yahoo weather widget is the same boxy
one without many refinements although it
is animated and it is somewhat pretty
looking it is resizable as with most of
the other widgets that come with it as
well the launcher itself is quite nice
coming preloaded with a lot of the apps
and widgets that you're likely going to
use already in place where you're going
to use them and make the
best use of them launching the app
drawer is relatively quick and has a
universal rap so no matter which way you
scroll you're going to always be able to
scroll and scroll and scroll you'll
notice one thing that's missing you
don't have a shortcut to the Play Store
right up here in the top like you do
with the stock Ice Cream Sandwich
launcher you do however have this
interesting little sprocket icon which
essentially lets you go in and remove
elements out of your app drawer
essentially just so you can organize hit
the check mark when you're done to
accept it one thing that the LG has that
most other phones don't is a voice
recorder why phones don't include this
is just beyond me it's very simple it's
very basic it does what you needed to do
it's right there and it's elegant I mean
just look at this video playback is
where the HD in the optimus 4x HD comes
from without of the Box support for divx
and xvid and MKV video files with
resolutions up to 1080p the results are
nothing short of astounding as long as
your video source supports the higher
resolutions you're golden video playback
is what the optimus 4x HD was designed
for and it does it very very well so
with four cores and an HD screen can you
possibly have good battery life in this
phone 2150 milliamp hours isn't a huge
battery but it's better than many we
might even go as far to say better than
most the battery is big enough to get
you through your day without worries I
was able to get almost to light use days
out of one charge which really surprised
me it's worth noting that LG is using a
new SI o + battery technology rather
than the standard lithium-ion technology
that we've seen in most other phones now
it's still a lithium-ion technology but
the SI l + tech allows for more lithium
ions to be crammed into a smaller space
resulting in a smaller battery or longer
battery life however you want to look at
it how about the camera how does that
stack up the rear facing camera is an 8
a pixel shooter with autofocus and LED
flash still shots were fair the little
bit saturated and with a bit more lens
flare than we've come to accept in most
phones the video recording capability of
the Optimus comes set at 720p though
it's capable of 1080p we ran it through
our regular test in the front yard
paying attention to close-ups detail and
color contrast what we saw wasn't great
the auto focus on the camera is
hyperactive causing blurring every few
seconds as the camera tries to refocus
over and over comments on the YouTube
video were brutal with many thinking
this was caused by a dirty lens rest
assured we clean the lens very well
before shooting let's go through the
pros and cons pros the phones got an
above-average battery life especially
considering that they didn't add any
extra bulk it's got a removable battery
something that we're seeing a lot of
phones especially the high-end phones
not have it's very slim very lightweight
maybe too lightweight it's got bluetooth
for that's different than a lot of other
devices it already comes with Android
4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich so there's no
waiting for someone like Samsung or a
carrier to build and approve android 4.0
you get it right out of the box you can
expand your storage with microSD all the
way up to an additional 32 gig how about
some cons auto focus on the video camera
is out of control this might be a
deal-breaker for a lot of you the phone
is almost too lightweight everybody that
I gave it to thought that it was cheaper
or not quite as high end as it really is
and of course if you're in the US and
you've got t-mobile you've got to live
with slower edge speeds so overall what
did we think of the lg optimus 4x HD as
far as hardware goes it gets a nine it's
hard to get a 9 in my book user
experience suffered a little bit we
rated it a seven a lot of that was
because of well honestly the camera as
far as software goes we
a solid eight the Optimus UI version
three isn't quite as clean as stock
Android but it's probably the closest
thing we've ever seen adding all those
together we give the optimus 4x HD a
solid eight well done LG
