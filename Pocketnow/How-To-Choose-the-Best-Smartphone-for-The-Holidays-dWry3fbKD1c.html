the biggest questions we get on Twitter
is which smartphone should we pick or
which is better this one or this one
that's actually kind of complicated this
year because companies have actually
done a good job they've invested hard
and good camera quality great design and
it's really hard to pick a phone this
year so we're gonna try to help you out
as best as we can with this video I am
finally that I'm this is PocketNow
and here's a quick how to choose your
next smartphone for the holiday season
now the best way to start has to do with
the platform and the case of smartphones
this is mainly a war of ecosystems these
companies want you invested in their
platforms if you already invested in iOS
your applications are not gonna work on
Android so it's gonna be really hard for
you to move to Android for example let's
just say you chose an iPhone which is
what a lot of people are doing lately
yes Apple did a really good job with the
iPhone 6 and the iPhone success is
picking that up but this is a very
interesting year for Apple as really the
iPhone 6s is not necessarily so much
better than the iPhone 6 and given the
fact that Apple is not really famous and
bringing deals for Black Friday or Cyber
Monday if you're on a budget for an
iPhone
I think the iPhone 6 is good enough now
bear with me if you want 7000 series
aluminum which is the strongest aluminum
out there which is good for Falls and
bends and stuff like that and hey if you
want the new force of such technology
then you're better off with the iPhone
success also a better camera but then
again the iPhone 6 even though without
the 7000 series aluminum even though
without the better cameras still has a
very good camera is still durable enough
and hey first such technology is not
going to pick up until next year
a lot of developers and applications
haven't really picked up on it and the
only phone we wouldn't recommend you get
is the iPhone 5s though even though a
good phone is probably up for a
replacement or a change early next year
according to rumors another thing to
consider with iPhones which is the most
important thing is do not please do not
buy the 16 kilobyte
phone it is not enough storage the
amount of storage that you get left is
very small and then again you have the
biggest problem which is the fact that
the applications are rather large for
the iPhone music is rather large for the
iPhone so yeah don't waste your time on
any 16 gig iPhone instead of buying a 16
gig iPhone 6's go for the 64 gig iPhone
6 that's a much better option now in the
case of Windows 10 mobile that actually
is easier because there's only one phone
to choose from right now which is the
Lumia 950 you're gonna have to wait for
the lumia 950xl and surely you have a
ton of Lumias out there to choose from
that will get Windows 10 mobile the
problem is they won't get it yet and
they won't get all the features that the
Lumia 950 has now even though there's
only one smartphone right now available
that's not necessarily a bad thing as
Microsoft and Nokia have been famous for
a ton of things build quality for
example snappy performance but even more
is the best cameras in the industry you
really cannot argue against Lumias for
their camera quality and another
particular feature that's coming
necessarily to Lumias but to Windows 10
mobile our newer phones which is
Microsoft continuum we actually have a
full video for Michael Fisher showing
you how to turn your smartphone into a
full-fledged computer with a few
accessories obviously but it's really a
cool thing if you want to give your son
a phone for example and you don't want
to buy him a tablet and a computer and
the phone this is probably a good way to
start for a lot of people in emerging
countries this is another good way to
have a full-fledged computer from your
smart phone again Windows 10 mobile
surely isn't its infancy but there are a
lot of great things coming here we have
a lot of great expectations and again
the Lumia 950 is gorgeous on its own now
the larger the platform the more
difficult choosing is going to be and
this is the case for Android and Android
is particularly difficult because more
doesn't necessarily mean better more
cores or more benchmarks or more
megapixels in the camera or more display
resolution don't really amount to great
user experience so I'm going to try to
narrow this down to a few categories
starting with those of you that are
interested at great camera quality don't
focus on the megapixels you hear from
other cameras that's not going to be the
case if you want great photos you need
it's great sensors and great
post-processing and the companies that
get this right are LG with the LG g4 v10
our Samsung with any of the top-tier
galaxies like the galaxy note5 galaxy s6
edge+ and the galaxy s6 or galaxy s6
edge we're talking about Sony experience
whichever z5 z5 premium or z5 compact
you're getting or in the case of the new
Nexus 6p this is another great
smartphone with great camera quality now
let's just say that you want really good
performance but you don't want all those
camera features and you still want a
really great smartphone this is a great
year for that because we've got a lot of
phones that are priced like mid ranges
but really aren't like in the case of
the oneplus 2 or in the case of the new
Moto X which are gorgeous phones that
are extremely powerful and just don't
have the best cameras in the world but
then they've got a ton of other great
things going for them at the price tag
and if you want to go lower than that
then there's also the premium mid-range
which are really great looking phones
that well don't bring the cameras or
bring a Snapdragon 615 processor but are
great designs and very power efficient
we've got the samsung galaxy ace series
oboes are aligned up we've got the
oneplus X which is probably one of our
favorites it's a really great looking
phone that brings a lot of great things
to it and just doesn't bring the
specifications but who cares if it
performs really well and again it's got
the gorgeous design there is a ton of
products that you can choose from and
we've got a full smartphone buyer's
guide to actually help you out with that
if you want to go any lower than that in
the price tag you can but you're going
into disappointment territory the lowest
we would recommend you go is the Moto G
2015 which is a phone that's got a lot
of things going for it but the problem
is number one the Snapdragon 400 or 410
processors are not great the other is
because anything lower than two gigs of
ram is looking into bogging down a phone
particularly if it runs lollipop and if
you get anything less than 16 gigs of
storage and Android you're looking into
a major disappointment because Android
is notorious for running out of space
even if you have expandable storage the
promise you can't really load your
applications on that expandable storage
and it just continues getting more
complicated bottom line 2016 is a great
year
we are very excited for all the
smartphone offerings out there but again
even though you'll find some great deals
not all of these will be good values so
make sure you follow the links in the
description and keep it locked to pocket
now as we will have a ton of articles
helping you not only find the better
deals out there but again also the
better value for your pocket and the
best durable options for you to be able
to use for the next few years but
anyways that's it for this video we've
also got another one coming up for
tablets and even wearable so make sure
you follow us on social media and
subscribe to our youtube channel as well
you follow me on Twitter find underscore
a better on Instagram and I know the
data please give this video thumbs up if
you like what you saw I am kinda better

see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
