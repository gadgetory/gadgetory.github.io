continue as we get more cases being
reported analysts claim that face ID has
entered OEM scrambling to ditch current
plans and we get more leaks on what to
expect from the BlackBerry motion I'm
Jaime Rivera and should I be upset
because everybody in my country took the
whole week off last week and I didn't
hey this is Parnell Daly the official
news today begin with a giveaway I know
that's not common on the pocket out
daily but LG is nice enough to give us
two tickets to the New York Film
Festival because it's the launch week of
the LGB 30 those of you that want to
participate and I do recommend that you
live in New York because it's not going
to include the trip it's just including
the tickets you can follow a link in the
description for all the rules of
everything you have to do we will be
announcing the winners on Thursday and
fun fact I am going to be there so you
guys want to join and talk you can learn
more about everything on a link in the
description now let's talk about
blackberry the company spent the weekend
teasing its new motion smartphone and
I'm still a little skeptical over the
design but renders never do phones just
as I always prefer to hold them most
interesting specification snapdragon 6 2
5 4 gigs of ram a huge 4000 milliamp
hour battery and blackberries are
legendary for the battery life that's
going to be very interesting you can see
the photos and more information in the
description as well now not everything
that happened over the weekend was
positive Joe Belfiore
pretty much the mastermind behind
Windows 10 mobile has just confirmed
that the operating system is pretty much
dead according to his tweets the install
base for Windows 10 mobile is so
insignificant right now that it's just
pointless to continue supporting it so
you will be getting software updates but
don't expect more Windows 10 mobile
smartphones don't expect any more
evolution on the platform and definitely
you can expect your applications to
start dying out very soon so sad day
that wasn't the only piece of negative
news over the weekend as we've got up to
seven cases of separation gate meaning
iPhone eights that have been separating
and we're assuming that it has
everything to do with the battery Apple
claims that it's going to look into
these specific issues obviously millions
of phones have been sold in only seven
cases which is
far different than the galaxy note seven
and still for companies that would
making fun of Samsung over what happened
last year
karma let's see how that goes over time
and finally the very hot news today have
to do with KGI and its predictions over
the future of how you're gonna unlock
your smartphone according to analyst
number one iPads are bringing face ID
next year it's just going to happen even
if Apple is struggling to make them for
the iPhone 10 but the second thing is
that even though these same analysts
claimed that Android OEMs are at least
two and a half years away from being
able to replicate this technology
according to analysts Android OEMs are
already scrambling to completely ditch
the whole idea of the fingerprint
scanner on the display given how
terrible the yield rates were with that
and apparently they are wanting to join
the face ID crowd this is interesting it
leads me to the question today would you
prefer Android to ditch the fingerprint
scanner and go face ID or would you
prefer to have a choice in my case I
don't want the fingerprint scanner to go
anywhere I don't trust face ID so far
it's hasn't even been proven yet at a
mass scale leave us a comment down below
