well maybe you're in the minority the
stiff competition of the multi-purpose
tablet space is giving the category a
tough enough time that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is
in the midst of spinning off its
unprofitable Nook division to help
arrest the losses the bookseller has
partnered with Samsung to produce a
hybrid tablet and the e-reader with a
mouthful of a name join us for a quick
hands-on look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab
4 look the first thing to understand
about the new Nook is that it's a not
quite so new Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 that makes
it pretty unremarkable as a tablet but
as an e-reader it's more capable than
most devices in its class going with
this over say Amazon's Kindle you get
the full version of Android backed by
the whole power of the Google Play Store
with Samsung's multi window multitasking
on top Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is also keen to
point out the dual cameras and stylish
design and whether you agree with the
stylish bit will be up to you but it
does feel nice and trim in the hand with
some comfy faux leather on the back
panel
sadly Samsung has made no special
changes to the device's screen so you're
still left with a typical LCD that won't
do as well in daylight as a dedicated
e-reader what's really supposed to set
this off is this special Nook software
we've got a home screen widget that's
meant to welcome you into your own
personal media library multi user
support for family use and our favorite
feature a persistent book button in the
lower left that always returns you to
whatever you were reading last which is
pretty handy still it's hard to avoid
being underwhelmed by the software as a
whole if you've seen a Samsung tablet
you've seen the new Nook Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
is offering some nice perks
this device is 179 after a $20 instant
rebate and it comes with more than $200
of free media including free magazine
subscriptions that include a year of
back issues for die-hard readers that's
a compelling value add as is the promise
of in-store in-person technical support
and tutorials from Barnes &amp;amp; Nobles
across trained staff
if you've been holding up for an
e-reader specifically and you want
something on the higher end the new Nook
might be a good choice based mainly on
the added value of the Android ecosystem
and those barnes &amp;amp; noble freebies but if
you're taking the whole of the tablet
space into consideration as you should
this is nothing really new and it's hard
to see how this predictable tablet
masquerading as an e-reader will excite
enough people to reverse the Nook
family's fortunes the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook
is available now at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble for
more smartphone tablet and wearable
