now we're at the HTC booth with hammer
behind the camera and the HTC Desire 816
we're going to compare in size it up
against the entire HTC one family the
one mini the one and the one max so
let's check it out so from left to right
we have the HTC One this is also the
order of announcement HTC One HTC one
mini HTC One max and the brand new HTC
Desire 816 as you can see they are all
following the same design guidelines and
principles with the boomsound speakers
on top with different drilled holes on
the desire age 16 but the same boomsound
speakers for front firing sound now we
cannot turn the device on the desire 816
because it comes with a pre-production
software it will launch with final
software with a probably future sense
but we decided to keep all of these off
so that you can see exactly how they
stack up and probably too much comparing
against the one so the desire 816 I
already managed to smudge up my screen
here is this much taller than the one
which has a 4.7 inch screen we're
talking 5.5 inch screens here full HD on
the one and 720p on the desire 816 we
won't go into too many details here's
the one max which is not too much but
still taller than the brand new desire
and of course the HTC One mini which is
the smallest among them but still a very
large phone phone for a mini moniker
flipping them to the back you'll see the
same design principles on the one family
and for the desire 816 HTC decided to go
with a brush plastic a shiny one which
in this white version is doing a good
job at not showing the fingerprints we
have 4 megapixel ultrapixel camera
stabilized on the one non stabilized on
the
many non stabilized on the one max and
the desire 816 has a 13-megapixel
standard camera on the back but the
front is where the differences are with
a 5 megapixel wide leg wide angle lens
and the rest of the one family just
sports a 2.1 megapixel camera on this
front this has been a quick look and
size up at the brand new HTC Desire 816
this is how it compares to the lineup we
will have more videos once we get this
in our labs hide behind a camera thank
you very much for that and we thank HTC
for the opportunity this has been Anton
stay tuned to clock it down for more
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
