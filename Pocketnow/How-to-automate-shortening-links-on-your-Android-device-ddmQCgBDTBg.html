to create and share short links from
your phone I'm Taylor Martin this is
pocket now and this is how you automate
short links on Android smartphones have
become powerful social tools we tend to
use them not only for consumption but
also for sharing personally I share a
lot of photos some videos and a ton of
links almost every single day
unfortunately sharing links isn't always
straight forward on a mobile platform
when sharing from my computer I tend to
use a bit ly extension not only because
it's convenient but because it helps me
track the number of clicks my personal
links get as well as various
demographics about those who click the
links using the bitly extension in
chrome is simple instead of clicking in
the address bar and manually copying the
link I simply click the pufferfish icon
click save link and I have it set to
automatically copy the short link is
then ready for pasting the problem with
sharing links while mobile is that there
are very few quick and simple ways to
shorten links why shorten why not simply
share a long link for starters it looks
neater and obviously saves characters
sharing a long link via SMS may break
the link up between two text messages
and if like me you like to track the
analytics of your shared links you can
use a shortening service when sharing
with Google+ Twitter or Facebook to keep
tabs on the performance of your personal
links the fact of the matter is
shortening links for mobile is terribly
over complicated however there is an
application on Android when set up
correctly make shortening links even
with your preferred shortening service
much easier the application is called
URL why I've been using it for years and
it's always among one of the first
applications I install when setting up a
new device unfortunately the UI is
hideous and antiquated and the
application hasn't been updated in over
a year but it works flawlessly and best
of all it's entirely free initially it
works just as any link shortener app
works open the browser tap in the
address bar long press select all copy
openurl why paste and shorten that's no
less than seven steps every time you
want to share a shortened link after two
or three times a process like that
forces you to not want to share shorten
links and you'll likely end up going
back to sharing long nasty looking links
and only returned to URL why when you
absolutely need a shortened link you can
also choose to share to you are ly and
it will auto shortened links using a
default service and from there you can
choose to share the short link but you r
ly offers settings toggles that make it
even easier to share short links open
the application and press the wrench
icon at the bottom of the display open
the short URL sub menu choose manage
services then select services I
personally use bit ly but if you have a
short number of choice it's best to
select just one under the user
credentials menu you can also log into
your service which will help with
tracking later back out to the short URL
submenu once again and select options in
the page titles menu uncheck fetch page
title next make sure complete long URL
is checked and if you prefer the prefix
HTTP colon forward slash forward slash
to be removed from your short URL check
crop short URL then check paste from
clipboard auto shorten and prompt for
custom URL should already be checked
uncheck prompt for custom URL if you
plan on pasting links often you can
leave copy to clipboard checked.check
autoshare and the last two options are
completely based upon preference to
share a shortened link now open a page
in your browser and share the page
select URL why the link is automatically
shortened with your service of choice
and automatically shared again simply
choose the application you want to share
to from there after this is set up it
adds only one step to the original share
process choosing URL why before choosing
the shortened links final destination
