up your mind to buy as many would say
the new galaxy you're probably asking
yourself which variant is best i'm hi
I'm Eddie Vetter with pocket now join us
for Samsung Galaxy s7 vs. galaxy s7 edge
brought to you by D brand in the quest
for regaining the popularity that it
once had Samsung has spent the last two
years trying to reinvent itself 2015's
galaxy s6 lineup may deciding over them
a question of price and looks and not
necessarily a question of improvements
the challenge is far more complicated
today with both galaxy s7 s as these
phones are just as similar as they are
different in the similarities Department
both phones can be described as gorgeous
glass on glass match with 7000 series
aluminium comes standard and this time
both have curves of their own no matter
which one you hold you'll have a hard
time wanting to put it down and you'll
have a hard time not wanting to clean it
up after that because of the
fingerprints both of these units run on
the same snapdragon 820 processor and 4
gigs of ram both start at 32 gigs of
expandable storage via microSD both
support the same camera combo of 12 and
5 megapixels and both include the same
extras like fast and wireless charging
even ip68 water resistance up to 30
minutes in 1 meter of water comes
standard in either of these what's
really going to cook your
decision-making is what makes these
devices different those extra hundred
dollars for the galaxy s7 edge are now
for more than just the right of passage
the edge is around 5% taller and wider
than the s7 even though the latter is a
hair thicker that extra room helps the
edge sport a larger 5.5 inch quad HD
AMOLED display that's just this gorgeous
is on the s7 but with the added curve
that creates the surreal bezel-less
effect that catches your eye about the
only point in favor of the s7 here is
pixel density since 5.1 inches will give
you 577
per inch compared to 534 that extra room
even helps the edge house a larger 3,600
milliamp hour battery compared to 3000
something that we'll discuss in detail
over our full review if it really came
down to hardware to help you decide it's
clear that one has the edge over the
other but that edge is not necessarily
that large in the software Department
both devices run on the same version of
TouchWiz powered by Android 601
marshmallow telling one apart from the
other when gliding through menus is
nearly impossible as both devices run
their respective versions of Android
like the flagships that they are both
include the same game launcher features
both allow the same theming
customization both offer the same
always-on mode it's not until you notice
the subtle tab on the right side of the
edge that you notice more value for
those $100 sliding on it reveals the
edge menus that are now more mature than
what we've seen in previous generations
you can always switch these off but I
found myself drifting to these ever so
often as the Edit launcher that Samsung
always intended it to be that can really
become useful when you quickly want to
launch an application take a selfie or
use the optional tools within the edges
also open to third-party developers even
though historically then hasn't really
amounted to much features are gimmicks
aside daily use is really where you
questions spending extra money for the
edge holding it is what I'd like to call
an acquired taste as it takes a while
for you to learn not to touch the
display while you're doing so the rest
of the experience and things like
gameplay phone calls and data Suites are
really the same and that's a great thing
since this extends to the camera Samsung
has endowed both devices with the same
12 and 5 megapixel camera combo and the
results are just delicious
both devices shine in the dual pixel
focusing and photos on both ends just
seem as colourful and saturated though
I'll let the cameras do the talking
even when recording video you'll notice
great results in stabilization while
walking with both devices at the same
time as opposed to the Apple way of
doing things where the phablet includes
more features samsung has given both new
Galaxy flagships the same amount of
power really the only place where I've
noticed the difference over the last few
days is testing battery life the edge is
obviously shining with its larger
battery pack but the s7 has also managed
to get through the day just as fine
again these are features that we will be
able to report on more when our full
review comes in very soon and overall
the Samsung way of doing things is what
makes this comparison really complicated
both devices are just as powerful just
as beautiful and just this feature
packed everything is really narrowed
down to a meager difference in size the
extra edge features that are nice to
have but you don't really need and the
added battery life that you know you do
I tell you what if it were my hundred
dollars I'd incline in spending the
extra money just for the battery
performance but regardless of which
galaxy s7 variant you choose I'm sure
you just will not be disappointed
