experimenting with the galaxy s6 design
we get more credible claims on the Apple
standalone stylus and could it be that
Sam single finally get a SmartWatch
right I'm hi Mary vetta and I guess the
CES plague just hit me I apologize for
the monster cold that I have right now
this is parking a daily let's begin
today with what's official how many of
you wanted Samson to acquire blackberry
I know many of us didn't and others
didn't really care but as it turns out
Samsung's JK Shin just came on record to
state that both companies will extend
their partnerships they will focus on
building better security features for
Knox but Samsung has no intentions of
purchasing requiring blackberry
interesting news hopefully that does
mean that marks will help us a route our
Samsung phones a lot easier at some
point now we have more rumors regarding
Samsung's Galaxy s6 particularly in the
design this time we hear that the
company is experimenting with double
edge designs we've heard that before but
we get more details from other sources
but even more interesting we've heard
that the company is not really
experimenting with metal anymore
apparently the company wants to give us
a glass on glass design and the reason
why that makes sense has to do mainly
with Sony's Xperia lineup they've been
able to pull off a waterproof phone with
glass on glass and probably that's what
Samsung is pointing for with the galaxy
s6 let's see what we get at mwc yes I
know almost everything today has to do
about Samson but these are actually
interesting news particularly with the
recent rumors of the Samsung Orbis which
is the code name for the round
SmartWatch the company is working on
apparently running Tizen makes the
SmartWatch cool is that apparently the
company is going to fix the whole works
we had with the gear live with the way
to charge the SmartWatch apparently
Samsung is going to bring us wireless
charging we're not sure if that's going
to be she where I was charging we assume
it will and if so we probably could see
a much better samsung Smart Watch this
time particularly in design and I mean
every single type of design including
the charger now let's talk about HTC
we've heard the company
is working on its HTC hema which would
probably be the HTC One m9 and we hear
more rumors on the specification from a
very credible source we kept hearing
snapdragon 810 processor we keep hearing
the 20 megapixel camera at the back we
don't know if that's going to be dual
lenses we also hear that an ultrapixel
camera will come to the front which is
great we saw that in the desire right
now at CES and that was amazing but even
more interesting we don't hear any more
details on the display hopefully we are
getting a two gay display even though I
know many of us including myself don't
really care about that as 1080p was
already providing enough pixels per inch
we will know more on march first and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day let's talk about the Apple I pen
or the apple stylist we don't know
exactly how Apple is going to name this
product that but KGI securities is
famous for all the iphone 6 leaks and
rumors and they got a lot of those right
this time they're talking about the
apple stylist apparently it will be a
standalone product they will even
charged with the Lightning port and
we've heard previous patents that this
product will work on whiteboards paper
and just about everything including your
iOS products but it seems that apple
will not build this into the ipad pro as
we are hearing more rumors of the ipad
pro apparently and they will both launch
at the same time but Apple will not
bundle it with the ipad pro to keep the
price down because apparently as with
everything Apple this will not be
cheaper affordable and it really leads
me to the question of the day what does
a stylus need to do for you to want a
product with a stylus because in my case
yes added functionality is great but for
me it's really the fact that things have
to be seamless I have to be able to
actually use a tablet as a piece of
paper and a lot of things go into play
there not every company has worked with
matt displays for example and i want to
feel some sort of friction when i write
samsung did a good job at the galaxy
note 3 and the rubber tips probably
Apple would do the same we don't know
exactly what the company plans but Lee
