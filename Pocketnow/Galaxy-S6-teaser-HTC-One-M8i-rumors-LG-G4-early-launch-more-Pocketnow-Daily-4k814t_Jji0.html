performance and productivity the LG g4
now so it might be closer than you think
and make way for the HTC One m8 I and
that I is literally not an eyeball I'm
high I'm gonna be better
literally enjoying Tuesday's ever since
I can remember this is parking out daily
brought to you by Squarespace today is a
day full of rumors and reports starting
with the Snapdragon 810 processor yes
the LG G flex 2 is already in the pocket
now labs and we have yet to test how
that Snapdragon 810 performs when it
comes to heating but we've got some very
interesting comparisons showing the
Snapdragon 810 compared to the
Snapdragon 801 and tests like playing
asphalt in addition to recording a video
for 30 minutes etc etc and so far it
seems that the Snapdragon 810 actually
heats up less than the Snapdragon 801 we
will confirm in our review and speaking
of LG and Snapdragon devices we've got
some very credible sources claiming that
we won't have to wait till the summer
for the LG g4 it seems that the company
is ramping up everything for us to see
an announcement in April and hopefully
get the phone soon after which was
usually the timetable for the Galaxy S
smartphones in the past and it seems
that this is what LG is doing just
rather interesting zazz the LG G flex 2
barely reached the market or will reach
the market in some places that we will
keep you posted and see what happened
other rumors talk about HTC it seems
that the company is planning to keep the
design of the HTC One m8 for another
year they're gonna dub it the HTC One m8
I and that's a letter I after the m8 and
as it turns out there is really no I as
an improvement here as actually what
we're getting is a Snapdragon 615
octa-core chip which we've already
tested on the Oppo r5 and it's not the
best processor in the world in addition
to probable good changes like for
example the 13 megapixel camera at the
back with the dual lens apparently there
will be some improvements there but
we're not sure of this phone will be
picked for specific markets and not
necessarily everywhere because it will
compete with the one m9 we'll keep you
posted on that one as well now the
company that's been reluctant to include
wireless charging in its flagship phones
of
Elly is considering it now or talking
about Samsung the company has just
posted this extensive memo talking about
how 2015 is going to be the year for
wireless charging we've been waiting for
that for the last couple of years
especially from Samsung but as it turns
out the reason why is because apparently
the company is working on bringing us
some new technology where we won't have
to worry about the wireless charging
standard anymore and that is really cool
because that's the really big term with
wireless charging right now let's see
what the company breaks on the table
hopefully at MWC and finally for the
very interesting news of the day Samsung
has decided to begin teasing it's galaxy
s6 and there are a couple of interesting
parts of this Twitter video that the
company published first of all the
company is talking a lot about how fast
this phone will be and how this speed
will allow users to be more productive
which is great even more interesting is
the fact that there is this new galaxy
logo being shown here at the end of
video and sadly I'm not sure if I'm
gonna be able to show you the video by
the time I edit this one but hopefully I
will and if not all the link to the
description for full details are what
you're getting here but it leads me to
the question of the day obviously speed
is something important for everyone but
will that make you buy a galaxy s6 at a
time when the Snapdragon 810 processor
makes almost everything that it runs
great or whatever or Snapdragon 801 or
805 we've got a lot of speed right now
in the market so is this really a
differentiating factor for you obviously
for us it is when it comes to games and
stuff but leave us a comment down below
