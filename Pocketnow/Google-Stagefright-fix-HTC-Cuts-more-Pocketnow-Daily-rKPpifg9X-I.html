for android flagship devices very soon
Apple releases new betas for iOS 9 watch
os/2 and even the public betas and it
seems that the LG Nexus that's rumored
is actually a crucial device I'm hi mera
neta and I'm enjoying the benefits of
100 degree weather if you can say it
that way this is parking out daily
official news today start with Google as
well stage fright for Android has a
brought a lot of stage fright to a lot
of people obviously somebody can take
control of your device through an mms
and it's really hard for you to find out
if you really got it or not it is
extremely powerful extremely dangerous
and google has just committed to fixing
this in this month of august for
flagship devices and we should expect
hundreds of other devices to be included
on the list soon buyers beware other
official news from app will have a
company launching the fifth beta for
watch os/2 and for iOS 9 and the third
public beta for iOS 9 the changes are
kind of major particularly in iOS 9
we've got a bevy of new wallpapers in
addition to other fixes in controls and
additions and in the case of watch a
wish to we finally get some updates
because in the past the you know betas
were just for bug fixes links in
description for the full list of
everything that you're getting and yeah
I would highly recommend you test the
public beta now XP of wearables pebble
has just confirmed that you can now go
pre-order your pebble time steel reserve
it and the sad news is that even though
you'll do this now it'll take six to
eight weeks for you to get your product
eight weeks yes two months that is
exactly how much you're going to be
waiting for this watch at a time when
you know the future Apple watch is
coming the current Apple watch is
selling and new wearables are slated for
Aoife let's see if that works out for
them moving the spot like that to Google
we've got some trusted sources claiming
that the future LG Nexus is crucial to
the company not necessarily because it's
a new Nexus and Google doesn't seem to
care much about that but because
apparently Android pay is going to be
launching on this new LG Nexus in
particular we don't understand exactly
why or how Google plans to make Android
a thing at a time when it's only going
to be on one device that'll barely sell
because that's the story with Nexus
devices will keep you posted as we learn
more and finally for the very sad news
of the day HTC CFO just came on record
to state that the company will be making
some cuts in order to look for
profitability it seems that obviously
the one I was not able to sell much and
so the company needs to figure out a way
to stay afloat very sad news the company
has not stated what departments are
going to be affected or how this is
going to hurt HTC in the future with its
products does lead me to the question of
the day though what do you think HTC
should do in order to regain its
limelight what would you recommend to
the company in order to you know wake up
again in my case I miss the old HTC
glory days of the touch diamond and
stuff like that that HTC brought very
substantial innovation but the company
wasn't really worried about its bottom
line as much as its innovation product
and obviously things have to go related
but leave us a comment down below what
would you recommend HTC to bring back or
to do runs you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video was filmed the shoe follow us on
 out comment subscribe to youtube
channel as well you follow me on twitter
