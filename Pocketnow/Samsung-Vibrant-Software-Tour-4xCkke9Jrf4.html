calm i'm here with the t-mobile samsung
vibrant galaxy s3 smartphone you've
probably already seen a lot of coverage
on the Galaxy S series and the ATT
version called the captivate so you
probably have a pretty good idea of what
kind of software errors in here but the
t-mobile version comes with a number of
really nice bundled applications so
we're going to take a look at those
let's check out so here's the default
home screen this is actually I changed
the wallpaper so I will show you the
actual wallpaper that you get by default
and it is the grass
so there we go and we have some nice
icons up here that are bundled the phone
and there's avatar whoo let's check that
out yes you get the whole movie comes on
a two gig SD card and it looks pretty
awesome dips down so there you go that's
one really nice one gold content go back
next one we got mobitv this also comes
on a number of other t mobile phones
like the hd2 it'll cost you an extra ten
dollars a month though so if you're
going to use it make sure you use it 29
days remaining for my trial
and this is pretty cool we can move it
around browse we can watch live TV it'll
stream see if we can get a show loaded
here we are and there we go quality is
not spectacular but it's watchable let's
go back home and you've got a number of
different channels here's our live TV
so that's pretty nice
and back to the home screen next we got
the sims 3 this is a pretty cool game
it's special for the t mobile vibrant
let's see if we can load it up real
quick see exclusively for tmobile
collector's edition here we go I can
play floating music gets kind of
repetitive and there we are pretty good
graphics it's a birds chirping so that's
people got a tmobile advertisement right
there in your world let's get out of
that and next we also have a kindle Hey
look at that
kindle software whoo and you can get
your books that just sinks right up
whoops since right up with your amazon
kindle account so if you purchase books
elsewhere you can download them here
that's really nice it doesn't have the
e-book reader that the european version
comes with
so those are the main featured bundled
applications you also get a link to go
go that's your in-flight Wi-Fi
so if we register our vibrant we're
gonna get some free Wi-Fi o for one
month there it is one month free Wi-Fi
on gogo inflight so that's good and
these are therefore by default over here
you got slacker radio don't believe I
signed up for this
that's bundled up and amazonmp3 that
usually comes on all the Android devices
that's decent way to get some music
yeah I put some widgets you got you've
already seen these before but there they
are this is the buddies widget shows up
Facebook updates status let's see here's
some other applications that it comes
with
if I already seen layer my account is
good I got a nice easy way to manage
your tmobile account it's going to load
my activity show me how many minutes
have used you can set alerts actually so
that you don't go over if you want to
turn on your minute usage alert it'll
let you know when you're getting too
much alright so that's a really nice
than half and this is my device gets
wallpaper
see what else we got so t-mobile help
application go straight to some farms if
you have some questions about your
device this is all formatted nice for
mobile devices so that's really good to
have help like that right here on the
device and getting status
so that's about it for first special
bundled applications you also got the
YouTube app but this it it doesn't do
high quality video one wins like all
right things see it's really really
pixelated it's not that great now the
windows mobile devices i'm used to high
quality youtube videos anyway there's
the samsung vibrant lots of great
programs bundled with it and especially
the avatar movie that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
