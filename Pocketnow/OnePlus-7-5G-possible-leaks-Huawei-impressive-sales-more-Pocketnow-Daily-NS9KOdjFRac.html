one plus is new 5g device and it looks
interesting according to some patents
iPhones could be getting Ted sensitive
back panels and other functionality and
one way is about to reach a milestone in
sales that might even leave Samsung
behind by next year I'm gonna leave that
up and according to the angle I need to
get some better recommendations for
Netflix shows in the comments this is
PocketNow daly sponsored by the huawei
mate book x pro the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for ipads
I highly recommend you visit Amazon
particularly because of you watched my
iPad Pro review I told you this tablet
is overkill you'd probably be just fine
with that entry-level iPad and it's
currently 229 bucks for the 32 gig model
329 for the 128 gig
that is crazy now let's talk about honor
as I was not really aware that the
company had launched a recent honor
magic SmartWatch that pretty much looks
like the Huawei watch sheets II and
that's all great I like the design but
it seems the company's not done there
since the company's partnering with
media tech to work on a wearable and
from my recent trip to media tech I even
wasn't aware that they manufactured the
processor for the polar m600 which is my
favorite Android wear Fitness SmartWatch
so yeah
interesting and speaking of Huawei let's
talk about sales I mean the company
stated something bold mid this year
where they claimed that they were gonna
defeat Apple and smartphone sales that's
pretty much about to happen
200 million units according to the
company are going to be reached by
December 25th and the rumors are that
there will be a special edition
smartphone which is really the reason
why I'm covering the news what special
edition are we getting I can't wait to
see and speaking of Apple those of you
that are waiting for air power we have a
full video with alternatives to air
power because we've been waiting for
that for the longest time but we've got
some patents that pretty much confirmed
that air power is coming and another
thing is another pattern where it seems
that Apple wants to use the glass back
for you to be able to scroll your phone
through the back which will not work if
you're using a case and you'll have to
because that phone is really fragile but
anyways
and finally the hottest news that they
have to do with oneplus and speculation
as there's a leaked photo from a very
famous tipster that choses Pete Lau in a
conference room holding a phone that's
also being presented in the presentation
and it looks like a future oneplus
device and according to the tipster this
could be the 5g variant whatever the
case may be I you know I'm not saying
that I know anything I just if this is
the final design of the one plus seven
I'm gonna say it looks really cool let
us know in the comments I mean do you
like what you see I mean a rounded
camera humph I actually think it looks
really cool but that's just me leave us
a comment down below we'd love to know
what you think and folks before we end
this video we would love to thank the
huawei mate book hex pro for making
today's content possible it's no secret
that many of us have praised this as one
of the best laptops of 2018 it's hard to
beat it's gorgeous and sleek ultra book
design a fantastic 3k display with the
high screen to body ratio on a laptop at
91% powerful performance with options
for discrete graphics 15 hours of
battery life

list just goes on follow the link of the
