calm we're here at the Nokia Lumia 1020
event so let's check it out and we'll
see our words
yeah
if you don't like the bond you want to
see the background do the opposite
more in-depth discussion on the kind of
technology you should talk to our
engineers okay
and what's really cool about this is the
manual focus yep
if you want we can have a look over
there okay hit the leaves
so step over there I can follow me and
you try to focus using the so stopping
the screen
it will
focus on the leaves what if I wants to
take a part of my colleague at the
background so what I can actually do
something once the manual focus and then
gradually on the background
but still does have to focus for
autofocusing right yeah so I don't much
you said and I could just uh
I was live the benefit of all these
controls is that you can really unleash
your creativity yeah and a lot of funky
stuff that's not possible on a normal
smartphone
how about we do high-speed shutter is
there panoramic mode built into this
as I know we have a separate app for
panoramas oh yeah this yeah it's not
 this post into the so there's a
it's on this smart panel so this is the
photo suite support second because once
you close I mean can you do like five
frames per second
no multiple sugars so that would be on
this much Kandra okay a different app so
you have to switch to have that involved
there
are you able to change the default
camera lens yes you are
like in the settings somewhere so I
could choose smart
actually the truth is the camera there
okay cool so you can choose the default
so this will be built in up yeah still
gives you the 5 megapixel the regular
Microsoft yeah and then pixels then not
gets much company and ok ok so smart can
be
to high-speed shutter or what else does
SmartCamp do
options here
probably that lower right button
so you have a missile attack sorry
action
people betting
okay there's best shot
yeah there's your options yeah that's a
shot that motion focus spread clucks
that's all
or together you can change faces remove
moving objects
but the panorama is not built into this
one is it
actually kind of run my separate another
separate
all right thank you look at the internal
here we have the lens
that's right are there between the what
this is the camera grip yeah so today
we're here at the Lumia 1020 launch
event so what I'm showing you right now
is the camera grip to really enhance
your stability of holding the phone so
now this camera people it also comes
with an internal battery and it has ten
twenty mini and first power in there so
you could just literally slide that in
there is a USB cable here so you can see
so I let it snap right in it has the
mechanical basically so so we're gonna
giving you the feeling of taking a photo
so I can just long press it and it can
brings up the Nokia pro cameras your
default camera so now you can see that
there are people outside and they're
looking out in the New York skyline so
you can see the grip here and then
there's battery charging you can also
turn on the battery light to just see
how much better you still have in the in
the camera grip and it has the really
ergonomic designs that you hold it and
have a favorite move very very steady
grip to it a little bit of length over
here and it does over here
there you go yeah and one cool thing
about is also have a universal standard
scoop so get screwed to your tripod that
your broadcast or any
excellent
and this is an extra $79 $79 $1 correct
all right so how do they take out just
pull yeah you have to basically snap off
both sides getting used to that left
right Oh cuz I mean we try to pick it a
little bit tighter so they can just
slide out again and then over here you
have the wireless charging and over here
it also comes with wireless charging as
well as already have a snap tongs you
just have to put on a cover it enables
actually wireless charging it comes with
the cover
how much thicker does this make it
and normally the phone is closed the
thickness is ten point four million
meter
very nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
