planning to get active with the Galaxy
s7 HTC now tease is that audio won't be
a compromise with the new HTC 10 and we
get a hint of what Apple means with the
whole iphone SE name I'm hi Mary vana
and somebody pointed out in the comments
that I need makeup I would agree that I
need an extreme makeover this is parking
out daily the official news today are
rather sad pebble is one of the pioneers
of the SmartWatch probably some of our
favorite smart watches out there I just
wish that my pebble time review unit
wasn't read for me to use it but hey the
biggest problem is that the company is
apparently going to let go of 40
employees because even though there is
money coming in it's really hard to keep
and that's a really sad news we do hope
that peb we'll figure something out as
we would love the company to continue
with its strength though I do feel that
they do need to do something about the
price tags and for those of you that are
wondering exactly what iphone SE stands
for trust me the whole first impressions
video that we did for the apple event
has a ton of comments that are just
hilarious with ideas but the company's
feel shudder just came out record the
state that iphone is e stands for
special edition and it makes a lot of
sense a lot of people wanted this 4 inch
iphone to make a comeback we would have
wanted a better design but that's not
necessarily a bad thing either let's
just see what the future iphone holds as
a going away from numbers actually makes
a lot of sense we've got some more
interesting news coming from music
streaming service as it seems that the
right now it's currently holding 34.3
percent of the market compared to thirty
four percent in digital downloads which
marks another milestone for music
streaming it's becoming more popular the
problem is a when record labels are
actually complaining about that
according to them too much revenues
being left on the table because a lot of
people are stuck in AD based services
and you know what the record label is
the problem is not really the ads it's
how much you want to charge for the
whole premium model you know just think
about it paying all that money just for
streaming music for me ten dollars is
fine for Spotify but then I can't just
pay that for you to bread and
us in that they're just too many
services out there just find one model
and stick left and since one of the
major concerns with all the leaks that
we've seen of the HTC 10 are the lack of
boomsound speakers HTC decided to tease
about that today the company shows us
that audio is going to be a big deal and
well the speaker drills that we notice
remind us of boom sound the problem is
that we don't really see that in any of
the leaks that we've seen Abby HTC 10
which makes us wonder are the leaks true
is this really the HTC 10 this just got
really good and finally the very hot new
should they have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy s7 active believe it or not even
though the Galaxy s7 and s7 edge are now
water-resistant phones it seems that we
are still getting a ruggedized phone and
that actually will make a lot of sense
apparently this is a 5.1 inch display
model unit and hopefully we get a larger
battery just like we did with the galaxy
s6 active but it leads me to the
question of the day do you think that
there is a model for the galaxy s7
active and if so would you buy one in my
case I thought I never would until I saw
the galaxy s6 active for the first time
it looks beautiful I just wish it had a
fingerprint scanner even if you could
just disable it whenever it's wet or
whatever leave us a comment down below
