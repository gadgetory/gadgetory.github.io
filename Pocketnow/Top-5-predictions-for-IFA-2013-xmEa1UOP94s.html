Aoife to happen in Berlin and our own
Michael Fisher and Anton d Nagy will be
covering everything live at the event
but obviously there are a couple of
predictions to go through so I'm hi Mary
better this is pocket now and these are
top 5 predictions for what to expect
that II but 2013 number 5 is the LG G
pad and yeah this is probably one of the
biggest tech irony's in history because
LG builds a displays for the best tablet
in the market which is the ipad pretty
much almost every Apple product out
there and still they did not have a
tablet of their own obviously we'd wish
they'd have a better name than G pad but
they're trying to dub everything as G
recently and as it turns out we are
expecting some decent specification
something good out of this tablet looks
to the description for details though we
don't know how it's gonna go with that
price range when you have something like
the Nexus 7 22 29 and just about
everything being cool number four is the
first ever HTC palvin there's the
company that they're the odds years ago
bring is the first big bones even though
Samsung took that crown with the Galaxy
Note lineup we are expecting a bigger
HTC One probably being dubbed the HTC
one max Snapdragon 800 processor a lot
of good specs licks in the description
for details on this device there are a
lot of rumors out there fingerprint
scanning at the back and pretty much
just again a bigger HTC One let's just
hope they figure out how to bring more
ultrapixels to this camera because the
four ultrapixels that we had on the one
we're probably the only thing we didn't
like about that phone let's see what we
get number three is actually not so good
I mean that is it the first two or
android-based and actually the next two
or android basis well we're expecting
very little microsoft bresson's the
reason why is we haven't really seen
many leaks of anything that has to do
with Windows a lot of people haven't
really like Windows 8 Windows RT has
been a complete disaster and we are
expecting for Windows 8.1 to be launched
in the next couple of weeks and that
would bring new products we aren't
expecting anything at Aoife but mostly
boots of products that already exist so
if you're out there waiting for more
windows phones or more windows tablets I
don't think this is going to be the
event for you number two are some good
Sony products notice i said products not
just a sony honami that we've seen in
lease we've had press renders of the spa
we're expecting a 20.7 mega
pixel camera very thin design Snapdragon
800 processor a lot of good things
coming from this phone but we also saw
some recent leaks of a mini phone that
probably will be released at the same
time we're probably expecting a new
Xperia lineup that will come at Aoife
like the last year even though last year
sony phones that were launched steady
but then get much of a good reception or
a much of a good push from the company
so apparently this Sony Honami will be
called the Xperia z1 let's see what the
mini will be called and let's see if
there will be another mid-tier in the
middle and let's hope that these three
phones or two phones or whatever we get
will probably retain the same
specifications and just different price
points and different sizes for whatever
you want and finally your top number one
prediction for what will happen at Aoife
2013 is that Samsung will steal a show
with the galaxy gear and galaxy note 3
now in the case of the galaxy gear this
is kind of tough because even the
company believes this will be just a
concept product and it's just a
smartphone companion probably no
different than what we'll see right now
with Sony SmartWatch on what you have
with a pebble so it's kind of hard to
see this to be groundbreaking and most
likely they're waiting to see what Apple
does with the iWatch in the case of the
galaxy note 3 you know they own the
phablet category those of you then
believe in it saw that the Galaxy Note
one in galaxy note 2 pretty much took
the world by storm and most probably
this galaxy note 3 will be a slimmer but
bigger galaxy note with probably more
functionality a better s-pen now the
company owns Wacom and everything so we
are expecting a lot from this product
but then again you'll notice that none
of these things that we mentioned in the
past other cases are one more thing you
know nothing out of the ordinary aside
from the leaks that we've seen so far so
that leads me to the question of the day
do you believe that we will be surprised
at Aoife 2013 is there something more
that we're probably missing in these
predictions honestly in my case it's a
tough one because league's pretty much
take the cake here we don't know what
else to expect probably Samsung has just
taken the steps with the you know the
leaks of the galaxy gear the Galaxy Note
we haven't seen really much other
products being teased around but leave
us a comment down below what do you
expect that's it for today's top five
thank you very much for watching there
