possible announcement of the galaxy note
7 which is rumored for August second so
it's probably a little too early for us
to give you a rumor roundup because
these are only gonna get louder but
still we do have things that we would
love to see on this phone I'm hi
admitting that I with pocket now here
with a quick wish list of what we would
like to see on the galaxy note set this
is actually a follow-up to an article
that was started a few days ago where we
actually rounded up all our wish list
and just to give you an idea in the
words of our own Adam down well we would
not like to see number one as steps back
the thing about the Galaxy Note lineup
is that it's always been that no holds
bar lineup for samsung where we get
everything but then in the case of the
galaxy note 5 that wasn't really the
case sure we've got the great camera we
had some cool things here and there but
it didn't mean that the Galaxy Note took
a step further it actually was just the
galaxy s6 with more features we would
love to see some of these features come
like the water resistance of the galaxy
s7 in addition to the camera but then we
would also like to see unique things
come to the galaxy no lie of a samsung
pushes the bar then in the wards of
anton just bring it already tony is a
very impatient guy and so are many of us
we really just want to see the phone
we've been covering a ton of rumors so
far over what to expect we're not sure
if we're getting you know more specs or
less affects the same thing or what we
just want to get the phone already and
obviously we would not like to wait
until Aoife it would be an awesome idea
if samsung would pull the phone early in
august it would give Samsung enough time
to garner enough customer mindshare in
order to make the battle that the
company wants to make against the iphone
7 plus or whatever that phone will be
and given the fact that the galaxy note
7 is actually a superior phone mainly
because of the features that it has it
makes all the sense in the world for
there to be no need to wait and then in
the words of our own horn back no one of
the main reasons why he was disappointed
with the galaxy s lineup this year is
because of audio quality and if the
galaxy note is that top-tier smartphone
it would make all the sense in the world
for Sam sink to actually
listen to companies like LG for example
with the v10 like HTC with the case of
the 10 and actually bring high-quality
audio into the galaxy note at least the
galaxy note given the fact of the galaxy
s7 was again one of the weakest black
ships this year when it came to audio
and then when it comes to the camera
that's another deal sure the camera the
galaxy s7 is gorgeous but it would be
awesome of Samsung would experiment with
that larger chassis of the galaxy note
and probably bring a larger sensor and
innovate in that direction I really love
horns wish list on this one mainly
because I do agree one of the main
reasons why i'm currently using an HTC
10 has to do with that audio deck has to
do with pretty much that feature alone
but then again they added a better
cameras well that would be awesome in
the case of Ryan he wants expandability
and I know many of us do I think it's a
given that we're getting expandable
storage and so right we should one of
the reasons why I stopped using the
galaxy note 5 was mainly because of the
lack of expandability the v10 just came
afterwards from LG and I just completely
moved away because of that particular
reason it would make sense for us to get
expandable storage yes but then again if
you have a larger chassis why not add a
replaceable battery as well there has to
be a way for samsung to pull that off
and that'll bring great build quality as
well and my opinion is least then we
would love to end this video asking you
the primary question if you had to pick
what features you want on the galaxy
note 7 what would these be would you
want expandability would you want a
better camera would you want the glass
on glass designer would you want
something different because in my case I
will tell you this much my wish list for
the galaxy note 7 is to have a phone
that does not make me want to go to
other phones in the past the Galaxy Note
used to be that android phone for me it
was the android phone that could do more
and i really want that galaxy note 7 to
be that phone the phone that could do so
much more compared to other devices that
i just would rather not want to stop
using it even if i don't really use the
S Pen much that doesn't matter it's
