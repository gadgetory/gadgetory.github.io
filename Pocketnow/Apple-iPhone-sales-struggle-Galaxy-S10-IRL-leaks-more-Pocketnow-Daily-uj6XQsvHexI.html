company is down this holiday for the
first time in 19 years look at the first
real life pictures of the Galaxy S 10
from a very trusted source and no
surprises here anymore and it looks like
Huawei is following Nokia's footsteps
with the mate 30 with another batch of
like five cameras I'm Jaime Rivera and I
had a hard time trying to remember that
today is not Tuesday it's Thursday
this is parking out daily the official
lose today begin with accidents waiting
to happen for those of you that are
planning on becoming Netflix subscribers
you will no longer be able to subscribe
to the service through Apple in iTunes
because it's you know kind of unfair
that companies like Netflix have to pay
30% as a cut to Apple just for that
transaction so now just like in the case
of Amazon if you want to purchase
anything you will be taken out of the
store the application and you will be
taken to the website to be able to make
your purchase pretty much what happened
with a Google Play in the end as well I
mean I guess they want to maximize the
revenue now let's talk about that Sony
Xperia XE for I know
Sony news aren't really hot here but it
seems that this phone is not gonna be
any chump we know that it'll bring the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 according to
benchmarks but then these benchmarks
don't show is anything like Ram but it
beats every single phone it was compared
to like the 812 Bionic from Apple like
the keren 980 which was the current king
and we're already starting to wonder
exactly what changed here so stay tuned
for that one and speaking of Huawei
let's talk about that make 30 pro that
will come later as we know the
difference between the P and the mate is
where the cameras are placed and now
we've got some leaked cases where the
camera opening for its it's larger and
so we're wondering if that means that
we're getting up this camera element
wait that would be fourth but that would
be five and I I know it's it's getting
kind of crazy but that's something I
would be expecting from Huawei and how
about if we talk about the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 that we've got famous
tipster Evan blasts showing us the front
of the phone and I don't
there's anything left to wonder here one
seven gets things there pretty much
confirmed the whole cutout for the
camera that doesn't look too large
actually it doesn't look intrusive and
then we've got a nearly bezel s display
chime in the comments let us know what
you think about this design approach and
finally the hottest news today have to
do with something that was going to
happen at some point what goes up must
come down Apple has been having great
quarters pretty much every quarter
better year over a year
quarter-over-quarter for the past 20
years and that pretty much ended right
now Tim Cook pretty much just sent an
estimate where the company was expecting
to sell 91 billion in revenue it ended
up being more like 84 billion which is a
significant drop in according to Tim
Cook it had to do with low demand on
iPhones and when asked for the reason
why it seems that he's blaming it on the
battery replacement program and other
things that have been happening let us
know in the comments down below we would
really love to know your opinion what do
you think happened what cost this
revenue drop in my case I do feel that
Apple just completely overdid the price
tag they overestimated okay we're not
selling that many units so why don't we
make it more expensive and still get the
same amount of revenue at some point it
was gonna backfire like iPhones right
now are more expensive than a MacBook
let us know what you think in the
comments down below

news earlier follow us I'm talking about
