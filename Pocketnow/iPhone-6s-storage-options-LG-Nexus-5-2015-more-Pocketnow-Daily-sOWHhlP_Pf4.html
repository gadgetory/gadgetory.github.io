options and sunsets storage options as
well we got some interesting rumors
regarding the LG g4 Pro and if you want
to get your hands on an HTC vive you
better be ready to wait I'm high Meadow
iveta getting ready to enjoy the
benefits of Friday and you should do the
same this is out daily the
official news are both good in bed we
were extremely happy this morning
because Huawei started selling its
Huawei watch on amazon for a crazy price
tag it was for two dollars on a variant
six hundred dollars in another and
apparently there are different price
points depending on a specific variant
that you order that range from three
hundred and fifty dollars to almost a
thousand dollars the problem is that the
listing was pulled from amazon and now
always apologizing claiming that
something was wrong with the listing and
we are hoping that it's the price tag
but for it to be lower we'll keep you
posted now the most anticipated product
of the year is not going to be available
yet we're talking about the HTC vive we
were extremely blown away by virtual
reality with this particular unit up to
the point where we've been crazy waiting
for it and we were expecting to get it
by the end of this year but it turns out
that HTC might only be able to shell
enough for developers to build products
for it so apparently that launch later
this year will be limited and then we
can expect to finally get it onto your
q1 2016 and we've been waiting for a
possible LG g4 pro or that super premium
phone to the company CEO teased earlier
sometime this year and well we've heard
a lot of specs like a Snapdragon 820 and
yada yada yada but some trusted sources
playing that we are getting a five point
eight inch quad HD display Snapdragon
810 possibly and you will have removable
everything as well but apparently it
won't be an aluminum phone apparently
we're sticking to leather here or
plastic whatever options they are but we
still don't have a date we'll keep you
posted and speaking of LG for those of
you that are waiting for that LG Nexus 5
2015 as it apparently will be dubbed
we've got some leaks of the display
panel that match exactly the renders
that we
about earlier and we get other renders
from other credible sources that show is
pretty much what we've already seen so
if you did not like the design of that
Nexus 5 like me for example you better
start getting used to it as apparently
this is what we are going to get let's
see wet and finally for the hot and cold
news of the day let's talk iphone 6s we
have good and bad news let's start with
the good ones first of all it seems that
the for such technology will make it
only with a different name which is
great and we also see that the rose gold
option will happen it's a little bit of
a copper tone that resembles the Apple
watch rose gold only obviously this is
aluminum well in the case of the bad
news apparently that sapphire variant is
not going to happen making it completely
unreasonable for you to get that 7000
series aluminum and then having the
display not be as durable but in
addition to that even worse is that
there are leaks of the box of the iphone
6 and apparently it starts at 16
gigabytes yes we've been dealing with 16
gigabytes iphones since I think the
iphone 3gs but hey it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about these leaks of the iphone success
particularly you know the color options
and the storage options do you think
that this would make a compelling
product because in my case i don't care
about the color i have my god 16 gigs
it's just a crazy way to start
particularly in this time when most of
the eye on smartphones are starting at
32 gigs at that price range but leave us
a comment down below what do you think
and as always you know the drill if you
want to get it was earlier before this
video was filmed make sure you follow us
on fire now about comment subscribe
change your channel as well it followed
me on twitter highlanders go to be
better on instagram it i never be better
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw i am hanging out or
even I thank you very much for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
