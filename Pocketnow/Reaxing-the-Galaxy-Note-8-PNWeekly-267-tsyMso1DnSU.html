although I do love their black dragon
that's the black dragon is pretty sweet
that's that's the one that's the one
that has my favorite most upset to pull
off my galaxy so I had my TAS si we put
on the Dragon Skin one because we a
daddy brand sponsorship at the time and
it made holding that phone so much nicer
and sets doing all the camera tests
rolling around in the dirt afraid I was
gonna drop this Liberty phone but the
other one that um was a biggie for me my
razor my razor blade laptop the finish
is super easy to scratch on that I've
got a bunch of dings and Nick's from

inexpensive way to preserve the look of

new skins for your favorite piece of
tech head on over to D brand.com slash
weekly that's d brand calm / weekly let
him know that we sent you and we thank D
Ram for supporting the pocket now weekly
indeed true story I mean actually our
sponsor can you hook up maybe a one plus
buy because our checkers run the third
be phone that you would have killed
I mean like oh my god this is weekly
hashtag P and weekly on Twitter or
getting so defensive
it's like super sensitive wow so he's
super lightweight that's what you're
saying podcast at pocketnow.com also a
place to email your questions so that we
can save them for a later date for a
rainy day and - you're completely sure
what's the satisfaction so we already
have a great question from at mapreduce
regular viewer of the show how much
charge do you three have this late into
the evening
hashtag p.m. weekly the essential phone
is impression
42% you know and I I'm a little charger
I hold it off the charger at 6 a.m.
that's what you got on your b20 so I'm
on my site I have a spare battery so I
just keep charging that's that's a to me
and right now I'm on 34% okay
34% on the second battery on the second
battery and a day this is the third
charge cycle of the day okay so I'm
doing better than the third charge and
so Galaxy s8 active is on 16 though
the active the best phones lineup equals
the second charge Oh
so baila waves oh that's impressive
though is for it to last in that kind of
cells earlier than three hours and
actually running data that whole time
because you kept all our notes going to
the entire show so I'm actually not
gonna hate on Samsung their that's or us
their once sir is no hate on this phone
so I'm at forty one percent on my LG g6
but I did have fifteen percent top off
at the bar okay so I would be down
closer to like like danger battery low
battery warning is the best performance
on the g6 meds
not bad for me the g6 is not good no
it's not but I've been using the honor
nine as my camera oh my god and so with
the exception of doing a couple
wide-angle shots up most of my most of
my phone photos have come from a
different phone and that's usually where
I've got my screen fo but I know
listeners I'm sorry the webcam is crap
but you gotta at least like take a
second pull it out because they have to
see the finish on this thing
oh it's in my bedroom you guys talk real
quick I'll be right back guys
I handled the pre-brief yeah I was kind
of disappointed to hear that but you
know the rumors are that you know 18t
wants to do a little thing probably that
same time period so I think I would be
dumb not to do something particularly
that honor 9 was actually a unit because
it was a while to get it look I was
actually wanting to get it for myself
but it's a gorgeous phone so it really
is a pretty phone oh I feel it's a
little I feel it's a little galaxy s7
even oh no no no well it's it's the back
layer lasers so the frame is very s 7e
the glass is wholly unique
so the back is a complete galaxy us of
an edge the bottom is galaxy s of an
edge the top is a galaxy s6 and yeah and
then the front is a mix between iPhone 7
+ 1 + + 5 I mean there's still some
Samsung going on there - I feel Samsung
was the predominant influence over this
phone and not necessarily in a bad way
because it's blending a lot of things
but the thing that I'm still
consistently impressed with and this is
something that you know I think we have
a little disagreement with on the note 4
and we'll get to the note 4 here in just
a minute I promise window grandboy about
this is is the flush camera centers
where the glass is unbroken yes on the
back of the honours still I think one of
the most impressive things I've seen yes
on if I mean it's just so simple to do
so I just I remember the first time I
might use the Huawei which was the Nexus
6p yeah and it was just funny because
remember back in Latin America our
concept of always is these very cheesy
phone and so like to get a 6p for me I
was like mate by Huawei but I just
there's a long way before the 6p there's
a wall way after the 6p that 6p
continues to be one of my favorite
phones of all time any 918 I have many
reasons and it just made me start
believing in this company and like I
received the honor eight late yeah then
I received the p10 sorry then the mate 9
then the p10 and just my exposure to
Huawei hardware yeah like the taste I
love how I remember when I used to go to
Bali presentations five years ago and it
was all the way the CEO was always like
this is better than this over
competition this is better than this
other competition and that Huawei is not
trying to compete no I think not always
arme US market well I I feel like the US
market is still the last enough that
they've they've got some inconsistencies
in how they're trying to crack it but
when worldwide they're the number three
yes
that's impressive growth because like
you prior to the Nexus 6p
is a brand that was not on my radar no
zero and how quickly we've seen them
change that perception it's now
genuinely looking forward to new
products that they put out yeah you know
that I know you know what the funny part
is and I think this is gonna serve as a
good segue segue yes before the before
Samsung started doing Nexus devices
Samsung was really not as much in our
radar either yeah HTC was the big bad
yeah and it was the carry over from the
Windows Windows Windows Mobile and they
AC make the first Android phone yes and
then Samsung did the Nexus S and then
the Nexus a gallon Galaxy Nexus which
was my first ever no sorry my first the
Nexus One was average Android phone it
was the Galaxy Nexus yeah and well the
Galaxy Nexus was thrown that really sort
of I think blew open Samsung design yeah
my wife is a huge fans the first editors
money has a way yeah oh my god I
remember I remember holding that phone
back and I still have it I have it I
have that unit there in my drawer and I
was like this phone is so big it's so
hard to manage and now we handle the
Galaxy Note reigns yeah who could
possibly use a 4.7 inch screen in their
daily driver 720p is a very easy are you
gonna use all of those dots with HD
resolution only you remember that
beautiful spent I'll criticize yes I
still do I mean that's one of the things
I was actually hoping to see Samsung
because we should jump in place to start
would be quark on Twitter doesn't know
it feel more like a revolution or
evolution which is always a good place I
defer to you immigration in a razor
it's an iteration I I wouldn't use any
of those words it's so high something
that needed to be in the place of the
note I understand the reason why I can't
understand why Samsung is doing this
they had a rough year last year yeah I
you know I found I thought I found it to
be bold for the company
than in a presentation where they're
supposed to praise their new products
and they took the time during the
presentation to admit that they the
still and they had a beer yeah and they
use the words when he was disappointed
here yeah I love that like ever since DJ
ko has taken over the company oh my god
like I love the humbleness
well Samsung has been so much more
grounded in there yes you don't have to
say hi GG let's do a Broadway show to
announce a phone yeah kinds of
shenanigans and yeah I think we all
appreciate that kind of a Congress a
more grown-up conversation with I mean
there was still the spectating when you
headed it to the s pod because we had we
were kind of transitioning into a whole
bunch of things too with Kwan HD you
know potential for 4k chip that ego 575
and then we started writing into
refinements as six design smooth like
glass couples it's not really like you
went there as an s3 really they have a
nature like them or this is like the
more in this one the whistle and the
iconic Samsung whistle now getting back
to the no date don't cringe you that so
the press conference because I love that
moment were they actually and they were
pulling video I'm sure a lot of you
probably saw some even for Lhasa Carter
was there they pull a video of people
talking about like their experience
isn't just like how emotional this stuff
gets and we might want to be kind of
cynical about something like that but
this is probably the device you spend
most of your day interacting with other
people this is happy like your lifeline
to other communication I think it's
important to recognize like how many
people they left in a lurch the flip
side of that though is I think they went
a little overboard on the fanservice all
you boil knows people you're the fans
that kept us afloat that the warm fuzzy
could be like I understand I understand
balancing that conversation and being
appreciative of your customer base but
after appointment was getting a little
much for me in the whole life I told you
I guess fees what I'm selling
awesome and loved loved up I sold you I
got invited to that fan so fun fact I
actually received an email from Samsung
bear in mind I've been using the Galaxy
Note since version 2 yeah
so I'm sure that they had some way to
try it are my personal user every single
Samsung in the NSA they're all over your
stuff right now I don't know it's just
so I received the B invite to come to
unpacked and write a fan and they had
like this stack of they had a it was a
very big group of people that were there
I think that like half the half the
people that were there were media and
then the other half were people that
were invited by Samsung I think it was I
don't take it the wrong way I I feel
that the reaction to the note yeah
because they made a good point I mean
this company is like okay let's like bow
down except the feet and let's offer
people whatever they want and and let's
see if we can snatch a victory out of
the jaws of this defeat but if you think
about it if you think about it and when
this happened to Samsung at the
beginning of the note 7 problem it
wasn't like we are going to replace your
phone with another Samsung no we will
replace your phone with whatever you
want yeah and so for the company to
notice that people replace their phones
with another Samsung I remember that the
metric was like 91% yeah there was
almost no migration no migration to the
competition and so I feel that it was a
good move to praise loyalty I understand
that but I start to get a little twitchy
when some of the starts to become like
we're besties and were your friends and
the conversation starts drifting into
that kind of feel I got it you know
these cuz it's like at the end of the
day this is still a multi billion-dollar
multinational corporation whose main
responsibility is to their shareholders
to tender morality for them and that's
you know that's just why I kind of feel
like it gets a little much or got a
little
for me during that conversation but I
wanted them to get on the talk about the
no date which we're not even doing whole
fan thing where it was like dude the
only reason why the LGB 21-hour prize
for the best moment of 2016 was my
default was because the note died yeah
but I think we were all in agreeance
that the Galaxy Note 7 was the best vote
of 2016 not for me but for other people
other people the general tso me I feel
like Samsung has made very conversation
with its Brandon it's realized what's
when it's done and we call situation it
rebounded by doing this whole you know
edition and in the guise of that was
going to resource these parts for you
know just making up the loss you know it
would make anywhere near than our money
that they would have otherwise I feel
like that was one employ you know if
they're doing it in developed countries
where you know in can be debated that
there's some fandom to agree over there
but you know it's also kind of a
mid-range
just as a general main range device with
a phablet and status and that putting
the no nathie up there with same
signaling to them that we're doing this
as a token we're doing this as a way to
let you know that we are making sure
that checks are in balance and that when
we get to the note a because the they've
started offering $425 rebates to go to
note 7 quarters for the donate we're
going to do it right and we're going to
make sure that everything is polished up
by the time this all blows through so I
feel like that is the foundation of
where that section of the audience is
coming from do you think where we're
going here is like where's the nest
chicken of audience here and what's this
play what do you think well that's
that's what I think we have yet to see I
think the essay was the the proper
Samsung
spawns to getting people back in line
not making jokes about Samsung phones
exploding and so now I think we still
need to see you go still - nothing no no
no it's not that the s8 was the
completion of that conversation the s8
was just to show we're back on track
we're making boundary-pushing devices
literally and that starts you back on
the road towards changing over that that
knee-jerk reaction who soon flew that's
gonna blow up you know like it takes
time to undo that I still think we'll
need to see over the next two fiscal
quarters how much damage was really done
to the node name well don't think it was
going to be much I don't think we're
gonna see a significant drop
although the bottom is we're not going
to get the numbers remember Sam sorry
about the vid Samsung is one of the
companies that does not release yeah but
I mean that's me pretty good insight on
how s8 sold after that again we're never
going to get the full picture but as I
said okay si has been like remember
Samson wasn't making money cent making
profit since the s4 since the s4 so this
is just proof I know but we've still got
general trend data on like how many
essays have been shipped how many assets
have been stocked and we can get a
pretty good sense of once we start
seeing that kind of data for the note if
there was a significant lasting impact
to the note brand from last year well
I'm assuming we're gonna see that that
kind of dip in light of the end of this
year you know as the note no longer
stands as the sole big-screen device
we're gonna have the most exciting
hardware update that we've ever seen
from Apple we're gonna see something I
think we're going to see something
pretty cool from LG and internationally
you've got intense pressure now from
huawei the mate has never been stronger
and pixel two is yet is starting to take
that enthusiast conversation you know
the people who really cared about like
that that Nexus behind a software update
conversation they're not that those
people have no interest in an LG or
Samsung they're looking at something
Google Direct and although I think this
is probably going to be this the
toughest competition
while Samsung stilllooking their wounds
on what used to be the only big screen
in town but you know I don't think
that's going to be the biggest deterrent
of the no date honestly it's not
competition so what's the big grant then
yeah I want to ask you to try don't try
to say you like CG likes to play this
game try to do the try to make some
memory and remember when was the last
time that you ever heard a phone in its
entry tier like you know this this is
yes this is the cheapest version of this
particular phone that you can buy and at
being retail that nine hundred and sixty
dollars rising good credit then you
spread that over 24 months or it may
team under lunette yes that's what you
just went crazy Larry yes it's nearly
fifty nine areas $40 a month
it's nearly $50 for down twice like you
know okay so the property market for you
the point the point being is never has a
phone you visit this expensive lately
and the reason why I'm saying entry
tears because shirt like you cannot even
know that there's gonna be well in
United States be honest if you go for a
256 gig iPhone and costs $1000 an iPhone
7 plus oh yeah you can make an iPhone 7
plus things like that you don't have but
you don't have but the base model of the
know date to cost between 920 and men
and $60 it just reminds me of that time
when Steve Ballmer with the launch of
the iPhone like nobody no nobody had
ever paid $500 for an iPhone plus the
subsidy yeah which was the launch of the
first iPhone yeah no I
I feel though that we have crested into
this territory because how expensive was
the note 700 something
850 I mean we were talking in an almost
$900 device last year yeah so the note
has always played in this top tier
premium it was less expensive when
Trayvon was less expensive
heritage it was a ladder's that photo
was a letter step first thing was the
iPhone 7 plus that $20 increase between
you know seven point nine and seven
sixty nine but but that's that's kind of
what I'm getting at is like we're going
forty notes at the police we're not
going on drums
so Galaxy s8 small phone to so in the
200m in the case of the Galaxy Note 5 vs
s6 edge+
the note 5 was $50 cheaper right it was
750 it would wait it was seven months
750 and and the s6 edge+ was $100 it was
850 that was like the oh yeah truly and
and what was it that they were selling
they were selling a fashion bomb that
Iran had the first curved screens on a
phone that large that was a beautiful
phone I mean it was it was a pretty fun
um but again what we're talking about
are different scenarios so I'm saying
from from model year to model year
Samsung already set a $900 expectation
near the no 7 and 6 and we're talking
like unlocked $30 more than that now so
I feel prices gonna put a hurt on this
but I also think this is the next phase
of what the premium flagship tier is
going to represent and I think that
thousand-dollar ceiling this now gives
Apple I mean what's crazy is that fact
that Samsung did not price this at $9.99
gives Apple room to actually hit that
price point make it an exclusive luxury
device Badgett and fill it that way and
make it in a completely emotional
purchase kind of like an Apple watch
Edition right you know you can make it
you can now make that a part of the
conversation that it represents some
kind of status where phones haven't done
that for a really long time I'm going to
complete I really don't like the premise
that Samsung is giving room to Apple in
order to make it just gave me an idea
right now so that so remember that the
iphone 7s iphone 7 s plus and iPhone 8
are ruins of E glass and stainless steel
yeah
what if it's ceramic instead of glass we
heard rumors that Apple was working on a
material
means ceramic this would be used on the
Apple watch edition yep ceramic on your
essential phone and like what's the cool
thing about ceramic it doesn't scratch
yeah like this band that I got for the
gear s 3 is ceramic it doesn't scratch
yeah so what if that's the reason why
they're gonna price the phone so
expensive well I mean as long as there's
a reason I mean I know there are other
things there are things on essential
phone that spec junkies are probably not
gonna really like right or you know what
I think is also funny like 2 years ago
was kind of a novelty if the phone was
water-resistant now it's like oh phones
not water was there's a night of
conversation exactly and that's time I
think that's kind of funny to watch how
that's kind of stuff cycles yeah you
know where you don't need it until
suddenly a phone that you like has it
and now it's a total deal-breaker if a
different phone doesn't have that
feature when we can't you can't say
there is no other phone that's made out
of ceramic and titanium fermions a deal
breaker
not having waters I mean like that's
just it I mean for me personally I like
good drop resistance and durability
water resistance is nice yo sorry the
b20 was still a solid option for me even
lacking water resistance still would've
liked the be 34 ya get both but you have
to seal up the battery and I understand
those compromises - I can I can still
look at the essential and say there is a
reason you pay more for more expensive
manufacturer and premium build so it's
not like you know it's just outright a
deal-breaker you just have to find the
right audience member for that it was
the seven-headed all phones we're
talking about $1000
what's where's the 300 dog gap here I'm
not see is the biggest question which is
actually the question of a Thursday ly
whenever it goes live eight really worth
- nine hundred and sixty dollars mr.
Hornbeck no less tested the 1+5 who's
clearly with the otter 9-mer hey I mean
what do you think that so to me
I always think that the question of
worth is toxic because there is an
audience for every device I have to find
who that audiences the audience might be
three people into kept see and that that
device is a failure but you want to
match like that that phone could be the
absolute right perfect fit for that one
person that's always the question I'm
trying to find so we're looking at a
note which is nine hundred and thirty
dollars plus I can't justify that for a
lot of people in my circle of family and
friends
okay I'm here right so I have difficulty
there but there are a couple things if
you're really into stylus fine point
find touch you know an interaction in
navigation it's literally the best game
the only game in town for the
implementation of that feature this is
you're looking for it on a phone yes
this is the first proper Samsung with a
dual-camera sensor so if you want the
novelty of having a zoom sensor portrait
mode you're into that kind of fun
photography on the go what other
Samsung's gonna do it for you if you
were a consumer would you buy it I say
that well since I wouldn't because I
mean personally if you're asking me I
wouldn't because I like content creation
devices like the b20 yeah and that's
that's a phone that is much better able
for me to get you a love of the body
I'll be 30 with an extra well what I use
I use my my V 20 with a stylo pen true I
use I use my ability phone with a
fine-tipped
active stylus it just doesn't have
nearly the kind of software interaction
that I learned oh yeah so again I can't
I can't write off this notion of price
because also a part of this is that
Samsung is the only manufacturer which
is as successfully nearly as
successfully as Apple become a lifestyle
brand true so the note also becomes a
status symbol and I don't want to
dismiss that for people there are people
walking around if you go to an airport
you see some dude walking around with a
Louie Vuitton duffel bag and you're like
you spent way too much to put crap in a
bag but that's his gig that's his style
is that what he wants it's a status
based on exclusivity thing
there's so few phones out there have
styluses that offer sizes I mean about
the G style ersatz 3 or whatever
technology and that those are you know
more affordable less functional and when
you're talking about the software suite
the Samsung has developed around it that
takes a lot of effort Oh conversation if
the conversation is style then the S Pen
is irrelevant because if the
conversation is static
right now the SI plus is a BOGO deal on
t-mobile right you know so like let's
have status if you're buying a phone
today and it's the SI plus you have
status today if you buy well that's not
the argument I'm trying to make my
translucent feature which people are
willing to pay more for in which case
whether to treat it as an aspirational
purchase where you say my for I think
they do I don't know I mean a big part
of that is is what is their social
networking service kind of so I mean
they do treat that feature is like be an
artist to be creative just be fun and be
a threeway
by our thousand dollar phone I would be
I don't know what the trend is but I did
know like for example my ex-wife went
crazy over the Galaxy Note 2 not because
it was a galaxy not because it had a pen
just because the file was big yeah and I
have well known we know there's so much
data to say that people were using the
note more for this I have yes I have I
know an insane amount of women
particularly that prefer the iPhone 7
plus just because it's big well any but
think about that that actually makes a
lot of sense because what do you not
carry around that you can put larger
devices into in the case of in the case
of a woman that you know they have a
person anniversary I mean so it what's
funny is if there was there was like
this really good data right before the
launch of the iPhone se about the
popularity of the iPhone 5s you know it
meant yeah especially younger men who
were one they didn't have the purchasing
power to buy a great overpriced gadgets
but than to it's like we were in another
phase of like skinny jeans yes
I mean again as fashion in status they
wanted the Apple logo but they didn't
want something that would Bend in a
pocket so the iPhone 6 was actually out
of the question because they hadn't
fixed Club rails on the volume rocker
yeah not specifically because that but
there was the whole person Joe your age
everybody yeah exactly
um good job Zach quickness in the right
direction
let me Molly Nelson but that that became
like this pocket trend for a hot you
know got minute where people wanted
these tiny phones to complement their
personal style
I feel the note still fits that
conversation but I feel its power is
waning largely because what you're
talking about
popular big-screen phones are no longer
unique it's so longer and now the thing
is well then let's go back to the reason
so why did my ex-wife want a note bear
in mind my job was to review phones it
still is and you know I was like oh my
god like the battery on this thing is
there are a whole bunch of other reasons
that go hand in hand
but I think people still look at a big
screen or something that's a bit larger
in the true-true
but none of me it wasn't that for me it
was actually cumbersome - you know -
yeah for me it was just going on
whatever tradeshow I went to and not
have to worry about charging the phone
and if anything I carried a spare
battery and I would just replace it yeah
and so um you know whenever something
good going back to the whole concept you
go going back to the whole concept of
our of our discussion the other day our
our tech debate denver if the note was
productive or not is like okay so what
is this park trying to replace its
triumphalism notepad which is what i
would i say it in my hands on up in the
debate okay this park is trying to
replace note that it's trying to replace
or sketchpad whatever bad and what was
worthy characteristics of these things
like for example when this paper never
runs out of battery replacement for
paper a kindle well but you can't draw
you can oh the perfect replacement for
paper for a book okay like what product
does a perfect job of replacing the
product that's
place yeah you charge it once a month
yeah it moves it every day and charge it
once a month it completes its purpose
and it actually looks like if you're
reading paper so in the case of the note
let's forget about the whole concept of
reading paper or not what it's trying to
be this tool this notepad that's always
available to you that whenever whenever
you just remember the photo somebody
gave you a phone number at 9 p.m. and
you're like hey just jot that and just
pull the note ok can the note truly
achieve that is the question well but
that's also I think part of the misnomer
is we are still judging the note on this
one feature of s-pen as opposed to it
being Samsung is the everything in the
kitchen sink kind of company so Samsung
is trying to add a feature to a crazy
Swiss Army knife gasps yes they're not
focusing on just something like the to
your point something like the blackberry
is the longevity device that and and it
features a hardware keyboard those two
pieces define blackberry that's a longer
learning feature but what can you do on
a blackberry for a creative professional
or a multimedia content creator or a
sketch are very an exam so you can have
all the battery life in the world but
can you do a lot so I'll give you an
example Angela Angela
Angela's a good friend her mother them
Dom is an amazing cartoonist and the
moment the iPad pro with Apple pencil
came out yeah it was no room for
discussion and I'm like so what is it
that you like about the iPad pro so when
she's like so have you ever attend you
have you ever used the Wacom like like
like Adam Lane is all about that and I'm
like ok so let's just say that the Wacom
is like driving an old Chevy from the
80s it gets the job done right don't get
me wrong but then you move to the Apple
pencil and it's like it's like a face at
a cartoonist for drawer and they asked
them exactly what they wanted mm-hmm and
it got delivered on the
so but so what and this is the reason
why I've always said like I remember
back in the day of pocket pcs these are
products I didn't have to worry about
the battery ever dying so they were
perfect notepads for me okay things like
that and so I passed last for ten hours
yeah of permanent use right but what are
the trade-offs there because you know we
have to examine the compromises on
obviously you know you just throw your
iPad in your back pocket right obviously
they tried the iPad Mini and it failed
right and they have well and they never
even bothered any support secretary and
so and so it's like I feel I've always
felt that about the note I always felt
that it would have been an amazing
tablet they came out with a note 8.0
yeah it failed they're trying to go back
into the tablet space with the s-pen and
so you know I'm like okay isn't there a
way for the note to just go back to what
it was you know what was it it was again
the vanguard phone and I stole that word
from you yeah it was that product that
you had the better life so the note 2
and they know three in one year the note
would feel like it was a whole
generation ahead exactly because it
actually did achieve its purpose right
it had amazing battery life and it also
had the pen yeah so that is the main
reason why ever since the note 2 that
was always my android phone not
necessarily because it was a good phone
I felt that it was a terrible thought I
was too big and too cumbersome and it
was too flimsy know what you want but I
love being able to pull the damp and out
right and actually use it but then ever
since I started using the note 5 no it
was just the Note edge actually which I
never used the note 4 so actually no I
was a note for fanatic the the note 5 is
where we saw Samsung shift and back yeah
and in it was all about trying to create
that pretty first exactly is now exactly
so I don't disagree with you there
but I still feel that what Samsung is
trying to tell us in the way that
they're producing gadgets is this is
what
been selling their phones so for are you
great people like us that I mean we
still the fans well we're totally
besties with multi-billion dollar
companies um so when um when we tend to
rationally look at this sort of
comparative specs and we make hard
decisions I mean we're still appealing
and emotionally and justifying with
rationale after active we just we have
different criteria for what get us
emotionally lit up right now about
different devices now when we're looking
at the way that Samsung was saying these
are the features that are moving
products and that are making people
excited and you know that they're not
playing quite the same thin game as like
Motorola is trying to do right now and I
don't think they're being very
successful with the z2 but it's the same
thing you know actually that's a perfect
example so the Z the Moto G Force Moto
z2 force according to Android
enthusiasts the killer feature of the
Moto C was the bigger battery according
to Motorola the killer feature of a
force is the shatter shield screen so if
they didn't called the Moto Z to force
just the moto g2 and left off the name
force no one would have been cranked all
it would have been is an update to the
thin phone that we have oh and they
added the shatter shield screen to the
thin phone yeah that's an upgrade but
because they called it horse everyone
was focused on the battery and that's
why people got upset and so I think
something similar has a homily with Sam
used on bear in mind the forces so the
force has been the iteration of the max
if there was always the razor Gary's
urbex the razor's open one you have
thick one yes the turbo about what yo
five letters take the perception of the
Moto Z 2 you have an amazing point true
and as Andrew in a very general way I
kind of feel something similar has
happened with Samsung when you call
something a note we had an expectation
of removable batteries business great
durability
extended battery life because of the
larger frame yeah that's not what
Samsung is whatever you know we're all
smart 430 rumors 21st thing was actually
responds to we need pretty phones
because that's what severely gonna fix
us so I mean every single point is
sitting there trying to fix something
when it comes to safe well isn't it but
but almost every company does this thing
where they have to pivot
you can court the geeks and the
enthusiasts to a degree and then after a
point you've got to find a way to go
mass market and I think the Essex was
their imperfect way to pivot to become a
little bit more lifestyle II like Apple
was and then I think they've evolved and
they've improved from there the s7 was a
great year for Samsung it was a great
year you know I'm even sure they're the
note 4 is like this experiment well it
totally was I'm sure that I was an
experiment in it s6 the s6 edge the s6
edge+
and the note 5 they did not know and
look at the regions where they would
sell in s6 edge+
and not a note and by the way Samsung
the reason why your note 4 failed is not
because the phone was bad wait no it's
not because the idea of the phone was
bad it was because the phone was clunky
AF no Ford quite possibly one of the
best phones ever made true story
future tech debate because what I wanted
to go back to those is talk about some
of this
because we had actually a really great
Drive is you know it's almost 1:00 in
the morning it is one of the morning
exactly 1:00 in the morning we have this
great conversation talking about design
yeah and so one of the things that I've
been really impressed with on the honor
nine how flush the glass the glass is
completely unbroken from the back of the
phone to the camera sensor and I was a
little disappointed with the the camera
module bar on the note 8 after the
wonderful work that's been done I really
like it I like it it's like the black
rounded rectangle and I see you either
black or on your choice of deep sea blue
because I steamrollered over you in the
car I would actually like to hear what
why does that stand out for you as a
design accent why so I like composition
when I take photos for example and write
oh I hate the fact that of the essay in
that of the essay in an essay plus even
though they were trying to look for
symmetry in that fingerprint scan oh you
know I think that there it's completely
asymmetrical it's like it's not aligned
with anything and so for me it's like
completely unpleasant to look at the
phone from its back and which is
hilarious because it's completely
symmetrical from the front yak with you
know and then when I grab the the SI
acted like the top bezels are larger
than this from all those things make me
cringe I have that problem and so what I
like about the note is not necessarily I
hate the fact that the fingerprint
scanners that homicide I hate I hate the
fact that they couldn't be smarter about
it
but I feel that the design is
symmetrical it's just so it's basically
places to see they hung the frame
straight yes okay okay
that yes that I can appreciate because
because again I'm looking at this more
from the thickness because it's the
thing that is it consistently impressed
me from the s6 to the s8 was they've
gone thinner they went thinner on the
phone and then you have this lump of a
camera that's stuck out on the s6 and
that was the one of the only phones that
I ever damaged the camera glass because
it's stuck out so are you couldn't put
that phone down
without resting on that camera sensor
you know you get to the SAT and
Samsung's finally sunk this sensor where
it's in the years and +7 the assembly it
still has the mark henick card that pops
out from the back I mean the SAE I mean
you can run your thumb across and only
feel that little bit of a seam yeah from
where the module is housed and how
that's blended with the rest of the
phone I just thought was such a great
mechanical achievement engineering
achievement that then the note 8 is
calling attention to the fact that
there's this separate module and to me
that that makes it look like it stands
out but I can totally see your point
where let me ask is having that bar at
least sort of frame with the exception
of Huawei phones and every other dual
camera smartphone has a terrible
explanation either the iPhone said well
fine so beep fine yeah I agree is
ridiculous
I bowled lakes out ridiculously I'm like
really Jonny it's really bad well yeah
really well and it makes me a little
nervous for the renders that we've seen
that all they've done is rotated it
degree oh my god because the problem the
problem was in the orientation the
problem was the fact that it sticks out
yeah crazy but you know I just want to
miss around people involved actually
from Andrew Wallace it seems that
Samsung is chasing Apple with the zoom
camera instead of going with a
wide-angle or monochrome and color sense
yes and no yes and no so let's go use it
like twenty eight millimeters for the
Apple and then that's a two times R
that's the same but only four okay so I
know I don't talk to mobility but
telephoto yes you're never gonna use it
no you're never going to use it I've not
but baseball games out yes he's not so
hard I'm black but okay the
implementation of portrait is actually
it's very very good yeah so I don't even
okay so why don't I use portrait on the
iPhone number one because no this whole
over it no control over it and you know
and you can't really predict how close
or far you have to be from the subject
and so the moment you switch the
portrait mode you have to eat normally
you're like this because you're used to
the 27 millimeter distance and then it's
like oh my god you're so close you have
to move back and so like it
automatically deters that and have you
gone through that experience where you
see something at the moment and you want
to capture it but you want to capture
what you see yeah you know and then when
you pull the phone out and the phone is
not depicting that messy it feels so so
disappointing
it feels really classic which is the
reason why the g6 is so important the g6
is one of those folks that actually
portrays what you're seeing with the
wide angle and use that field of view
giving you that field of view at the few
vinaya see and so I love the fact that
Samsung doesn't force you to business
portrait live with it it's like take the
photo and if you don't like it you can
always go WOW you can always go guys
regular shot you can't own up or down
it's what I love about rich captured
bear in mind I despised Windows bug I
hated it but I would never leave that on
Lumia 930 oh yeah ever just because of
rich captured there was just no way
there was nothing it was a class of its
own
and and I love like I would be willing
to use portrait mode now with the way
Samsung has it where I can choose well
this is this is what I think is
interesting and I think to Samsung's
credit they've taken my least favorite
dual camera implementation they have
great one of my biggest problems with it
though which was image stabilization on
the zoom sensor true so pitches did you
play with any of the video while we were
you were doing your hands on
like monsoon shootings his little
handheld segments and let him know it's
surprisingly good for it being the less
good sensor right so your image quality
is never going to be less good Atlee
aperture on that on that sensors
atrocious well but that's not so I mean
we're always going to have those
problems with changing the focal length
yeah right so it's never gonna be your
little light solution you're always
gonna have issues there yeah but
hopefully they don't political where it
doesn't even work you know I bet they
will know do that I was cracking with a
certain range I was cracking up over the
comparison of the Sampson was doing in
the presentation yeah cuz those the good
photo looked terrible looks at night and
this is the Gallatin like the telephoto
lens it's not working at night you guys
yeah so it doesn't that's already funny
but it's also like their example of look
at how much better ours is is still like
that looks like any crop zoom camera
sensor they were that they were bold
enough to admit that this was the photo
of the phone yeah whereas other
companies will show you something that
I'm not even a 5d Mark four could pull
off you know and I remember when it was
just that was it just after Microsoft
bought Nokia and they did that oh you
know image stabilization was just to a
sample of image stabilization from a
DSLR advertisement from the Lumia 920
was so embarrassed yeah that was rough
so barren but one of the things that
that made me happy and this is this is
I'm totally in agreement with you here
is so they took my least favorite dual
camera setup but then they added the
control from my favorite dual camera
setup for the toward Allah which is
Huawei so the way that you take the
photo
yeah and really the only reason why I
still I'm still going to give huawei the
edge here is because the way that Huawei
does the bouquet slider
those lines up
with your actual camera apertures like
it's not it's not perfect and again in
software background for employers so
it's all just post-processing but the
fact that they give you those little F
stops you know this is like an F for
this is like an f2 and I want Samsung
could give me just markers so I know
like how much blurred did I put on this
photo should I do less should I do more
and it's just a generic slider I wish I
had some note like yeah even if it was
just a percentage like you know full
background - full blur and you gave me
like 20 percent or 30 percent something
like that I think would be a lot more
helpful um but that's that's again it's
to Samsung's credit that especially in
the United States they're taking this
feature from a player that no one really
knows about but follow am like I still
still think they're ahead of the curve I
do have to agree I do have to agree -
but I've not touched the camera on this
phone because it was too focused on the
s-pen which I have to do for the video
and I also had that be des no - so did
you get tax reticulated let me snap
cameras great I'm here at the events and
I'm just you know I don't know I don't
going back to the topic of the note you
know after you it's funny how much how
little I cared about the prices like the
essential phone
up until I actually which is funny I
actually got this review that has a
funny story which is I was not supposed
to get a review in it but I did it was a
funny story it was the result the result
of being at the right place at the right
time but you know I didn't hold the
beatniks
late right ever I had never experienced
it it was like to actually hold the
phone
like in the case of the g6 it's the
whole concept of larger you know larger
screen over smaller frame yeah but it's
not you know it's a taller display of
that plays with surface area but you're
not really we've done that yeah we've
done that whether it is literally more
surface area in a phone line whereas the
essential phone is like the true
embodiment of a large display or small
and then using titanium and ceramic to
be able to make the phone sturdy enough
to withstand the frame that's needed for
this I'm going 5.7 inches oh I see what
you're saying especially because of the
top bezel sinking and so yeah so you
know there are literally you guys can't
see on this crappy webcam I don't know
why I'm on this whirring no keep trying
and so I going back to the topic of the
note I love the whole concept yes you do
need a large canvas on a note phone if
you want them to replace a note pad it's
just this is the for me this is the
future like true note bezels whereas we
still have vessels to a certain degree
with it with a note and obviously that's
for Apple is pointing with the rumours
of the iPhone 8 now I mean what's funny
though is you instantly ran into the
compromise of having no forehead bezel
when we tried to do a phone call test
yeah and you still need you mean we're
fighting physics it's some more room to
put like a speaker it's just it's like
if it was a full tweeter no yeah you
know what what because I don't want to
be that guy's ago it's not if it's not
perfect it's not worth it you know like
I really get frustrated by those kinds
of conversations do Bert do Berger you
know like no really you just need to
know that that could be a compromising
last week - no there's no Motorola it's
not gonna sound like like an echo
chamber or anything but I think what's
frustrating is throughout our tech
career I feel like every single one of
these concerns has had a solution so
what if you had the vibration bone
conduct tissue conduction screen of a
Kyocera kisser oh yeah you wouldn't have
to worry about whether or not you had
you dedicated to space to the gritty
remember you I've never heard of phone
call for bone conduction no how about
you use the aftershocks cited all over
their convention
because email issues with fidelity you
know it's not gonna be the highest
quality audio experience but the
Brigadier was loud and again the whole
point of that phone was like you might
be on a job construction site you know
moving heavy machinery so you're mashing
this phone up against the side of your
face and it's sending audio through
waves in the air and kind of jiggling
the soft tissue of your face to help
reinforce that audio I thought it worked
phenomenally well I'd only one side your
face until just forcing your brain over
to you
so I don't know I mean do you really
think and you know the price tag the
legacy problems with the no7 and the
rumors of the iPhone 8 I mean if the
iPhone is truly what we've seen in
photos like we are talking about
essential foam on steroids like
essential phone has a bezel at the
bottom and a weird camera loop at the
top yeah this is apparently zip like
nothing four millimeter business trying
to do the math in like a fraction of a
second but that's that's the biggest
question is open
obviously the note is gonna sell like
hotcakes because it's you know it's a
note but is it going to truly dent what
Apple is doing which is literally
leapfrogging everything no in fact I
really think that the note is gonna help
reinforce what Apple is doing if one
just from the conversation of price
points that we can now as phrase yes we
can escalate the price to Apple will be
that company even though so many
manufacturers are playing with different
form factors taller aspect ratios higher
resolution displays when Apple does it
that'll validate those moves for a
number of consumers and apples number
first and apples never first but I think
Apple also has an opportunity to shake
up the market in other ways not that we
want to drift too much on this pie
tasks but the work they're doing with AR
and VR the AR KITT developer life is
crazy compelling and it's not like Apple
to be ahead that's one thing they also
show the reverse the day of their 3d
sensing yeah camera it's like according
to according to KGI
their evaluation according to their
evaluation that seems that the
technology that Apple has will take
competitors at least two years to be
able to mimic namely Qualcomm and that
is mostly because they're waiting to see
what Apple is if Apple can be successful
and by that point it'll take two years
for them to actually real just think
about it I mean how how cool is this
thing after B to be able to replace such
ID
I mean touch ID literally touch anything
was not the first fingerprint scan and
then hassle about the backbone of
basically every future fingerprint
scanner the HP the HP 55 or Mindy yes
that was my first fingerprint scanner
then we got this Motorola I think it was
the Droid 2 when there were city tricks
in there too but the Atrix didn't have a
fingerprint scanner no there was there
was a nature there was one Atrix that
had it on the back
okay of the top I'm going in any case
the one thing that is the big ask for
any Apple consumer is to have to you
know wake up in the morning and put
their phone to their face instead of you
know finding it and actually you know
hitting the touch ID button and then
yeah I gave up on iris unlock on my si+
just because I would rather have the
phone unlocked I've had as I'm holding
it really because this is my behavior
this is so the the sa back that is so
flush yeah so flush but my typical
behavior every time that I unlock this
phone is doing this this is terrible
it's well Samsung's implementation of it
is the works for the most part but
especially like you know you pick up a
meet 19 and as you're pulling this
humongous phone out of your pocket it's
already unlocked you haven't held it up
to your case if T&amp;amp;G six you know again
is a perfect example of I want the phone
screen unlocked and ready to use before
my eyes have locked on to it so I
completely agree with your point for
something like that but what I think is
gonna be really compelling though is if
this 3d sensing technology apples
working on really does leapfrog project
tango an apple becomes that for service
where we're really starting to interact
with reality with data and services
Apple could then move forward on markets
like the problems we have with
automobiles in a really compelling way
because Google really hasn't moved the
needle much on that kind of interaction
and then companies like Samsung
I just don't think on Talent and I find
that if you're starting the industry and
I find that interesting that you don't
need a special phone for that to work
that sounds I don't you know one oboe
fat sounds like you're saying that all
these people through these you know and
the trickle-down firms that you know you
supply them the software you supply them
all the parts that and they provide the
services to you know I don't think you
know Apple could almost a first-party
hardware but you know it seems it sounds
like that you can transfer transition
them into a role of being like a model
like a Microsoft Surface and well know
the reason why I think Apple is the
compelling solution in this space is
because they have to developer toolkit
that people are really gravitating
towards if you don't have developers on
board that you don't have services and
it doesn't matter how fancy your camera
array is your sand we're a fab to go or
your fab to you bro I find that they
never going to mean like a are is fun
but like man I want to bring a board on
on a fab to pro yeah it's big enough
it's like the size of my foot and true
story rarely alive it's not it's not the
same size in my place it's big but it's
not that
Brett it's bigger than you I mean like
let's let's kind of put a pin in no date
let's actually kind of just wrap up our
thoughts I'm totally with you I think
the biggest concern of the phone from a
tax standpoint is slightly smaller
battery than si plus I do think that
that is going to be a lifestyle problem
but I feel like consumers it's something
that consumers complain about and they
never really seems to influence their
purchasing decision okay so how many
people in your circle of family and
friends like ah my iPhone just doesn't
get the same battery life that it yes -
better keep buying my phones it's just
you know these companies have listened
marketing is probably one of the most
important discoveries in human history
they're influencing I think that I am
not over exaggerating the importance of
marketing and written life like it's
it's insane how much buying sessions are
determined not in sometimes it's not
necessarily I mean I know a presidential
candidate that wanted elections not
necessarily because of good publicity it
was just because there was so much buzz
around the idea that winning I mean it's
no news right over there we couldn't do
it so listen I mean listen they could
think about how Sampson handled the
launch of the s8 all of us had a phone
like they distributed this like in the
past getting review units from Samsung
was a like ever since after the note2
it's like insane remembered no to was
galaxy s3s three was I think my last
good yeah Samson and so then afterwards
it's like the company became really
stuck up they kind of still are but
they're not as bad they're not as bad
and they're looking they're moons but
but but it was so difficult to get
phones from them it was so difficult to
get you know and we were an emerging
Channel we weren't emerging
it was difficult and you know we would
completely get ignored who have to buy
the phones and you know door jobs but
you know in the case of the SA and I was
like they reached out to everybody you
wanted to say you want to say and so
obviously the more you get people to
talk about the phone the more it becomes
a motive most of this is a Spanish word
yeah but it becomes like the it's like
going on Subway noticing that everybody
has an iPhone yeah and so right now with
us everybody it's funny I the other the
first time that I met SAFF and we met up
with a group of youtubers everybody had
an s7 edge yeah but we were just geeks
and now in the case of the s8 big want
to create that appeal where everybody
has an essay and they achieved it to a
certain degree they did really so you
can't it's very difficult for you to
compete with with the marketing machine
because when you're competing with his
influence and you know if you sit down
with ten of your friends two of them
probably just one will have an educated
will make the decision on a phone based
on an educated decision you know is this
really the phone for me whereas the rest
of the people I mean I can give you so
many cases of products that I consume
mainly because I watch TV commercials
when I was a kid I mean think about the
popular the popularity that Apple has
today it had a lot to do with the fact
that a lot of these kids were using
Apple's whose when they were children a
lot and then ylabel again a marketing
machine that's been affected since the
early eighties exactly I mean we see
that effect and I've seen that effect in
so many of both products I even see that
inside football teams like FC Barcelona
like like the result if CMOS said on
today as the result of something that
started in 1989 you know it wasn't
processed
yeah that ended up becoming a
culmination today and so the same goes
with marketing these companies are
extremely aggressive not necessarily
just in creating mindshare from older
consumers but also in the younger crowd
that will eventually become a consumer I
mean what are we we cater to a very
crowd as much as we cater to - you know
- amid the Generation X crowd right and
so the more we have the phone and we
show off that we use the phone and
except this is just a new way to reach
consumers through BTL marketing which is
below the line and you know what going
back to your question is the no date you
know what will the I mean it's hard to
say that Samsung is not going to succeed
because their marketing power is insane
yeah would I consider the noting to be a
great phone from an educated perspective
uh it doesn't do it for you no it does
okay just listen this is I'll give you
I'll give you a little turnover I'll
give you a little tip over how I review
phones
I am very pushy about review guides
review guides for me are very important
or a big part of keynotes
yeah usually people ignore presentations
whenever were pre-breathe because we
already saw the phone we already filmed
everything we wanted we just don't have
peace the video but I like to be part of
keynotes because I like to see what the
promise behind the product is yeah what
are you trying to sell to me in that can
you really deliver what and so the
question is do you really want to talk
yeah and so does the note 8 really
replace about that and is it really a
productivity tool for me my answer would
be that the note 3 did a better job in
that in particular I'm not trying to
subtract anything from the phone it's a
gorgeous display amazing build quality
it's a great camera and it didn't even
need the secondary lens to be a green no
you know it's it's got it's it's an
amazing phone on its own is it surely a
productivity tool that will help you do
more you know it's it's there you can
use some of these features but will
these really help you solve daily needs
not necessarily at least for me right I
know your user scenario is different you
know so it really depends on the
consumer so I think and again because
again I completely agree with you
except for the note 3 the note 4 was
quite possibly my best the best phone
no cases they're half as good okay
hahaha
or are you it's the note 4 plus the note
3 well that's no good
it's actually 3 but this is this is also
why it why I think Samsung is is likely
to see that dip over this these next two
fiscal quarters where the note can't
nominate well I use this race is the
power of the note waning because who is
Samsung going up against at the end of
this year yeah but possibly the only
company that really does give them a run
for their money in terms of marketing
agree and probably the company that has
done the best job of making their
consumers lifestyle consumers not geeky
techie yeah consumers that's that's
dirty in general consumer less and if
anything they've done an amazing job and
making geeky techie consumers enjoy the
concept of lifestyle dialogues they
consume totally I mean just playing this
this this last year of Apple
advertisements has been phenomenal
content I keep pointing to the bicycle
in the rain ad for the iPhone 7 yes
waterproofing not a big deal
lots of phones have water resistance
ratings before the iPhone came out and
yet you watch that commercial and you
have that ECDC pumping in the background
opening the garage doors thunderstorms
pouring down in the early Elle's yes
that's rad it doesn't matter what the
phone is your scale it up and you've got
your pulse rate going so you've got that
internationally we've got a resurgent
qua way again coming out May 10 and what
do we see from Google but Google is
starting to make their pivot into more
consumer oriented territory so I don't
think the pixel 2 is really gonna upset
note specifically no but this is the
second year if pixel 2 proves to be a
solid device this is where consumers
start paying attention to Google as a
brand because pixel had way more buzz
than it really deserved yes and it was
because Google was finally talking
directly to consumers not making a
developer phone that's when the Nexus
was and what is
Nexxus geeky techie that's dirty nubs
pixel well that's totally exactly the
same without a saga which is hilarious
Lily's over here the pixel is the Nexus
one was far better looking than the
pixel no I don't like the pixel but I
probably take it over Nexus 5 and and by
the way like so I get your point over
the pixel and the essential clone is
probably the reason why I like using
this phone most yeah is because it feels
like a pixel it does not look like a
pixel yeah so it fixes everything that I
did and I know I set the camera yeah I
can't raise the burner yeah clip regula
yeah well no I mean like the pixel
camera even with the ring okay is a much
better experience that's the the
essential phone camera right now it's so
in need of a software update but you
know you've been shooting at the bar at
night and then holding it right up next
to an honor and be like how much easier
it was to get a good because I could get
a good shot I'll be an essential with
patients with patients whereas like it
was just like a couple like flip flip
flip flip flip on my honor and I pay
like a much better photo
life's too bad essential phone
that's your marketing campaign life's
too fast bouncing RNA is not a it's not
a stepping stone against other volunteer
we're not talking about this against the
pixel to you because we don't have it to
compare with the same thing for that
iPhone 8 if you feel like that you want
it now and you feel it that it has made
an appeal to you then you should do the
appropriate course and save up and bias
or you know that's your mood you don't
feel like
convinced you at this point and you know
you've got the rest of 2017 with out
either
I know for something to turn to you can
borrow for quite possibly the best would
buy by mid Ranger or whatever and you
know you'll be much I want to celebrates
the passing mention of and rinoa Oreo
not sober so what you can't really see
very well on this webcam and for anyone
who's listening is a cool that's one
went out of his way to get the mint
oreos so it's an Android green so
officially the name of the the next
generation of Android operating system
is already on taste very minty
it is quite minty there is a little bit
kind of a toothpaste flavor so there you
