michael behind the camera still with us
use and this is a short comparison
between the assumes pad phone
- and the Asuza Padfone infinity 2013
2013 vs. 2012 stay tuned for this so we
have the assist bad film - on the left
and the bat-phone infinity on the right
2012 2013 and there are a couple of
differences between these as the suits
evolves from one version to the other
well we have a 4.7 inch 720p screen on
last year's model we have now a 5 inch
full HD screen on a 2013 model of course
the 2012 model is powered by a dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s2 processor
clocking at 1.5 gigahertz well we have
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor
right here in the 2013 version clocking
at one point 60 Hertz as far as memory
is concerned you get 2 gigabytes of
memory on both of these and the old pad
phone is rocking a micro SIM card while
the new pad phone has adopted the nanos
now holding these in your hand while
both individually feel good
the Padfone infinity from this year
feels much better and that is because it
is made of aluminum and this one is made
of plastic even though it is textured
and it's not slippery at all it's just
aluminum feels much much better and
while we're at the back 13 megapixel
camera on last year's model 13 megapixel
camera on this year's model - even
though the aperture rating is much
better so you want to prefer this one
over the last model now going to the
bottom not much else has changed here
got NFC on both of them the antenna is
right here on the lower side of it if
you come to get a sense of how thick
they are
the Batphone - feels thinner in the hand
because it's more tapered as you can see
here but that's just your illusion
because the Padfone infinity is actually
a slimmer and if we get a sense of
tallness I'm trying to stack it up like
this
the Padfone infinity is that's this much
taller than last year's model and it's
also this much wider so as far as the
operating system is concerned both are
running Android
is on 4.1.1 probably will get the 4.1.2
update this is already running on 4.1.2
we wish we seen 4.2 but maybe an upgrade
to key lime pie is in place this was a
short short comparison between the 2013
the zoo's Batphone infinity and the 2012
as soon as path 1 2 was Anton Michael
behind the camera pocket now 2013 MWC
thank you very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
