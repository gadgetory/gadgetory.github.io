weekly hello and welcome to episode 01
seven of the pocket now weekly the
once-a-week podcast from pocketnow.com
where we discuss what's hot and what's
cool in the world of mobile technology
Windows Android iPhone and sometimes
even blackberry I'm your host Michael
Fisher senior editor at pocket now and
I'm joined by our managing editor and
Tandy Naja good afternoon to you sir
good morning everybody good morning
around the world and good morning post

I absolutely love it I love love love
that you Joe and I had a conversation
off online the other day and I Joe is
like I'll help you out with this html5
thing but I got to go out and finish
building this chicken coop I'm like you
know that is so far removed from my
experience that I want to hear more
about that pretty much every day so Joe
I can't wait to have lunch with you like
you you recently had with a fan right
you did I did I did I got to to go out
to lunch with a fan from Poland and his
his father and his father's friend we

restaurant yes and of course the
Romanian
as was his want spoke Italian and speaks
everything under the Sun it's close it's
all evens closely Romanian as well it
was great well anyway um I shall look
forward to to meeting you someday Joe in
person and and and and and and seeing
your chicken coop and I will bring I was
bring your uh I will bring my combat
collection to you that'll be awesome
we're gonna talk about that later these
we are gonna talk about that a little
later in the episode but first let's
jump into our tour Brandon minimum named
thought thread Brandon is off today but
his thought thread remains as it always
does at the top of the the podcast we
had a story recently actually written by
Joe and disc mentioned to me by Tony
that we should probably talk about on a
podcast about the new dmca smartphone
and tablet exemptions these are legal
parameters that govern licensing if
you're not familiar listeners for music
and digital content Joe the first sub
head of your article says what does any
of this have to do with smartphones and
tablets I'm you said it better than me
fill us in on what's going on here well
a little bit more background this is
something that I wanted to talk about
and I had to fight Steven for it in fact
we had it split up so we were going to
do a collaborative article but some
hurricane or something Nix that so you
just got my perspective the DMCA a lot
of people think that the DMCA is just an
American thing it's just us and yes it
is a US law it stands for the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act it was actually
sponsored introduced and RAM rotted
through the Senate by my very own
senator orrin hatch out here in Utah
really I you gotta so proud no I am he
said that he was doing this for the
recording artist because he was one
because he he writes music and has like
two or three albums that really are not
that great but but it was for him and
his family people like him in the state
of Utah but this applies not only to
in the States but also to our
international friends because the DMCA
was essentially the roll up of two
treaties that came from the world
intellectual property organization which
I politely called the whip oh and so
they rolled up these international
treaties into US law it's not the legal
way to do things in the US but we're not
going to talk politics what this does
essentially is it takes the Copyright
Act which we've had since way back in
nineteen seventy-six which essentially
says you can't copy stuff that's not
yours and sell it make profit with it
use it without the owner's consent
except in these very few fair use
scenarios right know if it's personal
use if you're making a personal backup
or an archive if you're using it for
education for example that's fair use or
if you're making a parody that's where
we got weird al yankovic from because
it's bitch parody it's funny all fair
use the DMCA try to apply that or try to
bring the Copyright Act into modern
technologies into an Internet era where
people were well this came about mainly
because of Napster and kazaa and
limewire and all those other sharing
sites where you'd rip your music to mp3
share a folder and then anyone in the
world could download your version of
Metallica's Enter Sandman and well then
at that point you were distributing
content that you didn't have a license
to distribute it wasn't yours to give
away you know you're giving away a copy
of it so this law applied to that
unfortunately there's a little teeny bit
that said not only can you not copy
stuff you can't break any type of an
encryption schema right in Grenada
prevents which normally would prevent
copying yeah it attempts to yeah but not
only that you couldn't even attempt to
circumvent that encryption schema right
now that means all of our DVDs and all
of our blu rays which we didn't have
when this task but we do now all of
those are encrypted so if you want to
make a backup copy that I don't know put
on your Windows 8 tablet now
or your Android or your iPhone well you
can't do that because you're breaking an
encryption schema so how does that apply
to smartphones and tablets smartphones
and tablets usually come locked from the
manufacturer so attempting to lock that
is arguably unlawful or attempted to
unmil yeah attempting to unlock that
lock yes so that wasn't a problem when
the librarian of Congress carved out a
little exemption for smartphones a
couple of years back and said hey we
agree you should be able to unlock your
smartphone so you can take it to another
carrier or install other apps on it or
whatnot so librarian of Congress carved
down an exemption for us everything was
great well since then we've had tablets
come and that exemption didn't apply and
still doesn't apply to tablets and now
they've revamped the whole thing all
over again library and if Congress says
yes unlocking phones is just fine but
only until January 2013 after that no
more unlucky what is it up for a vote
after that or is it just is it just
forbidden after that I mean what's the
deal it's it is just forbidden after
that until it comes up for review again
and i believe it's every three years
every four years he does they come up
for review so I so that there's a
there's a world that that might exist in
the near future we're unlocking your
phone is is unlawful because you're
breaking encryption and that world
exists for every smartphone purchased
after January of 2013 well that that
would be that would be not any fun at
all I like there's there's a point
listeners if you haven't read the
article is where Jojo makes the analogy
that we're getting to the point where
ownership is nothing more than a license
to use and that license can describe how
and where we use what we've purchased
it's like saying you can't use the milk
you bought to bake bread and make a
sandwich from it instead you have to buy
your sandwich from someone licensed to
sell you one that is not true and I will
disagree with you all right now Tony I
know you had a lot to say on this yeah
I'm I have so many things to say I don't
know where to begin but let's begin with
your particular example
I know the main comment everybody will
bring up is that I purchase the phone
the phone is mine I should be able to do
with it whatever I want now we have to
make a difference between the phone
itself which is the object the plastic
the glass and the software while you
definitely own the plastic the object
itself you do not own the software as
with most licensing terms the software
is not your property the software is the
there copyright owner's property and you
have the right to use that particular
software under the terms of the end-user
license agreement so your particular
example does not apply with the milk I
understand what you're trying to say but
in this particular case we are looking
at a intellectual creation intellectual
work which is yours to use for instance
when you go to a hotel and you check in
for three nights you have the right to
use the room but you have no property
rights on any objects within that room
so this is this is for for for that part
of the discussion now I know that people
want to do hex and tweaks and mods and
stuff like that let me start this off
with an example there's there's there's
your phone and there's your software and
they're this thing which is the security
which is either the bootloader or the
the lack of routing capabilities which
is the barrier between you and the
software let's imagine this when you go
and try to break in to your neighbor's
house you open the door you don't enter
his house you don't steal anything from
his house you are still committing a
crime even attempting to open a door
which is not yours with a key is also a
crime so in this particular example
attempting to unlock a phone is or was
considered a crime de facto so the key
takeaway here how should I put this in
into both non legal terms and English
that
we can get back always and we need to
get back always to the fear use of the
intended software what is fair use the
user can only unlock his phone under the
limits of the fair usage the phone was
not intended to be tinkered with in
terms of flashing roms Android might be
an open source and free up to an extent
the software bit but it is in any case
protected by an end user license
agreement so if you have any comments on
what I just said up until now that's why
I'm well out of my depth Joe well and I
agree the the statement that I was
making about baking the bread was you
know obviously an extreme edge case but
it seems to be the direction that we're
heading with Android particularly once i
have my my hardware unless it's the
geeks phone which is meant to be running
custom custom roms on it but once i have
that it essentially is just a computer
in my pocket i should be able to do as I
please and this is where our opinions
are going to diverge if I want to for
example my desktop computer if I want to
install windows 7 on it I can as I has
analyzed were absolutely right if i want
to install linux on it i can if i want
to write my own operating system and put
it on it I can with my android powered
device if I want to run cyanogenmod on
my galaxy nexus I can that's okay know
that that's again that's where you can't
because cyanogenmod is a version of
Android which is not covered covered by
your license agreement when you purchase
the android phone which you are holding
right now the fraction of the price of
that phone was the license of the
software and the costs for other
licenses between Microsoft and the OEMs
Microsoft that or any other trade mark
mark owner and Google so that particular
fraction of the price does not apply to
another copy of Android which is in my
opinion
illegal within South cyanogenmod I for
the Google Apps part of the discussion
not the operating system you're correct
for for the AOSP Android the operating
system is open source it's available for
anybody who wants to get it and and
build a copy and put it on their device
so yeah and it's not went the rounds
with Google and eventually came to a
nice settlement said yes you're just
fine distributing Android as cyanogenmod
but you cannot distribute the google
apps or gaps is a link to come because
you haven't bought a license for that
correct yeah so as far as that goes yes
I can put that on my device unless and
this is where the DMCA comes in unless
my device manufacturer whether on their
own or at the requirement of their
carrier has locked that bootloader so
that they are trying to prohibit me from
doing that arguably that is
circumventing a quote unquote copy
protection scheme which I still don't
think it is to try and put something
else on it that's what is interesting to
me about this whole thing that that this
there's this copy protection scheme
argument has been applied to something
you know it was originally written for
to protect copyright to protect creative
content not necessarily operating
systems but it has been applied
seemingly across a great divide to two
operating systems and I don't know why
why that is and why that's possible let
me tell you why it well it doesn't
really make a lot of sense mate please
tell me why as Joe implied Android yes
it is free when we were talking about
pure vanilla Android as Google intended
it to be but when you purchase a film
from any and every OEM out there that's
not vanilla you get samsung / HTC /
motorola copyrighted materials on that
whether we're talking about the launcher
an application for any yet or anything
which was baked into
operating system and the lock the
bootloader locking procedure is
protecting that bit of copyright on your
phone well I get that I mean that yeah
you know it's I i would like to I would
I think that you guys have made some
some awesome points in each camp I tend
to get very very cautious when I'm
dealing with this kind of stuff because
it is it's just so it's confusing it's
also get one of those matters that is
confusing but it's also really easy to
get indignant about it because you know
you're being told how to how to use
something that whether it's legally true
or not yes you you feel like you bought
and you should be able to drive your car
that you bought where you want or
whatever that's a stupid analogy it's
early in the morning is you but I just
want to say something I'll wrap it up
that's what i was getting in toad like I
don't want you to have a minute to wrap
up I don't want to minimalize or
minimize the the law itself because
that's what I've learned that's what I
know how what to do when I know how to
respect the law but we have a saying
here in Romania i'm going to only tell
you the translation and it goes like
this an uncut thief is an honest seller
or somebody an honest commercial so the
thing is until you're not caught you can
do whatever you want all those people
who are downloading torrents and
cheering music and stuff all the illegal
stuff are not behind bars so there's no
police which is looking actively whether
you jailbreak your phone at night on
your computer or not I think the bigger
picture here is that when an OEM or
carrier decides to lock a phone it is
because they don't want to deal with the
boast hacking support when somebody or
something which they apply goes wrong
and then everybody asks for a refund or
replacement off of the unit itself
beyond the pickle copyright protection a
discussion or idea jodi of a final note
out there yeah i think that we're
definitely going
erection that I don't think is the best
direction for us to be headed if i buy
again my computer and want to even if it
comes with Windows pre-loaded on it and
I've paid a license for something that
I'm not going to use because i'm going
to throw linux on it i should be able to
do that no one should be able to to take
that capability away from me whether
technologically or lawfully whatever the
law says that that just ain't right so
as soon as and you know being kind of a
gun guy on the side one of the sayings
in in that camp is if you make it a
crime to own a gun only criminals will
own guns so if you make it a crime to
root and put custom roms on your phone
well then only criminals are going to do
that because you've made it a crime it
inherently isn't damaging anyone to
Tony's point if I brick my phone and I
try and take it back for warranty
replacement they got ways of telling you
know what you unlock the bootloader you
avoided your warranty doing that that
was the chance that you took that was
the assumption of risk that you took and
in every one of our articles where we
talked about doing that step zero is
always assume the risk you might break
things here doing it right doing it
wrong aliens coming down and doing
something to your phone in the sleet in
your sleep whatever the case may be
you're taking that chance because you
can because it's yours to take that
chance with yeah but what what I'm
trying to say here and I'm gonna wrap it
up right now just with this last
observation is that they are trying and
I think rightfully trying to stop people
from and I'm gonna give you just an
example from the top of my head to port
I don't know TouchWiz from a Samsung
device to an HTC device or stopping them
from porting nokia drive from a Lumia
920 to and HTC windows phone 8x so this
is probably the the amount and the exact
protection which they are trying to
impose agreed absolutely but using that
same logic we need to outlaw copy
jeans because you can copy books with
them absolutely there is that onion vcrs
as well which started off this whole
this whole copyright discussion really
or Betamax machines in the 70 yeah we
could go on forever ago we could have a
whole podcast about this and I would
probably not stay awake throughout it
and I loved hearing I do love here in
the discussion I think it's right very
important to the future of the industry
um we will be covering more of this
stuff as it as it happens I mean a joke
considering your input regarding when
the stuff comes up for votes and and you
know and certain expiration dates on
some of this stuff I don't think we've
heard the last of this particular
specific oh yeah and we didn't live up
the didn't answer the question why it's
a blitz are not exempted from from this
is if i'm reading this right is that and
i'm going to quote from the document if
i can find the quote itself is that the
register found significant married to
the opposition's concerns that this
respect of the purpose glass was brought
an ill defended as a wide range of
devices might be considered tablets
notwithstanding the signification
distinctions among them in terms of the
way they operate their intended purpose
and the nature of the applications blah
blah blah silly i just fell asleep it
just happened yeah so the basic idea is
that they are not allowing tablets
because the tablet is a broad concept
and you can consider tablets both the
ipad which could be jailbreakable but
also an e-book reader which you if you
could jailbreak you could then infringe
on copyright of its contents which in
this case our books right that's running
the same OS as a smartphone like this is
why we have so much trouble with yes but
you can Icarus is different so it's all
about the intended use sure then this is
different which is which is just
ridiculous to me i mean it's like it's
like ice I I run into a storefront and I
do property damage with the mazda miata
or i do it with a school bus uh I should
be I should be charged the same
regardless I don't know hey you know
whatever you know what actually in this
particular example you're probably will
not know I you're probably right I don't
you know what you know it's funny you
know what's a key sign of
me not fully grasping the concept is
that I make bad analogies I think the
most interesting thing about this to me
like this is the most interesting part
about it we still don't know how to
treat tablets in a legal sense yeah you
know in a literal sense I mean we
there's still this kind of product that
not a lot of people get millions and
millions of people owned them but
broadly we don't really know what they
are you know it still and took a thing
you Michael popular exactly to confirm
what you're saying and the quote from
the same document for example and quote
an ebook reading device might be
considered a tablet as might a handheld
video game device or a laptop computer
right you sorry yeah go ahead yeah so
the reason for that as i'm reading the
all the legal mumbo jumbo and listeners
we do this so you don't have to imagine
all the hours that went into researching
this so you don't have to you can thank
us later but the reason for the
exemption now or at least place the
temporary exemption for smartphones and
not tablets was for for being able to
move your your phone to another carrier
it was carrier portability if i go out
and buy an iphone for example and i want
to use not to mold in a different
carrier yeah i can do that and in fact i
can still do that until january 2013 you
will be able to do that even after that
if the carrier agreed if the carrier
degrees and that is also specifically
outlined if you want to unlock for the
purpose of portability your smart phone
or any phone really to another carrier
you have to do it at a carrier so the
carrier shouldn't be able to refuse you
on this because the intended purpose of
usage is the same you you have the
freedom to move your product to any a
service provider in the world so I don't
know you see that's not an argument
don't know if I agree with because if
you're a carrier I understand that it's
stupid and it's really annoying when it
carriers like no we won't support that
device on our network because we haven't
tested it and it's a total BS excuse
they they don't want to spend the
customer service hours necessary
support you on an unsupported device
that I want to train their said there's
a whole lot of reasons that they do it
but you know you if you own a business
even if it is a massive conglomerate
with a nationwide wireless network you
should be able to say I don't want that
on my network and you know if I want to
be a crotchety old dude about it then
I'm gonna be you know what I mean like
that that that's you should be able to
do that if you want to be if you want to
be a jerk you should be yeah but it's
not about it's not about the second
carrier accepting the phone it's about
the first carrier you're letting the
phone go oh is that what you're talking
about yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah can we
talk about something else yeah something
more exciting at least for you guys
thank you wake up if you fell asleep
wake up how is the really i'm gonna put
I'm gonna time codes on all these no no
sir but it is important i don't mean a
minimal as it it's just it's just really
really really dense but on exactly 17
strikes at the heart that look at this
our elected officials are appointed
officials don't get technology it's up
to us right to be vocal and to let them
know hey you guys this is just crazy and
we're gonna educate we're gonna do that
as part of our charter pocket now and
it's not gonna be as long and boring as
we've just made it well and depending on
you where your interests lie this will
either be just as boring or exactly not
as boring i had a opportunity yesterday
to talk to a guy I know what you're
talking about the no yeah I'm gonna just
wait in when you finish this with one
sentence and I gonna let you guys don't
say Tony's gonna like tenes gonna go
like have himself a sandwich and come
back when we're done but only East
licensed to do so from the milk right
exactly no I I had an opportunity to
talk talk to a gentleman yesterday
called Charles crim stock who is an
inventor and technology advocate who
makes his home in California and who
asked himself the simple question one
day because he hates bluetooth headsets
and he said why can't I just wear a
speakerphone I use the Serie in my car
all the time because I have a bluetooth
connection my car I would like to be
able to to have that utility out and
about without having to hold my phone
but I hate bluetooth earpieces
now ordinarily you know I think that's
an interesting idea but it wouldn't have
have been as interesting if he hadn't
also said at the same time why don't I
call it combadge and why don't I draw my
inspiration for this wearable
speakerphone from a from the small
communicator badges worn on on Star Trek
The Next Generation and that caught my
attention so I wanted to know who who
was behind this tiny tiny tiny speaker
phone that you wear on your shirt or you
wear on a lanyard so I contacted him he
was gracious enough to give us to give
me an interview and we talked for a good
long while about about where it you know
where the idea for comm badge came from
and and how he's trying to raise money
for it and all this kind of stuff so the
article is up on the site right now I
went up this morning listeners if you
want to check it out you should the the
product is called combadge comm badg e
and Charles is trying to raise 100 grand
on on IndieGoGo and we'll see if he
makes it or not but I eat I know what
Tony thinks about this and Joe I feel
like I might know what you think about
this because you are the only well
besides Steven you're the only other
real Star Trek fan on the on the team Oh
No and Adam to e where's Adam Scott a
unit has got a committee alright I'm
sorry Adam I didn't mean to let me just
say my one sentence and you guys don't
guess can't even wait just like what
what is this BS go ahead too so I was
literally asking Michael this morning
about this badge thing and I'm like okay
I don't want everybody to listen in on
my calls I prefer my standard bluetooth
handset headset and Michael like was
like okay did you don't get it it's the
Star Trek thing and I was like ah ok
I've never seen an episode so it's
probably gotta be a us thing and that
that's that's all my take on this so you
guys not gets a little bit so okay so it
for voice communication I agree it's
it's that's one of the things that we
all thought was cool in the late 80s
Early 90s when we were watching Star
Trek The Next Generation it's like oh
sweet the communicator is part of their
badge but every one of your calls as a
speaker phone call we started thinking
as as this logic start of you know sort
of infested our brains it's like
I would you really want to have all your
calls just kind of heard out loud and
yeah of course that's a that's a
negative aspect to it and you're just
going to annoy so many people so many
more people than even the push-to-talk
aficionados of about a decade ago did
but um the emphasis that Charles really
really points to to Siri and like
digital assistants and stuff and it's
less about for him it's less about
conversations and more about let's use
the voice features of google now and
Siri and similar services and so that
you don't have to take your phone out of
your pocket as often and it so in that
way it's kind of an I wish I'd said this
in the article it's kind of like a
pebble smartwatch or a SmartWatch for
you know for your ears you know what I
mean and instead of but it does not this
Borg like Bluetooth headset you have to
plug into your head I I basically I
think it's a cool idea i think i think
more choice and communication is cool
which is why i think it's it's good and
it's why i hope it takes off besides the
fact that i'm a nerd Joe can you put
aside any of your any of your Star Trek
feelings to have a real opinion on this
are you going to be like me and just
kind of try and justify it no matter
what because you want a badge that talks
to oh I'll hold my geek back a little
bit I've got three things that come to
mind when I'm looking at this first of
all for those of you who are thinking
hey I don't want my my conversations
made public by wearing this speaker
phone if you're using bluetooth you're
already doing it if you're using your
phone in public we can hear you we know
what you're saying we can hear half of
the conversation already which is more
this just lets us in higher the other
half no big deal just won't move up move
on this second observation that I have
is my kids in elementary school and I
believe across the street at the junior
high as well I've got a junior high aged
kit it's scary they all wear these
things which go to the article if you're
not there right now go to the article
and look at it this is a nice round
somewhat thick compared to the Star Trek
communicator badge right but little
thing we get the washer it's it's time
oh yeah you'll get smaller technology's
gonna bring a smaller you need it it's
already my kids school they have this
much larger thing that they wear on a
lanyard around their neck that also
incorporates their their photo ID and
whatnot they're smart chip to to let
them in the doors but that is a an
internal communicator that they use
throughout the school so instead of
pushing a button and talking over the
loudspeaker in the classroom you know
mrs. so and so you know so and so's dad
is here to pick him up they can push a
button and talk immediately with the
thing around the teachers neck so they
can immediately get ahold of them
whether they're in the classroom or on
the playground or like we're vocera like
VoIP communicators that that they were
on that you wear on your lapel they have
powered by Wi-Fi or something I've
probably always wiggle battery in the
back of it I know yeah yeah so good but
my third observation goes to something
that a friend of mine just came back
from China and of course when you're in
China you see all of these cool devices
that aren't in the US and one of the
things that they brought back was a GSM
cell phone watch and it's a big hunk and
watch but it's no bigger than this comm
badges and it's a full cell phone inside
a watch housing yeah reception is
probably pretty crappy and it made our
our Wall of shame at work where we have
all of our old crack damaged
non-functional cell phones because
production quality wasn't that great and
ever since all the charge yeah so it was
a you know one time you cell phone watch
brought back from China right where we
can do that with the phone itself it
doesn't have to be a Bluetooth accessory
we can do it with the phone itself yeah
and but you I don't you say there's a
lot of trade-offs there like I mean we
can do it I've seen those cell phone
watches I've seen full fully
self-contained phones that are the size
of comm badge and it's like wow this is
like a testament to why trade-offs are
really sucky you know because it looks
just like a product built on the
shoulders of compromise but in and you
know they're they're certainly
compromises to to to combat as well but
i like i like what it says about about
our capacity to continue innovating
especially in the in the framework of
innovation is continuing to the point
where things that we wanted you know
things that we may have wanted as kids
are now coming true to an extent and of
course if you want to nitpick you can 0
point out all the differences and all
the shortcomings of real life products
compared to their fictitious
counterparts but it's really nice to see
that we can still we can still enjoy a
fantasy becoming reality so absolutely i
just see one thing as as Joe saw three
things I just see one thing is this guy
walking down the street and he's like I
don't know tapping the button on the
comcast thing and he says hey Siri do I
have any messages baby you have one
message from the lady and he's like read
it to me baby and then it's like every
word which we cannot include here
because of the gleam tag inappropriate
yes and the entire street and everybody
who's running alongside and stuff I
would knows what the wife is preparing
so that's the only thing which I don't
really get but yeah it's it's cool
probably I'd never use it but as you
guys say you would probably be amped on
it and I have to congratulate this guy
for for pushing this forward innovation
is always welcome weather guys like me
like it or not but yeah props to him and
I'd and yeah here you know your
objections are are definitely worthwhile
and you know it's not for everyone I
think as I said in the article it's
definitely a niche product but I think
it stands a pretty good chance of of
being cooler and certainly geek more
geek chic than than bluetooth headsets
let's so my wrap up on this no I just
got to say everybody do us all a favor
and go out and buy this product if you
have a bluetooth headset that you use
because it'll save all of the schmucks
like me who are at the grocery store and
here you are talking on your bluetooth
phone and i don't know that and i think
you're talking to me so I'm having a
conversation with you and then they turn
their hand then you see because there's
like you see like yeah they've actually
done it some scientific studies or at
least one scientific study which shows
the average person is is significantly
more annoyed by overhearing a phone call
then they are at overhearing a
conversation because when you only hear
half of a conversation your brain has to
work harder to try and extrapolate what
is going on in the conversation yeah but
if you're doing it surprises no but of
course it's not your business so don't
don't sit right next to me on the bus
like talking about your your business
you know what I mean like it's not it's
not that we're sitting there You've
driving us that your brain is
unconsciously hearing one side of the
conversation it's like you can't help
but not only if you don't have
headphones you're screwed don't don't be
rude people I think is the thing right
don't don't don't talk in public on your
phone it's very annoying um combat
Renault that's why texting was invented
it's exactly i think i've written like
something like 13 articles on that stock
and that was just last week I know um
let's uh let's jump into the to the news
of the week we had up we had a long
thought thread and oh so we're we're
starting starting the podcast I'll start
the podcast okay when verse we want to
talk about the DMCA I was just gonna say
first you guys want to talk about
legalese and Star Trek somewhere um I
want to I want to jump into Windows
Phone first because the big news once
again for two weeks in a row has been
windows and Android news iOS has kind of
taken a little break so we push it to
the back of the run down there but first
off the HTC windows phone 8x which we've
been talking about for weeks in mo weeks
we finally our review is up and adam
wrote this and it actually went up this
morning so i think all of us have just
had a chance to to kind of look at it in
the in the sparse asst terms but we have
devices that are kind of making their
way through the team we're all getting
we're all getting hands-on more hands-on
time with with the 8x it is an exciting
exciting device i encourage you to read
the to read the review on the site it is
at least from a branding perspective the
closest thing windows phone has to a
nexus phone would you guys agree up to a
certain extent yes yeah yeah it's a
nexus phone that you can't play with and
do cool stuff with right right well you
can't because because if you do that if
you do that the government is going to
come after you right
and the baker and the baker that's right
the bread maker so I have a look at the
at the 8x review this is um you know
this is something that I don't think any
of the three of us aside from product
demo Hanson's has actually dealt with in
a way I mean or any of you guys no not
yet yeah none of us here are actually
planning on an ordering the 8x unless
haha unless something something happens
it's very important for me which is I
somehow become disenfranchised with the
Lumia 920 and and maybe well and I'll
just get this out of the way right now
and maybe if this wireless charging
comes to pass for the 8x that would that
would be a significant win for HTC knit
that's looking confirmed right now is
that right Tony this is a news story
from from you from I think yesterday or
the day before day before whereas this
was a leaked screenshot from verizon
wireless's and yes from so many training
document it's a train and I'm gonna just
answer to this please while trying to
still answer your first question even
though there wasn't 1i I heard one and
what am I had about one of those charges
yeah 8x eno I knew you had I will still
have a comment on it but it's not gonna
be about the product itself so in my
book the huge con for the windows phone
8x from HTC is its price point or I can
rephrase it like this the huge pro of
the Lumia 920 is its price point so from
what we've seen from the prices made
official yesterday by AT&amp;amp;T HTC windows
phone 8x is one hundred dollars more
expensive than the Lumia 920 so this is
already a huge con in my book or a huge
pro for the Lumia the send to get back
to your real question there was a
training document from Verizon Wireless
it looks like the phone is all but
confirmed officially to arrive on
verizon's network and one of the things
which were listed on this document
instructing verizon personnel is that
this phone allegedly supports wireless
charging which you Michael will probably
be super amped about absolutely me too
and you too Joe so I'm
ority again and it's it was one of those
things which the Lumia 920 had and the
HTC windows phone 8x did not have well
now it sure looks like they both have it
so at the end of the day choosing
between them beyond the brand
recognition and whether you're a fan of
HTC or nokia will be whether you like
the camera the build quality all right
or stuff like this I want to talk I'm
that price choosing between windows
phones and stuff of that but first I
just want to briefly drop in don't you
are not in the minority Joe and I are in
Hardy especially on this team because we
are the only people who give it any dams
about wireless charge whatsoever but I
give 3 i'm sorry i'm anna i have written
i think two pieces specifically on
wireless charging a night i think
probably jumped Tony can Tony whoa Oh
somebody just somebody just died
somewhere on the podcast Joe are you all
right I'm here oh I don't know what
happened I don't know what happened here
okay um maybe somebody's listening in
hey guys everybody who's in could you
live we're getting bugged but we're
getting bugged by all the government
personnel in charge of do you know but
all of yes exactly ah crap we got to
talk about that at the end of the
podcast so we don't trigger this event
mom anyway the deal is this when you're
writing for a site listeners there is a
there's something called the the
editorial voice and we kind of use this
convention sometimes at the pocket now
and sometimes we don't worry writing an
editorial and you kind of use the Wii
the Wii phrasing instead of I we do it
in our reviews and it's because we
generally do all agree in our reviews
but we all have different opinions which
is why we're I think a pretty good
editorial team but it's always it's
always a very interesting experience to
read someone else's editorial that says
something like here's why wireless
charging sucks and to rate the phrasing
is like we think that it sucks because
this and I'm sitting there like well no
weeks no we don't so and we've we've
published many articles on the on each
side of the issue but wireless charging
was one of the things that the Lumia 920
kind of came out of the gate at the
announcement with and Nokia was like
look at this
palme tried to do it and it was awesome
but you know that didn't work out for
them but look what we're doing it's it's
also awesome and wireless charging is
built into this JBL speaker dock and you
can put it on this fat boy pillow if you
want to be like weird with your phone I
don't know what the deal is with the
pella partners oh wait the department we
mean like this at starbucks oh right
yeah that at starbucks is like building
an inductive charging into a lot of
their tables here in Boston as a test
market for friend a my deployment
possibly so that's awesome like I love
all this except I think Starbucks is
using a different standard they're using
a power map thing instead of the cui of
the key compatible one but the point is
that it was a big differentiator for the
Lumia 920 and now it's kind of maybe not
because this 8x has been rumored long
rumored to also feature it and we don't
know if this is going to be only enabled
for the verizon version what's what's
the deal there is it you know I I have
my doubts here and I'm by no means
hating on HTC HTC was I think the OEM
which correct me if I wrong announced
its windows phone line up before nokia
am i right here no no no no you know
nokia beat him to it yeah okay but the
the key takeaway here is that HTC was
that silent about this so-called feature
when whenever they announced the phone
they didn't say a word about this and
now I don't want to go all paranoid on
this but is there a possibility that the
HTC windows phone x wasn't designed with
the with inductive charging and now
seeing that the Lumia 920 has it they
are trying to include it just to scratch
a con from their list because if that
would have been there Peter Chou would
probably definitely said something about
that that's a really good question i
mean it i guess it would depend on how
long how far along they were in the in
the manufacturing process right hmm I
mean hey kids we know that well I think
we know we kind of all assume that the
big speed bump to Windows Phone 8
deployment has been software not
hardware yeah but that's easy to to add
to the back of the phone an induction
how do you call that thing with the long
its entire yeah and two and two or three
cables so
easy to add after production or after
the initial plans have been approved
catch up to the market no well no I mean
cuz I think it changes I mean you're
talking about a yeah it's kind of
receive only but you're talking about a
pretty significant change to a phone
that doesn't have a removable battery
back and even if it had a removable
battery back you'd have to add the
contacts for for charging and you know I
know that is true yeah I don't think
it's an insignificant change so who
knows that's a good question Tony I
didn't even think about that um and I
wonder if somehow verizon has struck
some kind of deal or some or maybe yes
steel maybe you're right that the
verizon version yeah yeah who knows I
mean but all I know is that for me as a
consumer and I think this is the
important part now I have one less
reason to buy the the Lumia 920 now I
mean of course aside from the 100 bucks
now well we can we go they talk about
price but you know what here's yeah I I
think there are people out there who
will pay more to have a lighter slimmer
phone that is also true but then again I
will take this opportunity to actor
everybody who was asking me why do I
shove out that much amount for an iphone
this is why because probably people will
buy the HTC windows phone 8x even if
it's more expensive than the Lumia 920
that's why people buy iphones even there
if they're more expensive than the
android or ipad mini's versus the nexus
7 and rent sure it's not always it's not
always a question of price yeah you
gotta sutro paying for so I'm gonna put
on my conspiracy hat here just for a
minute yeah the European Union has kind
of forced us all into a micro USB
standard and Apple s has friends in the
European Union so they can get away with
a non micro USB charging standard as
long as they have an adapter but that's
that's being able to quote unquote save
our landfills from being filled up with
all of these chargers that are
proprietary for the device or whatever
and now we're even seeing some phones
coming without the chargers without
sometimes even the USB cables inside the
box because they assume you've already
got one yeah I think HTC has been
talking about that I don't think they've
actually done that taking that step yet
I hope they will never do yeah and
whether they do or not
that's great for the environment it
might be great for the bottom line
because it saves 30 cents out of every
package which adds up after selling
millions of devices so here's where my
conspiracy comes in everybody's already
got a USB charger nobody has a wireless
charger um this is all to sell
accessories all to inflate accessory
costs oh well yeah yep but this has
wireless charging get this wireless
charging dock and be cool now I get 70
bucks or 170 bucks sure whatever well
that's that's a you know what I don't
think that's too far fetched a
conspiracy theory I mean of course you
can still charge this is one of those
things that people who don't like
wireless charging always threats or like
what about how dare you I don't want to
do you have to tote it doc everywhere
like people like behave as if the USB
port no longer exists on a device that
can I charge wirelessly just just take
your cable it's okay you can still take
the cable with you when you travel it's
only at home that you can if you want to
use the convenience of a wireless
charging mat from my personal standpoint
I will in my day-to-day life find the
wireless charging useful in one
particular scenario when I bring my
phone to my car and I just put it on a
dashboard or somewhere where i had this
induction bed and it keeps on charging
and i'm not side to the cable so i can
get out of the car or maybe yes
illegally answer a phone while driving
yes so well it yeah and you know i think
the Windows Phone implementation does
not call for a magnet which is a shame
because you can do it in the car people
did it with palm touchdowns all the time
because I'll touch none would keep the
phone anchored to the thing and that's
what the nexus 4 is doing with its
wireless charging there's also a magnet
that keeps it aligned anyway I don't
know i think you know i could talk about
this all day but this is this is
probably going to be a minor
consideration for some people and tony
kind of burst right at the gate there
with that with that price comparison and
and rightly so because this is something
to get excited about the speaking the
HTC 8x for example yeah yeah that this
is crazy the Lumia 920 has been
announced for AT&amp;amp;T it is
for pre-order today when I get off the
air I'm going to look at ways of getting
one into my hand and if they're not out
of stock oh I don't if they if they sold
out in in before noon on the day the
pre-order opened up I will we have to
have another podcast right away let's
talk about that um but even though that
then he's just gonna go mug somebody you
know that Tony yeah yeah but I don't
want to say that on the budget right the
feds are listening sorry yeah I got to
get my hoodie on and go do that the
Lumia 920 which was kind of we were
thinking it was maybe going to be at the
150 price point or whatever but it's
gonna sell for 99 on contract and AT&amp;amp;T
is going to give away a wireless
charging dock with it which i think is a
great move on their part and they don't
have to I know AT&amp;amp;T is not competing
with anybody for the right to carry this
920 in the United States they have the
exclusive launch carrier which is pretty
awesome but it is obviously you can see
kind of Nokia's behind the scenes work
as they as they work to to fight HTC
who'd you know I think before probably
wasn't even on their radar and now HTC
burns out the gate with this crazy
competition and they're like all right
fun well we're going to give away this
we're going to subsidize this this
accessory and we're going to price the
phone we said 100 it's a 100 on stream
for 99.99 so it's 99 and none of the 8x
is what vs 1 99 99 it's a hundred dollar
difference and the Lumia 920 is that is
that for the that's for the lower
two-year contract yeah this for the 16
gig one alright so these these things
are on the same but that's just crazy I
mean we're seeing some some pretty cool
price wars break out I think I know
what's going on here hey what's up you
know when when the first wave of nokia
windows phone capable phones came out
the 800 and the 900 later on Stephen
Elop said that this is the windows phone
it's the signature phone you know fast
forward to last month Peter Chou said
that HTC windows phone 8x and 8s are the
windows phone 8 they're using even the
OS name in the product name and like the
entire world was how could they do that
Microsoft is giving up a nokia well
here's what I think
Microsoft gave HTC the right to use the
OS name and the device name that's their
support for HTC and microsoft support
for lumia for nokia is a huge subsidy of
bryce i think i think that's where
microsoft's money is that's a good
question because i was wondering as i
was saying like look they're giving away
the wireless charging accessory their
pricing this thing really low on
contract again like they did with the
Lumia 900 how can nokia really afford to
do this and do we have any data on I
mean they have to announce this stuff in
their quarterly morning earnings right
if my days left it's just like here's
another couple billion they will
probably will but this is relating to a
topic which is also on the list so I'm
bringing this up Steve Ballmer you while
talking about Windows Phone he said that
I'm trying to find the quote but my eyes
are running on this huge screen the idea
is that we will see unprecedented
marketing bushes and but I think a
conclusion subsidies for Windows 8
Windows RT and Windows Phone 8 products
something which has never been seen with
any Microsoft product in the best and I
think this is again where Microsoft's
money is yeah well they have to they
have to read that quote for you we are
still relatively small but with the work
we have done with Nokia HTC Samsung and
others there is now an opportunity to
create really a strong third participant
in the smartphone market now that's very
very bold words but Steve Ballmer has
never been one who didn't say bulwark
she's always been the chief cheerleader
at Microsoft except Nebraska they've got
what four percent you know bringing this
up this reminds me of the initial
commercial of Windows 1.8 L majdi how
much do you think the Lumia 920 comes to
1 99 99 can I Nina we please remake that
commercial can someone please dress up
as Steve Ballmer and make that
commercial for windows phone oh I'm
sorry Joey yeah no you're you're
you're correct date and they do have
four percent market sure they are still
very small and apparently a teensy had
an option to either include that
wireless charging dock accessory or a
slap chop or a salad shooter nice yeah I
make the wise choice so this is
fascinating what is this for the first
time for the first time we have windows
phones coming to you know many carriers
in the United States many many carriers
worldwide and but they're there they're
duking it out in a very high-profile
fashion when Nokia came to ATT in the
United States with the Lumia 900 I mean
that was shaking the market up enough
that was like wow look 18 he's really
putting some dollars behind this Nokia's
making a big noise Microsoft is making a
big noise there's a big push but it only
had itself to fight with I mean its
competition was the HTC Titan to you
know it was like I don't give a damn but
man look now you have these colorful
phones from two different manufacturers
and colorful literally in addition to
figuratively like like fighting with
each other publicly and the companies
are have so much at stake because HTC is
doing poorly once again and Nokia is
obviously doing poorly and they have so
much at stake with these products that
they're kind of taking shots at each
other in the press it's a fascinating
landscape and it's more interesting than
Windows Phone has ever been and now
finally they have the guts of these
devices the processors are good enough
to wear like the hardcore geeks are like
all right I'll go so I can take notice
of that and you know the Microsoft fans
are always going to be vocal and it's
just it's just awesome I mean it's I I
think that and also I don't think
there's any other player in the
marketplace who can even get close to
the idea of maybe becoming the third
relevant platform right well not at this
particular moment and with this amount
of money which which Microsoft is
willing to spend yes yeah exactly I kind
of have a deja vu are we are we going
into Android because I have the perfect
yeah shift we okay so we are i I'm
having a dish of you with this Microsoft
and Nokia and Lumia 920 thing comparing
with the google LG next
for I've written a piece I think it was
this weekend and the LG Nexus 4 is like
five or six times more expensive in
Europe than it is in the US and I'm
afraid that's gonna that's what's going
to happen with the Lumia 920 I think
that Microsoft as Google is subsidizing
a great amount of the products price in
the US and when that product will leave
the US or on other markets like in Asia
or Europe the price will be five times
as much as what you guys will probably
pay it's I mean it's for 4999 unlocked
Lumia 920 man i DNT yes so what are we
talking about here it will probably get
to Europe at like six hundred and fifty
euros or something like that which is
already three times the amount of price
and to make the analogy with the nexus 4
instead of paying 199 or whatever the
nexus force prices in the google play
store in the u.s. in Europe it's around
600 euros which is close to eight
hundred dollars which is crazy yes so I
think I'm afraid this will happen at
that would be a real shame and I think
you're probably right considering what
we heard from commenters after a podcast
a couple shows ago where we were talking
about iphone pricing and you know people
from every country are writing in saying
like the iphone would cost me 1,500
bucks the iphone would cost me you know
in nine hundred dollars busted me one
thousand dollars here cost you Wow yeah
I mean and and I bought it from the
apple store from Hungary of course it
was 990 something to be specific so yeah
yeah and I mean obviously we can't can't
predict pricing and it is a shame when
when you see so much rejoicing from from
save the United States for it's like wow
the nexus 4 is 350 bucks that's amazing
and then it overseas it's like well no
as a matter of fact it's double that so
yeah i agree i hope that doesn't that
doesn't really happen but we'll we'll
have to see we are we are already in
android so i want to i want to keep
talking about android because that's you
know we got an android guy in the
podcast today is the lake over there Joe
if Robert windows motors blue so you're
still within windows it's live tile talk
absolutely I want you guys to know I
started out life as a wind
mobile guy as we landed mmm that was me
you know that's what I did you guys have
a cat ringtone yeah no I've got an
actual live cat that's is it USB powered
it's all right guys okay the cats now in
and under the bed we can move back to
just because likes Android by the way so
ha hide your mouse had your USB moccasin
oh I just got it sorry um so no we were
all yeah I know we were all we all kind
of started life as Windows Mobile guys
so yeah no I don't mean to I just like
calling you jelly by the android guy
because it's all i do i do too i just i
don't want our listeners to ever think
that i am anti windows phone I think we
need to have that other competitor in
the market place to to not just keep the
other two players Android included
honest but also to push the innovation
iphone iOS really hasn't innovated its
stagnated and it's it's made very small
incremental updates but we need to have
someone who's well and honest what do
they have to loose they've got four
percent so they're willing to do really
really bold stuff because they can yeah
if they don't they've only got four
percent to lose right so we need them I
appreciate what they're doing I still
think live tiles are way too distracting
but that I'm glad we have them love them
this is Joe you're making a really good
point it with regard to innovation and I
wrote a piece about this yesterday that
I I kind of like the way this piece came
out it's one of my shorter ones but I
still I like the way it landed because I
wrote a piece called wide leaving
Android for another platform is harder
than ever before because I'm thinking
about this right like i mean i think i'm
not alone a lot of people are thinking
about what's this new windows phone 8 i
want to try it and also i want to use it
as my daily driver and so I'm like but
I've the problem is I've had an android
phone for for a year and i've been using
google products like extensively since
2006 so it's like that that level of
integration in my in my palm is is
really alluring
and I use it constantly so the idea of
jumping to another platform it's not an
ecosystem question it's not like I've
spent all this money on apps and now I
have to buy him again like no I already
did the math on that another article and
I'll end up like Reese pending like 14
bucks I'm okay with that you know
because you use free apps not because of
something else no I don't know why it
isn't maybe I'm just lame but uh the
thing is that like it's it's scary
because I'm going to lose so much stuff
that i use lroff to find third-party
solutions for all this stuff I use
natively like google voice like Google
you know like Google Drive and other
like Google centric things I'm going to
be switching to to your own bing maps
from google maps and i use google maps
all the time blah blah blah blah blah
but I that's all kind of pedestrian and
dull like we kind of talked about this
all the time the more interesting thing
to me is what google is planning to do
in the future and i used google now as
the example in the piece as something
they're really doing that's that's
really groundbreaking and some media you
know it's a commenters like so basically
you're gonna miss google now and that's
your you know and like no and actually
he's not he's one of our regular
commenters i shouldn't say isn't it but
you know and i'm like no read the piece
again it's not about just google now
it's about look at all the innovation
look at all the momentum google has with
with innovation as far as driving the
industry forward and driving the future
of search for word and searches
everything and i mean it's amazing what
they're doing if you read some of the
interviews with with their execs and
what they're planning on doing with
android and i don't want to be missing
out on that the microsoft is doing great
things to with Windows Phone 8 but I
feel like they're still in in a UI sense
yes they're ahead of a lot of people but
in every other a lot of other senses
they're still playing catch-up or at
least they're just trying to they're
doing a good job of keeping pace but so
I don't know i mean what do you what do
you guys think about this allow me to
disagree of it please until a certain up
until a certain extent i know exactly
where you're coming from but in in 2012
and not necessarily this year but from
from let's say 2010 and up until now
platforms and applications have been so
good at becoming enter compatible
whether you have an iOS phone or Windows
Phone you will be able to setup your
gmail account but with the calendar now
I'm not sure about Windows Phone 8 but
you will have google drive on your iOS
device obviously google voice is
something i have never used because it's
not available around here and it's not
available in many countries outside of
the US this except if it's the u.s. only
thing so what I'm saying is that they
are all offering some some sort of
interoperability things you can set up
most of your your applications or
services you are using on a daily basis
on other things too but then again the
downside is of course every company
wants to push their own products and
services I just read a piece that the
famed Windows Live Messenger will die
and it will be replaced by Skype yeah so
Microsoft is pushing windows live mail
as hotmail or outlook.com now they're
pushing office they're pushing skype
Google's doing the exact same thing with
its own products and Apple is doing this
the exact same thing with its own
offerings the good thing about 2012 is
that you can use it if not all of the
products but most of the products on
other platforms to of course Google Maps
is no longer available on iOS and it's
not available on Windows Phone but you
go to the mobile website and you have
the exact same experience so you don't
you don't have the exact same experience
if you go to the website and the browser
come on yeah you now have Street View
man I guess you've more features but it
functionally as well it's not the same
well then again let me rephrase it
depends on what you're using google maps
for sure sure so my key takeaway here is
that the line is becoming very thin
between this war of offerings between
the companies i think i think you're
right time' in one respect i agree with
you i think the companies are a somewhat
equal in offering maybe a like number of
things like microsoft has its google
equivalents that it's offering it has
enough google equivalents for every
google product it has something to
answer it with but
a lot of those are just for me it's like
wow Microsoft is really focusing on
skype well I know a lot more people on
google talk than I know on skype you
know Microsoft is saying yeah look at
look at one note and I'm like well I use
Evernote and thankfully ever notice on
Windows honey you know Microsoft is like
look at the office suite I swear if if I
have to hear about the Microsoft Office
suite one more time because i hate
office I've always hated office it's
it's you know it it's like advertising
like based on based on having an awesome
office suite integration if you're
talking about a consumer product is for
me like saying like come to our ice
cream stand because the paint job on the
ice cream stand is really awesome
instead of saying come to our ice cream
stand because the ice cream is great you
know it's like it's like Milton from the
office talking about his red swingline
stapler it's a stapler right exactly
yeah yeah and and so we can we can get
into that a lot i get i get the point
tony and i think that a lot of
commenters have rightly said no but
there are equivalents on on the Windows
platform there are equivalents on iOS
you just have to know what you're
getting into and you have to be willing
to make that sacrifice and say yeah I
got to use some third party stuff
because Google and Microsoft I want to
play nice on some stuff and you know
whatever we that these are the
sacrifices we make when we jump
platforms it's just interesting to see
how much harder it is to leave android
now than it was even a year ago and it's
our luck or our curse that we have to
use them all at the same time because of
our jobs exactly yes ok so so a couple
observations from the android guy first
of all i think i said it was the office
i know its office space don't ring me
about that please I just been spoken
haha yeah and it definitely was his
stapler don't mm-hmm swingline so lame
Microsoft has always been and I'm a
Microsoft developer I code all day long
in Microsoft technologies Microsoft has
always been a king of integration
whether that's active directory exchange
Word Excel SharePoint sequel all of
their stuff integrates together and
works really
well even when one solution might not be
the technologically superior solution
chances are you're still going to go
with it because it's so tightly
integrated with everything else windows
mobile had that Windows Phone doesn't or
at least it didn't in its first
iteration they scrapped everything
started from the ground up this is not
the next version of windows mobile this
was Windows Phone one point 0 starting
from the ground and moving up Microsoft
is still really good at integration
Google not quite as good they're not
quite as tightly coupled with everything
they're getting there but you can now
very very easily and my experience with
with windows 8 which I'm running on my
desktop computer right now love it or
hate it one of the things that it asked
for was all of my other accounts kind of
like an Android install does you know if
you've got a facebook account of Twitter
account hey if you've got a gmail
account it asked for that my windows 8
now just automatically gets my gmail it
gets my google calendar it's integrated
my google contacts it just did it it
pulled that in mmm if windows phone is
not doing that now we're not doing that
to your satisfaction now they will soon
it will be seamless it won't matter so
the two halves of the discussion and
honestly when I read your article I
wondered where you were going with it
Michael I thought this was going to be
more about and I hope I'm not alone in
it that your article is going to be more
about your data portability I've got all
my contacts I've got all my emails i got
my calendar over in google i don't want
to abandon all that and put it all in
again on windows now I don't think
that's gonna be an issue cuz it's not an
insurance affordable no that's why I
didn't talk about it was it's not an
issue Yeah right and that's that's kind
of what confused me no you know all of
these other apps and whatnot yeah
Microsoft you just wait there they're
gonna do it they're gonna do it right
and and hopefully they'll do it when
they're still relevant yes
I'm is the only thing that's the only
question exactly yeah I you know it
needs these it's it's a big question and
it's one of the I think Tony as you
touched on it it's one of these
sacrifices that we kind of have to be
willing to to endure by virtue of having
a world where we have multiple platforms
to choose from yeah these platforms
would not all be be separate and being
important if they were all the same if
we had three version three separate
slightly different flavors of Android
out there it wouldn't be as much fun so
you have to be able to kind of deal with
these these difficulties when you hop
between platforms and I'm happy to do it
it's it's it is after all fun to learn
an entire that to relearn an entirely
new world as particular read it I beg
your pardon in three days exactly you
Dave and I think the the the difference
is not that huge between platforms on
mobile devices than it is on personal
computers I mean the difference at least
to me between a windows pc and a mac is
much more big than this between Android
iOS and Windows Phone maybe it's just me
I don't know no you know I think you
make a good point i think a big part of
that is is that the interface technology
is so similar across devices in the in
the mobile world like if you think about
it just from a hardware perspective all
these have capacitive touchscreens and
from a software perspective you flick
swipe and tap like we understand that
these methods of input right but on a
computer like yeah you have a mouse
pointer and you have a mouse but the
software's is laid out completely
differently and right clicks do
different things and yeah you know I
guess that that's analogous on the
mobile side to we have long presses do
some things and you have gestures go
ahead whatever I don't know you know i'm
not sure every platform has its learning
curve the good the really good platforms
have a short learning curve yeah yeah
well that's true i remember regardless
of if it's mobile or absolutely exactly
it should epson should just be intuitive
and this is what should just work this
seems really like the theme of the
podcast were to kind of keep keep
progressing into the windows phone 8 in
the windows 8 block but that's why I'm a
little concerned very
fillet about Windows 8 not because it's
not going to take off as it is is going
to catch on like wildfire but all these
gestures on Windows 8 tablets where you
like draw in from the left to multitask
you drawn from the right for the charm
bar you like swipe down from the top to
close applications I feel like people
are going to use windows 8 and they're
not going to not buy windows 8 but
they're going to spend six months using
Windows 8 and then somebody's going to
like pull out the charm bar for them
like on their tablet they're like what's
that you know because that's what
happened with with webos like people
used to have their pre next to me and
they'd be like trying to close an app or
whatever and they'd be like yeah it's
stupid like I can't close apps on this
thing I'm like you just flick the card
off the top of the screen and they're
like they're like mind is blown or when
somebody did it for instance just by a
mistake where did that yo exactly
exactly because like when you have a
user interface that has elements that
are hidden like that it's very hard to
get people to learn them right off the
off the bat because I don't know about
you guys but the first thing I do is
skip tutorials like tries to teach me
how to use it I'm like no I got it I can
figure it out I think you see with their
tips overlay oh yeah and exactly the
overlay layer on HTC devices and Samsung
oh my god I mean it's a it's a good idea
if you watch the tutorials and I always
give them high marks for trying to teach
customers but man every time I get a new
girl really it's like these are your
75th and 127 stab let's imagine you're a
first-time smartphone you exactly and
that's why I give them that's why I say
I've given problem like yeah you know
you should put it out of it man if I
have to drink bring down that
notification shade on a new device one
more time and have samsung say like this
is where notifications go I know you
guys remember Clippy from oh yeah but i
love the einstein wait what it looks
like you're trying to close a nap it
looks like you're trying to get your
notifications just shut up that's what
I'm trying to the boat the bonus with
Samsung devices is that like half of it
is those kind of novelty features that
Samsung half does right and half of them
are just total crap so it's like hey if
you can double tap the device if you
want to go to the top of a list and it's
like okay I'll enable that feature and
then for the rest of the devices life
you're like whacking the thing on the
top of it is like wow this isn't working
all thanks thanks a lot but and is it
Samsung that writes all those tips and
some like handwriting font so it looks
like that's the acc 0 is that uh yeah
hey come on guys it looks like you just
scribbled this thing together five
minutes before you push the device out
the door you want to be friendly they
want to transmit that that personal
feeling to you that it's not a machine
with the Roboto font it's a person that
transmits you the information that's
right rotate you how to do stuff it
wrote it by hand in comics and comic
sense speaking of HTC there is a there's
a new device on the horizon for for
Verizon customers in the US which we
know is which we think is the same
device as the butterfly J this is called
it's called this is a vinyl name I was
going to say the amazing name changing
HTC android phone because this thing has
been what the rumored as the dicks the
DI X the DLX the butterfly J of course
is its name in Japan and now we're
seeing it as the droid DNA on verizon
which i don't know if you guys like i
understand i understood dicks like droid
incredible acts cool i understand DLX if
you want to go deluxe butterfly j is
weird but it's japan so okay but like
droid DNA i'm really looking forward to
the marketing copy that we are just
going to be hit in the face with to
justify this weirdo named like it's in
your genes it's so amazing that it's in
the cellular structure of your body you
know I know gives you exactly right yeah
it knows you because it is you droid DNA
you know I'm not looking forward to
being hit over the head with that i
would but i am looking forward to
attending the launch event because
that's happening next week and i'll be
going to cover it and i'm i'm actually
really excited because this is let us
know if that image that we've got posted
on our website is it's true are we
really gonna get a phone that has a
honeycomb wallpaper on uh what is it is
it up on the site right now yes it was
it posted yesterday did I miss it or is
it like brand new honeycomb wallpaper
this is hella subhasis even less are
go HTC and Verizon schedule press event
droid DNA launch has a new render at the
bottom and yeah it's been updated the
post has been updated Oh with the new
vault wallpaper and Little League of a
new breast render yes so here's this
press render end it's got a red colored
well because it's a droid brand
obviously it's gonna have red stuff on
it but it's the honeycomb hexagons yes
Jody remember when we saw the first
leaks of the nexus 4 and it had
basically a screen or the notification
tray of a cyanogenmod rom so this might
be something similar this might be just
the nut not the final render or they
might just go with this super cool red
honey come I think that's probably
probably final wallpaper i mean it is
cool-looking i have to say it is it
brings back but everyone hates honeycomb
me that they hated the hate it I know
but people know why annoyed we're gonna
look at this and go honeycomb I don't
want that and they're gonna move on to
another device right but it's not it's
not like a Nexus device right like it's
not like it's not for the geeks it's for
the people who I got it guys for total
morons why how I mean it's called DNA
and if you take some looks of the DNA
you know those spirals and stuff like
the DNA helix yeah yeah and that
probably tries to emulate that i don't
know i don't think if they wanted to do
a helix they would do a helix and not a
bunch of hexagons you know I don't Navy
I'm a moron we didn't want to have to
break it to ya yeah realization of the
day you know I I don't want to I don't
want to find excuses don't blame me gay
okay so the take home from this is right
please if you're a carrier or if you're
a manufacturer and and you before you
release any of this stuff we're really
really good with NDA's bring us in just
hire us for a few hours show us the cool
stuff we'll let you know what sucks what
kind of what doesn't so that you can
make a better product so without even
looking at it even mention I mean I
didn't even mention that this divide the
highlight feature of this device which
if you need a reminder like I did just
now it has a 1080p display or it
probably will if it's the same device so
that's you know alternately cool and not
cool
there's been some spirited discussion in
the comments on pieces that we write
like the one I wrote about 1080p screens
are useless on smartphones because
they're so small and then some people
come back and they say yeah it's not
just about pixel density a 1080p display
really does look better in various
different ways that are measurable and
all this kind of stuff so I'm very
excited to lay eyes on it and i'll be
giving you my impressions when i do in
new york city of next week and i'm very
excited so I don't want listeners to
come away with this idea that we just
hate the fact that they've changed the
name five times and this is a dumb
device like i love i think all of us to
a person really like HTC at pocket now
like we talked about on the podcast
pretty often and i like to see new
products from them so this will be will
be fun just a short disclaimer and we're
99.999% sure that this is going to be
the droid DNA but there's no hint on the
invitation itself so it might just be a
point one percent that we're wrong on
this and is gonna be a totally different
device in epi hilarious university
android 4.2 for every verizon ring ever
early or they could probably no one
actually sending those phony text which
was a rumor to come to verizon the
leaked documents and stuff like that oh
yeah and and leaked images of the screen
so it could go three ways four ways yeah
you know that but it so the invite says
we invite you to experience our latest
collaboration single Single tense
collaboration so I feel like could be
the droid DNA could be the windows phone
8x yeah because it's singular probably
not both right and I don't think it's
the windows phone when it doesn't look
like the amazingness it are a
collaboration with multiple devices yeah
that would be honored I would love that
anyway um moving on we've given that
thing enough time the the final kind of
two things in Android here are smaller
elements and Joe I want to ask him about
this this his piece in a second but just
real quick lenovo has announced this
kind of Android device or it's leaked or
something that's happened that that has
a massive battery in it this is a 3500
milliamp hour battery the razor
acts from motorola the kind of previous
crown holder for high-capacity battery
at tops out at 3,300 this is a 3,500
milliamp hour battery in a lenovo phone
called the p770 if you want to look it
up that's awesome I want to see and I
want to write a piece on this I want to
see a battery a milliamp hour race I'm
not interested in higher resolution
displays because I don't hold my phone
two inches from my eyeballs all the time
I don't care I want my phone to last all
day and to see manufacturers besides
motorola who are crazy in in some of the
best ways ever say we're gonna throw
this massive battery in our phone
especially when it's this kind of random
brand like Lenovo that's awesome what do
you guys think about this I welcome the
idea I love the idea but I just think on
a conspiracy level again that it's not
in the manufacturers interest to deliver
you a high-capacity battery because if
you have a small capacity battery you
wear without relatively quick if it's a
one-day charge or half a day charge
you'll have to charge it more than you
charge the 35 million power battery so
more charges means that that battery
will probably die relatively quickly and
with no means to change the batteries
and phones nowadays they're all going
with non removable batteries you
probably have to buy a new phone so I'd
love to see at least a phone which will
get me through one and a half days
without me needing to turn it off
completely overnight but I just don't
think that we're only limited by battery
technology yeah well from a from a
broader like Sam point though you're
looking at it's like if you're a
manufacturer that kind of doesn't ship a
lot of phones that sell a lot like like
Lenovo it was a you know very big
prominent company in computers and less
so and smartphones like you're like well
how can we differentiate how can we sell
more units let's look a big you know
headline-grabbing battery and let's say
use it all day and then the next you
know whatever mm-hmm I don't know
absolutely I just want to say thank you
Tony for being the conspiracy guy on
this one
and giving me a break that's awesome so
I just reviewed the the droid razr HD
the non max version yes which only has
correct me from around here guys I think
there's 27 30 milliamp hour here
somewhere with that you realize that i
did but it's an honor just battery i
couldn't look at the battery i couldn't
even get the back cover off i I couldn't
even get the the little door open to put
an SD card in it but I digress uh that
phone that phone with an S 4 plus
processor in it ran over 20 hours with
with my I would call it significantly
heavier than average user use it was
average for me but that is not the max
this is the reg this is not the max this
is just the regular one that's awesome
in fact that's what I concluded in the
article is you don't need to spend the
money on the max unless you are a
die-hard road warrior who needs to have
all that extra time 20-plus hours and it
was still going I mean I was in the
yellow but I wasn't in the red yet and i
was at twenty point four hours and it's
still nice it was amazing watching your
video Joe and I was I took a moment to
be like to be to enjoy watching another
Jolie vibe review which I hadn't watched
in a long time I was like God you are a
soothing guy to watch on your reviews it
is great like a lot of you know it's
like some of us were like I'm like so
yours I'm gonna tell you about something
else and you know we've all gotta run
like styles and Joe's like I'm gonna
tell you about this phone and you're
gonna like it it comes with the rich
Corinthian leather which by the way we
need I wanna fight it's a current my
father yeah I'm one of those bamboo fun
go ahead jobs so yeah big batteries are
awesome if you've got a bump on the back
of your phone and it looks goofy already
fill up that bump with throwing in extra
milliamp hours to what tony was saying
yeah batteries are not necessarily rated
as far as longevity
and you know it's going to last a year
it's going to last two years it's rated
in how many charge-discharge cycles you
have and the smaller battery you have
the more of those cycles you're going to
have the faster you're going to use it
up until it just doesn't hold a charge
for more than a couple hours at a time
or you have to leave it plugged in all
the time and in that case you don't have
a smartphone or a tablet and have enough
you've got a desktop yeah you're
tethered congratulations now another
observation is one of the first things
that I had the chance to review one of
the first accessories that I had a
chance to review when I was working on
the the Galaxy Nexus stuff and then we
all hit that all at the same time was
the extended battery and I you know I
said I don't really need it the the 1700
stock battery or whatever it is is just
fine it gets me through the majority of
the day and that's just about it and I
don't care no way dude I have since
turned 180 and I'm running my I think
it's a 2200 milliamp hour battery in my
phone I get a full day out of it but
that's it around eight nine hours tops
and if I'm turning on my hotspot forget
about that oh yes have earned it through
a whole battery in with a hot spot
yesterday yeah so bigger I Samsung did
that I'm sure just so that they could
sell an accessory they could sell an
extra skew and and you know all the
phones in my house all that galaxy nexi
in my house and yes I have four of them
now all but one of them have the
extended battery yeah this one coming
with a full battery and I don't know
this battery in this screengrab looks
like it could be removable yeah it does
have that doesn't it it's got the plus
and minus sign on it i don't see tape
holding it down anywhere like you do on
the non removable ones right so i'm
wondering if this isn't an extended
battery for it which would make sense
you know sell an accessory upgrade to it
but even still that's fabulous before I
go way too long winded which was about
five minutes ago uh yeah we're going to
move on coming out that the s4 series
particularly those guys are sipping at
the power like nothing I've ever seen so
just looking at the battery capacity
itself
you got to remember that's part of the
story the other part is what's powering
it because like we saw with that that
razr HD even with the plus processor not
the probe process but the plus it's
doing phenomenally well with a decent
sized battery with that new advanced
processor that's the yeah and that's
when you brought it the new Galaxy Nexus
I was like yeah I had the 2100 milliamp
hour battery in there or whatever it was
and it's it's it wasn't a question of of
really of the battery itself it was a
question of the design of the phone and
how poorly the LTE version managed its
battery life and yeah there's so many
variables that go into that we have to
we have to jump in iOS because as usual
were over time as I was saying to Tony
before we started recording over time
for us is the new on time so we can't I
always had another light week in the
wake of a lot of big news in iOS and I
would kind of in the low but Apple has
reported sales of 3 million iPad minis
no no no that million iPads and rolled
over wait three men a peds shipped or
what those it's it's 3 million iPads so
over the weekend including minis and
ipad 4 and that ends the three
presumably right no only the new ones
only a new one only the new ones god you
think they just pick and choose what I
mean not Apple like manufacturers just
pick and choose what they want to report
so okay so that was three million iPads
iPads this weekend which was what the
weekend of the 4th and 5th or whatever
yeah uh is that good or bad cuz they're
not they're not breaking it down into
ipad mini figures like a lot of people
have made a big news deal out of that
that they haven't announced specific
figures for the mini it could be it
could go both ways and i am right now
looking or searching can you just fill
in 20 seconds while I search for
something oh yeah we could fill time
like champs episode of Trek when they
were doing that thing and they shot
those things oh yeah and then they
bounced back and hit him in the face
yeah it always happens yeah so so let me
have something uh
I've got a day job a lot of you already
know that our CIO came up to me last
night and he now has an ipad mini oh
he's like wow you know this I didn't
think I'd like it because it was so
small but wow this is just awesome and
he's doing this as he's picking up my
nexus 7 from my desk and looking at it
and running his hands over it and I
don't know if he thought that I also had
an iPad Mini or if he was thinking and
this is just an awesome form factor and
I I let him into it saying yeah that
that's 7 inch that 7 inch size is just
ideal it's it's not too big that you
can't easily carry it around with you
like some of the 10 inches are it's not
real heavy and it's small enough that
you can read it and use it small enough
that you will have it with you to be
able to and he was just all for that in
fact he made the comment or read with a
comment that the big size the the big
iPad or even the 10-inch tablets yeah
it's like The Reader's Digest large
print edition yeah oh yeah no it's
entirely true i mean we have this love
for this continuous love fest for the 7
inch and 8 inch form factor around here
and it's entirely justified i'm glad
that like you didn't go to hear
testimony from a real life person
outside of that tell you because you
found your your piece of information i
was looking for for how many ipad 3
units did Apple sell this March when
they introduced it and I could only
found the only press release which was
around two weeks after the ipad 3 became
available so it took two weeks for the
ipad 3 alone to sell three million units
now it took three days for the ipad mini
and the ipad 4 to reach that number now
we have a couple of hints in the press
release the new ipad with retina display
that's the name so the ipad for demand
for the ipad 4 was higher than the man
for the ipad 3 but we don't know exact
numbers as far as i'm concerned i would
tend to believe that out of these three
million ipads
I would believe that summer around
seventy sixty five seventy percent were
iPad minis and the rest were ipad 4's
and here are my reasons if you remember
pre-orders the iPad minis were the first
ones to sell out in the pre-order period
when these tablets became available at
brick-and-mortar stores we got stories
of the ipad mini selling out now of
course it could I could play devil's
advocate and say the ipad mini stock was
lower than the ipad for stock but they
designed for him either mmm they had the
headlines in some regions they didn't
have in other regions and here's what
i'm saying is that if you have an ipad 3
i personally don't see a reason to
upgrade to the ipad 4 or if you have an
ipad 3 i don't see the reason to upgrade
/ downgrade to the ipad mini but if you
have an ipad to you probably probably
want to buy the ipad 4 or the ipad mini
so what I would have liked is to see a
breakdown of how many iPad minis not
necessarily because because I want those
numbers personally but because the Phil
Schiller was so enthused about comparing
the mini and the nexus 7 on stage and we
know that it took six months for google
okay five months for google and suz to
sell three million Nexus 7's I would
just would have wanted to know how many
did Apple manage to sell in three days
if it's 1,000,000 then they're that much
better if it's two million even better
if it's 50,000 that's both right and
well and you said it best Tony they
don't want you to know those specific
numbers because of the lay of the land
you're gonna get a lot of people who
aren't going to upgrade to it because
it's not really enough grade it's a
downgrade and not just in size but also
you know not having a Retina display and
in yada yada yada so you're gonna start
seeing those types of numbers reported
and I think there'll be impressive
numbers with the ipad mini 2 which i'm
gonna go on the record here and if i'm
wrong Michael will eat my hat that this
is it will have a Retina display and it
will most likely have an a6 processor in
it it will be in and ipad 4 mini
right and that's what everyone will be
interested in i will i will also
disagree and i'll say that there will
only be a Retina display if Apple will
be bold enough to introduce a new
resolution the ipad 3 and ipad 4's
resolution in 7.9 inches I think we will
never see so we will probably see retina
if they introduce another intermediate
resolution which I don't see Apple doing
at the moment and if I'm wrong Michael
will eat my hat hi I'm nom you know I
got it I got so many hats in the buffer
it we will see what they do it with
screen resolution I agree that that is a
concern that that Apple has until now
well apple continues to do to kind of
sidestep really well this issue of like
are we going to alienate developers with
a new screen resolution because you know
when they did with retina they just
doubled everything and with the ipad
mini they're like yeah remember that old
resolution we're at now it's set a
smaller screen size and so just keep
still still that resolution is still the
standard for the app store because there
are still the majority of iPads there
are iPad ones and twos so those who have
ipad threes are less than those who have
ipad ones and twos and this mini is
basically using the same resolution as
the ipad 1 and ipad 2 so developers are
not affected in any case right well
that's what I'm so and that's that's why
why Apple is really really good at
dealing with this thing because they're
like either either you have the double
resolution or you have the single
resolution that you can recode for
whatever and blah blah blah so I agree
Tony I don't think that they would be
terribly likely to launch a third screen
resolution but then again we have an
entire year presumably before the ipad
mini sequel launches show and anything
going to happen between now and then
including you know iOS gaining even more
traction and an apple saying sorry to do
this to developers but you're going to
make a lot more money here's a third
screen resolution they're there already
is a third resolution we have the tall
resolution now a what for that so my
question yeah for the iphone 5 so my
question is could we see in the future
an ipad mini that is a little bit
narrower and a lot taller and would that
be a red nose but i canno
it looks like that no they they went
with that with the phone but they will
never do that with the tablet because
tablets as far as they are concerned our
content consumption devices and thus far
as Apple is concerned they think that
the only or the perfect aspect ratio for
content consumption is 4 by 3 same time
same time I agree Tony and and for me I
I kind of like that too but Apple was
also once the company that said we're
not going to do a 7-inch tablet you know
not they didn't they did an 8-inch don't
know whatever you know what I mean I had
someone else sees that well i'm thinking
can't if we're talking content
consumption what content are we talking
about are we talking about books are we
talking about websites are we talking
about everything in general so except
for a video for by face is the best
except for video exactly now so if video
expands and we see even more offerings
like we're seeing with Hulu Plus getting
more stuff Netflix getting the no more
stuff but not losing as much it we're
getting all of this widescreen video
content I've already got this nice wide
screen android tablet and what is Apple
half well that you can watch it wide
screen on your iphone 5 but not on a
bigger screen yes Joe but it's only one
out of the four so we have the web we
have books we have pictures and we have
videos so except for videos books and
web and pictures are better off on the 4
by 3 inch screen so I think they they
won't change the entire perception just
because videos by themselves well we
don't know what do it you know I will
have to we'll have to see i think it's
gonna be fun to talk about it's gonna be
fun to talk about iOS as if we start
especially as we start to hear what what
sir Jony ive is going to do yeah I what
quit kind of mark he's gonna leave on
the software side of things in the wake
of forced also until then let's let's
let's move on because we have very
little to speculate on and even though
we could speculate all day we have to
wrap it up so and it's it's so much fun
to speculate it really is but let's
weave
we have two relevant pieces of listener
mail this week and as always we thank
our listeners for sending them in and I
this what the first one is from someone
who says I don't mind if you get my name
wrong because i live in serbia so it
doesn't matter that is verbatim thank
you well I'm going to try my bestest is
from sieben said lon that's correct yeah
that is correct except except for the
fact if his from Serbia if he missed
some diacritics but if his name is
written like this then he's sitting said
Lance even said lon okay well good i got
one right for once maybe he says hi i
love the podcast it makes an early trip
to school very fun thank you that's
that's great to hear a couple episodes
back Brandon talked about how we could
change the screen texture on a
smartphone so that when you use the
stylus it feels like pen on paper
recently I read about a company called
tactile which is promising a drastic
change in screen technology they believe
that when you're typing on a soft
keyboard the glass could change so that
buttons appear on it when you're done
typing the buttons just disappear and he
says that's pretty much possible today's
technology you can find the commercial
on on youtube so this we've we've talked
about this before and we spent so much
time on the air talking about it that we
shouldn't talk about it too much right
now but you are absolutely correct
sipping like we we've seen technology
demoed from companies that essentially
changes like it places a it changes the
voltage of the current that's that the
screen is running on so it increases
resistance when you touch it based on
how much voltage they're running through
there which is really really cool I mean
like you know you can be running your
finger along the thing and then they amp
up this you know the amp up the charge
and all of a sudden your fingers like
sticking to the screen which is awesome
and you guys remember we were waiting
for the iphone 5 and we got the iphone
4s and one of the features rumored for
then the iphone 5 was this thing yeah
yeah that would have been so it is Oh
would have been great I mean it is it's
a really cool idea and it's something I
think we will see because I still hear
this today guys I just heard it the
other day from someone who would
switched from his blackberry to an
iphone
and he was like yeah I love it I love
everything about it I can't really get
used to the keyboard still and it had
been a couple weeks and of course he'll
get used to the keyboard at some point
but it is going to be inferior for a lot
of people regardless of how long they're
given to get used to a soft touch
keyboard there's something about that
tactile response and you know it touch
screens will find a way to replicate
this and the it'll become widespread
once it becomes useful what in a broad
sense and I'm looking forward to it
because it's going to be the next cool
thing I can't wait to review a
production version of something like
tactile they also even pre-production
yeah absolutely ends on that yeah oh man
I'm but there's something to be said for
that tactile feedback my first and right
well windows mobile days all of my
windows mobile phones save one had a
slide out keyboard I even had the AT&amp;amp;T
tilt yeah till to running it on tmobile
which apparently is illegal now hunter
after January but it had a keyboard when
I switched to android my g1 had a
keyboard then I went with a nexus one
and no keyboard but my next phone after
that I went back to a keyboard the g2 it
since then I've I've just moved on
because devices you have boards because
there's going to spec with yeah the ones
without people and I live with it but
that tactile feedback we're tactile
pretty that's why we have fingers that's
why we can feel stuff satisfying in a
way that either touchscreen is not a
still breakout don't make fun of me I
still break out the veer every so often
and it yet as the tiniest keyboard ever
but that key response is so cliquey and
it's so it's just so satisfying in a way
that a touchscreen can't be sipping also
by the way it just by way of note I just
got the jelly bean update for my galaxy
s3 and I was wondering if you could ask
Anton if he's still waiting for you no I
got it actually two weeks ago turns out
that my galaxy s3 was a UK unit so i got
at the moment they started rolling out
the UK jelly bean update or
congratulations
Tony I ain't waiting for my jelly bean
update if the rumors are true use and
waiting on 2 2013 I know and you know
what I'm done waiting I'm hi mum I'm
just done Joe are you running a jelly
bean on your device over there of course
you are one of your for Galaxy Nexus is
all the next CD running jellybean the
the nexus 7 of course is running
jellybean i think the the motorola xoom
is running eat early but he's not
waiting for 4.2 yeah yeah yeah waiting
waiting 7 thank you for the for the for
the for the letter he says it's always
keep up the good work and I'm a nice day
assuming you have a good day too I'm
sorry if I did end up butchering your
name thank you for the for the letter
and finally one from William who says
I've been using my iPad once my iPad one
excuse me since the launch I've been
using it as a computer with I work I
only use it like that because I cannot
afford a laptop and now I have budget
for laptop about the price of a macbook
air I'm wondering if that is a smart
decision to carry on buying tablets as a
laptop replacement all I do is surfing
the web using apps playing simple games
and doing some homework but now with the
ipad mini coming i'm wondering if the
ipad mini is going to suit my needs
better than the ipad since it has a
lower powered processor or i guess as
well as the ipad image so what in your
opinion is the best suiting product as a
three categories for my needs thank you
by the way I love your podcasts Thank
You William guys this is an interesting
question to me because I was in a
Starbucks yesterday writing an article
and an old woman was kind of walking
around you know in a friendly manner
hassling people about what computers
that were using because she was in the
market for a computer and the girl
behind me was using an iPad with a
keyboard dock and the woman's like now
what is that and you know the girl was
like well it's an iPad or the keyboard
and this is what oh well I could do that
I could buy a tablet instead and save
some money and have a keyboard
attachment and I feel like this is the
question of 2012 it's it's it's going to
be the question of 2013 it was sort of
the question of 2011 do I need to buy a
laptop or should I buy a tablet and try
and make that my primary device for
William specifically for a user who
specifically all i do is surfing the web
using apps playing simple games and
doing some homework I don't see why a
computer is necessary to you for those
of us who don't know what is I work I
work as Apple's suit of so-called office
applications so we're not talking remote
desktop type no no it just is word
processing spreadsheets and
presentations yeah in tablet form so I
mean it on the top yeah I'm the tablet
right so I mean okay for William seems
to be the prototypical case of a
customer who doesn't need a computer who
can actually who's one of these millions
of people who are buying tablets in lieu
of buying a laptop or a notebook or a
net but you know an ultrabook or a
netbook so I yeah I mean William just
from from my perspective it sounds like
you are the perfect case to buy a tablet
and I think you should stick with the
full size because I think as we just
discussed with the ipad mini the second
iteration of the mini is going to be
better and even though it's less
portable the bigger version will
probably serve you better particularly
if you're using a keyboard dock with it
but it what is go ahead let me clear up
the his second way I agree if that's all
you do then it's not necessary for you
to buy a macbook gear or any other
laptop for that reason now since i work
as Pages Numbers and Keynote as I said
there's not a huge difference in doing
this particular things which you are
doing between the full-sized ipad and
the ipad mini yes the ipad mini has a
slower processor it's still faster than
the ipad one you are using so it's yeah
it's the ipad one it's the ipad mini and
then it's the ipad 3d ip3 is the fastest
among all but just for a comparison sake
the ipad one has the same resolution as
the ipad mini but the ipad mini has a
faster processor so it will drive those
applications faster it will be slower
than the ipad 3 of course but for word
processing homeworks slight games and
web browsing you're better off with an
ipad mini if if portability is your
thing if you don't care about the full
size that will go with the the ipad 2 or
3 or 4
make sure your eyes are good yeah now as
far as accessories for keyboards and
whatnot are there have we seen any
keyboard accessories for the ipad mini
yet or we look in it you can use any
apple bluetooth keyboard to connect to
your tablet right but if sure absolutely
but yeah you want to go with like a case
like the logitech that is a hard back
case / keyboard no we don't have any of
those for the million we have some ducks
but we don't have that form well we've
got yen this is something brand-new from
yesterday from this company called pad X
or PA da CS seems to have a robot a mini
case that includes a keyboard for the
end of battery for the ipad mini but
this is brand-new like this the stories
from yesterday that i'm looking at so i
don't know if it's if there's a pre
production version looking at i think
there is no question that many of these
are coming and you'll have a lot of
options so you know i don't know we'll
see how that goes but it's a good
question i look forward to seeing more
and more tablets with keyboard docks out
in public and as people kind of make
this decision because it's cool to save
money and it's cool to save money and
also get something that maybe you didn't
expect to work as a full-time
replacement it's not for everyone I
would as much as I love tablets and
mobiles I would just die if I didn't
have an actual computer to you yeah
because you you know you do videos and
photo editing and video editing and
stuff like that even just for even just
for browsing sometimes I just want to be
like okay I'm tired of moving my hand
around so much I just want to have the I
want to maintain the keyboard and mouse
you know touchpad paradigm for sometimes
it's just more comfortable so I get it
you know it's whatever its lilium let us
know what your decision is what you have
purchased yeah yeah yeah and keep in
mind that this is exactly what Microsoft
is trying to figure out with their
surface their windows 8 and windows RT
yeah all of that is is it a desktop
computer or is it a tablet and os
limitations of both and what they're
trying to do so make sure you you at
least look at those articles as we
continue to write them on pocket now
because yeah we don't know the industry
doesn't know exactly how to do it yet
you're asking a question that the
biggest minds in the industry are still
trying to figure out how to get it right
so I'm with the opinion of these guys
what it sounds like you're doing right
now keep doing what you're doing a
tablets going to be better for battery
life and portability and you've already
proven it works for you so don't mess
with what works and wrapping this up
because I know we're gonna wrap this up
I have got to get to add I'm gonna give
you guys some homework if we call the
phablet's phablets because there are
between the smartphones and the tablets
how should we call the surface which is
between the laptop and the tablet
potatoes tap top I borrowed compute tab
comput ave sounds like a sweet 1980s
sci-fi gadget yes or something that old
Steve Ballmer would have announced no
it's computer with reversi hey Michael
KITT can we find that video just that
that advertisement for what was it
windows one point of the one oh yeah I
have embedded it vertical I have
embedded it in the Windows Phone ad with
Steve Ballmer oh we've got to put that
in there if you haven't seen this
commercial it's hilarious I'll throw it
in the podcast post tell me if it's
alright with you and sure yeah I've
listeners if you haven't seen this
commercial please do watch it but we
have to wrap it up cuz we're so far over
time that it's that it's just ridiculous
gentlemen anything anything further no
it will be a time waster and we already
have our comments on the length of our
podcast do it so done good job but its
its quality it is all quality wheat we
hopes and for the sake of all of those
who think it's too long jump around
that's all I say about that yeah and
this is this is an exception this is
both quantity and quality yes absolutely
and modesty and a lot about modesty to a
full extent and hats it had some hats on
the buffer that's what the show is gonna
be called from now on uh guys that wraps
it up for episode of the pocket net
