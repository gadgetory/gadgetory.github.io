to ask for a pretty average lb at
wellspect smart phone well what if a
tablet came in the box along with it
that's the question
AT&amp;amp;T is putting to customers come June
6th when it opens pre-orders for the
unique a sous pad phone x i'm michael
fisher with pocket now and this is your
unboxing and first look the box for the
ped phone X is large but otherwise
typical AT&amp;amp;T with orange and white
branding and precious little else
opening the box reveals the pad phones
tablet dock up front with the smartphone
down one layer in its own dedicated Bay
if a tablet and smartphone in the same
box aren't enough for you you do get
something extra here bundled earbuds
which we're always happy to see down at
the bottom of the typical wall charger
with 2 amp output and a USB cable along
with some product literature warranties
and so on the hardware itself will be
familiar to anyone who's been following
the PadFone line the tablet portion is
just a cradle for the smartphone
providing a 9 inch 1920 by 1200 display
for a pixel density of around 251 in
pixels per inch it's embedded battery is
quite large at nearly 5,000 milliamp
hours that augments the 2300 milliamp
hour battery on the smartphone itself a
Snapdragon 800 powered device with 2
gigs of RAM 16 gigs of on-board storage
and microSD expansion to an additional
64 gigs the screen is 5 inches at 1080p
and the camera around back is 13
megapixels with an Isuzu i running atop
Android 4.4.2 again the phone provides
all the connectivity and processing
power when it's docked to the tablet so
it's got a TN t--'s full range of radios
including LTE advanced compatibility and
support for PMA wireless charging but
not sadly Qi in the hand the docked pay
is reasonably compact though at a
combined mass of 664 grams you're
definitely gonna know it's in your bag
it's comfy to hold with its matte finish
and the bezels while huge to allow for
easy handling and they also provide
space for the front
speakers always a plus the asou software
layer is reminiscent of the company's
Zen UI and it's pretty thick but it's
necessary for jumping between phone and
tablet modes as smoothly as possible
it's certainly not without its
compromises but after a few hours of use
we can safely say that pad phone X is
definitely bringing something
interesting here for those looking to
get the most for their dollar now
whether it's actually a good buy remains
to be seen but we're certainly looking
forward to finding out as we head into
our full review to make sure you don't
miss it
