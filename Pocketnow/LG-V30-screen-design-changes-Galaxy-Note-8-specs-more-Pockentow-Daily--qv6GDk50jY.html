changes in the display technology that
might not be two screens Samsung Galaxy
Note a details claimed storage options
that we've been waiting for and ten
years of iPhone didn't really get
celebrated as we were expecting I'm
hiding that Ravana and I did start my
Friday celebrations ever since yesterday
and who's counting this is pocket out
daily one of the biggest hurdles to
adopt project five is the steep price
tag of getting into project five because
there are no Nexus devices anymore you
have to buy a pixel but apparently that
is going to change because that moto X 4
that's been rumored lately which is
funny because the Moto X was number
really a budget phone is apparently
going to be the budget option for
project I can't wait to see how that
goes now let's talk about the one plus
five if you remember yesterday we were
talking about that whole jelly effect
that some users were talking about and
that one plus was investigating
apparently oneplus has already ended its
investigation and it turns out that it's
considering this lis pretty normal
behavior and sure the jelly effect that
we have see on some other videos is
pretty much just the way material design
works in certain applications I'm not
necessarily saying that this is okay but
it seems that that is going to be how
oneplus is going to handle this well and
I guess the reason why we didn't report
on the whole 10 years of iPhone thing is
because we were waiting to see what
Apple did and it turns out the company
didn't really do anything it seems that
if there is any sort of commemoration
for one of the smartphones that pretty
much change the industry
I guess wouldn't have to wait for apples
next event still if you want to see why
the iPhone has been so crucial to smart
phones there's a full info graph in the
third link in description and for those
of you that are wondering what will the
Galaxy Note 8 bring that's different
when compared to the Galaxy S 8 plus
we've got some trusted sources claiming
that in addition to that Google camera
at the back apparently we will be
getting more storage options you will
get 64 and 128 gigabytes of storage and
that's actually great we're just not
sure exactly where those 128 gigabytes
of storage will be concentrated because
of the rumors of this film costing a
thousand dollars are true yeah it's
going to be
and finally the very interesting rumors
they acted with the lgb 30 mainly
because this phone was really
interesting up to the rumors of project
joan we would be getting two sort of
displays one of these being a display
you slide out and you get extra user
interface elements the problem is that
according to new sources that is not
going to happen with the lgb 30 the only
change that we're getting is that we're
getting an OLED display apparently the
whole IPS LCD and the whole dual display
technology is going away even the
existing dual display technology that we
currently see on the lgbtq 20 is
apparently going away which leads me to
the question of the day are you ok with
the dual displays going away or do you
think that this is what made the b20 and
the v10 important in my case I wouldn't
mind the dual displays going away I just
for me it's sad I mean the LGB 30 was
supposed to be the vanguard phone from
LG and it seems that all it's going to
do is comply with daydream leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion brands you know the lid
goes if you want to get bit earlier
before the video was filmed but let's
not find out our comm and ink that
subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one you also follow me
on Twitter hang on there's what we
better run into the ground but finally
that please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am hi
navigator thank so much for watching
we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
