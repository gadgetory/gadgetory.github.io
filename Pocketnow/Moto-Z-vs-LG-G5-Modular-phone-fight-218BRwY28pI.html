coming right to phones with very
different ideas on how to customize and
accessorize but those manufacturing
differences run deep throughout each
phone from design to build materials to
the software on tap let's start with
build quality motorola is going for lean
super lean the g5 is far from chunky but
it feels thick after handling the moto z
LG is blazing its own trail with the g5
introducing a new design language we've
not seen before metal frame with a
primer like paint coating the exterior
beauty might be in the eye of the
beholder but the metal and glass combo
of the Z looks like it might edge better
over time
fit and finish also lands with the Moto
Z we like the rear fingerprint sensor on
the g5 but the chin slider still doesn't
fit as flush as we'd like for a premium
handset the Moto mod pins on the Z look
a little techy like exposed circuits but
it's designed around a magnetic system
which is built to cover those pins but
we totally expect that the fiddly little
power and volume buttons will turn some
people off and the chin mounted
fingerprint sensor is definitely
unfamiliar for operating like a power
button instead of a home button still
it's easier to see the premium nature of
this phone when it's made out of
materials we associate with luxury now
talking about screens LG shrank the g5
display down a touch we now have a 5.3
inch quad-hd LCD that slightly tighter
pixel pitch doesn't quite beat the
colorful and contrast II 5.5 inch AMOLED
screen on the moto the Z screen is also
easier to read in sunlight thanks to a
more consistent high brightness mode the
g5 technically should be able to crank
brighter at least according to LG
marketing materials but we can't ever
seem to get it that bright and these two
differ noticeably in terms of software
LG's UI still holds to an older
tradition of altering nearly everything
about the Android interface Motorola
continues to offer an almost stock
software vibe LG even initially tried to
get rid of the app drawer shame on you
LG but they cut out some options like
split screen apps possibly in
anticipation of Android n but we do
still have some interesting controls to
automate certain behaviors like pairing
with Bluetooth devices or setting a home
location
to toggle Wi-Fi motorola hasn't really
changed anything here to the point where
it can be somewhat Stark customizing
home screens the biggest departure from
stock Android is this moto assistant
which augments what you can do with
voice Actions now powering that software
both phones share familiar hardware
welcome 820 chipsets backed up by four
gigabytes of RAM so we aren't surprised
to see similar performance in daily
operations judging flagship phones by
how they open email is a bit silly so
jumping directly to more graphics
intensive games the Moto X out a victory
while not completely lag free the Z
plays Marvel future fight smoother than
the g5 stepping down from this tier
though even gaming performances often at
ion games like implosion or that sweet
sweet candy crash action moving to
camera tech the g5 pulls ahead here for
still photos LG delivers a much more
feature complete app for adjusting
settings and includes the ability to
capture raw images for folks who like to
edit the dual sensor experiment is also
a lot of fun to play with is the super
wide angle lens opens up photographic
possibilities the Z just can't match the
only area where the Moto has any
leverage is in shooting video where the
Moto Z can adjust exposure and has an
HDR option to augment color nice
features to be sure but not enough to
unseat how much LG has grown in terms of
camera tech over the last couple years
what is surprising though is seeing how
these two phones trade places for audio
actual speaker quality is pretty close
but the Moto gets the win for pointing
that speaker in the right direction a
headphone audio is a solid win for
Motorola - we still aren't able to use
an LG DAC friend with us a carrier
branded g5 so testing the built-in
headphone jack is something of a
disappointment after coming from the LG
v10 the Moto Z's adapter kind of bums us
out but we do get a higher quality audio
signal from the z4 purists the Motorola
will truncate high resolution audio
downsampling playback to 16 bit but it
has a louder amp and better dynamic
range than what the LG can produce now
checking out battery life this is a
pretty close fight while some
manufacturers increased capacity this
year both the Moto Z and LG g5 took
small steps backwards in terms of
battery size 2,600 and
eight hundred million power respectively
in testing run time though the Moto Z
has the smaller battery it seems to
perform better in our media benchmark
streaming 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 50 percent brightness the Moto
Z with a brighter AMOLED display drained
6% of its battery while the g5 with a
dimmer LCD drained 7% the LG does charge
faster than the Moto in our testing
however 30 minutes on the included
chargers the LG topped off close to 55
percent of its battery while the best we
could manage from the Moto Z was 38%
lastly do we really need to detail the
differing methods for modular
accessories here motorola wins first
LG's friends are somewhat lonely the
camera grip has limped out into the
market we can't play with the B&amp;amp;O DAC
and that's it for this slider hardware
Motorola has several moto mods ready for
launch from simple style back plates to
a battery pack to a speaker mod and a
projector so we're actually able to tell
you about this system plus the actual
operation is a solid win for the Moto
amazing things those magnets and pogo
pins slap a mod to the back of your
phone and you're using it that's it nice
and easy having to reboot your g5 to
swap on a camera grip is cumbersome and
feels half-baked unfinished true modular
phones might be right around the corner
but moto wins for having real consumer
facing accessories and actual partners
onboard to create interesting options
for Moto Z owners so we should wrap this
up where does that leave us between the
Moto Z and the LG g5 both companies
should be commended for taking risks and
pushing into unfamiliar territory for
design build quality and novelty both
phones also have some compromises which
might be deal-breakers for individual
consumers when comparing both phones
based on what the manufacturers are
highlighting as the unique features of
each device we can't help but feel that
Motorola has the more successful
solution here that's not to say we don't
think someone out there shouldn't buy a
g5 camera snobs like me would probably
gravitate towards LG's shooter more than
Motorola's but when you chalk up the
reasons for why someone might spend over
$500 on a phone the
days if we're paying for a modular
accessory platform we'd like to be able
to use what we pay for as always thanks
