months now how's it holding up -
scratches and blemishes this is the
iPhone 5 durability report let's get to
it
hey guys it's Brandon banana from pocket
NomCom now before I show you my iPhone 5
after 4 months of use a couple of things
I want to mention number one I do not
use a case in fact I don't believe in
cases I think they take away from the
beauty and the functionality of the
device so I've been using the iPhone 5
completely naked for the last four
months
number two I've never dropped this phone
I promise you I've never dropped it on a
hard surface I might have dropped it on
carpet but who's keeping track it has
never hit the pavement I promise you
that and number three I haven't baby
this phone nor have I treated it roughly
kind of somewhere in the middle I never
placed the iPhone 5 in a pocket with
keys or other hard objects to avoid
scratches but I don't place it perfectly
on a tabletop like some people do to
make sure that it doesn't touch any of
the edges of the table or whatever I
treat it like a normal phone anyway
let's take a closer look at the iPhone 5
after 4 months of use and of course your
results may vary you might have a an
iPhone 5 that you've been using for four
months that's in pristine condition or
maybe you're on the other end and it is
beat to help from so let's take a look
at what I have with my iPhone 5 to start
off I would say that if I were to give
this a letter grade I'd give it a C
which is a pretty bad grade to give such
a quality piece of machinery here but as
you're gonna see there's a lot of
problems with the iPhone 5s quality not
build quality but the way that they
manufacture the device I want to start
off here on the screen if I tilt it just
right you're going to see a scratch here
you see that and a scratch here and
there are many other surface scratches
the camera is having a tough time with
that but trust me when I say I've got a
pretty deep scratch here deep scratch
here and a bunch of surface scratches
that I cannot remove let's turn over to
the back of the device I've got this
nasty Nick down here that's right into
the aluminum there the anodized aluminum
has chipped off and then worse is the
beveled edge this chamfered edge is
destroyed not destroyed
it's pretty terribly marred around the
entire device you can see little Nick's
taken out look at that yeah that is Oh
bad taken out all around the device and
fortunately I've got the white iPhone if
I had the black iPhone it would be even
more apparent because the paint would be
chipped off leaving kind of a silvery
chip below the black anodization so this
is pretty bad and it carries on the
front two chips all around the device
and again I haven't been throwing this
thing around and every single iPhone 5
I've seen family and friends the exact
same thing is true chipped chamfered
edge all around so overall my iPhone 5
is not doing so well I'm gonna give it a
C in terms of the durability report here
