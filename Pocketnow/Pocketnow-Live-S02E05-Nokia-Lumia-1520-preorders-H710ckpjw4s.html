afternoon good evening everybody and
welcome to episode number five of season
number two of the pocket now live i'm
anton denied managing editor and i have
the utmost pleasure it's not everyday
Brenda minimum the editor-in-chief joins
us still warm welcome to Brandon minimum
hi Brandon yo how are you today you know
I am I want to talk about something real
quick and I actually want to see if we
can get some participation here I want
to talk about the nexus 5 because I've
actually returned my Nexus 5 um be which
is which is crazy because it's it's such
a good phone it's got android 4.3 it's
really fast the camera is better than
the nexus 4 but not amazing but the
screen see this is so washed out that I
just I can't do it I can't support the
nexus 5 because of the screen being
washed out it's really crisp really
clear but like it looks like there's a
white film over everything even at max
screen brightness so any guys here have
you gotten the nexus 5 again zone raise
their hand let's talk about the nexus 5
all right this guy right here in in New
of the Nexus 5 please unmute please
please unmute there should be eight ok
we heard we got you baby is back yeah
it's a little choppy um so do you have
your nexus 5 with you uh I'm looking at
school ok here's a tip for you
apparently or your speed internet
connection is not that fast so why don't
you just kill your camera and leave
audio only so we can hear what you're
saying that's it yeah it's somewhat
better hopefully it will become even
better just go ahead so so tell me tell
you think what you did laughing hi yes
I don't think this is going to work yeah
I don't think so Ian why don't you try
to join us again maybe your connection
will improve okay because so far we
can't hear anything you're saying okay
oh okay hold on no no now it's good done
and now it's bad again so let's make
yeah okay anybody else would a nexus 5
anyone else for the Nexus 5 no no no and
ok i'll ask you something I haven't seen
the nexus 5 yet but i do remember we had
a similar conversation regarding the
nexus 7 not this year's model but the
initial Nexus 7 and I told you that the
worst screen on the planet is on that
tablet now how did you compare the nexus
5 the Nexus 5's washed out screen with
the nexus 7's washed out screen if you
if you saw the nexus 7 from last year
it's the same deal like there's the
contrast isn't there the the the only
difference is that the clarity is there
this is a really high PP on the Nexus 5
but the same thing like the chrome icon
you know how it has like red and blue
and yellow it's not really like strong
red yellow and blue like LG doesn't know
how to make screens because they make
screens for apples devices so do you
think this might have been on purpose to
reduce gosht yeah i think it was to
reduce costs this is what i picture i
picture LG going into a room with Google
showing like five different panels with
little price tags above each of them
starting with the best with the g2
screen too expensive and it kind of went
down the line and they picked one that
for most people is good enough but it's
not of the quality of the g2 ok you know
what why don't you choose somebody from
down below to talk to and hopefully if
somebody comes in with the nexus 5 in
their hands will circle back to this all
right let's talk to Kareem
what's up a man where are you from I'm
from Egypt Egypt yeah finally somebody
on my own time zone Wow finally someone
on Tony's time zone so what what phone
are you using what I'm using that looks
like everybody's got connection problems
today yeah I couldn't hear you I did you
say I thought about you know to galaxy
note 2 that's a very respectable phone
it's are you considering getting the
note 3 to LA though I won't i won't put
it considering i won't buy no.3 this
deep not this year not this are you
running IE running stock TouchWiz on
your note to know actually rooted and
installed the TM 10.2 CM 10.2 cm11 is
going to be 4.4 based is that right by
they are open what is wrong with google
today it's really tough to hear you um I
don't think that's going to work can you
save your camera try to disable your
camera I don't think that that does much
but it's worth a shot okay try talking
now how could you turn out yes we can
hear you it's it's problem that we only
hear every fifth word you say okay until
Kareem fixes his problems let's talk to
somebody else let's talk to somebody
else I return sorry about that so who
has a really fast connection raise your
hand Tony now Tony you don't count this
guy here in the shadows uh min
yes finally yes it's like butter what
kind of connection are you on um I'm on
comcast but it's actually cuz my voice
been living be like I have like Paul for
like a few days awesome so what do you
want to talk about men um I'm actually
um I'm sorry I'm actually one haha no
cap 1520 the Nokia 15-20 let's tell what
do you what do you want to say about it
what do you think about it um I don't
know um it's like I was hoping that
Microsoft will bring them feature that
they have an artery Snap feature that's
well gaps 66 inch screen I was expecting
that but apparently not so like this
race me question it's like if they're a
snap feature what you gotta get-get no
Catholic enjoy yes I think yeah i mean
this the snap features a no-brainer i
mean in windows 8 it's it's such a big
deal especially in 8.1 because it's
better you can write you can resize it
to any degree whereas in Windows 8 you
can only do like a third at a time yeah
it's so it's so strange that they didn't
do the snap feature with especially with
such a big screen and 1080p support that
would have made it awesome i guess they
want you to get a s surface if you want
if you want to do snap well maybe they
are planning on that once we all have
heard rumors that Microsoft is planning
on unifying Windows RT and Windows Phone
so maybe Windows Phone 8.1 unify who'd
Windows RT will probably bring that two
phablets and maybe the rumored 7 inch
smaller service that would be sweet so
what would fun are using them um I
actually just got my endpoint 1020 oh
yeah that takes some good fix you got in
black yeah and you have a case on um
yeah cusp if I actually don't I mean
like I don't like case it's kind of bulk
up phone but like I they don't want to
take a chance of dropping it on
cuz i bought is a lot so I don't have
any warranty stuff like that you babe
like 800 bucks for that oh I school I
got unmet me for like 600 oh not bad hey
let me ask you does the does the Oreo on
the back bother you because when i was
using a 1020 and i put it down on a
table you know is kind of like you know
not very stable yeah that happened to me
yesterday i was testing and it's kind of
awkward because whenever i hold it like
Dario keep getting away and like it's
really awkward just call and text and so
I try to put it on tape all in half and
the thing happened what happening is
like is wobbling around so it is it's
just awful like maybe ask you this I'm
not right let me ask you this eventually
the humps going to be gone technology's
going to be good enough to wear that
they can they can keep the peer review
of 41 megapixel camera in a slim form
factor without the hump you think we're
going to get that next year do you think
it's going to be 2015 or do you think
it's going to be a long time until we
have like that dream phone with that
awesome camera in a slender body i would
say next year just cussed a 1520 if you
look at the camera home I mean is still
half a home but I mean it's 20 20
megapixel it's not that big anymore and
this I believe the Sony Xperia I forgot
what was it the one with 20 min hae the
seat 1a xperia z1 yeah i mean like i
don't think that won't happen camera hum
right no it was like us but we're
talking 20 to 40 min I mean that's a
doubling of well pixels yeah but I mean
technology the one gear as I feel like
Nokia or any OEM should figure out how
to put a full on mega pixel without come
because it's really starting to bother
me like and I just got this yesterday
well I think the hump is not necessarily
because of the sensor but but it's more
about the optical image stabilization
and older motors and everything which
keeps the actual sensor and lenses in
sync when you take a picture so it's not
that much
the sensor itself it was back in the 808
days when because of the sensor it had
to be a little bit of thumb but on the
1020 I think it's about that it
construction the entire system that's
what makes it thicker you know what we
haven't seen anything about is optical
zoom on a camera that would be awesome
optical zoom on the samsung galaxy s4
zoom my friend which is why would I they
reckon in repose you know what i mean i
think that like whoever figures it out
first without a hump is going to get a
lot of a lot of buzz cuz like the other
day I a little story I woke up in the
morning and there was a deer caught in
my fence right and I didn't really want
to get near it because you know so I try
to take a picture of this deer and I was
so far away so I did the little pinch to
zoom and I got so blurry and I'm just
thinking like why can't there be optical
zoom on a smartphone camera yet like I
mean you look at like some point and
shoot cameras like some Sony cameras are
some Nikon's that are really small and
they have zoom and the lens doesn't
perjure that much like that would be
okay if the lens protruded a little bit
when you were zooming yeah but on the
other end the Lumia 1020 fixes that you
don't need the optical zoom you have the
that 41-megapixel canvas and you can
just select five megapixels out of the
entire canvas and boom there's your zoom
yeah a big something like I
cannot find Robbie Turner when I take
pictures and weird the Rob picture will
be available to you was in replication
half and and 10 I can just a 5 megapixel
yeah antenna like I cannot find him how
do you want me getting soaked yeah the
34 megapixel version is saved on your on
your phone and you'll be able to access
it once you hook it up to your computer
either Mac or Windows ok alright Anya
let's move on do you want to know please
be her be the one who selects the next
color hey Becca alright see men nice dog
I want to talk to the guy who's in the
car who has disappeared oh no there he
is I've got my buttons and messed up is
it is it room L yeah hi there can hear
me yeah you are there leave where are
you a recon from yeah i'm a i'm coming
from a london UK nice what kind of car
you in Alexis Alexis dan I mean darn is
it is it your Lexus are you riding with
someone vice- mine yeah I just parked up
and aware of facebook and i saw the the
post about the hangout session so i
thought miles was running so the
connections pretty good when I are you
an LTE right now our Wi-Fi 4g t-mobile
will e UK really fast connection i get
about 40 megabits per second so it's
quite good wow that is excellent and
what phone are you talking on at the
moment I've got galaxy s4 I got that
upgraded about six months ago and it's
due me stomach great I used to have an
iphone switch over to android and a I
love it this is best but I bad it's so
funny thing that the galaxy s4 was
released six months ago which means a
galaxy is fine is not too far off what
do you what are you thinking with the
five yeah that's a thing cuz i'm i'm on
contract to your contracts I can't
upgrade a get a new phone so if it's a
substantial improvement on this floor I
might just sell this in this by by the
phone unlocked from a from the shop
spaghetti what would have to be
different for you to sell that at the S
4 from five um I would think if you had
a faster processor Snapdragon 800 maybe
we may be the next generation I think
it's gonna have a 64-bit and if taps are
optimized for the chip that would be
something that would be interested in
but i don't think the s4 is a big of
improvement on the s3 apart from a few
of the gimmicks which I don't I don't
really use like all those gesture
movements and all that
yeah do you keep that stuff turned off
yeah well yeah basically turned off and
the battery life is always isn't all
that to be honest I barely get about a
day's usage from it so I got pretty much
a percent of passive mode on and that's
before the day if you're doing a lot of
hangouts I can understand why he from
kinking Henry lane yeah but yeah
generally if it was a major improvement
than I would be interesting in the
otherwise i'll just wait for two years
Timmer contracts finished and then I'm
upgrade to work the best phone at a time
and you're using apple headphones on
your hands you know the galaxy ones to
the gaijin yeah you once they're just
like Apple cuz they're white and I got
the clicky hang on it go figure Brennan
yeah well is Lyra is there anything else
you want to talk about him i was looking
to get a tablet uh I'm not one and the
so many out there but I would like to
get android based on but just let you
just let's get your pin is on which you
think would be the best one to get maybe
look big size 1 i'll tell you what the
nexus the new nexus 10 should be out
soon so you should probably wait to to
make your decision until then but the
new Nexus 7 is really really good my
only complaint about it is that there's
a software bug where like overnight it
drains a lot of battery like when it
Winston standby but I think it's gonna
get a 4.4 update soon which should fix
that but like the display quality the
speed it's it's just such a good tablet
and you'll really appreciate how it kind
of fits in one hand and it's it's just
very if you can put in your pocket it's
it's small enough for that so I think
that's your best bet that's great I'll
definitely consider thanks excellent
alrighty well thank you for joining us
from your car and we'll see you next
time just let's have a big fan of you
guys i want your youtube channel every
day so that's quite the book we
appreciate that alright see ya thank you
you want to take another one brandon or
should i because i'm having some issues
i cannot see any video I can listen to
audio but there's no video on my and so
can you guys see me yeah
Cole's gone going just fine okay so you
want to take somebody or should i pick
somebody why don't you a pic someone now
all right let's let's see a Korean did
you fix your problems oh well could you
hear me now yes it's it's somewhat
better yes better than all right okay so
what were we talking about earlier well
I was we were talking about cm11 yes and
Brandon said that it will most likely be
based off of Android for that forked get
yeah I got me release it for next for
for the next four well I'm sure that
there will be there will be options
nightlies to download on most of the
popular phones I mean right now there
are a lot of Android for that for builds
for for the Galaxy Nexus even for the
nexus s 4g 24 i can actually name a
phone which which is a recent phone that
does not have a for that for built its
not cyanogenmod but a for that for AOS
beam oh yeah recently i'm running the
android 4.4 launches like the and you're
running that on + grade for that free
yeah and yeah that's a I'm sorry go
ahead brandon i was gonna say way so
what did you download a an APK and kind
of sad load it yeah i would be for the
launcher and some new apps from Google
from android 4.4 when people said that
they had some bugs because there were
some compatibility issues between the
new launcher from KitKat and previous
builds of android now I see that Thiago
is also showing us that he has that do
you have any bugs yeah with the camera
app I have a bug in the whole sphere the
crashes everytime maybe that's because
of the drivers but for the launcher
itself does it work as it fluid and a
little bit laggy it's a little bit laggy
what what phone are you using a samsung
galaxy note 2 oh it shouldn't be laggy
under no to that thing was fast it is
fast but the launcher it still fits
little planning okay here's a question
you got a note 2 and the note 3 is out
how come you have not updated to do
three I mean I I know the reasons why
somebody should not upgrade but I want
to hear your thoughts well I didn't find
the note 3 textured back later pictures
back come on you like the hyper blaze
more than the faux leather oh yeah okay
you know what me too but let me I and
also the the side was a little bit like
a notebook was what was change it wasn't
like the Samsung Galaxy s4 I like that
design of the same to the gods is for
more than everybody more 30 they had two
in dramatic I can hear somebody else
that can go ahead Sorry Sorry green go
ahead and Ian please mute your
microphone thank you yes so this was the
main reason for not upgrading and also I
i recently bought the note 2 so it has
been a little bit over six month with me
is it is a key contract or did you buy
it unlocked and not was all that was on
lock oh so you're not tied into a
two-year contract but uh no no no no
that's better yeah okay anything else
you want to talk about you want to ask
me you're Brandon well nothing else I
guess I could ask about I guess I'll
leave it some someone else sure no
problem tell everybody if you have
Google+ Facebook Twitter and you would
like people to follow you like you or
tweet at you feel free to pimp your
social media who could tweet me at shed
on this court takes it well that's my
twitter name or Twitter awesome yeah
thank you very much for joining us have
an awesome awesome weekend stay safe
Brandon back to you back to me Tony I've
got a question for you please what phone
are using these days i'm using the lumia
1020 in a combination with the s4 octa
Wow because i was using the HTC One and
its final
he got android for that three and
apparently it broke my connection
between my phone and my mac the android
connector no longer detects my HTC one
because the HTC One is stuck in MTB mode
which I hate so much so i can no longer
transfer files or pictures or documents
or music between my mac and my one so i
got so frustrated i took out the S 4
from my drawer and now that's the combo
hmm got it what what funny are you
looking forward to getting next well
let's add it's a tricky one huh I
thought of the iphone 5s but then again
i saw that there's a little difference
between the 5s and the five so i'm
skipping this year's iphone i always was
in love with the LG g2 but by the time
i'm gonna get g2 is gonna be stale so
let's stay with this statement for the
moment i'm not planning on getting any
phones maybe after CES for mwc very good
well i'm gonna pick someone else now i'm
gonna pick rj thank you for talking to
me sure goodbye first kid hey RJ you
there you'll have to a mute first he has
to unmute are gay unmute all right let's
go to Tiago hello can you hear me oh
yeah loud and clear how's it cuz I know
a man what what phone were you holding
up earlier it's a bit of an older phone
it's the sony ericsson xperia arc oh
thats that was a nice phone i enjoy it
even though it's still a single call i
am running a cyanogenmod 10.2 on it i
think your signage in my 10.2 it lags
yes us but I should be getting a new
phone soon hopefully a nexus 5 ooh I
think you'll be happy with the nexus 5
unless you're a display freak like me
now the only problem is a I'm actually
calling from South Africa Johannesburg
and just just like a Kevin last week
it's it's
not really it's not easy to get any
Nexus device besides besides the Nexus 7
tell me about South Africa you've got
any more I think but the problem with
importing is a the price goes up
drastically where you guys will be
paying I think it's a three fifty
dollars for the 16 gig will be paying
maybe round about equivalent to maybe
six hundred dollars and that is a good
price because some European countries
like mine and our colleague hi main
Honduras we pay way more like 657 750
for a nexus phone well yeah that that is
quite area and also hearing here in
South Africa phones in general are quite
expensive i mean everyone who wants to
get a decent high-end phone goes for a
contract even though luckily all phones
Soulja are unlocked so we can use them
on all networks so one of that whether
sound that works like in South Africa
they're not they're not too bad I mean
we've most networks have at least 3g
only two networks have LTE and even then
the signal is is kind of sketchy it's
some areas will work good other areas
not so much we still starting out at
that right so what's the name of the
carrier you use MTN it's one it's one of
the biggest ones here it's between MTN
and Vodacom and Europe at mtm is is that
also present in some European countries
MTN I'm not sure but I know that they
present in most African countries she'll
probably somewhere in Europe too because
they are familiar I'm sorry for
interrupting maybe no no problem it's
always it's always interesting to hear
about how other countries do cellular
networks because for the longest time
the US was so behind and then the u.s.
like was ahead in LTE and other
countries are just getting LTE now yeah
which is called a perception difference
Brendan because what you guys call LTE
some European countries offered that
speed on 4G or HS DB plus so it's it's
all about how you market you
speeds not necessarily about the
technology itself because I I've been on
fast 4G or HS DB plus networks in Europe
which were faster than some of your LTE
speeds oh yeah yup yum yum so it all
depends but yes if we talk like textbook
LTE the u.s. is ahead but with eight
percent or eighty five percent
smartphone adoption rate until until you
get to south korea with the LTE advanced
lte-advanced yeah just kind of just
going to mention that so that's like
what is that up to 100 megabits per
second that's way faster than Wi-Fi I
know it's really fast that's about as
much as I know about it so so Tiago when
let's let's think about like a the next
few years when we've got speeds even
beyond that up to maybe a gigabit per
second far faster than what we get on a
landline unless you have google fiber or
something with like what do you think we
can do with all this bad with like is he
going to be just all weekend us you know
go to web page faster there's got to be
like new uses for all this speed I'm
sure there will be I mean first of all I
gotta feeling by then storage will also
grow exponentially I mean we might have
phones okay we talk about Samsung over
bloating their phones watch phone soon
come look like 16 gigs worth of software
just you never know and then to update
that you're going to need a really fast
connection yeah that's interesting so
that's our to knows brandon you believe
in OS in the cloud for phone I don't I
don't I don't see that there's an
advantage to that in terms of power and
you know data is expensive I mean the
carrier still today you know don't give
you my key here in South Africa mobile
data is really really expensive so Wi-Fi
still going to be the thing for a while
when you're downloading apps and
multimedia yeah um so who knows you know
I mean I mean if you look at like the
difference between 3g and 4g or 2g and
4g like what are we doing that's
different we're doing some more video
calls we're at downloading attachments
more cloud based storage we're watching
more YouTube videos we're watching more
netflix over the air so there is a
difference mostly video so and like okay
okay is coming ah for kaif away so that
that could be like the next thing in
terms of because you know phones are
going to have 4k in 2015 we're already
talking about higher res in 2014 I mean
we've already got the some variants of
the note 3 filming in 4k and I remember
my phone my xperia arc they they market
it as forming in 720p it doesn't have a
720p screen the next year it was already
commercially available a 720p phone yeah
but Thiago you know that Samsung is the
note 3 is recording 4k video because
Samsung has also some 4k TVs which they
need to sell so at the moment I think
that's a huge marketing catch but yeah
4km phones will be here eventually I
don't know who wanted or what the
advantages are but which version of the
note 3 does 4k video um um I'm not sure
it's the it's not the one which we
reviewed but the other one oh whoa look
at that I know I checked around when it
came out they did say 4k video sir yeah
look I don't hear video size it says
three oh my gosh is reporting what's the
point like what are you gonna do with
that what are you gonna wait wait until
the price of 4k TVs go down from 5,000
to like you know anyway uh well they all
right expensive oh yeah thanks to thanks
for stopping by Tiago thank you so much
I mean I really wanted to thank you guys
for everything that you're doing usually
when I wake up is round about the time
when Jaime hi my releases his pocket not
daily and that's usually one of the
first things i watch in the morning so
let's hustle really thank you guys so
much for now fighting us being a reader
on the info thank you so much also for
this this this hang arts it's been
really enjoyable and I'll keep on
watching thank you thank you very much
and thanks bye ok bye Brendan still you
or do you want me to take this one why
don't you take this one
okay Tony you have to do it in a
southern American accent the whole thing
I'm not sure I can do that I can do
Russian accent if you want oh yeah
that's Russian accent no no I don't want
to creep all the people out oh don't be
let's talk to a Michael Michael please
unmute your microphone and let us talk
about whatever you want to talk about hi
guys what do you think is going to be
happen what do you think is going to
happen with the samsung galaxy s5 well
that's a tricky question first of all I
don't think that we will see an S 5 at
the very beginning of the year I think
that we will see the s5 summer around
March April or May just like we've seen
it this year and I think it will be a
phone which will be like so feature pack
then so spec back that it will be
unbelievable I'm guessing it will run
probably the next processor which comes
after the Exynos 5 if we're talking
about the Exynos version and the next
netdragon after the 800 I think it will
have at least three Ram I think I still
think it will be like 1080p but maybe a
little bit larger screen a new design
probably on the lines of the galaxy note
3 it will have a 16-megapixel optical
stabilized camera and here's note this I
think it will have a new version of
TouchWiz and I already have it my
prediction I disagree with most of that
except for the new version of TouchWiz I
think that's actually going to be the
hallmark feature I think that Samsung
has been working on a new version of
Android that's almost a forked version
but it still has touchwiz elements I
mean they've been criticized for years
now for their TouchWiz interface and I
think this year we're finally gonna get
away from that another thing that I
think we're going to see is an entirely
new design Tony because what always
happens is that the the s phone dictates
the note phone design and now we're back
around the cycle again except for this
year when when the note 3 had nothing to
do with the s4 um what do you mean I
mean it's got the it's it's it's got a
lot of similarities yeah but they
changed the materials I'm not saying
that I would not enjoy a premium
aluminum galaxy s5 so that'll be awesome
you know I was going to suggest that the
galaxy s5 will be metal but you know
remember the rumors about the new f
series of young I still think they're
going to do that I think that the only
way they can get that really lightweight
feel and the galaxy s is to go with
plastic so I think they're sticking with
plastic I think that they're they're
definitely going to have a textured back
like the note 3 and and the the other
one is a textured and the roundels oh
yeah like the galaxy round um it's I
agree with the 16 megapixel camera I
think it's going to be a really good
really good camera uh obviously I could
see them going to four gigs of RAM or
beyond because of the 64-bit thing if
they do with you if they do it because I
mean like everyone's asking with Apple
why 64 because the main advantage of
64-bit is you can address more than four
gigs of ram but like the million-dollar
question is what will they do with all
of that power yeah more TouchWiz more
mortgages Michael if the yellow cs5 is
anything like me and Brandon described
that would you buy um well it sort of
depends on generally the price point and
how good of a phone it was how many
features it did have well you know the
prices of the yellow stones are pretty
much the same here on here and it's
pretty much the best phone in the first
half of the year without a day yeah
definitely I'd say soon okay anything
else you'd like to ask us or you want to
talk about um do you think that the do
you think that something will have any
metal phones because and if you do when
will they bring them well there's this
rumor that they might bring the metal
body to a so-called f-series which
brandon just just mentioned which will
be a premium line up but so far the S
series was the premium line up so I'm
not really seeing how Samsung could
could go both ways within within its
lineup and portfolio of devices I think
it's a natural thing which they need to
do because people like really really
hate plastic these days
when it will happen summer around or
after mwc if it happens I'm skeptical a
bit okay I agree I don't think they're
going to change very quickly I think
late the earlier Samsung Galaxy Note
full-timer gonna sear maybe or maybe
summer during the summer they will
introduce like hey everyone this is the
new line this is the f-series phones
which is a completely premium phone it
costs like twice as much as the galaxy
s5 and you can buy it if you don't like
plastic who knows they could they could
do that too because you know there they
got power and money yeah they did
Michael anything else i know that's it
thanks awesome thank you very much for
joining gun come back next week okay
yeah definitely i buy brand them back to
you hey you know what I'm excited about
I'm excited about the HTC m8 I'm not why
because I'm guessing that it will
probably be too early in the year to
have specs worthy of beating the s5
which will come after it it will be in
the headlines for probably around one
month until the s5 comes out it will be
completely the same thing as the HTC One
is if the leaks we've seen recently are
any indication and HTC has to really
sort out that fingerprint scanner or
drop it because is now on the one max it
just is just there no one wants a
fingerprint scanner right I mean am I am
I crazy to say that no one cares about
fingerprint scanner unless you thought I
think by best I mean it's nice to have
like on the five s where it doesn't get
in the way I mean it's just it's right
there in the home button but um this
thing on the back and the move what the
and it doesn't even work that well I
mean why would you include a future if
it doesn't work that well did you see in
Michaels video when he showed out the
fingerprint scanner like how many times
he actually swiped his finger over the
camera instead of the fingerprint
scanner oh it's awful placement come on
um yeah I think I think you might be
right about the Emmy I think that hd's
gonna release it a little too early
because that's what they're they've been
doing and I think that'll be good in a
way because it'll get a lot of attention
fresh phone 2014 but it's going to have
probably a Snapdragon 800 nuts
dragon like 900 or whatever is coming
out next year um I think they have a lot
of a lot of things to do that they could
really improve upon that they're going
to do with the MA like a smaller form
factor i mean the the wood is so tone so
why they for the screen size i think
that you know boom sound is doesn't
really need to be improved the camera
come on the camera can finally be better
here's a question for you do you think
the the rumor is that the MA through
will ship would send six do you think
that HTC will have an overhaul of the
stands 5 or did will they go with the
same minimalistic look and just to add
more features hmm I think your incense
for the long haul and I think sent six
is going to look a lot like since five
and 5.5 because people really like it
and they did a good job and it's going
to be 4.4 based and all that good stuff
cool now a quick announcement before we
get back to you Brandon this week's
episode will be shorter one because both
Brandon and I have to do some other
stuff pocket not related stuff so we
were sorry in advance we're all still
gonna be here for like ten more minutes
which brandon will dedicate to the next
two calls yeah let's talk to hi Otto
how's it going hey um thank you for
favoriting my tweets a lot very nice
meeting what what what are you rocking
uh I have my custom Moto X oh yeah what
a case you up with a case on with the
case I yeah I just the the the nonwoven
ones just don't feel good so hey putting
a case on it but it honestly feels
better that way what sure sure what else
have you done with the ad the XO you
have AB like a cool blue back and what's
your accent color when they get the case
off your quick you want show your phone
I'm really up scream last time I was
here
it's been a while yeah whoa is that a
casar like a that is my first d brand
skin Oh deep brand looking good there we
go my Moto X has black x ask accents Oh
glad you are with the black front cuz
the white friend doesn't look very good
yeah I've seen that I've seen the white
front it just kind of looks i like that
i like the back in white but the front
kinda looks dirty and gross it does so
are you are you uh are you happy with
the Moto X I am extremely happy with it
and I for the first time in a really
long time I don't feel the need to get
any other phones out there oh come on
really you don't want the next five even
with the nexus 5 because it doesn't have
all the Moto X's feature is the active
listening and all that yeah the Moto X
is just such a good phone did you get
the software update for the camera I did
but you you can't fix the camera it's
it's the camera is unfixable it's so bad
how do you think the conversation went
in the motorola boardroom when they
present this motor Alexei engineers are
done with it and they take a picture do
they say oh it's it's crappy but
hopefully no one will notice like how do
you do that I mean it's sigh it's about
as as awful as the droid lineup on
verizon so it's probably just what
they're used to see what they're used to
here's a question of the Moto G is
rumored to be the Moto X's smaller
brother and it's rumored to have a 5
megapixel camera which would be much
smaller than the camera on the Moto X
what would people say if the lower end
camera on the Moto G would take better
pictures than the higher end camera on
the Moto X I mean I'd be very sad about
I think a lot of people would uh I think
a lot of people would be getting the
Moto G because it's supposed to be
cheaper from what I understand but it
would confuse people because people
mistake more megapixels as being better
so all of a sudden if a 5 megapixel
camera has something better than a
higher one is just for
about really bad yeah I'm sorry whether
you were about to add something when I
stepped in what about what about tablet
said did you get a nexus 7 actually last
night i picked up ipad air ooh wow
that's a space gray how many uh how much
storage it's just a 16 gig model I'm uh
this one I just got for about two weeks
like a review and then I might be
getting a getting aid my own device here
in the next month or so so what are your
first impressions of the air I like it
it's it's really really light and thin
and you know it's probably got the best
build and design of any tablet I've used
and I I'm not the biggest fan of iOS but
you know it's it's pretty good and you
can't be the app support so it's I'm
liking it so far yeah i mean the apps
are amazing only problem is that you
know Google considers obviously iOS
second class and so you don't get all of
the new stuff and the best features that
are on Android right but you know that's
that's kind of a boo although they did
just update the google search app so
that it's got more Google now features
I'm pretty sure it'll actually give you
the notifications similarly to how
Android does it does although I I've
never gotten a notification since the
update so I wonder if it like if you
have to key if you have to open it kind
of keep it in memory or probably owed
out assumes though are you uh do you
think you'll end up with the ipad with
retina display or do you think the air
is the we like the bigger screen test
I've been thinking about getting the
many we actually at the tmobile store i
work at we've had them sitting in we've
had two minis sitting in the back of our
store for about a week now and I've been
wanting to buy one yeah we can't sell
them yet obviously since they're not out
so I figured I would just fit the air
perfectly there's there there are some
issues with screen burn and with with
the screens of the ipad mini retina and
that's the reason why it's being delayed
so much rumors hope that's not an issue
with with the inventory we've already
got
okay where's the a midori located give
me a mature now it's um every time I
pick up the air I think like this is how
the first iPad should have been yeah and
I know the technology wasn't there for
it but like we went through two
generations of iPads that were so thick
and heavy it's just it's just I don't
even like them and we loved them yeah
yeah what I uh I just had a customer
come into my store the other day who
brought in his new ipad air and his
original first gen ipad he wanted to put
both on to our network since we have the
free two hundred megabyte plan and just
holding the two of them next to each
other in each hand was it's it's crazy
how different just half a pound can make
on a tablet how how much thinner the air
is hey I want to ask you about that two
hundred megabyte thing just for my own
purposes so like it if I buy an ipad air
I first of all I have to buy the 18 or
the t-mobile version right to get it uh
no because the air will actually work on
any network whichever model you have so
you buy the AT&amp;amp;T version doesn't matter
so then you you activate cellular data
and then you choose like t-mobile on the
iPad ready to take into a tmobile store
you would take into a tmobile store it's
ten dollars for the sim card and then
basically as uh you can get it on
prepaid or postpaid whichever one you
want with prepaid you have to it it's
free two hundred megabytes for life but
if you don't use it within 90 days they
will cut it so if you don't use what the
sim card yeah if you don't if you don't
access the network for 90 days they then
they'll just end the service just
because that's how prepaid works in
general with tmobile got it but it's
like its true like free 200 megabytes
mhmmm that's amazing house t-mobile's
LTE these days it depends on where you
are um I have actually had some really
good experiences with it it's it's not
quite as as fast as say a TNT's is and
I'm not sure about verizon because I've
never I haven't had them since I've had
a flip phone but
with 80 mg n AT&amp;amp;T LTE around my area is
about 30 to 50 megabits down okay one on
the day and t-mobile's is close to uh
I'd say about anywhere from 15 to 30 in
my apartment so it's it's it's pretty
good and especially considering how
recently it's been released it's it's
I'm surprised how good it is yeah and
they're catching up fast yeah it's still
not the coverage still isn't great in
not in like rural areas but if you're in
if you're in the city I you know I've
had any issues with t-mobile's coverage
awesome well thanks for thanks for
stopping by yo bro I think I'm going to
turn it over to Tony and if you think
the last goal and then we'll just wrap
it up why don't you take the last call
cuz I'm here every week and you're here
like every six months that is good Pablo
says t-mobile LTE has been awesome
awesome for me where's Pablo Pablo not
in here okay um very good let's talk to
Steven hey Steven judging by the
choppiness up his camera I don't think
he hears us Steven oh ok that's all
right okay you have to mute he perish
that's not working very well in that
case let's jump to I'm bad day to finish
over here she got me I think are you
there uh hello I'm getting lots of
noises hello um anyway um let's let's
good to talk to a job did how do you say
that hi sorry oh yeah hey yeah that's my
second account jam it to my second
account so this is actually my first
account of some reason google plus log
into that one oh no problem where you
from um right now I'm on Canada nice is
it getting cold there yet ha not yet and
set some weed right now 12 degrees which
let's say that would be like
50-something Fahrenheit I think yeah I'm
doing that why doesn't everyone just use
the same temperature I mean come on yeah
why don't you guys just switch to
Celsius until oh yeah exactly that
America is the one who's just like okay
we're just used Fahrenheit I mean though
the worst part of it is that we still
are on not metric and I think for like
decades we've tried to move to metric
but then then someone figures out we
have to change our all the street signs
and that's very expensive and no one
wants to pay for that uh so anyway what
um what kind of phone you using Bible
HTC one x + 1 x plus so that's got via
faster Tegra 3 yeah and i have i have
cyanogenmod running on it so it's
probably pretty pretty speedy right yeah
it's actually pretty good and I'm also
using the google launcher referred to
the nexus 5 minus i missed the memo
about the Google launcher I got to get
that going cuz it's it's so nice to have
google now on the left side of your home
screen yeah it's actually really good
remind you eat lengthy it's also a
little weird though right because for
the longest time Android has had the
central screen flanking screens and now
you have no other screen on the left
yeah yeah but Google now is actually
pretty useful because like you can
instead of jumping into the weather app
you can just swipe to the left and
you'll see the weather it's pretty
useful and I can also see like the
sports horse stuff yeah that is a very
handy what is was Google now not do that
you wish it could I wish it would like
like you discussed on the bacchanal
weekly that it could do system functions
for example like i could say turn off
Wi-Fi and if you turn off fly find stuff
like that yeah and especially on like a
nexus 5 or our moto x it should be
better integrated so you can do system
functions like that yeah it was just
amazing though when like when you first
use google now and it starts to like
send you a notification like it knows
what time you leave for work or school
and it says there's gonna be traffic or
there's not going to be traffic yeah
like yesterday i went out somewhere then
it took like I just swipe to the left
for Google their owner told me how much
time with traffic it's going to be it's
going to take me to get home pretty
handy because you searched for an
address on your browsers yeah yeah so do
you find a little creepy um no I don't
like because i live in canada the
government doesn't like really late
monitor also anything so yeah we've got
the bola NSA thing happening here where
apparently everything is under
surveillance but you know yeah i'm just
wondering jasco question um in brand
kenyatta nexus vibrate uh i sent it back
but I had it and how was the speaker
quality compared to like for example an
iphone 5s 5s is definitely louder and a
little bit clearer it's not bad it's
yeah I I like that is not on the back
yeah it's harder to cover up with your
hand so I'd say it's average maybe a
little bit above average but no boom
sound right no way no way um not many
phones can do a HTC could do and I'm
surprised that this year there haven't
been boomsound copycats
on facing speakers amplified it's really
amazing nobody wants to make huge
phone's not on let's make you sean's
except HTC hey but thanks for stopping
by now we've got to wrap things up here
right Tony yes that is correct so thank
you very much for joining us thank you
everyone this was probably the shortest
bucket now live episode in the history
of the bug in my life but will be here
next week and we'll have a one hour 30
as usual I've been Anton denied Michael
Fisher will hopefully be here next week
until then ran the minimum do you have
any final thoughts I I was just gonna be
out the drums oh okay then everybody
