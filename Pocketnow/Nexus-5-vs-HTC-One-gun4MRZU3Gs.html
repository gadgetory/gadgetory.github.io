another smartphone platform and asked
for recommendations on what phone to get
odds are pretty good that the HTC One
and Google Nexus 5 would rank pretty
high on that list but these two high-end
devices are popular for very different
reasons and they deliver very different
user experiences so let's check both of
those devices out and see if we can get
to the bottom of which one is right for
you I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
and this is Nexus 5 versus HTC One the
HTC One is one of our favorite Android
devices of all time and a big part of
that is thanks to its excellent fit and
finish the one's zero gap construction
is aluminum and polycarbonate and it's
replete with all the hallmarks of
premium 2013 design chamfered edges
two-tone coloring and precision machined
holes for the twin front firing speakers
it's this build quality that's led some
to call the one the gateway drug for
iPhone users give or take a few minor
details it really does equal or
surpassed the feel and hand of an Apple
product the polar opposite of that would
be something that felt ridiculously
cheap and chintzy and thankfully the
Nexus 5 is neither but it's plain to see
that price and possibly a desire to
de-emphasize Hardware in favor of
software played a role in the Nexus 5's
design hardcore or not plastic is still
plastic and it still doesn't feel as
good in the hand as the HTC One is
aluminum the Nexus 5 is only 13 grams
less massive than the one but it feels
much less substantial as a result of
that material choice on the plus side
though the soft touch coating on the
back makes the Nexus 5 a grippier device
and it'll probably hold up to drops and
scuffs better than the soft metal of the
one it also won't get as hot in the hand
when it's working hard
comparing the footprints you can see
that these devices are fairly equal in
size on their face but because LG didn't
have to accommodate the big boom sound
speakers it was able to squeeze in a
larger display but though it's bigger
it's not better colors aren't as
saturated on the Nexus blacks aren't as
dark and whites are unnaturally warm to
our eye the better quality on the ones
display more than makes up for the
slight size sacrifice under the ribcage
each of these phones has a healthy
ticker backed up by two gigs of RAM but
the brand-new Nexus 5 edges out the
older competition with a Snapdragon 800
instead of a 600 that means there's more
processing power under the Nexus 5's
hood and better graphics capabilities as
well in addition to the qi wireless
charging ability and support for more
LTE bands so all this means the Nexus 5
demolishes the HTC One and day to day
usage right well if you've been watching
PocketNow videos for a while you know
the answer is no but we don't worship
specs we value performance and in that
respect each of these phones is crazy
fast and ridiculously smooth you'll
notice that we've been swapping back and
forth between the Google Play edition
HTC One and the stock edition running
HTC Sense and truly it doesn't matter
which one you're running performance on
the one is a dream the LG phone of
course has a newer Android version and
being a Nexus device it'll probably
always be ahead of the one but with HTC
promising to update its phones to KitKat
within weeks one owners won't have long
to wait for improvements like the
streamlined Google now integration built
in Yellow Pages UI enhancements and so
on the only question is whether you
prefer an excellent third-party Android
skinned HTC Sense or an excellent stock
Android experience you'll want to check
out our full review of the one and stay
tuned for our forthcoming full review of
the Nexus 5 for more on that but for now
just know that either way you go the
software is so good that it probably
isn't gonna be a pain point for you
the camera is another story just like we
dealt with in our Nexus 5 vs. Moto X
comparison we've got two very
inconsistent cameras here both feature
optical image stabilization but the 8
megapixel shooter on the Nexus 5 is
considerably higher in resolution than
the ones 4 megapixel sensor on the
flipside the one features many more
options in its viewfinder software for
honing and perfecting your shots or just
making them more fun and those shots are
again inconsistent the one tends to
swing wildly between over and
underexposed output depending on where
it's focused the Nexus 5 is a little
less finicky in this department but once
you do find a nice groove with the one
it can produce some pretty nice shots
that sport more color on average than
the Nexus 5 the HTC phone also has a
much wider field of view which we like
because it lets us get further from our
subjects and HTC's ultra pixel
technology may have a gimmicky name but
it does do a much better job in
low-light than the Nexus 5's camera
which more than once couldn't bring in
enough light even to focus properly even
the front-facing contest favors the one
while the Nexus 5 only has space for one
person's sad and lonely selfie the ones
wide-angle front-facing camera has
enough space to include a friend about
the only thing we like better about the
Nexus 5's output is its video quality
which is pretty gorgeous no matter how
you slice it
the HTC one has been the reigning
champion of voice quality since it
debuted and though the company was
forced to change some of its microphone
technology mid-cycle
we still think the one delivers great
voice quality but according to colors
the Nexus 5 does too and we agree on the
earpiece anyway but then there's the
speaker performance folks with a name
like HTC boomsound you know it's gonna
be intense and it is the ones speakers
are positioned more logically and
they're much more dynamic than the Nexus
5's single speaker we'll have more on
the Nexus 5 including thoughts on
battery life more camera testing and
more detailed rundowns of the goodies
found in android 4.4 in our full review
Landing soon follow us on social media
and subscribe here on YouTube so you
don't miss it
the Nexus 5 has taken a bit of a beating
in the last few categories so now it's
time to remember what we're talking
about here this is a phone with a 1080p
screen a Snapdragon 800 processor and
optically stabilized camera and a
virtual guarantee from Google that it'll
always have the latest and greatest in
Android well for at least the next two
years and it's $349 in the US that's not
just value that's crazy value the HTC
one might outperform the Nexus 5 in some
areas and it might feel like a jewel in
the hand but you're gonna pay a premium
for the privilege of carrying it off
contract anyway still if you've got the
money to burn or you're willing to strap
yourself into a carrier contract and
you're more concerned with the
smartphone's holistic experience rather
than having the absolute latest and
greatest we think the HTC One is the
better rounded of these two phones if
the kind of things that peel your banana
instead are high-end specs and lightning
fast updates save some money
snap up the Nexus 5 just be prepared to
accept the compromise that comes along
with it haven't had enough Nexus 5 we
talked a lot about the Nexus 5 on this
week's pocket now weekly podcast with
special guest Brad Mullin from Engadget
Mobile head on over download that it's
up and that is also where we announced
the winner of our Nexus 5 giveaway don't
worry we'll be running another giveaway
at some point in the near future but
