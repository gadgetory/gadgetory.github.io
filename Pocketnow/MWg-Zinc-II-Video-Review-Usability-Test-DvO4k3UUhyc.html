pocketnow.com and today I'm going to
perform the pocketnow.com usability test
with the m WG zinc to the first test
will consist of switching the email
contacts and calendar applications from
the today screen and I'm going to be
using the Start menu as you can see so
we've gone from messaging to calendar to
contacts and as you can see it's all
very responsive next up opening a
third-party application we're going to
use Windows Live search and it's buried
within the interface under programs so
we're going to go to the Start menu go
to programs and then look for live
search which is a little further down
right there so live search loads right
up we'll go to the live search home
screen and then we'll tap on map and the
map is displayed fairly quickly Lex it
out there and exit there again a very
responsive application our next test is
to bring up a website using pocket
Internet Explorer so we'll go to start
bring up pocket internet explorer then
I'll select the website will you swab in
this case and will see that it renders a
quite fast so this works quite well
pocket Internet Explorer does a good job
at rendering next test is to start
playing music from a specific artist
we're going to use the zinc to menu in
this case so we press the button on the
side and I'll press the media player go
to artists and select a song once we
selected a song we hit play
as you can see using the music player is
very easy on the zinc too now we're
going to go and create a contact bring
up the contact application go to new and
the name of this contact is john zorn
I've switched it from the John Doe just
because Zorn is at the end of the
alphabet makes it easier with the email
application so then we're going to go in
and type in the phone number the phone
number is obviously numeric and to get
into the numeric mode you have to hit
the function button and you can lock the
function by hitting it twice then we go
to the email address and i turn off
function I've had a little problem
turning off function for some reason
that key sticks but you are able to get
it out of function mode the email
address is test at example.com I've also
been using the d-pad for the arrow keys
there are arrow keys on the keyboard but
you have to hit the function key to use
them i just find it easier to get my
thumb up to the d-pad and it seems much
more efficient i also use the touch
aspects of the screen one of the
advantages of the m wz g zinc 2 is its
responsiveness to touch so the next
application we're going to go to is the
email application and we're going to use
the contact we just created so i'm going
to go into new email flip it into
landscape mode you can see the landscape
mode is actually very responsive on this
device which is another plus for the
zinc 2 i type in zorn and get the email
address and now i'm into the subject
line which will be test message and then
i use the d-pad again
to get into the main area of the email
in the body i'm going to type in the
quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
and every time i use one of the
suggested words i use the d-pad to
select it and then hit the d-pad enter
button to add it to the text which is
quite helpful as you can see i struggle
with my big thumbs on this keyboard but
it does get easier as you use the
keyboard the keyboard membrane is
responsive it's really just an issue of
practice each key surface on the
membrane is responsive as I said before
and the ridges between the keys help out
to determine where you should place your
your thumb in a previous part of the
video review I had mentioned that the
the space bar wasn't large enough and I
I do find that still to be an issue so
we're going to send this email of course
this email is going to fail when we send
it since it's not a valid email address
well that does it for the usability test
and I hope you can see how responsive
this unit is and that's really thanks to
the Samsung 500 megahertz processor
which really does the job on this device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
