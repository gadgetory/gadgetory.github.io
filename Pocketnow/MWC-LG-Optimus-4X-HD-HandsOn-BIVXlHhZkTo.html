letter for pocketnow.com we've got Henry
here and Tony which you already know
over there and we are filming the LG
optimus 4x right here so tell us Henry
what's great about the for action first
of the famous companion for you look
over here at the corner this one into
the when it's red it's a companion for
when it's green is one of those what for
okay let me try to you into that you can
seize when we're not with foot minutes
in the idle suit states in the companion
for remote for most of the time okay so
it tells me when it's using all the
courts
reader
right now it's burning significant a
less power night and then once you start
playing on the one of the two of the
 cores are active now okay we've got
two cores and especially when you launch
week bores you there let's see a camera
launch of camera
port quarter there and that's permanent
that's not just part of the demo unit
right now actually we are still
fine-tuning it the camera quality is not
on par with one of those
it's not the standard yeah basically
when we're doing the preview mode it's
actually doing exclusion behind the
scene processing okay this is definitely
not final software because we are living
we are seeing a little bit of lag but
okay so that companion feature is
something that you activate even if you
bought your planning to keep that even
for final end customers in the future
they're going to be able to see which
courts are working and how much the
processor is working oh this science you
know we will not come as a widget
leaving will know we're not planning to
release this this all okay so you're
just showing this for demo okay a lot of
people are curious whether the companion
for is a marketing hype or whether it is
really efficient okay this one clearly
shows that it's really effective and
without the companion for rock floor may
not quite a quest
okay now tell me more about the specs
we've got how much RAM on this phone how
much built in storage or one gigabytes
of internal memory and then 16 gigabytes
of it okay you're only going to be
offering 160 gigabyte model not a 32 or
is it expandable storage of course there
is expandable slots okay right there
okay perfect
ok and when then we've got what type of
battery we've got a 2012 14 t20 140
million power battery okay that's a
killer battery okay let me tell you a
funny story this physical pole vector of
this battery is within five years like
the five percent larger than the optimus
2x battery okay virtually the same side
that's optimus 2x but it packs
forty-seven percent more
ok sensual doctor ok how we did that
that's the battery technology
those can be called assignment okay and
then we've got this in the back you
don't mind let me just hold the phone
this is a plastic definitely kind of a
brush design really nice give this a
chrome finish also plastic we've got the
power button at the top we've got oh you
got one there it doesn't it remind you
of oh it's really no can I keep that
okay we've got the speaker grill at the
bottom we've got the microUSB here let
me chill okay and then we've got a
volume rocker here which is barely being
able to be seen now is this android 4.1
sandwich right is an android 4.3
optimist right favorite version so here
are some quick boots that we played with
once you place it over to make a full
dirty hissing stops in there or there or
you can even slide it in here like this
it's very nice handle on feeling
make a folder in there once press the
folder can expand it like this
now
and teach the name
change the color of the folder
what screen technology do we have here
this one is a true HD IPS ok ok ok
andersen yeah we've got we've got a
really good contrast on the side he
maintains the color from the bottom
also from the right also from the top
okay really good what else do we need to
know camera at the back what do we got
emma is a 8 megapixel BSI sensor okay
backside is single LED flash what about
the front the front is I think its 1.3
make that 1.3 megapixel camera okay and
then we've got capacitive buttons here
you're going for ice cream sandwich and
maintaining the funds here which is
really good okay well so far so good
anything else then we'd like to know if
you see the danger Oh tell me about that
this is my personal favorite this one's
sprinkle
sorry does this come free little bit
with the phone no this one is not but
this one is for free it's included with
the phone yes
these things happen it's a demo unit no
problem so well thank you very much
Henry really appreciate it this is time
that we did and tony over there from
