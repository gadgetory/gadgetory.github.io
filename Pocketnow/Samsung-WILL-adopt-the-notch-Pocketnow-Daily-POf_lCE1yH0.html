want to grab the brand new one +16 now
is the time follow the first link in the
description partner dot-com / 1 + 60 for
more information the day that we've all
feared has finally arrived Samsung will
be adopting notches different designs in
the near future there's a possibility of
getting a new flashy color variant or
two for the Galaxy S 10 and if you're
not a fan of LG displays you might want
to buy anything other than an iPhone
this year I'm Jaime Rivera and Wow
definitely crazy Thursday travelling
Friday I don't even know if I'm gonna be
able to record but this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you want to get yourself that
brand-new Lenovo smart display this is
the time at Best Buy they've got some
early Black Friday deals where you can
get up to 50% off it's gonna cost you
hundred bucks
and then you've got cases like for
example the nine point seven inch iPad
the regular one which is currently $100
off and also deals for the Apple watch
Series 3 which I don't recommend
actually you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about fossil
the company has just announced their new
fossil sports SmartWatch and I have been
looking out for this because if you
wanted to get yourself that new Qualcomm
Snapdragon wear 3100 you only have the
Montblanc option now you've got fossil
and this watch is gonna cost you 250
bucks I believe it's not that expensive
there are two size options 41 and 43
millimeter and the idea is that this is
a sports watch so let you know how
sporty it is because I need to lose
weight now let's talk about LG and Apple
as a both companies have collaborated in
like forever when it comes to IPS LCD s
which power pretty much of all of
Apple's Mac line app iPads
the liquid retina is LG technology but
now there are orders for o LEDs for
those of you that have been complaining
about LG ohlet's forever I'll tell you
this much the LG v 40 has a great
display so I wouldn't worry but yeah
there are orders for o LEDs from LG for
iPhones so if you don't like LG this is
a it's a bad time let's talk about
Samsung the company's developer
conference
teas the new feature in the company's
new UX where the user interface actually
adapts to the color of your product
meaning if you've got a black phone
you'll get a black user interface and
therefore there is now speculation that
we're getting two new color variants for
whenever the next galaxy's launch and
the colors are green and pink and I
think the last time we had colors like
this was in some galaxy note at some
point so stay tuned it might happen and
finally the hot no I'm kidding it's not
hot news today comes from Samsung and
the concept of notches
we saw the company's infinity flex
display with the whole idea of giving
you a flexible product and it collapses
and stuff but there are other infinity
products there are and all these have to
do with notches actually we're talking
about the Infinity you which brings you
a notch that looks like the essential
phone the Infinity V which follows on
that V name and then the Infinity o
which is a cutout for the camera on the
display and it's on the side not in the
middle and it's just so funny I mean
Samsung has spent years teasing other
companies for using notches and now
we've got a Finity notch I don't know
it's terrible in the comments down below
let us know what do you think I mean do
you think this is a good solution or she
just Samsung stick to their guns of
avoiding the concept of notches which I
don't think will happen if we've got new
technology in my case I don't know man
it can somebody just if you're gonna
build an arch can you build a UI around
it for that - I don't know for there to
be some functionality with it and not
follow on Google's example leave us a
comment down below really skeptical
