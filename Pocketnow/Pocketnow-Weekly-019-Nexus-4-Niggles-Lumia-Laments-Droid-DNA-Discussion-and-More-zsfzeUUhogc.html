weekly hello and welcome to episode 019
of the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcasts from pocketnow.com where we
discuss what's hot and what's cool in
the world of mobile technology Windows
Phone Android and iPhone and everything
in between I'm your host Michael Fisher
senior editor at pocket now and today
I'm joined as usual by our managing
editor anton d Naja good morning to you
sir good day to you guys in to everybody
and by our editor-in-chief brandon
minimun good morning to you good morning
we have a we've had a short week we have
a short week here in the United States
because of the thanksgiving holiday
which will arrive as usual tomorrow and
we also had a late podcast last week so
this is a podcast that is not covering
as many topics as usual but as long-term
listeners know well that does not mean
we won't turn out a 14-hour potty
somehow we'll find a way we do have some
some great stuff to talk about though
some of it we touched on last week but
we didn't we didn't know enough yet
about what we were going to talk about
and I want to get things kicked right
off I'm talking about one of the most
buzzed-about devices of the season and
it's one that I don't have Brandon
minimun as the nexus 4 and has been
making some videos about it and I we all
want to hear your thoughts Brandon well
happy to provide them because they're
they're a lot different than I thought
they were going to be and let me frettin
let me let me frame this properly um the
Galaxy Nexus was one of the best android
phones ever and I and I think everyone
was expecting it to be it was google's
new Nexus flagship it had the second
720p screen of all time of course the
HTC Rezound was the first so it was it
was kind of a breakthrough it had this
beautiful screen it was super amoled it
was fast at the time it came with i
think it was ice cream sandwich she was
the first phone with ice cream sandwich
is that right guys I think that is
correct yes and you know it was such a
good phone it had a good in hand feel
had good waiting it came out on carriers
that had LTE it was affordably priced
although actually it started I think a
little bit hired like 499 a little bit
lower than your average unlocked phone
at the time but still no Nexus 4 so when
when google announced the nexus 4 i was
like hot damn this is gonna be the next
Galaxy Nexus this is gonna be an awesome
awesome phone it's got the s4 pro
quad-core that thing smokes it's got the
even higher resolution display it's like
an optimist g which is awesome alright
it's running stock android so that must
mean it's going to be faster and it's
going to be unadulterated android which
is just awesome cuz google was done such
a good job and at making android good
enough without a skin to be just
beautiful and elegant and fast and fluid
and so forth um so i got the nexus 4 and
i've been using it since i don't know
what i think i received it on monday and
so it's been it's been a solid you know
48 hours a little bit more which is a
long time because you know when you
first get a device of course you spend
almost every waking moment with it um
and as a result you're like why is my
battery life so bed and then you're like
oh yes i'm using it comes using it all
the time yeah yeah um and I am
tremendously disappointed with the nexus
4 and there's there several reasons but
I want to first start off with something
funny that happens you know sometimes
you see a scary movie we're like um like
someone goes into a room after having
just left it and something's different
like the couches on the other side of
the room kind of like um what's that
movie with the cameras in the house safe
house not safe house something i don't
know i don't want her movies like like
paranormal activity oh that there's a
lot of movies with cameras in the house
i was about to say something else that's
another type of movie uh yes tourney
anyway but anyway so i'm having that
experience with the nexus 4 I leave the
room and I come back and the nexus 4 4
is on the floor and that kind of rhymes
oh wait what oh because it's because
it's sliding off surfaces yes it is so
weird yeah it is like literally I've
tried this on three or four tables and
I'll place it in this
center of the table like a foot away
from the ledge and I'll come back and
I'm like how did that what yes I I've
talked about it you can put it down and
you can actually watch it crawl across
across stuff right because this is what
happened with the optimus G I was I
couldn't keep holding the thing like I
also would like look up for a second I
look down and it's just gradually just
slipping along the tabletop if it's
anything but perfectly level I know
exactly what you mean I'm so glad that
you're saying that because i thought i
was i was crazy now right when when i
wrote this piece about here's why google
is selling a nexus 4 bumper somebody in
the commons said that there is by design
a gasket or something on the bottom of
the phone designed specifically to avoid
slipping did you see something like that
or that's just marketing talk no it's
I'm looking at now it's flush it doesn't
protrude beyond the piece of glass on
the back so it doesn't keep it from
sliding wow so it's exactly the same as
helped mr. yeah yeah yeah just slide out
of your pocket Brendan let me ask you
does it like when you're sitting down
and you know you like if you're sitting
in a cab or something that your legs get
that up angle you know does it slide out
of your pocket because that happened all
the time when I had an all-glass fun no
no it doesn't slide out of my pocket I
haven't noticed that that would be ultra
weird girl huh did you ever watch out I
I think it you know I think this
slipperiness is is we're seeing Gorilla
Glass to roll out and I'm thinking the
gorilla glass 2 is smoother and well be
well you know it's funny cuz I've
noticed that going from device to device
I've had a lot of devices recently in
between the 810 and the droid DNA
there's a very different thumb feel
under the thumb and the fingerprint
patterns are different on it you can
tell it's the material I don't know if
they're both gorilla glass 2 or what I
mean these just the two examples I
picked but yes I know what you mean I
mean it's interesting to see how
different glass works and if you think
that this gorilla glass 2 is
contributing to the additional
slipperiness I wouldn't be prepared to
disagree with you interesting yeah so so
uh so I'm gonna go throw a list of
things that I'm disappointed with and
we're talking about this yes I've got a
list here and and this is great cuz this
transitions into the first topic of the
Android check
which is what we love and hate about the
nexus 4 so please just yeah hit us with
this well that's going to this is going
to be that but more extensive job so the
iPhone 5 has this this new screen
technology where they bond the touch
layer the touch sensitive layer to the
glass I might not be describing that
right but basically it allows the screen
mechanism as it were to be thinner so
that the device can be thinner hmm is
this has the eliminate that layer
between the glass and the displayed side
oh yes yes that is this doesn't differ
from that lamination that that everyone
does their on their own kind of way it
should be it should be the same right
right so so then the benefit to that is
that it of course makes the device
thinner but and it also brings the
screen up about a millimeter which you
know it makes the screen look closer to
the service which is nice um the big
downside is that it impacts negatively
touch sensitivity and and we've seen
this people are staring to complain
about on the iphone 5 I noticed it from
day one on the iphone 5 the typing on
the keyboard felt different it didn't
feel as accurate and the the optimus G
and the nexus 4 has I'm assuming that
the Optimus G has prom I didn't spend
enough time with an optimist tree the
nexus 4 has this problem and the screen
and the touch sensitivity is kind of
numb on the Nexus 4 and it really
impacts the usability of the phone and I
don't think it's something that can be
fixed with software I think it's a
hardware thing it's not a deal breaker
but it's definitely something to get
used to did you notice any numbness on
the optimus G Michael no I was just
thinking back to my time with it with
the J and I I didn't not that I'm aware
of not that I'm recalling I think I was
just to Malone away by how smoothly the
software how close the software got to a
one-to-one experience under my finger so
um I may not have noticed any any
hardware deficiencies contributing to
then interesting yeah uh so so there's a
touch sensitivity of the screen which
again isn't a deal breaker but it's it's
it's a little bit frustrating the next
thing that disappoints me about the
nexus 4 is the in hand feel and I've
been trying for the last two days to put
my finger on it because I pick it up in
my hand and I wrap my fingers around it
and I feel it and I don't feel like that
satisfaction that that sense of like
yeah this is this is great
real reward you know you know the
feeling the feeling you get with like an
HTC phone or a galaxy note you're like
oh mmm damn it i love this yes I I don't
get that with a nexus war and I think I
finally figured out why the build
quality actually is cheap while it looks
on the surface to be a high-end phone
you get this awesome pattern on the back
and there's glass on the front that
wraps around the edges and there's nice
little details when you hold it in your
hand it feels dare I say like an LG
phone and we we almost got past this LG
thing cuz the Optimus G is a big step up
from LG it really it really is but the
next is for for some reason feels like a
little bit of a step back uh is it
because of the why is that I mean is it
because of the change in design from a
blocky thing to an organic thing is it
because it's shaping the Galaxy Nexus
what is I I keep focusing on the the
edge which is soft touch plastic and
maybe it's the the difference in texture
from the smoothness of the front
smoothness of the back end of the soft
touch and and so it just feels like it's
lined with plastic hmm I I can't really
describe it uh and I need some more time
with the phone to figure it out but
anyway so that's the next thing the next
thing on my list is the chrome browser
the chrome browser in Android has worse
performance in almost every case than
the stock android browser and google
keeps sticking this on the nexus 7 they
stick it on the on the nexus 4 on the
nexus 10 and and it's like come on guys
this browser is not finished yet it
feels beta it's it's got great tab
management bookmark sync is awesome and
password sync is awesome but it's not as
fast as the default android browser have
you guys found that to be the case yeah
yes I I have since i started using
chrome found it to be the delay gear
browser for four months and months but
um I was just talking about it yesterday
with a friend of mine I will I deal with
the lag eNOS and I don't complain about
it often because I like these that
chrome syncs across my desktop and my
mobile platforms and it kind of
remembers my history across devices yeah
I mean so for me yes it's laggy but I I
get around it with other conveniences
what about you eternity
I do not use grown because I don't have
a device which I don't have a nexus
phone so do you don't use it in iOS um
no I'm using safari and I'm happy with
um and and and as a to illustrate this
point for it further right now uploading
it the Nexus Galaxy Nexus vs nexus for
comparison video where we're comparing
the nexus 4 with chrome with a Galaxy
Nexus with stock Android and you'd think
that the nexus 4 would smoke the Galaxy
Nexus because the s4 pro is a beast but
guess what it's about the same speed in
fact sometimes the Galaxy Nexus is
faster sometimes the nexus 4 is faster
and I bet you if you were to take the
stock android browser and stick it on
the Nexus 4 and then do the same
comparison the nexus 4 would smoke the
Galaxy Nexus as it should but it's not
it's about the same and it shouldn't be
interesting I mean is this just browsing
or is this general responsiveness are we
still talking about chrome vs vs browser
it's just browsing overall the nexus
wars definitely faster in the galaxy
nexus by about a second to a half a
second it's not a mega leap uh but it is
it is noticeably faster and then the
next thing really the last thing on my
list is this issue of LTE and I know
people kind of grown about that but the
thing about LTE is that if you're coming
from a device that had LTE the nexus 4
is going to feel slow but if you're
coming from a device with you know hspa+
already next you're not gonna it's like
it's all about comparison right yeah it
is it's all about you're gonna see like
differences if you're if you have
devices right next to each other you're
not gonna necessarily see it left left
to right but i don't know i mean what
like the LTE question is completely in
uninteresting to half of our listeners
and it's critical to the other half like
it's the most polarizing thing this side
of Android versus iOS I feel like right
you know what I'd be interested in I
know it's the same platform the same
phones the optimus G and the nexus 4 i'd
be interested in seeing a side-by-side
comparison on how LG's version of the
nexus 4 if I may works and how Google's
version of the optimus G works the
comparing just the side by side stock
android vs
LG customization hardware is the
proximately the same 99% interesting
that would be interesting and we should
we should think about arranging that
that would be cool to see ya oh yeah I'm
looking forward to seeing that the video
that you're uploading now in the Galaxy
Nexus versus the nexus 4 because this
that's really what the most what's the
most interesting comparison right it's
it's like this is the previous iteration
of the Nexus flagship here's the current
one and they even look alike I mean you
know they too since the nexus s yes yeah
oh and but but the Galaxy Nexus you know
took did Galaxy Nexus changed more from
the nexus s then I feel like the nexus 4
changes from the Galaxy Nexus mm-hmm you
know right all this talk actually makes
me miss my galaxy nexus a little bit and
that's why when I brandon i feel you
with as far as your objections to the
design because when the nexus 4 was
announced after all the leaks and it
actually was the thing we'd seen leaked
i was like really because it to me this
is just a aesthetics thing that's just
personally speaking it doesn't look
great I actually prefer the look of the
galaxy nexus which I never threw any
parades over like the Galaxy Nexus I was
like whatever it's kind of like it's a
teardrop it's fine but I think those
Nexus is better looking yeah I sort of
agree the nexus 4 is nondescript but it
at the same time it kind of looks a
little badass because it's it's
literally like one piece of glass on the
front that's the same color and cheat
like I mean on the Galaxy Nexus if you
put put it next to the the nexus for you
you can see the screen on the Galaxy
Nexus because it's blue tinted as
Samsung Super AMOLED tend to be but on
the LCD display on the nexus 4 it's just
like one big glass panel thing can I
tell you what I don't I don't mind that
the blue tent but I you have made me
remember something remind us the nexus 4
does not have a curved screen glass
right right it's got little tapers
around the edges right which you know
find that feels great under a thumb and
whatever nobody really does it but
that's one of the things I loved about
the nexus s and the Galaxy Nexus was
that a manufacturer had decided that yes
we're going to make another bar phone
and you know they all look the same all
these slabs but we're going to curve the
glass I know the display itself wasn't
curved and some people saw it as a
gimmick and but the way just that
SQ away in which it contoured to one's
face while you're while you're having a
phone call and like you could look at it
I edge on and see that it had that sort
of suggestion of a banana shape i mean
that's awesome i think that's a cool
waited to make a phone feel different
and look different and i was sad to see
that wasn't there on the force are a ton
of a few if you flex your muscles you
can put some raw force in and you can
bend the gnosis for just that tiny
little bit honey bring me my blowtorch
yeah yeah yeah yeah I missed the shape
of the galaxy nexus it definitely uh was
unique so to wrap up the thought threat
here um you know that there are some
good things about the nexus for the
screen is gorgeous it's it's got
fantastic viewing angles amazing color
saturation and it just looks really good
it's a little bit warm a little bit
orange tinted but but that's not the
worst thing ever it's fast day-to-day
operation it's not blow away fast but
it's it's definitely one of the fastest
androids if not the fastest android it's
got an android 4.2 which has some pretty
cool niceties like the photosphere thing
which is fascinating to use its best
when you're not moving so if you're
sitting in like your your living room or
whatever and you're like I want to make
like a 3 360 degree or it's more than
that it's it's like a complete sphere
you can do the ceilings and the floors
it's it's really cool um madness yeah it
was jolie by i did a video demoing
photosphere right yeah yeah yeah and it
looks fascinating and I mean panorama is
interesting enough but but the
photosphere I feel like is a really good
idea have you taken a lot of internal
interior photos with him yeah kind of
pointlessly but it's a it's it's fun he
really is oh well let me ask you before
we get off the nexus for the the camera
i mean in general photosphere aside is
the camera an improvement over the
galaxy nexus please say yes it's an
improved yeah it's an improvement over
the galaxy nexus but it's not at it's
not better than a galaxy s3 for example
it's it's an okay camera it it's just
okay okay um and and so so my concluding
thought for this and my god wait oh
you're gonna wrap it up but but i'm
sorry i have to jump in with one more
question that I
because I haven't had my hands on one
yet the LED notification light I know
it's it's tiny on this new one right
yeah is it white only or is there
support for multiple colors I'm only
seeing white I need to get a what's that
called um light life low life low life
low I need to get light flow on here
which I think requires root right no no
no it doesn't require root but it
doesn't it also doesn't work uniformly
across devices so it's kind of a mixed
bag whether it'll work or not all right
well I know I'm gonna do that in advance
of the the review and sweet i'll let you
know now now you crap I'm sorry I needed
it I needed that answered pressing
questions from from a concerned listener
I thought it was just in my Nexus far is
just sliding off the table again it's
unbelievable i am not surprised i'm
gonna see can I be mean guys oh please
be mean yeah they're saying around here
I'm sure there's a similar saying in the
u.s. to what did you expect for that
triple price I mean it's a superb rice
which doesn't really matter it's 200
something dollar phone subsidized from
google I know it's good to be critic and
to criticize the device and the platform
itself I say we would be more entitled
to criticize this if we or if you guys
lived in a region where I do where we
don't have google play and e-tailers
sell the phone for like 4 500 euros but
for two hundred and something dollars
this is a great phone yeah sort of it's
unfortunate it's it is a great price
it's a great value but the expectations
were far too high for this phone and and
so my concluding thought was going to be
the dirty little secret on why the nexus
4 is so cheap is because Google said
let's make a cheap phone and in order to
do that we're gonna have to partner with
a manufacturer who can make this super
cheap we're gonna do things to help our
economics like we're gonna leave an LTE
chip in the phone even though we're not
gonna give it LTE support because that's
a little bit cheaper for every model
that we make if we keep it exactly the
same as an existing motherboard so they
did that they then they said well we got
to make this thing look high in so we're
gonna do this like back plating with the
glass and the little shiny things on the
back
um but we're gonna work with LG on this
because they can make it real cheap and
we're gonna make it like it's not real
cheaper to put an s4 pro in it's going
to be the most expensive component in
the whole darn phone and and people are
gonna think that this is the hot but I'm
not buying it um-hmm I'm skeptical and
you know I I need a little bit more time
with this to get my final opinion
there's no doubt it's a good phone but
it's not it's it hasn't met my
expectations and I don't expect that
over the next few days it's going to do
wow me any for I to disagree what you
think is gonna get more about that I
tend to disagree about the fact that
it's a it's a cheap phone it's not a
cheap phone the reason for the low price
is I think Google subsidizing it the
real price of this phone is the price
which we see it listed in European
countries which don't have the google
play store or anywhere else in the world
I think the difference is google
chipping in on the price because they
want to grow the fan base the user base
they want to help LG because you name it
the reason why but this is not the price
of the phone the real price of the phone
is around five six hundred dollars and
that's that's that's probably true but
if they went with if they went with
samsung for the next or they did a very
similar phone they would have had to
subsidize it even more maybe twenty-five
dollars more per unit which would would
be extremely expensive over millions of
devices yeah I feel like LG probably had
a pretty significant incentive not to
not to put too high a price tag on this
partnership with Google because the LG
is desperately in need of more
visibility and I feel like they are the
company who would work for cheap that
plus you cannot have three consecutive
phones made by samsung I mean they're
they're probably the air top OEM partner
but you cannot neglect the rest of them
yeah but Google could have gone to back
to HTC you know who is also scrambling
him hit me too who's also you know the
HTC is trying to scramble back to
visibility again but so I but I feel
like HTC still has more clout than LG
does this is based on the movements
justjust orders I mean yeah yeah so
that's interesting like a couple days in
Brandon minimun thinks the the nexus 4
is a Kia with rhinestones glued to it
that that's putting it harshly yes my
point is that expectations are that this
is gonna be the best most incredible
android phone ever to exist and that
it's super high quality in terms of
everything just you know keep your
expectations check it's still a good
phone but it's not it's not gonna make
you're not gonna knock your socks off
that is really good advice and it's also
a really really good segue into
something that could have been the the
next best amazing just market destroying
Android device San lizards yes I know
right and she's getting a hyperbolic on
Wednesday before Thanksgiving it's the
droid DNA review went up I wrote it I
went out with cold days ago it's already
in your DNA what way yes I'm have a
massive genetic mutation that has
happened it's so the DNA is is on its
way to Brandon right now as we speak to
do some to do some more videos and for
to get in under Brandon's freakishly
awesome my balls to to see if you can
discern any pixels from from a half inch
away but my god I do like this phone and
I we talked about it a lot on last
week's podcast and you guys asked me a
lot of questions about it was very
similar to what we just did for the
nexus 4 but I've had more time to get to
know it I've had more time to remember
the things I like and don't like about
sense and see what they've brought new
in the sense thing I've had more time to
hate on the camera a little bit but oh
man for someone who values how a phone
feels in the hand for someone who values
a good build quality it is really hard
to beat that the droid DNA I mean it
just is an amazing device to hold I
think and I might be talking it up a
little bit maybe next week Brandon
you'll come back and say what are you
talking about i can't handle this soft
touch sharp-edged nonsense but no it's
it's it's great and also the screen is
of course beautiful but my question is
and maybe you guys can help me because I
truly don't understand this HTC we kind
of know how they feel about battery life
because they've run focus groups we ran
that story
for some reason stuck in my mind better
than almost any other story we've run
where HTC ran all these focus groups and
and they determined that people care
more about thinness than battery life so
we know what their attitude is on that
the non removable battery shouldn't
really surprise us that much its
milliamp hour rating maybe should
irritate us considering the power-hungry
screen but none of that matters as much
as the non removable storage the non
expandable storage because unless you
can live most of your life in the cloud
then 16 gigs of storage only you know a
little over half of which or whatever is
usable is user accessible that's not
enough for anyone especially if you're
going to be taking video 1080p video
you're going to be downloading 1080p
movies you know you want it you want to
listen to use HTC beats for some reason
to destroy your music you know and
listen to a lot of your music on the go
like a why and and we know Ram as a
component costs isn't that pricey right
we know that the Apple prices iPhones at
a hundred dollar spacing between 16 and
32 you mean flesh or flat ellipse I'm
sorry not Ram flesh yeah that's what I
mean wrong yeah Rama storage but we know
you know the Apple price is it a hundred
dollar levels but we know it only costs
them what ten bucks for an extra for an
extra eight gigs of storage so or I why
would HTC do this do you guys have any
speculation I have something yeah Andy
capping they did go ahead the biggest
problem with the droid DNA is that it is
a verizon exclusive so if this phone was
analog phone available on all carriers
or internationally I think HTC would
have went with the 32gb version just
like the 1x or maybe the 64 gig version
like the one x+ or or maybe both so I'm
thinking that will see the droid DNA on
verizon with these options they have it
first and then when the HTC deluxe comes
out regardless if it's going to be this
holiday season CS or mwc we'll see 32
and 64gb options for the masses okay so
and you know I was going to mention that
to it is going to come out as the deluxe
internationally and commenters have been
over
about that and rightfully so but why
would you intentionally hobble like okay
the butterfly J launched in japan and
that was a big deal and whatever when
you're launching you know in America
that is no less significant a launch and
when you're launching on verizon
wireless it's a very high-profile launch
considering its launching as a droid so
why would you hobble it with with 16
gigs of storage only why would you wait
to include more storage on the
international one it's a it's a cost
savings and we had you know in the case
in the case of the droid DNA they
figured that people would look past that
specification saying mm-hmm i got that's
got a 1080p screen what I want to see
and I you guys remember when 3.5
millimeter headphone jacks didn't come
on all phones and everyone was really
upset and every review was like yeah
lack of 3.5 millimeter headphone jacks
sucks yes yeah and then an HTC came out
and said you know what for every one of
our phones in future when I 3.5
millimeter headphone jacks and they did
it and everyone in the industry did it
they needed we need to do the same thing
about micro SD storage expansion and
make a stink about it because I think
it's so much better to have a phone with
like eight gigabytes of storage and a
microSD expansion that's 16 gigs and no
ability to expand the memory in the
future yeah and and we've seen in like
unlike the Nokia Lumia 810 you can put
the micro SD card slot right on top of
the sim card slot so you can save space
on that footprint because the sim card
has to be there anyway right yeah so I
agree why why omit it Plus don't forget
guys that HTC had and I think they still
have the agreement with Dropbox i mean
if if they put 32 gigs and 64 gig
versions or I don't know 32 plus as the
card options on a phone nobody will care
about activating their free 50 gig
dropbox account I'm not sure if that
option is still available but again they
have partnerships and the trend is to
move everything to the cloud whether we
like it or not it is and and that's
gonna be fine long term but right now
with data crunches and carriers giving
us data caps and all this stuff we
really need more storage I just
discovered recently I feel like an idiot
that Spotify lets you download playlists
and I know that's at the one of the key
and I know that's one of the Keystone
features but
you know it's so cool to be able to
download you know 500 songs over Wi-Fi
and then be able to take it with you and
not have to worry about Oh each song is
10 megabytes against your your data plan
right again that's why Spotify is so
crucial for particularly for us right
because we're switching devices all the
time and like I don't want to have to
like pop out my micro SD card and put it
in a phone that maybe doesn't support
micro SD and sink it on my computer and
cables and Wi-Fi sync and all that kind
of know just thank fire up your Spotify
client and download view songs what
playlist you want to the new device I'm
glad that you found out how to do that
it's really pretty easy once you once
you're discovered it was possible but
you know I was trying to listen to music
on Spotify just last night it was coming
back from whatever has come back from
the theater of the bar or something like
that and I was like on a train that had
you know I had HSPA covers but it in MLG
coverage and for some reason it was
being slow or whatever I don't know what
phone i was using and i just couldn't
get the music fast enough and the track
was skipping in my ears and I was like
this is so absolutely frustrating why
can't I just have the music on the
device oh right because I don't have
enough storage on the device I
completely agree i think microsd should
be a standard i think it's absurd that
almost all mid-range phones have it but
these high-end devices are for some
reason having their micro SD
capabilities removed its rails kind of
all it's it's just it's just absurd so
and that's been you know that's not just
us being tech nerds I mean this is what
the commenters have been complaining
about it almost universally in the
comments they shake their fist about the
battery life a little bit or they they
complain it's too big or whatever but no
like ninety percent of the negative
comments are HTC why did you cripple
this thing why did you get 16 gigs of
storage not enough and a PSA here um do
not get the nexus 4 with 8 gigabytes of
storage you will run out within two days
if you are planning on downloading any
number of apps because you start off
with about six gigabytes maybe even 5.5
and you download like shadowgun which is
one gigabyte you download a couple
Spotify playlist you're done and it's
its root
Nicholas yeah an eight gigabyte device
on the market like masquerading as a
high-end device is not it shouldn't
exist it's aimed towards those who are
like me happy to live in a region with
unlimited data and fast speeds wherever
I go yeah I know it and I think that's
kind of the thing right because there's
this prejudice that says only people who
only people who live out on a farm in
Piedmont South Dakota it can't can't
live in the cloud and it's not true you
know i mean we've talked with us before
i live in a very very thickly settled
city that is very technologically
advanced and relatively prosperous and i
still can't you know I can't exist in
the cloud because the whole damn public
transportation system is underground and
also don't forget that when you it's
it's much more gentle on your battery if
you've got yet you know if you storing
versus streaming very good point exactly
yeah there are still really significant
merits to to storing versus streaming
and yeah well we should we should we
should we should probably move on but I
did Brendan you're going to have the DNA
by the time we talk next week I'll be
looking forward to hearing whether you
would hearing you talk about it Toni I
can't wait to hear their continued can
get your hands on whether the it's the
deluxe or a version of the DNA or
something like that because I think you
will find a lot to to like about it just
from a hardware sense i think it's i
just want to say one more thing I I
think it's a really really great how
they decided to to do the 5-inch screen
thing where they didn't widen it they
didn't decide to make it into a big like
galaxy note 2 thing they just stretched
it it feels so great in the hand that I
just can't get over it yes going keep
you keep talking about how the DNA is
not phablet and I it sounds it sounds
like that's a really big headline here
it is it's the most important thing ever
and they set it right on stage in the
New York City event they went out of
their way to make that point very clear
and it's not clear on the video because
video is the thing where it robs scale
right i mean even the next to the galaxy
note 2 they don't look all that similar
but you put the DNA in your hand and
it's very clear what this thing is you
know it's it's very very much the next
step up from the 1x not anywhere
in the same region as the Galaxy Note or
the Galaxy Note 2 so we'll talk more
about it next week this is still a
really hot device and and Brandon's
going to have his own thoughts to bring
to it I can't wait to hear them
especially with regard to viewing idols
we could talk about this phone all day
but we can't we got to move on and
tony's board over there but this may not
rescue him from it because i know i
don't know Brandon first of all it's
been such an absolutely absurd holiday
season this is my first holiday season
with pocket now and I didn't realize how
crazy things get so today I'm putting
together the podcast outline and I'm
like kindle fire HD 8.9 unboxing and
first impression who did this Oh Brandon
did this when did he do this like I
haven't even had a chance to look up
from from all these from all the
craziness of the holiday season and
actually see things Brandon is this is
something to get excited about or is it
lame I haven't even had time to watch
the video it's it's a very niche device
and I think it's really good for mom dad
grandpa grandma who just want to sort of
live in this island of content and
that's it it's so I mean is it is it
still a it gets the really relevant
question I want to ask about any kindle
product is why would i buy it instead of
A's and say a nexus 7 and we know I'm a
giant X 07 fanboy so it's a crappy
question coming from me but the 8.9
starts at 299 and the nexus 10 starts a
hundred dollars higher so there's the
price I mean the seven nothing and then
there is d you know that the ease of use
and the d comfort you know the kindle
fire HD is just nice to hold in the hand
again it's really it's not intended for
power users it really isn't it's
intended for mom and dad and it's really
good for mom and dad safe to assume that
the kindle fire is the ipad of the
android ecosystem mmm i think it's our
users for people who want everything to
work without any tweaks out of the box
content consumption consumer tablet well
I feel like the Nexus 7 is already that
I feel like Google did what they wanted
to do with the nexus 7 which was to say
hey kindle fire eat asphalt you know
what i mean like here this this does
everything you need her to do out of the
box and it has a con
10 story which is really good and you
know it's reliable and it's stable and
it runs the latest Android build without
a skin and it's always been more
responsive than any kindle and it you
know it will remain so so like what you
know I just don't get why the kindle i
know i think the kindle still exists
because it's right for some people but I
I just wonder if I wonder how much
longer that dominance will last in that
arena there's one thing that's that's
for sure is that the speakers on the
Kindle Fire HD 7 &amp;amp; 8.9 are unlike
anything if you guys have a chance to
play with one at a store hit hit a video
like a movie and play it at high volume
and you'll be like on you'll be amazed
it's unbelievable what they've done with
the speakers really it's so depressed
lately with surround sound and I turned
behind me I'm like oh my god what
happened was that and I'm like oh
they're sort you know there's sort of a
surround effect it's amazing it's not
gimmicky at all you think it would be
stupid and gimmicky Oh surround speakers
on the tablet it actually sounds like
surround sound it's the weirdest thing
it's awesome that does sound awesome i
suddenly want to try this product now
that's are they front firing like what
do they come out the sides what do they
do their bet they're backfiring and i
don't know how they do it I just I don't
know and the unicorns must be inside
brainwaves yeah well cool I are you
doing a review I don't think I'm gonna
do it for you I don't think it's really
something that our audience cared that
much about so yeah problem first
impressions I think as far as we're
gonna go on it yeah okay well let's uh
let's let's keep on pushing on here
because we've actually up some windows 8
windows phone 8 stuff to to talk about
we have I've seen I don't know about you
guys want to ask you if you've seen some
Microsoft ads recently because Boston
has been papered with them I have seen
entire t stations or subway system just
papered with Microsoft Surface ads so
the effect is when you round a corner
you come onto the train platform and you
see into the distance and every single
one of these 30 or 40 billboard spots is
like this brightly colored pink or cyan
or whatever Microsoft Surface RT bad and
then there have been windows phone 8
manners all over the place
I started to see Microsoft
advertisements in the flesh like not
just on TV but in your area you keep
forgetting where I live I know I do I
just hold out hope that maybe they'll
steal some banner placement from Samsung
because I know Samsung advertises over
there no stuff I I've seen a lot of
surface ads I think we talked about this
in the last podcast but I haven't seen
that many windows phone ads maybe a few
on the on TV can we talk about this
ridiculous um video that Microsoft put
out that we were going to talk about
first where they like the meter like
here's the highest end windows phone
ever and here's a two year old piece of
crap android phone that no one owns
anymore are you talking we're gonna talk
about the meeting to me you're mad crazy
is that freakin nuts I'm so wait or well
yes Brendon you've done a very
interesting job of just just completely
demolishing my segue but yes absolutely
thanks man Tony you-you-you wrote this
thing and what is the story can you tell
us for listeners who have not seen this
meet your match campaign well probably
everybody remembers the campaign which
kicked off at this year's CES with the
smoked by Windows Phone where Microsoft
employees running Windows Phone 7 were
facing off people on the street trying
to show how Windows Phone 7 is faster
than you name it and now with Windows
Phone 8 Microsoft is taking it one step
further and they have renamed and
rebranded the entire campaign from from
smoked by Windows Phone to meet your
match with Windows Phone and this is
basically something which is not only
emphasizing on speed but Microsoft tries
to convince people on the street that
the windows phone is the phone that they
need is the phone for them so it's not
only about performance but about also
ease of use about services about
features in general okay I mean does it
and I from brandons tone I'm guessing
that maybe these these ads how do you
say suck a little bit it's okay let me
compare it to different phones and I
know Brandon stance on this and I was
exactly like this i mean comparing a
windows phone
8x by HTC or an AT&amp;amp;T Nokia Lumia 920
with a blackberry or a two year old
android phone come on Microsoft right
then again somebody commented in defense
of Microsoft and the the he was like
okay guys what should Microsoft do if
those phones are actually out there on
the streets I mean just think about
these people who bought these phones
with two year contracts there are still
many people stuck with those phones so
it's not microsoft's fault that they
probably met every I don't know 20th
person running on two year old android
phone but the marketing just kicks in
and they select probably those and they
just deleted those with this so they
roll up to a guy as I hey you wanna do
this video let's compare this 922 what
do you got your pine your whips out a
galaxy s3 like oh no never mind just
kidding hey you over there you got a
thunderbolt in your pocket let's uh
let's try the chain compares the videos
feature any comparisons against like a
modern high-end device I haven't seen
all of them they are ten you know why I
have counted them right but I haven't
seen all them probably yes I know it's
lame but I don't like these campaigns at
all yeah like I get what they're trying
to do with it but it always seems to me
that these kind of things always reek of
desperation is the wrong word but kind
of this like trying too hard it's like
the Bing ones right weather where the
guys are on the street and they're like
there's two searches and there's a blind
search test and I'll Bing one you know
you chose big you like being better I'm
like but what are you talking about I
don't know I I found one with an with an
iphone 3gs that's very relevant very
good right yeah and there's this girl
with the iphone 5 who apparently doesn't
even get to typing the SMS message by
the time Ben the bc guy has already sent
it out and she just concludes that the
iphone 5 sucks I mean come on yeah he
sucks she can't even get to them mm-hmm
it's interesting I mean like this is all
this is all very curious and about what
it's a it says interesting things about
Microsoft's like you know push behind
Windows Phone and I'm glad to see I'm
it's you remember when when the windows
phone 7
the first push came out and like the ads
were everywhere like since then we
didn't we haven't really seen any of
that and it's it's nice to see it
visible again as a matter of fact I was
at where was I concert or I was
somewhere and some some friend of mine
asked me what phone i was using cuz i
had my 920 out what phone were you using
today exactly right but I know yeah I
had my it was either my 810 the a-10
review unit or my 920 and she asks me
she's like I was that the new windows
phone we're normally the question you
know for the past two years almost would
have been what is that that's weird does
that run Android like is that what is
that a smartphone like Z these are all
variations on the questions I used to
get but no instead finally someone and
this is totally a non geek you know and
and she's like what was that the new
windows phone like wow interesting brand
recognition actually happening yeah that
is great and I'm very much looking
forward to seeing more of that and it I
felt once again like it was six or six
or eight months ago and people were
asking me oh is that the new galaxy you
know I'm like oh wow you understand what
a galaxy s and product is like what you
know it's like it's like they're uh it's
like it's like a baby saying its first
word ulit it like the world starting to
learn the language and you're like and
they say is that the new galaxy and
you're like okay yes it's the new galaxy
it's technically the galaxy s3 record
iteration of the galaxy but yes you're
right but just saying galaxy you're just
in a whole new class yes good for you ya
know so I think that's nice and I think
that no matter how crappy some of these
ads are and you know whatever for
Microsoft is just nice to see the
Windows Phone getting a little bit of
mine chair because you can't went you
cannot win if nobody knows what your
product is it's a bad design of people
don't know it exists go ahead to this is
exactly what Samsung did with the
samsung galaxy s3 vs. iPhone 5 poster I
mean they highlighted all the super
awesome features which are only on the
Galaxy S free and of course the iphone 5
doesn't have them and on this exact vein
there's a microsoft video showing off
kids corner on a Windows Phone and I'm
just trying to imagine how been the BC
guy walks up to this woman and he was
like okay Kenny your phone do kids
corner
I'm just going ahead and imagining how
she whips out her I don't know Galaxy
Nexus and she's like no but can your
windows from fire at Google now it's the
same thing yes stop comparing features
which are platform-specific try to do
things which people do on a day-to-day
basis and be fair and compare those
features which are across all platforms
it's like he goes up and says does your
phone share the same code base with
Windows 8 come on what's your baby the
most proprietary thing possible and ask
if you he hasn't yeah but no but I have
a smart stay my phone doesn't shut off
what I'm looking at it yeah well pho oh
god yeah um you know I don't know get
when you when you do these platform Wars
and this is something I've been
struggling with as well with this kind
of Windows Phone vs in my case Android
kind of thing where it's like yeah some
of these things are platform-specific
you can't compare them but because their
platform specific and they don't have an
analog on the other platform you're like
wow I really really missed that you know
all right wow I really really can't
stand that I don't have this anymore
because I jump platforms and there isn't
an equivalent don't you guys wish
somebody would step up to you and try to
convince you that X phone or X platform
is better than yours just yeah you're
still pocket now editor's you're still
in the tech and I just wish to see Ben
the BC guys stepping up to Brandon met
him when trying to convince him that the
windows phone 8x by HTC does fit fill in
the blanks yeah i mean like it because
it's a hard it's it's a hard pitch right
i mean especially that I mean even to
normal people but two techniques
especially but i don't know i mean you
know there's so much i was talking about
my experience with windows phone to a
friend of mine recently and I was like
it feels like I've moved into a really
nice really nice house that has almost
no furniture inside it it's a very very
spare experience so forget the ceiling
man yeah I know exactly I mean I feel
like I'm sleeping on it like in a room
with the vaulted ceiling with a
beautiful mural on the top and it's like
got six fireplaces but I'm sleeping on
an air mattress Michael tell us how your
how you're getting along with the 920
are you
I just don't love this is why yeah I've
just I've just had some time with it
because finally all these reviews are
sort of done for the moment and I'm it's
sitting right next to me on its wireless
charging played which I like oh how cute
isn't it and I like I'm still learning
it's a little language with how often it
blinks the light on the charging plate I
don't really read manuals too well so
anyway you know it's been interesting
and I am currently in the midst of i'm
still kind of embroiled in this location
based services standoff between my lumia
920 and these other devices i'm going to
write a piece on that today i want to
take a train ride and that'll be fun but
you know it's been nice re getting to
know windows phone and and using the 920
is my kind of primary device for a bit
and what the only fully formed thoughts
i have at this moment besides the fact
that it's very Spartan and i really miss
spotify and i really miss pandora and
i'm annoyed that i have to wait until q1
of 2013 for these really important apps
sign up for zune or how what's their
name out ya xbox music i miss bugs
writings gonna have to do that i
actually am gonna have to do that
because i'm i'm really annoyed about
that i'm annoyed that I that's one of
these symptoms of this platform I think
being rushed out the door and and apps
developers really having to be cajoled
into making something cuz come on unify
them how how hard could it be III don't
mean to say then coding is easy I don't
mean to say the developing an app is
easy it's not it's very very hard but
like your Spotify right you are you have
a massive amount of popularity of a huge
mindshare you've got to have some
employees how hard would it be to just
make a stopgap app today on our windows
phone just just think about this how how
long did it take for Spotify to release
an ipad application they just recently
did that i mean i remember being in
London for the galaxy s free event in at
the beginning of May and I was still
trying to get used to the application so
it took them years and years how can
they had the iphone application it's not
about the time I think it's about but
are they want to do it or not and that's
exactly it and pandora is the same thing
it's like you everyone
bought a Lumia 920 is gonna get pandora
one for free for a year hey that's
awesome that's really legit wait what do
you mean I have to wait until january or
februari or march to get pandora yeah
you know me like i did and that's the
thing i have another friend who works
for a company in the medical field and
microsoft kind of came to them when they
were talking about windows 8 a couple
months ago they're like we want you to
develop an app for Windows 8 and my
friend was like yeah alright that's cool
but Microsoft wouldn't give them any
developer hardware and like apparently
you know didn't support this is like
anecdotal evidence is anecdotal and
whatever yeah but I feel like that
Microsoft has done a really good job in
getting the app marketplace for windows
phone 7 from 120 or 100,000 apps 220,000
apps in a very short amount of time the
growth is great but for me a lot of the
apps that I want and need are missing so
Simon some of my shell even say how's
your overall experience with it it's
been it is it is i'm still developing my
feelings on it there's still a lot i
love about it but i feel like i was
oversold on Windows Phone 8 I feel like
I feel like I also have a question well
hold on I feel like I was oversold on
the platform and frankly I think the
PureView aspect is a little overblown as
well really i thought it has night
vision that's doing doesn't it see light
where other ones do not which is
actually kind of cool excuse me yes no
it does and but you can watch at work
right you take a photo it generates the
photo and right before the photo goes
slides over to the left into the gallery
you see it brighton and then you slide
back and you're like oh yeah that is
brighter but it but it's not you know
magical it's it's applying it's applying
some software effects to bring the light
out and i don't know enough about
cameras to talk about how that differs
from may be taking the same image
putting it into a photo editor or free
photo editor and bumping up the exposure
level a little bit but that's what it
looks like it's doing and you know
that's fine it makes for a brighter
picture but it also does that in
daylight and we've complained about this
already we're like you're trying to take
a picture of normal lighting and it's
like oh I see you've you've overexposed
a lot of this photo for some reason
thanks PureView
you know so it's not a crappy camera I'm
not saying that by any means is it's
it's a good camera but once again it's
one of those things where it's like you
guys basically sold us on optical image
stabilization which is pretty cool but I
still get blur in my shots if I use the
shutter button so why I don't know I I
feel at the moment like I do like this
device a lot I also feel like it's not
quite the finished product that everyone
wants to think it is and I think it
after a software update or two and after
the app marketplace grows a little bit i
think in February around roundabouts
this will be the device that I want it
to be today and that's okay i'm willing
to willing to wait i'm not going to
return it i still love a lot about it
i'm sorry that i'm talking about the
negatives exclusively but you know
there's a lot of positives to it and the
fact i always tell people it's heavier
than the galaxy note 2 and they always
say the same thing like really and then
they hold it and they're like yeah but i
don't care it feels so nice and that's
how I feel too so you know there's a lot
of thought yet to be developed on this
thing mmm but if you bought one on AT&amp;amp;T
uh you in the past couple days you might
be able to get one you may but we get
some money back this is a story that
Stephen shank posted yesterday I think
about people AT&amp;amp;T is doing this Black
Friday fire sale we're not fire sale
well I'm an idiot there's no black
friday sale we're ninety-nine dollars
apparently is just just not cheap enough
for this flagship Windows Phone 8 so
they are cutting the price in half for
black friday which four are not American
listeners is the day after thanksgiving
and apparently some people have been
irritated about this on the WPCentral
forums and they've contacted AT&amp;amp;T
virtual chat support on the ATT website
and if ATT has been willing in several
instances to credit them the fifty
dollar difference which is you know golf
claps all around right i mean good job
AT&amp;amp;T for being you know understanding
and human you know i don't know and it
would I think Steven puts in a couple
disclaim
where he says don't expect this to work
for everybody and you know this is your
mileage may vary but it's nice to see
AT&amp;amp;T I'm you know be nice to people
thrown a bone to people exactly so if
you are in our in our boat I already got
enough free stuff I'm fine i got my my
free wireless charging plate and I feel
like ninety nine dollars as a more than
fair price for this flagship level
smartphone stark though some of its
software may be so I'm you know fine
with it but for those not lucky enough
to be on windows phone 8 saw hardware
right now we got word that Windows Phone
7.8 the gap filler for those running on
older hardware is going to arrive in
2013 this is a rumor not a rumor but
this is a sort of like a this is a
screencap from my nokia site from china
is that right that is one report and
then there's another report that she's
also coming from nokia i know that
because i wrote this one it just came
one day after the initial report so the
initial report was that Windows Phone
7.8 will be arriving in early 2013 the
second report which I wrote about was
allegedly originating from a nokia
developer meeting in asia pacific when
allegedly it has been said that Windows
Phone 7.8 has been released to
manufacturing and the update might be
landing in the next days two weeks of
course you can ask a ton of questions
whether it will be arriving only to
nakia phones whether it will be arriving
only two Asian Pacific regions but there
are two different reports with two
different time stamps and time frames
and the rumor mill which one is is the
more recent one Tony the one I wrote I'm
sorry I missed that I should have put
that one on the story or not the one I
wrote is from November 17 and the other
one which road is from November 16 right
so two conflicting stories on this I
hope that for people on the 900 the 817
etc don't have to wait until the 1st
quarter of 2013 to get their 78 update
because it you know it's obviously a
very significant update uh uh I don't
know we'll see which one of their do you
guys have any active 7 series devices
you yes personally I have to dust off my
LG optimus 7 I've gotta focus but it
doesn't turn on anymore no no why did
you try and route it what's that I said
so did you try and route it nah I don't
think so i might have thrown against a
wall but I don't have any reason any
reason to do to do so i really like I'd
like to focus I like the focus too I
took what's funny is I got a commenter
one of our more anyway one of our
commenters left left me a comment
talking about my complaints on maps Ruiz
talking about try driving from boston to
san diego and using google maps and see
how you like it nothing's right let's
try ping and I'm like wow that's really
fascinating i drove from Long Island to
San Diego and I did use bing maps on
windows phone 7 you what it would a
prescient comment you've inflammatory
person it is a matter of fact I hated it
but you know whatever it's it's it's
very funny to think back on my days with
the samsung focus and they feel like a
long time ago I have a question that I
might sound dumb but again I will always
say this to my excuse i am from Europe
so I don't know do you guys have roaming
rates when you go I don't know from one
state to the other from I don't know
from the Pennsylvania to New York know
that useful for data's that used to be
the case but no no longer most national
carriers offer free roaming so basically
when you are using google maps for
navigation going from one state to the
other is just your local normal rates or
it counts against your allowance it
counts against your data a lot and with
ya whether you're on your front porch or
whether you're in hawaii yeah i
understood ok because i was thinking
about reasons for me to to use google
maps as navigation when i drive to
Berlin or to Barcelona crossing five or
six countries and of course in Europe
there are roaming rates but if if the
states are the same as for instance a
domestic country a domestic region in
Romania or any other country in Europe
then you have no other right so thank
you for clarifying that yeah
do you remember when back in the early
cellphone days hmm if you went out of
your like hometown you'd be roaming and
you'd be charged more like a literally
early 90s well that was even late 90s
and into the early part of the
twenty-first century because I remember
yes yes i remember when i went to
college we talked with his last week and
getting my first cell phone like I was
like so I can use this in Virginia I'm
in New York now but I can use it in
Virginia they're like yep doesn't matter
where your call with it whatever you do
it's nationwide I'm like wow I am still
shocked than I continue to be shocked
until the US carriers will probably yank
this Cupid idea that you guys in the US
have to pay for incoming calls I find
that to be the most stupid thing ever
counts against our minute allotment yeah
yeah it is it is dumb it and there used
to be something called first incoming
minute free that you could try and
finagle your carry around it's funny
yeah so like people would call you in
like 4 59 seconds you talking like okay
gotta go bye no it's stupid you got to
think of it as stupid and I'm glad in
Pierre in Europe we don't have that I'm
just glad I don't use the phone anymore
you know my voicemail doesn't work like
my google voice call forwarding is is so
inconsistent for some reason now
probably cuz there's somebody phones is
forwarding to that like when I get a
voicemail I just don't even I don't even
check it I because of a voice everyone
knows I don't talk on the phone anymore
do you guys leave messages on a
voicemail I don't do you leave mess why
is that like it no I mean the first
thing I do when I when I purchasing you
prepaid sim or I sign a new contract
this to disable the voicemail because
nobody actually leaves a message I mean
when somebody listens to my greeting
message like hey this is tony you know
what you have to do they just they just
hang up and i'm the same i don't want to
leave a message i want to talk to
somebody I hate I hateful can't talk for
a second about voicemail I know this
isn't I mean we're already it's already
on the way there are two big probs with
voice but number one is that people's
voicemail messages you know when you
hear the recording our way too long this
is usually how it goes hey this is uh
this is mike goand you have reached 5 5
5 1 2 1 2 i'm unable to come to the
phone right now but if you want to leave
your name address phone number and
favorite color i will call you back at
some time in the future now wait for the
beep and when it sounds I want you to
work and he just say it's true so my
voicemail just says hi this is Brandon
please leave a message and so that's
that's that's the first problem the
second problem is that people leave
entirely too long voicemails which is
why I'm very delighted that google voice
translates it into text so you can read
it you can scan it you don't have to
listen to all the arms and ahhs and you
know the hesitations oh yeah sucks but
voicemail voicemail sucks that's a good
day you're right I google google voice
does transcribe people's voice messages
into emails that it then sends you or it
just stays in the google voice interface
but its transcription is the most
hilariously wrong thing just all the
time i used to i had a habit for about a
year of whenever somebody to leave me a
voicemail i would take the transcription
copy and paste in and facebook and just
share with my friends like anyone want
to help me figure out what this actually
says because it was just ridiculous it's
like hey Michael shrub went to bear town
and bank attack look out for love you by
East Tennessee as google translate yes
yes it's terrible I used to use this
service called line one translation and
they actually had humans do the
transcriptions and they were incredibly
acted but unfortunately you paid like
ten cents per message which just wasn't
feasible but but yeah the translation is
hilariously bad anyway let's let's uh
let's come back to Windows Phone 8 to
close it out real quick because Adam
Lane did a did a as city lens video in
New York City where he'd showed no kids
silence I want to say that if you're
going to get a windows phone I think Ian
getting a nokia phone is still it's a
good a good call because of all the
added functionality it brings to fill
some of these windows phone 8 gaps but
City lenses if you don't know is it an
augmented reality application do you um
this to me I'm gonna ask what you guys
think about this but to me mented
reality is the biggest letdown of the
smartphone world not because when I
first saw it I will always remember
where I was when I first saw a demo of
it and I'm like really you just hold
your phone up and it's superimposes like
where the local pizza hut is on top of
the image that your camera if you find
that's awesome but in practice it's
always awkward
it's always just weird if you're using
it in person like I did in New York City
a couple like last week like you're
holding your phone out in front of you
up at eye level and yes you can see
where you're going because the phone's
camera optic is energized and so you can
kind of like see but it's not
comfortable it's not really any more
useful than using a map application
depending on your map application I
guess what's the in Adam was was having
some you know Adam was just giving us a
rundown in his in his video I mean
what's the use case here if you guys
ever found any augmented reality app
useful no Brandon you had a video do you
remember the video when you showed up
that application on the iphone
translates yeah exactly that bad yeah oh
yeah it's incredible like it's called I
think it's called world lens or word
lens no idea we'll have to look it up
member we have let's hook it up it's
available for all platforms now it is
also really you hold your camera up to a
stop sign and what is stopped in Spanish
uh call Jaime and I what is what is
stopped in Russian Tony dough boy okay
it'll say that but in it like it'll
actually take the text it won't just
like superimpose like Times New Roman
it'll actually change the text of the
stop sign to read stop in Russian like
it is so if you're traveling hold it up
to a menu and it's like you can read a
Spanish menu in English on your it's
just that's cool I think augmented
reality is really risky and that to
develop an app that's really good takes
a lot of time and resources and because
it's so high-risk I don't think
developers are really doing much with it
right now do you know what what hardware
modification would make augmented
reality work for me wood and we've
talked about this a long time ago a
rotating camera because back in the day
and dumb phone samsung was putting its
rotating barrel cameras on a lot of its
phones and it was handy because you
could move the lens around without
moving the phone if i could rotate my
camera on my smartphone so that the lens
was pointing straight through the top
edge and i could hold the thing like i
normally hold it while using augmented
reality that would be worthwhile
me no one will ever do it because
augmented reality is something that
people think is cool for like two
seconds and then they never use it again
I feel like you know citation needed but
you know IIIi don't think hardware
manufacturers will bring back these
movable cameras but that would be really
really cool to see I think that would be
cool and and that's you know another
problem about many reality is the as you
imply the unnaturalness of it that's why
I think Google Goggles is trying to do
augmented reality in an entirely
different way that makes sense that's
more natural yes oh yeah and that's
gonna be fun to try out i forgot that
existed that they went they went dark
for a bit um yeah let's uh what i want
to stand in the nokia apps of i but i
want to jump into iOS because nokia here
maps okay kind of debuted i think last
week and it's already the fourth top
iphone app no actually yesterday it
debuted yesterday 24 hours ago so i can
probably right now 26 hours ago and
here's what happened everyone downloaded
it as quickly as freaking possible and
everyone uninstalled it a few minutes
later after they saw that it's not even
it's it's it's a low resolution app it's
not made for retina display Oh Larry
it's really bad so let me let me just
say this because i think we had some
commenters on our last episode of the
one before asking like have you guys
actually used apple maps I'm like is it
really that bad are you just succumbing
to the media hype and it's like okay I
can't go anywhere without people like
people find out what I do like what do
you don't know why I would talk about
like oh I have an iphone of course you
do everybody has never it's like do you
like it go to baba Baba I love it my
used I used to like it so much and now I
hate it and I'm like why is that like
Maps like of course like they like you
use a non-stop and and people apparently
do like I mean just just last night it's
having conversation my friend's
girlfriend that that was pretty much
verbatim the conversation and and she's
like I hate I don't even use maps
anymore I just hate it so much like are
you freaking for real so anyway I
understand why Nokia here maps has risen
to the to the top downloaded apps lot so
much but you guys have used it I have
not tell me about it besides us being
low res is it any good
it's it's the interface is ugly it's
very no key esque which is not so bad it
reminds me of a symbian you I where the
buttons have rounded edges and it's kind
of like light blue um you know I tried
searching for some stuff and it didn't
really find what I wanted I think that's
actually the main problem with Apple
maps like I searched for I've seen my
flu shot and I needed to know that
address of my primary doctor so I type
his name it to google and it takes me to
like Poland and if I did that in google
maps on an android phone or on an iphone
4s with with google maps it would take
me right to the right place it you would
know that i don't care about a doctor in
Poland because I'm in southeastern
Pennsylvania you know and I think I
think no no key max also had that
problem but it's just ugly to look at I
mean you don't want the Apple Apple maps
look really nice in comparison yeah I'll
tell me what's your what's your
experience over there well I can tell
you this much it is better than apples
Maps in my city Apple maps in my city
doesn't have any point of interest no
venues no businesses nothing I have the
maps all right I can navigate from point
A to point B if i manually select them
but if i search for something anything i
cannot find it mmm now Nokia Maps has
points of interest not all of them less
than google maps but it has them so for
instance if i am to type there's a
shopping center here in Oradea which is
called lotus center the fights i blow
the center into Apple maps it brings me
to the center of Lotus City summer in
the States if I do the same thing on
here maps it finds it and I can navigate
there so it is definitely better and can
I speculate for just a second because
this gives me the opportunity to further
emphasize my opinion that apple will not
allow google maps in the app store and i
will probably eat my words but i think
that this is the case so you don't think
you look at this really we have here
maps 24 hours on the itunes store
already at position number four if
Google Maps was accepted in the iTunes
Store it will be probably number one
higher rank than YouTube which is
position number two once everybody will
start using Google's own dedicated iOS
application for maps and navigation
Apple will have an impossible mission
impossible bringing those users back to
its own Apple maps and Apple canceled
google maps for a reason they want to
push their own maps so I think this is
the reason why they will never allow
google maps in the app store but I will
eat my words if I'm wrong it they screw
it up they really really screw this up
there's no way to get around this they
cannot reject google maps it will look
terrible and if they accept Google Maps
they're gonna probably screw up years
and years and years worth of efforts to
make their own mapping system it's
really a terrible position nepean it is
that it's very rock and a hard place
kind of thing I wouldn't want to make
that decision but I'll tell you i if i
were there i would probably find ways to
justify it i would probably try and find
ways to compromise but i would
absolutely let Google back in the store
because when you as you guys have
already said when you look at these
effects when you see Nokia released a
mapping solution and then less than 24
hours later it's like one of the top
most downloaded apps in the you know
there's obviously a huge demand for a
proper mapping solution and its
interests i also have I also have a
solution but oh what if it's so there's
I haven't encountered a problem with the
maps themselves they are accurate the
street names in my region at least which
is not a top region are accurate the
problem is with the points of interest
in venues so if if Apple partnered
beyond ways because ways from what I've
heard and seen is their primary partner
for maps if they would partner with I
don't know Foursquare or Facebook for
locations then automatically you get
access to billions and billions of
points of interest on your own maps and
problem solved hmm that's not a bad idea
at all because whatever when I want to
check in to foursquare it uses apples
Maps but it overlays the Foursquare
points of interest and that's the
biggest problem of apples Maps the lack
or the in accuracy of the points of
interest you know what's interesting and
this is as it relates to two windows
found this whole apple in Madison
because that's my biggest problem with
windows phone 8 gets the point of
interest wrong or the Nokia Maps on
windows phone is that they gets point of
interest wrong and it's not terribly
dense and it doesn't offer a lot but it
sounds like a lot of these problems are
happening on the on the Apple maps you
know in the Apple maps of space as well
so and this won't be a massive ground
swell of movement over to windows phone
but I feel like one less impediment
there's one less impediment now for
users who are like wow i'd really like
to jump to windows phone from iOS
whoever these users are i don't know if
there are a lot of them probably to
andrea but not to windows phone well but
now there's one less reason not to go to
Windows Phone it's like well my mapping
experience is gonna suck unless I'm on
Android is that is the state of the
world right now because really it's what
it sounds like and it's amazing how
important mapping maps has become to the
smartphone experience I feel like
something we treat it as kind of a
utility before where we didn't really
appreciate it and now that the major the
huge major Apple platform has has
screwed up maps everyone's taking notice
and saying wow I really do use that
pretty often there's some people that
still don't use that off like my mother
got an iphone not too long ago and she
is looking for like a nail salon and she
needed if the phone number so she's
calling 311 I'm like mom what that keep
doing you have yeah maps are you just
typing in them there yeah so I think
there's a stove a lot of people
especially the less sophisticated users
that don't know the utility than that
but I agree it's it's it's thus of a
sort of secondary feature it's more like
a you know I must have oh yeah yeah it's
funny I mean there that I always kind of
laugh when I see things like that one
motor more one of my roommates is
absolutely just not a techno person and
like she was calling to order something
yesterday and she was like calling a
delivery company on the phone and like
reading their menu off the off a piece
of paper and what are you doing whatever
woods what's going on with you she's
like I've been looking at a computer
screen all day and I just I need to talk
to a human and give somebody cash and
get something in you know in the real
world and I'm like wow that's weird I
don't
I don't really ever want to do that I
should understand no I can understand
her Joan just made a jerk but anyway um
this is a well we're talking about iOS
and just to kind of close out iOS this
is fascinating and I was going to skip
it I was not going to include it in the
rundown and I even didn't even put the
headline in here right but it's a story
from Stephen shank from yesterday
chances are your kid wants an ipad this
holiday season but maybe not an ipad
mini and this is a nielsen report
talking about you know a survey about
you know what what do kids want for
christmas and apple's ipad is apparently
up there in the list and you know i'm
reading this story i'm like i'm kind of
like okay who cares moving on to the
next one but then I look then I look at
the bottom there like the last line of
this story that's talking about her kids
want the ipod touch the ipad the iphone
5 as we move away from Apple territory
says the story kids seem to quickly lose
interest only about one sixth of the
children surveyed claimed to be jonesing
for an android phone and a meager six
percent are hoping to see a microsoft
surface in their stockings that's
fascinating because he will what's a
kick any like daddy i wanna i wanna make
a spreadsheet really have the better I
don't I want to have a macro work with
presentation yeah I'm gonna make a
powerpoint I like to remind ourselves en
right now I like but this is the thing
right cuz I if if I'm looking at this
story my initial impulse is to be like
ah kids don't don't care about reading
about kids whatever but kids are the
buyers of tomorrow and what they what
their preferences say is really really
important and apples I feel like apples
brand image maybe not eroding but maybe
in the position where it could be
eroding soon in the face of this kind of
Android onslaught or whatever but it
that hasn't trickled down to kids yet at
all because I feel like I feel like six
six percent of kids or what want
microsoft surface like only one-sixth of
children surveyed wanted an android
phone and you know you can I don't know
what the testing methodology was but
this is Nielsen
this isn't some like tiny analyst firm
you know these are this is real data
that's really interesting and it says a
lot about the future I think good I
don't know if we're talking about you
know teens preteens toddlers or six to
twelve though so this is a little bit
unrelated but sort of related recently
there was an eight-month year old boy in
my house he was a friend's son and they
had this awesome case for their iPad it
was a fisher-price ipad case that just
surrounded the device and like tons of
plastic and rubber so if you dropped it
from the Empire State Building I'm just
bouncing away happily and and to quiet
this kid the mother gives him the iPad
and here's a kid who can can't sit up by
himself because he's too young he
obviously can't talk um and she puts on
an app for him it's like a storybook app
that says stuff there's like sounds and
colors and then eight month year old kid
who has terrible motor control just
because he's so young is able to swipe
on the darn screen and he sits there for
like 35 minutes swiping from screen to
screen on this iPad completely immersed
and it was just it's crazy wow that's
amazing it's amazing and and yeah I mean
kids affinity towards these Apple
products is probably going to carry them
forward um and you know we're having
Thanksgiving at our house and there's
gonna be a like a nine year old boy and
he gets he's a little crazy you know
that's a tough age they're bouncing off
the walls I bring out my iPad and I'm
like here's my games folder and he runs
away and I don't see him the rest of the
night it's amazing you know I'm kind of
looking at the bar graph on them from
this survey and you know there are some
excuse me there's some hope for other
stuff in here there's a category called
tablet computer other than ipad which
gotta respect excuse me a respectable
twenty-nine percent to the iPads
forty-eight percent so that's
interesting and that mirrors this other
kind of metric where I'm we frequently
forget how big the non ipad tablet
market is or at least I do and I keep
forgetting like the iPad is not is not
the leader as far as share
goes in the tablet space eyes what it's
not for sales it may be but not for
actual market like saturation like it is
i we have to find just recently fell
from sixty-five percent 250 something oh
I'm sorry okay I'm sorry maybe you're
right it is over fifty percent it is the
leader but I think from my perspective I
expected its lead to be somewhere
between eighty to ninety percent and not
the slim lead that it has and it's fun
to think about and all this and these
metrics were true you know back in the
days before the Nexus 7 and when the
Kindle Fire hadn't gotten that much
purchase yet this was true you know way
way earlier this year later last year
and I'm like who who's buying all these
like zooms you know so it's interesting
to be reminded sometimes at the tablet
market itself is bigger than we think it
is we will see exactly what we have seen
with the iphone I mean the iphone is one
phone coming from one manufacturer with
a one operating system against everybody
else the ipad is exactly the same it's
one tablet from one company with 10 s
versus everybody else what I find
amazing is that two or three years
almost after its introduction the ipad
is still the market leader yeah that is
that is fascinating and it's you know
it's why i think we write about the
reasons why and and like ecosystem
concerns and stuff like that no be very
interesting to see what the Nexus 10
does to this if anything it'll be
interesting to see if Google's gamble
works where they're like we made
beautiful hardware now developers get
excited you know Oh speaking of which
just very briefly Tony that sent me a
link right before the podcast started
the the skype app has been rewritten for
Android and apparently it takes
advantage of larger screen sizes a
little bit better i I think skype
stories kind of bore me more than
anything else because skype always fails
me somehow except in this podcast which
by the way knock on wood skype has been
doing us well for about 20 episodes here
but you know it's it's interesting to me
to see that in an application from a
developer owned by a competitor which is
Microsoft and is finally like taking
advantage of the larger canvas size of a
bigger android tablet and you do that
yeah and these apps are out there as
Android commenters remind us all the
times like here's this list of Awesome
tablet apps like yeah okay we have all
16 oh yeah exactly and so there they are
out there but to seal it to come from a
big developer like Skype is cool so
maybe it's starting to work already we
don't know we won't know until the nexus
10 really gets out there and hopefully
they'll sell in some numbers and by the
way real quick you let us know what you
think about the nexus 10 because I've
seen you unboxed it oh yes yes yes um
you know it's it's beautiful in a little
in a weird kind of like flying saucer
ish yeah in a late 90s concept of the
future kind of way it's you know I like
those rounded edges and I like the feel
in hand because it well it has this uh
it's not it's soft touch but you know
how soft touch is almost like suede to
the fingertips sometimes like it has
that strange you know soft touch has a
very unique feel Samsung has gone with
some completely different soft touch on
this thing and it's it's tacky almost is
it tacky and like a gross I just spilled
my soda on no it's not it manages to be
tacky and grippy in a way that's not
gross now I didn't get all sweaty with
it you know if it's the summer time I'm
walking around with this thing and like
it's hot it's probably gross right but I
don't know I just like different
materials choices and when you marry
different materials choices within kind
of an unconventional design that yes
does look like a toddler's tablet maybe
a little bit with its weirdo rounded
corners I'm gonna like it because it's
different and the screen is you know
beautiful what I saw of the startup
screen I didn't want to ruin Joe Levi's
experience too much I was like all right
I've unboxed it let me get this out to
our Android guy and I wonder how much of
that router aspect the design has
something to do with samsung and google
believing it or just just being a move
to avoid future possible litigation from
Apple that's a good question
gen and I'm sure that probably played a
big part in in the design and you know
I'm glad about it because frankly I'm
i'm tired of big rectangular slabs with
you know short radius circles and on the
corners and like wow koolance another it
could be an iPad I don't know I'm six
feet away I can't tell what it is you
know because they all look the same so
yeah I'm happy to see that we'll have to
see what would Joe thinks of it we're uh
we're not going to go for listener mail
today because as I mentioned there's a
short practice we still have stuff to do
before the holiday comes in so folks
when you send us listener mail thank you
for your mail will try and get to some
of these pieces next week please do
please do favor brevity if possible we
love reading your mail but some of these
I think most of the pieces we got this
week are like really really long so you
know we just don't have time by the time
we get to the end of one of these shows
and as I learned or tried to learn as a
teenager simply saying I'll keep this
short at the top of your of your piece
of mail and then following it with 700
word words of expression does not it
doesn't work but I want to reiterate
that we actually love getting mail from
you and some of these questions are
really good why don't we keep on saying
the same thing for the length of the
buck yes to what's well that's true what
what that we're gonna go shorter that's
right we open up every shows like we're
gonna keep this one short we're at 90
minutes again I think if we want to keep
it below one hour we have to talk about
only ones out I know well you know what
well we'll talk about this I want to
kind of maybe think about doing a show
Wow would it anyway whatever we'll talk
up here listeners you will have to do
all have to speculate about what we're
going to talk about but before we sign
off can I get some some final thoughts
from we've talked about some important
stuff today Brandon before the holiday
sures us into wonderful tryptophan based
sleep do you want to say anything I
don't think so configure yes at all yeah
I think I unleashed a big beating on the
Nexus 4 to start and
you know I'll hash out some more
thoughts in the final review coming
early next week but that it's still the
phone um just again keep your
expectations in check that's my downfall
that's a that's that's a good point and
Tony I am looking forward to seeing all
the reports press releases and analysis
following up Black Friday and Cyber
Monday in terms of sales we've sold this
much we've activated this much and just
to compare them and this is just to
remember our audience readers listeners
that it's kicking off the holiday season
it's gonna be analysis and reports after
analysis and reports last year was that
huge battle between Google's Android and
Apple's iOS like how many millions did
we activate over the Christmas period
now we did 25 pieces more so I'm just
looking forward to seeing those and
reporting of the course me too and yet
you actually remind me that we do we
will have tags live for black friday
stories and cyber monday stories and
you'll want to watch for those listeners
