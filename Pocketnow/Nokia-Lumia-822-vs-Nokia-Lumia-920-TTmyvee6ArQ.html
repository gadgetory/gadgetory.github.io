very different across the top to
nationwide carriers of those AT&amp;amp;T packs
the wider Windows Phone selection topped
by the high-end Nokia Lumia 920 but say
red is more your color on Verizon
Wireless your Nokia selection is topped
off by the mid-range Nokia Lumia 822
each of these devices has its own
particular strengths and weaknesses so
let's explore them I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow and this is Nokia
Lumia 822 versus Nokia Lumia 920 now
here we've got the white version of both
of these devices on the left is the
Lumia 920 and on the right is Lumia 822
we're gonna put these head-to-head as
quickly as we can in five categories
specs build display software and camera
on the spec side even though we're
looking at a mid-range device stacked up
against a high-end one there's not much
different in the guts at least at the
core they both run on a dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 running at 1.5
gigahertz and backed up by a gig of ram
crucially and interestingly since the
8:22 is a lower range model both devices
feature support for LTE on their
respective carriers that is a huge plus
obviously the 8:22 also features support
for a microSD expansion to boost its
onboard 16 gigs of storage with the
Lumia 920 you're stuck with a non
expandable 32 gigs
speaking of non removable items the 920
features an embedded 2000 milliamp hour
battery while the 822 takes a slight
amp-hour hit to 1,800 in exchange for
the option to remove it
although these devices are very clearly
from the same manufacturer and look
quite similar on video they're quite
different in the hand the 920 at 185
grams as one of the beefier phones we've
encountered heavier even than the Galaxy
Note 2 and at 10 point 7 millimeters
it's not winning any awards for thinnest
of the bunch but it also boasts not just
the best build quality we've seen on
Windows Phone
but one of the most premium builds we've
seen on smartphones in general it feels
and looks like a luxury device the Lumia
822 is lighter at 142 grams but thicker
at 11 point two millimeters
thanks to these sheer sides that remind
us of a tumblehome hull shape on an old
battleship you feel every millimeter of
that thickness in the hand now whether
that's a good or a bad thing depends on
you but the combination of lightweight
thick ungainly design and the prominent
chin below the display makes the 8:22
feel every bit the mid-range device its
model number conveys that lower tier
status is further reinforced by the
display is chosen for these models the
822 is fitted with a 4.3 inch 800 by 480
AMOLED panel while the higher-end 920
features a 4.5 inch 1280 by 768 LCD the
blacks are deeper and the colors a bit
more saturated on the 822 and both
devices feature Nokia's clear black
technology as well as its glove friendly
super-sensitive touch the 822 is also
more visible edge-on but the higher
resolution larger panel on the 920 puts
out a pixel density of 332 PPI and that
combined with the smooth 60fps rendering
of the pure motion HD plus technology
makes the Lumia 920's panel the winner
in our book since it debuted two years
ago one thing has remained fairly
consistent about Microsoft's new mobile
platform a windows phone is a Windows
Phone by that we mean that performance
including UI fluidity and app launch
speeds is about the same no matter what
device you pick and that seems to hold
true for Windows Phone 8 as well boot
time is identical between these units
and app launch times are so close to
identical that it's impossible to call a
winner we'll try a few here just so you
don't have to take my word for it we
like to make sure the phone launches on
time 1 2 3 boom
almost identical as we say see if we can
hop into messaging SMS 1 2 3 boom almost
identical once again hop back to the
home screen here email application 1 2 3
once again almost identical and the
camera will use the shortcut key on the
side here you may be detecting
millisecond differences in these launch
times but that's just because of my
inability to hit the button at the same
time these are really really too close
to call 1 2 3
boom viewfinders are up the 822 beating
the 9:20 by maybe a tenth of a second
really nothing that's going to make a
difference in day-to-day use finally
we'll take a look at the browser on each
starting with D 9:20 coming to the 9:20
specs page go ahead and zoom out zoom in
we've seen this in our full Lumia 920
review which you can find elsewhere at
pocketnow.com the very responsive
doesn't take a long time for the text to
re-render when you zoom in quickly and
of course flick and pass action in the
browser is just fine let's check it out
on the 822 loaded to the comparable page
for the 822 specs
DoubleTap zoom in once again
excellent responsiveness with the page
fully loaded swiping there's a little
bit less inertia on the a 22s display it
doesn't there's no it's difficult to
explain but it doesn't cover as much
ground when you flick but that is not a
knock on the device that's just it just
handles touch input differently
certainly no surprises here Windows
Phone continuing to behave the same
across different models even from high
tier to mid tier comparison points using
the Windows Phone benchmarking app WP
bench shows us similar results as well
with the 8:22 scoring 245 0.02 and the
920 scoring - 33.5 in its performance
test both of these devices feature
cameras in the 8 megapixel class 8.0 on
the 822 and 8.7 on the Lumia 920 the 920
of course features the special PureView
optical stabilization technology
whereas the 822 does not both cameras
perform very well though their output
varies based on lighting conditions
sometimes the 920's camera delivers
colors more true to life but other times
it favors more brilliant colors with
higher saturation the 920's camera did
perform better in low-light situations
as expected given its optimization in
the end you're looking at two excellent
but very different Windows Phone 8
devices on Verizon the Lumia 822 is the
highest end Nokia Windows Phone you can
get for now and though it's screen is
low res and its body is clunky it still
delivers a solid software experience a
good camera and LTE plus it's got
expandable memory and that's not a bad
feature set for $49.99 on contract if
you can stomach the design on AT&amp;amp;T the
Lumia 920 is $50 more expensive on
contract it's heavier and it's got non
removable battery and no expandable
storage but in exchange there is a much
bigger better display beautiful hardware
design and one of the best smartphone
cameras around if you've got solid AT&amp;amp;T
LTE coverage and no beef with America's
number 2 wireless carrier the Lumia 920
is undoubtedly the classier contender
here as always though it all comes down
to what works for you each of these at
the end of the day is a very capable
smartphone in its own right folks hope
you enjoy the comparison between the 822
and the 920 we have a lot more on these
