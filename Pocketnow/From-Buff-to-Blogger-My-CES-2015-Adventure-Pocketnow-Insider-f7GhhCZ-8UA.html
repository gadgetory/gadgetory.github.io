always wanted to just drop everything
for a week and fly to Vegas to check out
all the new crazy gadgets and cars and
tech that the new year has to offer but
part of the fun of seeing everything is
telling all of your friends about it
when it's over taking them through the
experience my name is hi out to human
and I want to take you through the
experience of covering CES with pocket
now
the first day I landed in Vegas after I
had checked into my hotel and picked up
my badge I dove into the rental car
captained by mr. two phones himself and
our journey began we tackled LG and sony
early on in the day and the slow pace of
day zero gave me time to learn how the
pocket now CES machine would operate
every morning after that Michael Jaime
and I would find a place to meet up and
head to the convention center where we
go over the plans for the day and act
accordingly that usually meant that
Michael and I would go cover a device
while Jaime edited previous footage in
the press room I learned very quickly to
appreciate the rental car we had which
made getting across town for meetings
much easier at least when we could find
a place to park thank you very much
recovering devices and editing videos is
only half of CES or any trade show
really the other half is meeting people
and having a good time sure you might
run into some familiar faces emits too
hurried power walk to the next device
but it's good to have a place where
everyone can just unwind and socialize
showstoppers was just that place and man
were there some awesome people there and
awesome food we got the chance to check
out a few booths while we were there one
of which featured the yotaphone too and
to our surprise we were even given a
review unit on the spot it was a great
time of course not everything can go
smoothly at CES and for us that was both
thanks to time constraints and the
miscommunications you see the waterfall
that's where I want to film our goodbyes
chose the podcast instead all things
considered it was a fairly seamless
experience from start to finish and we
had just enough time left over by the
end to visit friend of the show nicole
scott and record an onsite podcast to
close out our final night of coverage
before saying goodbye it may not be the
best trade show for mobile the CES 2015
was the best time I've had in a long
while and it's all thanks to Michael hi
May and the rest of the guys from pocket
now so be sure to subscribe and follow
the guys on the ground for Jaime Rivera
I auto Houston and all pocket now I'm
Michael Fisher we'll see you next time
you are so much better than I am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
