weekly hello and welcome to episode 12
of the pocket now weekly once a week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss news and opinion from the world
of mobile technology smartphones tablets
phablets of every shape stripe shade and
source and so forth I'm your host
Michael Fisher senior editor at pocket
now I'm joined as usual by our
editor-in-chief Brandon minimun good
morning to use her hello there and by
Anton de Naja is off this week's over
very special guest joining us for the
first time on the show chief news editor
Stephen shank welcome to the pocket that
Weekly ahoy-hoy thanks for having me
it's great to have you we had a way to
shake up this morning so Stephen is
joining us on somewhat short notice and
this is great because as I was saying
just a second ago off the air I have
never spoken to Stephen in real life we
have chatted on an instant messenger of
chatter via text I have absolutely never
heard his voice before this very moment
so this is very exciting for me someday
we'll share photos than ventually a
video possibly meet in real life five or
six years down the line you know Aria
our relationship is just gonna keep
growing and that's you know that's I'm
very much looking forward to our to our
adventure to utah to meet a fellow
mystery man Joel Eva in 10 years we've
got to go west coast for that one he um
we this is a strange morning all around
on account of you ever have those those
those evenings where you're maybe you've
stayed up a little too late and you're
laying in bed thinking well met you know
what at least I can sleep in tomorrow
Wow Wow pretty sick is that your brent
is it is it a crazy news day over there
it's it's it's so funny because um ever
since the mega foul of several weeks ago
where I literally had seven calls in a
row um I i started to remove all
electronic devices from the podcasting
area here but you know the day that I
forget my my wife calls and so I just
texted her to leave me alone I thought
that was like the red the red news phone
ringing I thought you know you guys had
to go into the news
bat cave for got a hot tip coming
through right this is good though wives
love it when you dismiss their calls
it's gonna work out well Brandon's just
gonna say this is gonna be awesome I'm
not going home tonight Kevin on the
office tonight yeah um but no like I was
in it last night I'm just I'm I'm up
late and I'm like well this is
ridiculous it's very very early in the
morning and the sun's gonna be coming up
soon at least I can sleep in oh crap
we're recording the podcast tomorrow so
I woke up this morning and not
well-rested and it was only the last
minute addition of Steven that really
got my adrenaline going and readied me
for the podcast so thank you steven i
have that effect on people yeah awesome
um let's uh let's let's hop in a little
bit to the to the news here I kind of
want to because we have Steven on the
show I want to maybe change up the order
just a little bit but before any of that
Brandon minimun tell us what you want to
talk about fur at first No thank you for
the floor mmm so I uh I've got something
to say about Apple I'm a little
disappointed an apple for two reasons so
you know one of the one of the great
amazing features I'd say it's an amazing
feature of the iphone 5 is this beveled
edge because if you tilt it in the light
it just it reflects the light just right
it looks so unique I can't think of any
other phone that has it but it's
tragically flawed as we found out
recently and we posted about if if you
happen to drop the iphone 5 or even if
you mishandle it you're going to nick
this aluminum edge and not only that but
a lot of people are finding of their
iphone 5s are coming from the factory
with nick's already in them which is
insane because you picture some machine
you know churning out millions of
iphones and how could it possibly damage
the phone of course there are humans
involved somewhere along the line so so
you know mine came with a nick and in
the unboxing video I kind of showed that
and was surprised to see it so I'd
always intended on going to the apple
store and getting a swap insisting on a
swap because there's no way I'm gonna
live my life with a phone that came
damage from the factory so the other day
I haven't done the swap yet by the way
the other day
accidentally dropped the iphone 5 uh it
wasn't a big fall though it was like it
was like two feet and it was on to a
tile surface which is relatively smooth
low friction it's not like concrete and
I didn't was like super hard though yeah
well well not as hard as concrete it's
it's probably you know I don't think it
matters that much we break out the Mohs
hardness scale real quick yeah taking me
back to ninth grade uh so I dropped the
phone and I I almost didn't want to pick
it up um but I did and I noticed that
there were two new Nick's in the
aluminum edges and I thought to myself
you know it's tragic because the iPhone
5 is so beautiful and yet you you can't
you can't not I don't know if I said all
right you can't not have a case you have
to cover up these edges or else you're
gonna do everyone drops their phone it I
don't care if you've got iron grip i
think i have i heard grip but I drop it
anyway but you have to get a case for
the iphone 5 because they went with this
soft aluminum wears on the iPhone 4 and
4s they had steel bands around the edge
which were more resilient and yeah if
you dropped your naked iphone 4 4 s you
would have cracked the front or back
probably but like this metal thing just
takes it to a whole new level yeah I
mean and is that that's what I was gonna
say I was gonna say well you know this
just makes the case for for a free case
huh you know it which is stupid because
I hate cases as we've discussed before I
mean you're covering up all this
beautiful engineering eliz hardware
design that went into making this you
know device that Apple and other
manufacturers espouse as as beautiful
yeah I mean I'm covering up in this like
pink this carnation pink silicone
 BS you know why are the trouble
of having this fancy beveled edge if you
can't even see it exactly exactly and
that's why that's why Apple didn't make
a bumper for the five because they
didn't want to cover up this beautiful
edge so uh didn't they didn't build a
bumper for the five ago there's no
official apple bumper for the file i
didn't know crazy Wow yeah yeah that
good good for third parties because
people kind of got used to that bumper
and the bumper was a great idea for the
4 and 4s yeah um no can I ask you a
question Brendan no yes well good beat
you to it
I want to ask you is it possible I
haven't handled the my own iphone 5 yet
so I want to know is it possible that a
one of those stick-on you know the
screen protector ask coverings could
help with this or those beveled edge is
just such small surface area that you
that it wouldn't apply there like you
know what I'm talking about the errant
stickies that go all over the phone I
don't know it cause it's like a film
yeah you know I think that like you said
the edge is so small that it would be
look impossible to read maybe there's
that a product where you spray the whole
entire device okay it's clear you yeah
it's yeah it's duy unless the protector
was already you know kind of folded to
fit the edges I don't see you just
pushing down and bolting it onto those
bevels they're so tiny yeah yeah yeah
not gonna happen um so so so yeah so I'm
getting a case now so that that's my
first disappointment with Apple which is
that they created a product that cannot
exist as a naked product and there's
nothing worse and I'm sure you've got as
I've seen this someone who goes in the
total opposite extreme of naked they
have this screen protector with these
horrible bubbles underneath its yes
aligned they've got this thick k singer
like is there is there not one over
there yes it's it like literally appears
to be like this this this actual brick
hanging around the neck of a friend of
mine who's a stage manager so she's
always like crawling around and you know
beaten up her phone and she needs it but
it's it's a monster I mean it's just it
some of those OtterBox cases are just
yeah they almost double the size of the
device and it's like wow that's just
incredible yeah yeah it's amazing um are
you gonna do this no I I'm thanks I I'm
actually going to bestbuy this afternoon
to find a case that's as minimal and as
protective as possible so I'm saying
goodbye to the beveled edges I will
pretend like they don't even exist
because I won't see them unless you get
like a clear case but that just looks
cheap anyway no so I think sorry the
throwing here for a second one we're
still on the the metal here is this
gonna be a huge problem with the ipad
mini cuz the pictures we saw looks like
it has the same aluminum finish
is this yeah are the ones that came out
yesterday it's gonna be you know scratch
city over there is that gonna be a huge
problem well it's it's not the like on
the back of the iphone it's got that
aluminum with this Cody yeah yeah which
is good its scratch resistant it really
is it's just this beveled edge and I
can't imagine that the iphone not the
ipad mini uh will have a beveled edge in
fact the you know the leaked images Tony
I don't think I've seen that no just for
proportionately it would have to be a
thicker metal edge to be substantive
substantial enough right so we'll have
to see it and it's interesting because
the newest I guess we might talk about
the ipad mini lady where we are I mean
we can actually if you wanted to leap
into it now that's that's totally fine
cuz I'm looking at the images right now
to see what you guys are talking about
i'm looking at the black the photos of
the black case yeah that and that's new
well but i mean i guess i guess it'll
come in white or black and it'll it'll
be sort of that gunmetal look yeah for
the listeners who don't know what we're
talking about these is this is a leak
that happened what was it yesterday from
this comes to us from like ukrainian
iphone is that right yeah that's the one
yeah with this showing the this suppose
that ipad mini case that is just all
black is this metal i haven't i've
actually had the link here but I can't
do we know it's gotta be yeah unless
looks like it at least maybe it's maybe
it's leather or uh maybe logon ID yes if
I would buy but can I just go on record
right now if a naugahyde iPad ever comes
out i will buy it and never ever get rid
of it what's that word you use at I
thought you said something else and was
our Naga Naga head what is that it's a
premium leather oh it's like example of
19 yeah a staple of 1960s designed the
original Star Trek series had a lot of
naugahyde in it that is terrific I i
love that material um um anyhow one more
thought before we get into the podcast
uh so i actually pre ordered to iphone
5s one for me and one for high maybe cuz
we're Jaime lives to get an iphone 5 is
literally double the price that it is
here and so we arranged for me to buy
one for him and then
pays me back and so forth so so I got
the second iphone 5 yesterday and I took
it out of the box as the second one was
actually going to be mine because he
wanted the 64 gig and I went to the 32 I
take it out of the box and I nervously
inspect the edges I'm like you better
not have any nicks and it didn't have
any nicks yay but what I you did you
secretly swap them out are you gonna
give Jaime the chipped one uh well well
the chipped one up you tell ya oh that's
right I'm taking back forgot so he's
gonna give the tile drop you think
they're gonna exchange it for you yeah I
am a lil nervous about that but I go
change it before the podcast goes live
good rock I have proof through video and
okay yeah actually wasn't Nick down box
I'm okay yeah so I get the new iphone 5
and I'm like hmm I wonder if they're any
different so I i turn on the new one and
I'm like you know this home button is
totally different the home button on the
first iphone 5 i got was clicky the
iphone the second iphone 5 i got the
home button is a little bit more numb
and then I mess around with some other
things I flip the toggle switch i press
the volume up and down button i noticed
the volume up and down buttons are more
cookie on this newer iphone 5 then on
the old one and i just i started to get
a little bit worried because you know i
i'm just i think i fear that we're
seeing a post Steve Jobs Apple that we
all sort of feared where it's okay to
release a Maps app that's not good
enough where it's okay to release a
phone with soft metal edges where it's
okay to have differences between final
products meaning the home button would
have a different texture on one iphone 5
vs the other and i understand that there
are human limitations in our ability to
create 10 million of one very complex
product in a very short period of time
and and this variation can be expected
but there's just there's not just one
thing that that is a hash sign fail for
the iphone there are multiple things and
it just it just worries me that that
this is the new apple that it that the
their bar has been lowered
a little bit it's an interesting point I
mean you got me thinking about what what
other iphones you know what fails other
iphones have launched with though in the
Steve Jobs era and I'm like I'm thinking
about like the badges the fact that
badges support and push notification
sport was delayed by I think like a full
year because I expected it on the iphone
3g and we were told to expect in on the
iphone 3g as i recall and it didn't
really arrived in full until the 3gs
right i mean that's a giant miss giant
kind of failure on their part and i
remember my remember the bubbles
remember the bubbles problem on the
iphone 3g or the casing would just like
from the casing material would spring
forth these little spherical defects
that grew over time you yeah like i
don't remember that since i wasn't
bonded properly or i don't know it was
something like i don't know if I don't
know technically what went wrong but at
the end result which I noticed on mine a
little bit was that if you looked
closely enough over time the iphone case
would not would become less smooth and
not in the way of scratches but it was
as almost as if you were holding a heat
source underneath it and small bubbles
of gas escaping from the casing yeah
rookie it was fascinating yeah yeah it
was very interesting to see that science
in action but you know of course not
everybody liked it I certainly didn't so
you know I I feel like we've we've seen
these problems before and I don't know
if I know where I definitely know where
you're coming from brandon i'm not sure
if if these problems are severe enough
yet to to be concerned about overly
concerned about that but i think that's
something that we're all kind of holding
our breath waiting for right it's like
Steve Jobs was this we've talked about
before was this ridiculously obsessed
perfectionist and now that that
influence maybe you know is not there on
a day-to-day basis then yeah there's
gonna come a day where we're gonna see
some real real problems and I don't know
I guess it'll come down to how Apple
handles it and like like they're
handling the map situation like this
actually our first iOS story you know
Apple came out on this was on September
20 this is like right after we last
recorded it's the oldest news in the
lineup where Apple's CEO Tim Cook came
out and published a letter on the
company's website saying we're extremely
sorry for the frustration this has
caused and we're doing everything we can
to make maps better
what you guys think about this reaction
I think it's pretty cool to see a
company's say all right we've weathered
a couple days worth of negative coverage
because our product isn't very good and
also you know what you're right and
we're sorry I mean what do you guys
what's your what's your with your
feeling on how this was handled I mean
it's nice to see a maiya culpa but
without any sort of you know follow
through plan like okay and now we're
going to go back with sign that deal
with Google get you what you want
straight away I mean there's they're in
the same boat they're waiting for
something better and I've no idea when
it's going to arrive yes I heard I was
on that was writing the teeth at the
subway here in Boston the other day and
two guys were on their way to some two
college kids and one of them had the
iphone 5 and I just was overhearing
snips as their conversation with a guy
was like yeah a noun in his own not very
good or something oh and the other guys
like how did you use Bing and the other
guys like what Bing Maps what was it a
ting ya know exactly was like this it
was like he'd never been exposed to the
Bing brand before and I was very telling
and the other guys like it's uh it's
microsoft's thing it was very odd about
this conversation was the minute that
other guy was like it's microsoft thing
I was like oh Bing Oh like Oh capital B
right yeah you have to alta vista right
the bing maps isn't even updated for the
taller screen the iphone so that's kind
of like black bars it's got the black
bars oh dear as and there you know i'm
actually surprised at how slow its going
with the updating of the of the apps i
mean a lot of key apps like Spotify and
the apple store and there's just so many
absolute did that haven't been updated
it's crazy that is that is crazy that's
weird um I'm sure those those will catch
up over time but it's just I don't know
I mean if Brandon have you been you've
spent another week with it now I mean we
talked about maps for extensively in the
last podcast but it so I just want to
touch on it here I mean are you still
and what's your what's your feeling on
has it changed it on no I mean I I was
driving by my my high school and it was
misspelled and so I submitted a
you know a report a problem and I didn't
want to do that because like I've never
had to stop and and send in an error
report for a Maps app that's ridiculous
and not sending in google maps are
reports it's fun then you see how you
contributed to it when they finally
accept it what really let's say they do
except it's even then you've gotta like
keep checking back there's no way to
know like all they actually listen to me
yeah yeah I've never submitted a action
item to google to fix something on their
maps but I tell you I have had the
opportunity to do so I don't know if I
mentioned in the last podcast but google
maps and I don't I'm Google Maps
frequently screws up for me I'll search
for something that I know is there
because I've been there before I just
can't remember the exact address i know
it's exact name and i don't know if it's
a sponsored result messing it up i don't
know if it's one of the Zagat things
messing it up if it's a restaurant but
it won't give me the right place like
maybe three times out of five it won't
give me the proper number one search
result i have to like dig through the
list if i'm on my device so maybe it's
me maybe I don't omit the opposite of
the Midas touch with google maps but you
know I certainly haven't had a flawless
maps experience and Android now you're
talking about looking for points of
interest or addresses I'm talking about
looking for a point of interest based on
its name specifically like a restaurant
or a bar like this has happened with
maybe mmm I guess yeah and the last
month of probably done five or six map
searches and three or four out of those
times it hasn't given interesting that
it's the same thing that we're calling
apple out on nail yet it's happening
with Google and no one seems to be that
yes sir and you know maybe like I say I
haven't heard widespread complaints
about it so maybe it's just me you know
it's I'm not doing anything wrong i
guarantee you that but maybe it's a
Boston thing I don't know but you know
it's not like it's a small city so if it
is a Boston thing that's a problem and
maybe so maybe i'll submit error report
there you go yeah you could be good
citizen via cutter benefits ads to
answer your question i mean beyond that
i guess one of the true tests will be
tomorrow actually when I go to New York
City when so are you Michael yeah you
know we're we're gonna be navigating
around the city and I guess I'll tested
for real then but besides that here in
the burbs you know
been fine it it finds what I what I
needed to find I haven't had any weird
moments I do definitely miss street view
but beyond that it works for what I
needed for well it'll be aight i will
very much look forward to seeing how
yours works in New York City and and
trading devices with you for a second we
should have a Maps off once we uh you
know on our way to the event I
definitely want to see how much we can
get each one to screw up I am tempted to
put together a scavenger hunt for you
too oh that would be awesome how do you
delete phones you want to go geocaching
Brandon they'll be fun yeah Thank You
fun stuff we can hide QR codes or
actually I was gonna suggest in some
sort of NFC technology but can't do that
with the iphone 5 ah wah wah womp womp
then again who use NFC no one no one I
know every time I see a galaxy has three
commercial where it's like oh wow we can
just tap our phones together and and
trade content it's like yeah but nobody
really does anyway um I want to talk
about before we move on to Android the
the iphone 5 total cost of ownership I
made this is Jaime Oh Doug that I was
yeah um this was a report from what is
the name of the firm avalanche spent
some time calculating how much it would
cost you to own a smartphone during the
year and of course I guess the iphone 5
being one of the most talked-about
devices they decided to run some numbers
on that and it's actually a very pretty
little run down here that's really well
visually appealing infograph yeah it's
very cool i I mean it's just these
things probably take a long time to make
I don't think I want to find out how how
to make them cuz then you'll want me to
make one right yeah nerit so so this is
like I look at this and I'm like yeah
it's expensive to own an iphone 5 over 2
years but it's also expensive to own a
standard smartphone the only real
difference is that apps in the Apple
storm were a little bit more expensive
you've got to get some new accessories
and you've got to get a new case which
is an accessory but like it doesn't this
apply it it you know 1x or galaxy s3 you
know maybe not so much with the really
offensive lightning cables and the
adapters but yeah that mean the the
monthly plans this is what you're going
to be paying on an Android or Windows
Phone right and it is actually that's
probably the most interesting thing
about this infographic is it does break
down in the US the kit the network
providers cost you know verizon 18 teen
sprint are all quoted here and it it's
just so interesting to see what some of
these plans are in a in a form outside
of their usual websites because you see
verizon's like you could pay 80 bucks a
month and you're getting unlimited talk
time unlimited messages but 300 megs of
data which it's it's so it's just laid
out in such stark relief how how crappy
the data situation is today yeah I would
have largely t-mobile's data up here as
well it's been making a big push to get
the the iphone users over to its network
and in this a pretty decent unlimited
deal compared to the rest of these guys
I think it's something like 70 or 80 a
month unlimited data as well as
everything else yeah yeah t-mobile is
really really really pushing on trying
to look competitive and they have to
they're they're hanging on to a you know
a distant fourth I think but they may be
are gonna be moving a little bit in the
right direction with the acquisition of
metropcs uh yeah that is that's like the
big news of the morning right um I we
were getting ready to podcast and I saw
this pop-up I mean this is a this is a
fresh fresh news t-mobile has announced
a t-mobile USA has announced that they
are going to acquire if the feds let
them regional provider metropcs here in
the states which metro pcs I don't know
about in your guys market but metro pcs
has been this really aggressively
aggressive company as far as marketing
goes there like check it out we've got
unlimited for cheaper than anybody else
we've got you know android phones
they're really drilling this whole like
we have you can get a smartphone with
unlimited data for way cheaper than
anybody else and it'll work where you
need it to work and I apparently they've
been doing well because they've they've
been huge they've even rolled out LTE
which for a tiny little regional carrier
is like wow that's cool you know and
voice over LTE already do they vote yeah
in their testing it in some markets Wow
and yeah and what sprint was it rumored
no it wasn't rumored I think
was trying to buy them and then what the
detox fell through a couple months ago
um is that physicans anyone confirm that
I don't remember that but that very well
could have been yeah I think I went cuz
I went into a metropcs store at the time
and I was like uh I shoot you away we
went shutting down and you know that
later I didn't want to I didn't want to
you know mention it I just went in with
that stigma of the guy who's walking
into the store and look at the people
being like I've been I've been in your
situation before dudes this merger stuff
is scary but then they didn't happen at
any rate well whether that's true or not
this is all contingent on government
approval and stuff like that I what was
your first and what was your first
thought about this guy's I'm mine was
that I was happy for t-mobile USA it's
good it's good to hear them talking
about getting back on their feet after
the whole 80 nonsense yeah i think it's
it's a great move I'm cautiously
optimistic I mean when we were talking
about AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile getting together
that sounded like the worst idea ever
yes I mean gets from monopolistic
monopolistic standpoint this I think
it's gonna be beneficial to their
subscribers it doesn't look like they're
going to shut down the existing cdma
network anytime soon a gradual
transition into what we've you know all
been hoping for this future where
everyone uses LTE you can jump between
networks I think this could be a great
starting off point for LTE roaming
especially oh god yet that would be
something else I had a house t-mobile's
LTE plants is still just you know 2013
or given specifics on first cities
together I haven't seen any specific I
haven't paid much attention because
t-mobile seems to be so invested in in
just talking about how ridiculously fast
they're HSPA network is and its true
like I see I have some t-mobile fans on
my feet and they're always kind of like
hey guys it's been a week so here's
another speed test showing that i'm
getting better speeds on HSPA then
you're getting on LTE really yeah
like what what are the speeds that
they're getting well again like
30-something in whatever and you know I
can hit that an LTE just fine but in
some markets that that have higher LTE
penetration I think what no actually no
even here like Verizon I when I do
review units for a verizon it so you're
like 15 down or 16 down usually it's you
know whatever and this this lack of LTE
on t-mobile is really harm them and it's
going to harm them even more over the
next six months because you know in the
case of Apple turning away from t-mobile
probably because you know they're not
gonna release a non LTE iphone and I
imagine that other carriers would we
feel the same way although it sounds
like lily I it's been it's been a while
since I tested the hspa+ on t-mobile and
when I tested it it wasn't that
impressive but it sounds like it sucks
it's living up to its promise yeah it
really does and you know it's I don't
think t-mobile has much in the way of
capacity issues to deal with I'm not
someone's on it right oh I'm not
speaking from any position of authority
at all but you know we all know the
tumor was the smallest player in the
state so speaking of network traffic I i
remember back to about two years ago CES
2010 when Verizon launched their their
LTE network and and the speeds that
people were getting were ridiculous at
the time they were like 20 25 down and
everyone was like oh you have a wait
till everyone gets on the network it's
gonna go down and okay so two years
later a lot of people not it's not
nearly as as used it as the 3g network
but you know I gotta say that you know
and and and Michael you could speak to
this with your is is you know LTE gonna
come crashing down right the the network
seems to be taking the taking the load
quite quite well and staying fast around
that 20 megabit per second it really is
and I'm very surprised I remember I had
a review unit that I stupidly this is a
lesson learned I stupidly did not do a
hard reset on first before I started
reviewing it so halfway through the
review I'm like why are my LTE speeds
like nine down this is ridiculous and I
don't know what software problem this
device was having but the minute i did a
hard reset in the middle of the review
period i was getting the speed i needed
to again and i was like oh wow i was all
set to dog verizon's network as like wow
it's already already you know
feeling the brunt of all these users
hopping on but no here in the in the
Greater Boston area both verizon and
AT&amp;amp;T are having just a wonder I have a
great time anytime I can get on their
LTE network which is very often because
I'm a Verizon customers so yeah it's
it's a little surprising to me and I'm
like knocking on wood right now I don't
want to ruin anything because they're Oh
knock on wood so nice Steven knock on
wood wait how do you good thank you we
want our LTE speeds to be as as a good
as possible because the future is now
although because we talked tucked in the
last podcast we're still you know
questioning what can be done with these
much faster speeds but I'm sure there
will be good good enough answers in the
future you I've got to wonder how much
of this the high speeds that we're
seeing now is a result of you know the
carriers smartly you're building up
their network adding the capacity and
how much is just users aren't pulling
down as much data as am I want to
because it's expensive because they're
afraid of hitting their caps right uh
that's a good a good question I I don't
think if anything I think people are
almost if by accident using their data
more I was because it because it's
faster it's faster like oh I'm gonna go
ahead and download that song and then
they get their belt thinner than nothing
like oh yeah I should have done that I'd
like to think of it as trying to fill a
water bottle with a fire hose yeah nice
that's a good analogy I was thinking
that's very same thing yesterday save
anything cuz i was sitting I was
standing in line at a shop or something
like that and I was kind of using maps
and for the idea just popped into my
head was like oh I wonder where I am on
my data allotment for the month because
i have by a ridiculous plan i've got
like six gigs a month and it's it's
great but you know i have to try to use
that up like i have to be tethering
every day and doing news posts with a
lot of images to like even get close to
using that or editorials with it sorry
not news post and but I'm still
concerned about it I can be at I could
be at 200 megabytes in you know 28 days
into the month and I'm still worried
about it because it's not unlimited by
virtue of the fact that it's not and at
you know Justin and on because it's a
finite resource and I hate that feeling
I absolutely hate it and I really miss
sprint
that regard because I used to be a
sprint customer it's that same anxiety
that you get when you're when you have
reason to believe that you're not gonna
make it through whatever wherever you
are whatever you're doing with battery
life yes yeah you could be at eighty
percent in the day only has two hours
left in it you're still like wow I
really wish I'd brought that spare
battery it's this weird anxiety thing
it's like anxiety in the cellular age
but I've got to say I'm surprised how
much users seem to be on top of these
concerns they're aware of these caps and
they're like either they're checking to
see where they are and their data usage
there was some study that I posted about
last week that showed a breakdown by age
group of how users consume cellular data
and then Wi-Fi and everyone is using
Wi-Fi to a significant amount beyond
what they're using on cellular I would
have thought that you know your average
Joe smartphone user might not be so
savvy as to be hopping onto Wi-Fi
whenever possible but it seems like
people are taking care to stay off the
network when they don't need to be done
all it true law it takes is uh is one
overage and then you're like how can I
stop this oh I have Wi-Fi at home and I
don't even have a Wi-Fi turned on maybe
I should you know connect that well
that's that's true but also i mean
there's um there's also that thing that
we were complaining about before with
this really really aggressive Wi-Fi
software that companies are building it
i wrote a piece called Wi-Fi auto on
must be stopped a couple weeks ago
because it is absurd i don't know if you
guys have noticed this on your own
devices or whatever but the galaxy s3
with the verizon software build on it
will not allow you to do anything like
you can't turn off Wi-Fi notifications
the device will periodically wake up no
matter what you do look to see if
there's a Wi-Fi network and if there is
it will ask you if you want to connect
to it i mean that its aggressive to the
point of overreaching and it's very very
annoying it's not cool that's not cool
it's it and there was a story today and
this on the flip side about it was this
huge Steven talking about the iphone how
how it is the iphone is rumored not to
be hopping onto Wi-Fi networks properly
yeah they released a patch for verizon
but supposedly it's happening all over
the place which yeah with the iphone it
says it's on Wi-Fi but it's actually
using cellular data set the story and
i'm not clear if it's that it's jumping
over to the center network when it
shouldn't be or that it's improperly
tallying megabytes you're pulling down
over Wi-Fi as cellular but the point is
that users are being charged for data
when they shouldn't be wow you know it's
there's gonna be an update to iOS
experiencing there are more problems
with it than I think any previous update
and it's funny you mention this issue of
that when the device should be using
Wi-Fi using cellular because what I've
noticed is that when I take my iphone 5
out of standby I can catch it on LTE win
a second later when I'm stolen
lockscreen oh go to Wi-Fi wears on the
4s I took it out of standby and I saw
the Wi-Fi bars right away really so it's
almost like it's fault it like it when
it sleeps it's falling back to cellular
which would that's interesting I feel
like that's you feel like I've
encountered that situation before where
devices I don't remember which ones
running web platform but like they'll
wake up it'll wake them up and it's like
oh wow so when you're in sleep you turn
off Wi-Fi and now you have to find the
Wi-Fi network again that's weird yeah
not cool no not dance is not acceptable
I don't like that except I don't like um
what's uh we ventured into misc
territory there for a second let's let's
hop on back and talk talk android a
little bit we had some weight of
significant device announcement a couple
days ago with HTC announcing the one x+
which is uh which is cool I wish they
had done this like a week ago so I could
have mentioned this in my in my piece on
how mid-range phones are sometimes
cooler because HTC also announced the
HTC One V X which reminds me of the
poison gas in though this is what I was
saying to brand name for you don't you
watch the rock man how many know what
the exes come on man again yeah I'm just
having visions of people getting you
know greenpoison marbles put in their
mouth punched in the face yeah the HTC
VX is the mid-range option of the two
and I think it looks way better than the
the One X plus the one x+ not the 1x
what's what's the story on there we were
you guys like disappointed by these
heartened I mean that this is it looks
to me like an iterative upgrade on the
One X and not much else for the higher
end one the this sort of disappointing
moment came when I was reading the press
release and they are like you know it's
got a better processor higher clocking
like good good better battery good good
more milliamp hours that's always good
and we've upgraded the front-facing
camera to use the image sense chip and
and like I found my my palm and I
pressed it against my face and I felt on
my selfie what are they going to get the
message that people do not think that
the One X has an amazing camera they
think it has an okay camera and and what
are they gonna change the slogan from
you know amazing camera authentic sound
too well is Emma green is something else
I wonder about this Turkish we always
complain about this right we I mean to
be even more precise you and everyone
else complains about this but me I don't
understand it look I don't understand it
yeah I don't think the one axis camera
was that bad in my in my testing I have
to go back and read my review I mean I
didn't say it's bad like it it's it's
not as good as the marking material will
lead you to bleed open and compared to
the galaxy s3 it's absolutely interior
where the excellence I that's absolutely
inferior isn't that the whole point of
marketing to hide something up to make
it sound better than it might actually
be in case a big important component of
marketing is not just to get people to
buy your product based on that claim
it's to reinforce its to do that what is
that that foul is that logical fallacy
that oh god it's it's that after the
fact reinforcement is that that when you
buy a product and you want to defend it
it's what leads to fanboyism it's what
needs two jerks I hate but it at any
point it's it's it's like yes we're HTC
you've bought our product now watch
commercials about the product you
already own and how awesome the camera
is so you know it's this kind of
reinforcing this perception that led you
to buy the phone the first place where
I'm imagine that there are thousands and
thousands of HTC One X owners out there
being like showing their friends and me
like could check out this amazing camera
and then the you know because they're
their friend is saying it the friend is
like oh yeah no totally that's a great
picture and I think we mentioned last
week that
it's the screen that makes the images
look so much better on the phone right
it doesn't have a green space a
beautiful screen today are they bonding
the screen on the one x+ as well is it I
don't think they're changing the screen
tager for the one x+ yeah which is a
good thing because I think I in my
unscientific tests I think the one x + 1
x plus does the best screen of any
mobile device even better than the
iphone 5 yeah that 1i self screen was
was amazing i agree oschous there's been
a lot of backlash recently about the the
iphone 5 screen quality at first
everyone was talking about how great it
was but now these studies saying the
galaxy s3 has such a better screen you
guys are saying the the one ex I mean
did Apple this is another thing they not
to get back into iPhone territory now
but maybe that's another failure there
that that Apple you know post steve jobs
that we wouldn't have expected a year
ago what are they saying the galaxy s3
has a better screen than the thighs I
didn't look into the details of it but
I'm assuming resolution color saturation
gamut all the technical stuff its
resolution yes color saturation um well
you're always gonna get slightly better
on a an amyloid and damn it I have no
idea what that means I'm glad you said
it I didn't want to fess up I was guy
was just so feeling oh yeah gamut I know
it yeah totally man got to got the gamut
matter and when I run the gamut it's
it's intense yes yeah yeah you run the
gauntlet not the ganic hey man you do
what you want down there in Philadelphia
up here in Boston we run the gamut I
don't know what that means I I I don't
know I I haven't compared the two I mean
the iphone 5 you know I would like to
see it next to a galaxy s 3 i'd like to
see it next to a 1x and not through a
computer monitor right but there's
fortunately speaking of displays
speaking of large displays for some
reason speaking of clumsy segways the
galaxy note 2 might be shipping with
incomplete software we this was your pee
stephen about possibly the device
containing missing features yeah there
was some forum
from users who hadn't got early hands on
a galaxy note 2 when they say that this
this multi window split screen feature
that Samsung at hype tins and videos
just isn't there there's no mention of
it and the manual nothing which is
interesting and it's not the first time
we've seen this I saw this on the HTC
One launch actually when the 1x came to
the to AT&amp;amp;T it didn't incorporate 60
frames per second video shooting which
had been demo'd to me at the you know at
the event so I was like where is this I
hate it when this happens and then
manufacturers kind of just could sweep
it under the rug I'll be out with what
did they say it'll be out with an update
or have they not haven't heard any
statement yet that's the assumption that
it'll come out you know the next OTA
update to go out but no statement yet
mmm which is a shame because you want to
be able to use that giant display with
like an innovative multitasking feature
which I think I called out and our first
episode of worst ever with the the
kyocera echo and that's like it's like
let's guess what i was thinking of when
i heard about this like who cares about
this it didn't work so well on the echo
but i'm assuming that samsung has its
act together a little better it's yeah
it works actually really well a couple
of examples you know they have this this
note tap or you can take a note and it
can follow you around the operating
system like the pop up video and then
they have pop-up web which i think is
probably the most useful so that if
there's a part of a web page you want to
keep an eye on or if there's some
information on a web page and you want
to go into email you can keep it hovered
on the on the above the apps oh really
yeah I think I think they you know did
some cool stuff unfortunately it's only
limited to like five or three or four I
forget what the numbers applications
it'd be cool if they let developers tap
into it but as we've learned from
history when when an oem comes out with
some sort of new API to tap into a new
feature developers are like I'm just
gonna keep developing my android app you
know yes it's a trend toward you know
it's that the trend toward like favoring
what is most popular and kind of looking
at new and it's like oh yeah that's cool
but it's going to take a lot of work and
i'm not sure the return on my investment
of time is going to be worth it so devs
don't really go for it is is a feature
that's going to be on every samsung
phone what's the point right exactly and
and and they and they don't they don't
do it like that they do it like you know
it'll be specific to this device and by
the time the sales numbers are in it's
too late for the developer to start the
you know two three four month process it
takes to create a piece of software to
plug into the API right so we dug
manufacturers for not doing new and
innovative suffer i do because i always
like to see bold moves but it's it's
it's a shame when when you know that all
the blame can't be late on their
shoulders this is just some of this
market dynamics and it's really nobody's
fault it's just what happens but I that
that floating web thing I still can't
get past that i didn't know i didn't see
that on the galaxy note 2 we played with
that Eva and I would love love love to
play with that because that sounds great
just the page with the floating web page
does that auto refresh I don't remember
tom is it like live or is it like a
screenshot of the web page i wonder i
wanted to yeah left i have to figure
that out um it sounds like Samsung
doesn't even know yeah like what should
we do a little ship it later yeah maybe
it'll just forget about it yeah yeah
could well be and then leaving everyone
to just talk about you know the S Pen
for four weeks in more weeks um I'm
looking forward to getting to to playing
a little bit with the with that that
should be happening very soon um the
speaking of software updates just to
touch on this real quick hey guys
breaking news a manufacturer has
backtracked on its ICS update promises
no yeah can you believe it say it ain't
so yeah yeah and furthermore um it's a
motorola of all people can you imagine I
can't even insights this is this is hot
hot news yeah motorola previously had
announced plans to upgrade specifically
I think we're talking the Atrix 4G the
second iteration of their of there a
trick slender kind of fallen atrix line
yeah along with the the photon I believe
yes and the photon 4g yeah and is not
happening now weird only in the sense i
think from my perspective weird in that
it's motorola who we previously would
have expected this from but who under
the google umbrella it's weird to see
them
making the same kind of not necessarily
boneheaded moves because I don't feel
like atrix owners are the ones who are
going to be all up in arms about this
necessarily but it's not it's not
friendly it's just the same old the
Android OEM complaints that I didn't
expect Motorola to continue doing once
google had their you know hands all on
him I don't know yeah Motorola's seemed
like it really turned a page now that
it's under the the new ownership I
forget exactly who it was but there was
some exact being remarkably candid on
Google+ a little while back about these
missed updates you know apologizing
saying this isn't what you users deserve
we want to do better and then to hear
this news it just seems like it's two
different companies isn't that weird
yeah like sometimes an exact quote will
go be very candid like that and you get
this glimmer of hope like wow maybe this
corporation will actually is it gets it
like somebody inside gets it and then
something happens like the bureaucracy
of the corporation takes over or there's
a money concern or there's there
something that just prevents it from
prevents this enlightened viewpoint from
taking hold right that's that's
depressing let's move on to something
happier okay all right good yeah I've
got one will multiple Nexus phones ruin
the Nexus brand that's happier right
depending on if your Apple or not yes
this is a piece from our from our live
tweeter extraordinaire and also the
android guy Joe Levi from yesterday the
day before yesterday talking about the
possibilities of you know what might
happen if multiple Nexus devices were
released which is kind of this
possibility that's been floating around
from multiple carriers we're hearing
rumors over and over that Google is
going to announce several Nexus devices
at once and we're talking smartphones
here I think primarily but personally
this is what this has concerned me this
is something i think would very
seriously dilute the nexus brand as just
like samsung is doing with the galaxy
brand name which is i think which is
completely watering it down by releasing
all sorts of products with the galaxy
prefix
try wrote about in another piece um what
do you guys think I don't ever want to
see I want to see one nexus phone at a
time just like we're doing now i want to
say we've gone nexus one nexus s galaxy
nexus you know i want to keep seeing
that I don't want a Nexus device family
as far as the smartphones go like oh if
there any with if they're all good and
as solid as every Nexus has been I'm all
for it that I like more choice but if
you know if we have a nexus family and
like two of them are like the ugly kids
that no one wants and then it dilutes
the Bennett dilutes the brand and it's
you know Google loses the prestige
behind a nexus it this would be a big
step i think but it's not entirely
unheralded if you look at how things
have been going with Nexus devices
especially when we start getting these
you know separate former releases for
the cdma version of the galaxy nexus
it's already started sort of breaking up
into you know multiple paths for
different users are getting different
experiences this is just the next
logical step maybe it'd be well it might
be the next step I don't know if it's
the next logical step well yeah i agree
i mean when we see manufacturers doing
this like why pick on samsung right
picked on samsung my piece but we've got
HTC doing with the one where the one x
is you know comparatively awesome and I
think the one what was that the one v
that that really isn't very good yeah
that's not even getting an ice cream
sandwich is it it was a jellybean the
not upgrading you probably not yeah I
mean yeah yeah and I mean you know if
you want to talk about LG with their
Optimus stuff motorola with the motorola
with the atrix I mean the atrix family
has just been this kind of downward
slope of a non impressiveness hey
Michael yeah what's a little game um
it's not it's not like that I don't like
that tone of voice can be pretty good
got to get worried it's alright it's not
it's only gonna be a one-sided game
meaning you're the only one
participating awesome one of them's what
I like to do is I like to get out my
timer and what I liked for you to do is
name all of the galaxy devices you can
in 30 seconds and if you get more than
15 of them you get a pat on the back
and that's it if I get more than 50 for
repeats no penalty for EP yeah all right
so stretch your legs you know do what
you gotta do and that all right I'm not
getting feet I was gonna cheat and then
now I'm not gonna cheat no cheating
right so this is 30 seconds Michael
Fisher knowing the galaxy brand and how
how far-reaching it has become in three
two one go all right galaxy tab Galaxy
Tab 7.7 galaxy tab 10.1 galaxy note
galaxy note 2 galaxy note 10.1 galaxy s
galaxy s2 galaxy s3 galaxy nexusgalaxy
nexus LTE galaxy ace galaxy Oh a galaxy
camera which is cool big galaxy oh oh
there's a stupid one for like US
cellular GALEX like eccentric or galaxy
exhilarate I'm sure one of those is
right galaxy yeah it did I hit 15 you
hit 14 that wasn't 30 seconds alright
well that was past 30 seconds 30 point
three seconds and I didn't say what
happens if you don't get them you get
10,000 lashings ah I've always wanted to
commit and hence my lashing collection
um wow that didn't even get to like the
dual-sim versions and everything right
yeah I knew there was other weird
through her other weird low and ones
that I'm sorry that I didn't get to like
galaxies render or whatever that stupid
one was wise pretty that's pretty good
though so it was impressive thank you
thank you isn't it crazy though I mean
you know it's it's it's nuts to see
companies doing this I thought the
galaxy brand was so cool when it first
came out it's like the up wait you guys
are calling this the galaxy tab and when
I got my hands on the galaxy tab at
first the first one you know the first
legit iPad competitor from a big
manufacturer I was like you know you
guys are calling this something cool the
Cullens the samsung galaxy tab and while
tab was Lois Lane but galaxy whatever
maybe i'm just a nerd about galaxy um I
wasn't that galaxy thing because I
remember when I first heard about the
Samsung Galaxy or was the first one was
galaxy s ii OC
yeah yeah cuz no chairs predated all the
restaurants yeah yeah and I'm thinking
like okay I'm thinking of galaxies which
is a a collection of stars and planets
yeah and I never ever used the word in
my day to day um it means nothing to me
I don't understand I don't understand it
I think that like I mean first of all
any word with an X in it is it's kind of
automatically sort of cool and that in
that sort of geeky way you haven't X
next to a y as well there's very rare
and it's a very fun word to kind of say
like feel around in your mouth and
galaxy you know and also if you watched
a lot of Star Trek The Next Generation
you know that the enterprise is a
galaxy-class starship and I think that
that definitely was this number one
consideration Samsung entered into when
naming their new product well we won't
we won't role play vie de Genesis brand
thing maybe next letting us off the hook
there speaking of product names with X's
to close out the Android category rumor
has it the next Nexus phone may launch
in in 30 days I don't really buy it it's
just an interesting thing to touch on we
you know we're very due to see the next
Nexus device whether it'll be at a
family of three or five or just another
single device it's going to be coming
because the time is coming up for it um
I don't know if I am terribly excited
about it considering all the other
exciting stuff that has been announced
in the past few weeks I think Google was
gonna have to really really bring the
heat to to make it an impressive
announcement what do you guys think part
of me thinks that they're not going to
bring the heat and they're just going to
fix the Galaxy Nexus and what I mean by
that is the cameras gonna go to eight
megapixels is gonna be quad-core and
maybe a couple of other things and I
think that would be enough to sustain it
for another year because the Galaxy
Nexus view by today it's a great phone
it's a faster own it looks nice it looks
different than anything else out there
and and you know Google would I think
served the world well by just doing an
iterative iterative update however that
will not
get that much attention no it won't
cause a huge burst in sales and they'll
have to do something more dramatic but
I'm just saying I want to be too
disappointed if they just did it I think
it would get plenty of attention I think
it would get plenty of negative
attention I could do the headlines now
like did google just release their own
iphone 4s you know you know for weeks
and weeks like it's like what's wrong
with google you know yeah I'm curious if
they're gonna actually come through with
a whole new version of Android likes
been like has been rumored I mean I know
it's is the thing to do but it just
seems like you know jelly bean barely
got here right and that also you know
I'm wondering what would they possibly
do to make it a significant improvement
over jellybeans are we finally going to
see that the multi user experience
that's been the framework is there is
that finally going to be front and
center ah i have seen actually in the
comments 2 after the buzz for the nexus
7 I think more than one person mentioned
like I love this tablet the only thing
that I wish I could do is have multiple
user accounts because you know people
are using their at starting to use their
android tablets as like family devices
you know and I think that's gonna be
this is gonna be an oddly big news bit
when that launches I think for a lot of
people I don't think it's going to be
there's going to be frenzy about it but
I think a lot of people are going to be
happy when they can set up multiple user
accounts on their tablet I don't know if
you see that saw the video but I think
like a month ago I did a video on a 1x
rock called domination or something that
that you know tapped into this jelly
bean feature that users can access Multi
multi user support so I think that I
haven't checked nexus 7 forums lately
but i'm pretty sure that they're going
to be roms that use this this guest
functionality so i think it's it is
possible today and it actually worked
quite well it's it's really neat did you
guys see the video i should have seen
the video and i did and i'm sorry miss
that one I can describe it it's it's
awesome because you create a new user
account and you specify which apps that
person sees and when you log out of your
account and go into that person's
account if they go into any application
calendar photos mail it's all like stuck
like you just hard reset your device so
they can set all
their own stuff almost as if it's
creating a new partition on the device
and and then when you and when they
interestingly when you go into settings
under this new account there are like
five settings like you can only turn on
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and that's it the
only way to obviously get get all of the
settings and do all the tweaking is to
go back to the primary user account
which you can then password protect or
put on face on lock or what have you but
it works really well it's pretty smart
that's really awesome i mean it's it's a
logical evolution of you know we're
using mobile technology more and more
for stuff that desktops used to handle
and it just makes sense that that mobile
OS is should it start incorporating this
feature the big the big downside of
course and i forget who wrote an
editorial about this i think it was Joe
with multiple user support you
tremendously distance I'm not gonna use
that word I haven't found with the word
something I disincentivize yes
disincentivize people from buying
multiple devices good if you look at a
typical family right now you know little
Betsy as a tablet you know Timmy as an
ipod touch mommy has an ipad 3 and if
they had multiple user support these you
know father would say wait a sec we're
gonna get the ipad 3 you're all gonna
have your own account where to use it
one at a time you're gonna go to your
room yeah your broadly yeah they
wouldn't they wouldn't buy all these
extra devices if they could do multiple
user accounts so it's really uh that's
probably why we haven't seen it yet yeah
that that is an interesting thing that I
hadn't considered you might be right i
mean you know notwithstanding the power
of kids to always be like no I don't
want to share because I get that impulse
completely for fun this is when those
thoughts it's very cynical but now that
I'm thinking about it it makes a whole
lot of sense yeah Wow well I will we'll
see i guess i guess and hopefully will
see very soon because like you say it's
built into jelly bean it's just not that
the switch isn't flipped right in this
in a stock configuration is that right
that's right yeah i think is that
there's no i mean the the framework for
the aliasing directories storing
individual app ticket is all there but
there's no UI to actually change users
to switch between them yeah well we will
keep an eye on that situation i want to
kind of hop on over to Windows Phone
here which I was looking I didn't know
about this nokia has
has dropped some new Lumia 920 ads or at
least one um if you guys seen this yes
yeah the one where the there it's kind
of nineteen eighty four ish where were
ya got these people walking and walking
is done of a drum and in the background
it's like there's a like a picture of a
4s and then it's an arrow to a five that
looks exactly the same run they get to
the end of the line and then they put
down hundreds and hundreds of dollars
and then the guy behind the counter
gives them a black or white phone and
then the guy that receives a phone says
hey he's sort of implies could I have
one in color and then the guy behind the
counter freaks out gets extremely mad
and then two seconds later some cool
people with Lumia 920's or or a 20s are
walking by with their like green blue
and the rainbow colored folks yeah they
brighten up this dystopian dark
landscape with their bright colors and
then they end the commercial ends and
it's like Lumia 920 but the guy doesn't
the guy who's buying the phone that the
customer who hands over the pile of
money and gets his it gets his 5 which
is just a phone that says five on it
which is very subtle nokia the doesn't
imply that maybe he'd like color what
actually happens in the commercial in
this one minute bizarro bizarro piece is
that he goes color like in this
creepiest voice you've ever heard and
then the whole commercial just kind of
explodes into this audio frenzy of
terrifying proportion this is the most
frightening mobile phone commercial I
had you ever seen very Halloweeny it
freaked me out i just watched it a
couple but like an hour before the
podcast i was like what is what is and
then i was like what is that what what
market is this for and i think this is
for the German market which I understand
now because I was freaked out by several
advertisements in Berlin and I was like
always they hold on oh I mean I'm in
Germany I've there's this like big
cultural shift right but I don't I I do
not understand what it Jaime Rivera is
the one who wrote this piece about this
ad and he's he made the point like you
know these have never worked like when
Apple did it and did their 1984 ad
directed by ridley scott like they
remained you know in last place as far
as what they were trying to sell at the
time
like I may have been a groundbreaking ad
but I don't think it had much of it much
of an effect and it of course didn't
work for the zoom because the zoom kind
of the motorola xoom kind of isn't a
very good product i don't think i think
the Lumia 920 is one but I don't think
this commercial is gonna do anything but
freak out people who watch it and it
doesn't really it doesn't really appeal
to people because I don't think anyone's
having this conversation I don't think
people that are thinking about the
iphone 5 or I've gotten the iphone 5 sit
there depressingly thinking I wish my
phone was yellow but I think my
personnel no one no one says that it
would be nice to have color choices
absolutely but that's not a headline
thing agreed you know your non apple
fans talk about oh they're just going
with the flow their sheep they're just
doing everyone else wants to the Apple
people buying the iphones they're not
feeling that there that they have to get
the iphone because everyone else is they
want this they like us they're right
they're not the ones asking color yeah
really i wish i wish i had that the
timestamp Kudo because i really want to
play that on the pine wood color um it's
a agree i think this is a problem you
know a solution in search of a problem
here i love color as well i think it's a
really good eye catching thing it makes
for awesome videos when you're a company
that makes multicolored phones like HTC
and you can jump a whole bunch of phones
in the same shot and flip around
gleefully and right yeah and actually i
think that's when these phones are most
impressive to be honest when there are
many Lumias and in a single shot or
there are many HTC windows phones in a
single shot and it's like wow that
really does look like a mixed like a
like a bag of a brightly colored candy
that appeals exactly yeah it appeals to
that three-year-old inside me that's
like oh I like this is various like it's
like it's like candy exactly and then
you pick one of them to take home and
you're like oh man this blue is awesome
but I'm a little tired of it you know
and thatthat's why you buy changeable
covers and that's all another
conversation I don't know it the ad
freaked me out i wanted to mention it
but hey look it's got us talking and
it's been sent around the internet
probably a million times by now and even
if it never makes it to TV which i don't
think it well maybe in germany it's a
minute long which is double the length
of the normal commercial um uh yeah
i don't know i don't i think i think
it's made it mates meet it as far as
nokia has intended maybe you guys have
intrigued me i am watching this thing
first thing we are done now just don't
you know you raise the shades man don't
watch it in the dark and i'm sure you
have your blanky absolutely is freaky
nokia is actually doing something
somewhat cooler maybe this is not
confirmed for markets outside of Italy I
guess Steven you wrote the story about
how Nokia maybe maybe denying carrier
badging on the Lumia phones right this
if this is true this would be cool i
think the rumor is that they will that
no kids in talks with carriers who are
going to carry the Lumia line to
disallow carrier you know silk screening
of the carrier logo on anywhere on the
device that would be amazing because am
i right in saying that no company has
managed to do this besides apple good in
the US i think of any i can't either
yeah you're right you're right there's
always a can't let me be as far as apple
because supposedly there still will be a
little carrier customization on the
software side of things sure they can
have some apps on there but i mean it's
a huge step forward having this standard
manufacturer logo only external design
ya know it's you know it's terrible um
so so it's a it's frustrating an
annoying when you see the carrier logo
on your phone because it just takes away
from the aesthetic a little bit but
there have been some cases in the past
where carriers go above and beyond to
make sure your phone becomes an
advertisement I'm holding the AT&amp;amp;T tilts
to in my hand when you extend the
keyboard you get a second nice big shiny
metallic AT&amp;amp;T logo that faces people
when you're typing on the keyboard it's
gross yeah I remember when when on the
flip phone days when carriers like
Verizon started customizing the external
LCD which used to just be blood a blank
when the phone was open because it was
useless but carriers would start putting
in their own stupid logo strings in
there so you had this like four line LCD
but monochrome LCD and when you opened
the phone it would invert and it would
show verizon wireless and it's like I
remember
oh you'd hold up to your ear and you'd
be like oh that's definitely a verizon
phone yeah I go to the store and buy one
now thanks for the advertisement yeah
right exactly i I can't stand that
they're actually and and this is a kind
of a thread type that has maintained
itself through at least 10 years I
remember seeing these back in 2003 2002
when people would come on forums and
they're like a new user and they're like
hey guys I'm just kind of a regular guy
i'm not a phone nerd but i really want
to get this carrier logo off my phone
and you know it's it's sprung this
little if there's always somebody is
helpfully able to say like oh yeah just
use some nail polish remover some
acetone and that'll come right off
because it's just silkscreen down there
um but there are just normal people who
are not not necessarily phone geeks who
are like yeah I don't I don't like the
logo on there I I don't it's not in the
contract that I ever said I would
advertise for AT&amp;amp;T you know and I get
that I think that's so III think it
would be really cool if Nokia we're able
to pull this off I think the US carriers
will fight this tooth and nail
particularly verizon IX IC IC big
carriers like verizon AT&amp;amp;T being able to
throw their weight around a little bit
and be like no you guys are on the least
popular platform you know of the big
three you were gonna do what we want to
your phone and you're gonna like it
you're gonna honor it mmm but I mean you
know maybe sprint Sprint's usually
interested in doing something different
and maybe t mobile metropcs will will
play ball but i don't know we'll see
what happens the is if we did this very
briefly the speaking of Windows Phones
the HTC windows phone 8x front-facing
camera god oh my god oh posted on the
internet which is awesome wait a sec
what wait a sec it was a great picture
but like if I want to do I could take
the camera of my of my treo 700w and I
could spend all day getting the lighting
just right and it looks like a picture
there's taken spur of the moment but I
can get lucky with my treo 700w I don't
think we should we should consider this
to be an indication of how incredibly
amazing the camera is the front-facing
camera there
think it's a step in the right direction
but I I'm taking that picture with a
grain of salt or what if all the pics
end up looking as good as that one then
that's all changed your to us okay yes
of course yeah well here's the thing
though I mean hey okay so this is a shot
of three I think HTC execs in front of
the David Letterman theater in New York
the CBS Late Late Show theater there's
it does look it looks like I'm not ready
to say this has been a manipulated photo
I'm not gonna that's not i'm not
interested in throwing accusations
around but it is almost perfect from a
photo standpoint like you've got to one
guy in the foreground one guy in the mid
grant one guy in the background like it
presents this amazing depth of field
that that lets you see you know what the
camera is capable of from a focused
perspective the color is amazing the mid
the mid-tones are great this looks like
a shot that was that was like
instagrammed in the right way it is that
such a thing what instagramming
something to make it better ouch I was
you know I don't think I've had quite
enough of you guys beating up on my
favorite little app I i took i gotta say
i took a really good picture with the
iphone 5 and i sent it around to michael
and Jaime and Michael wrote back you
should totally Instagram this picture
and I'm like why don't I just rub grease
on the lens and retake the picture and
make it worse you and you missed the
point I know share with people you I
know I put off it I should have put on
facebook that would be the extent of my
sharing mm-hmm wait what you should put
on phase it is a beautiful picture
anyway so is this this is a beautiful
picture from a front-facing camera I
think it's newsworthy I think it does
Jaime's headliners HTC windows phone 8x
front-facing camera sample amazes which
normally fi I see headlines like that
know Malika knows a little hyperbolic
and then I open it up though and I'm
like no that's entirely right that's
exactly the headliner would have written
because it does it's for a front-facing
camera that's awesome and if that's real
if that's untwist them that's impressive
I think I clicked on that expecting that
to be the leader image and then to have
the actual the front-facing pic buried a
little farther down yeah that's the
front facer yes agreed yeah yeah fun
fact that fellow in the middle Jason
dunnan's the
the guy that started a pocket pc
thoughts which back in the early days
when it was dark and there was an
electricity and only pocket pc devices
it was it was packing house competitor
in the very early days it was just
really pocket pc locks in pocket net now
and covering pocket pc devices and now
things have changed quite a bit so I and
now we worked for HTC is that correct uh
yeah now he works for HTC that's cool
mmm finally in the in the Windows Phone
space the last bit of news from there is
that this ZTE orbit which we'd heard
about which I think Tony and Orihime I
got their hands on at mwc in Barcelona
is landing on US cellular another
smaller carrier here in the US as the
ZTE as the ZTE render yet again a really
awful verb name for a phone but let's
not talk about that we'll just talk
about the device hey Michael what what's
we're ripping on cell phone names lot
what do you think is a good example of a
really good phone name it and and and
stephen youtube I think I and this is it
skits skirting the edge of like rule of
cool and like a little too cool but I
think Galaxy Nexus is one of my favorite
phone names ever it because it evokes
the you have the nexus branding the
backing you know it's like this is a
pure Google device and Nexus is a cool
word with an X in it and a galaxy of
course as we discussed earlier is is is
cool for its own reasons and I think I
think that's a very very cool phone name
I don't think things like you know
samsung fascinate or captivate or render
for the love of you know no I don't
think that these are very good info
names so that's y a Galaxy Nexus to be
my vote I'm not used to it I think about
phone names a lot like I get about car
names in that I I think my favorite
manufacturer as far as naming its cars
go as BMW because you have these numbers
that make a lot of sense you know you
know three series cars are going to be
similar to each other 328is
going to be like the 318 so I think
Nokia is doing a great job instead of
adapting that / phones they're not
sticking to the series as well as I
would have hoped like it's not clear
based on the numbering how similar the
phones are to each other but just if
they you know thought it out and started
releasing them you know in these groups
where we know okay we had the 800 last
year 820 is going to be a little bit
better I think that's the way to do it I
hate these fascinating renders as much
as you Michael what about you branded a
you are you all about like phones like
the like the Galaxy aspire or you know
it's stuff like that yeah they they're
very motivational I really enjoyed the
2000s when HTC would have really cool
code names they never released like the
HTC rhodium that's awesome or that's a
cool name or the HTC Titan tytn or you
tease Power Man like all right let me go
back to rhodium bad so i'd say i'd say
rhodium listen sort of what else that
they had like they had the HTC universal
the Wallaby the mommy that's a pretty
good oh my god yeah hilarious I like
when code names get weird like the I
think it was the the successor to the
palm pre three was good at was codenamed
the Windsor not just like wow all right
you guys are really going crazy um yeah
I I like I tend to favor phone names
that that are more abstract like I think
Lumia is a very good brand name because
it it may have an actual definition but
nobody really uses the actual definition
yeah I like Luke that's good Lumia also
i used a um when I was doing voiceovers
more often i used a voiceover script for
an audition for a shampoo product called
Garnier Lumia Garnier Lumia make sure
and wash your hair regularly or whatever
the hell the copy was and there's like
six months later that Nokia Lumia lo que
NOS the Lumia line is like oh hey
shampoo phones sure same ballpark the
same thing right anyway yeah I'm very
excited about this device I'm not
excited about this device but I think
it's cool it's noteworthy because is
this the first ZTE windows phone can you
guys let me know I don't know if I'm
right on that down it I don't I think it
had one before is it at seven months
unveiling the phone in the US senators
windows phone line up um II I don't know
if it is the first one it might be the
first one in this to land in the states
I think it might be yeah um I it's just
exciting to see windows phone to see
another manufacturer into the space of
Windows I'm sure it's not i'm not sure
Tanya sorry here no no that's okay the
ZTE Tanya of course are we really this
is what we're doing now Tanya AB you
worry you know what does tanya mean it's
the name of a lady person yeah that's
what we need more phones with people's
names it can see Lucille yeah samsung
hall yeah yeah that would actually be a
great way to sort of bring up what if
but the problem is names are very
sensitive so if you do you recently
broke up with a you know a cake and you
know the HTC cake came out you would not
buy that phone no matter how cool it was
it's entirely true if she broke your
heart the phone's gonna break your heart
it's just exactly this identity HTC
Catherine is the classier upgrade it's
got a better camera right wow wow this
is a solid idea we got to start buying
these domain names right now what I
would just to to hop on our one
remaining miscellaneous topic before we
go we have HTC if no no that's not true
HP hewlett-packard as delivered on a
promise to the webos community which is
awesome HP when wants it torpedoed the
webos ecosystem and everything it
finally collected itself enough and meg
whitman kind of organized a bunch of
teams internally to be like what are we
going to do with this what are we going
to do with webos because we're not going
to do what we used to do with it and
they announced that they were going to
open source it and that was a kind of a
big surprise to everybody every was like
well okay we'll will believe it when we
see at HP or not everybody said that i
think most of us who've been following
web OS news were like all right
whatever when you deliver will you know
believe you and then they did they said
before September ended and just last
Friday agent 99 yet at what like in the
middle yeah 59 yeah oh yeah I mean it
was very it was definitely the last day
of the work week um you know the last
Friday of the month and HP announces you
know webos open webOS Wando which they
demoed webos chief architect Oh what is
what is his name Steve Winston demoed it
running on an HP TouchSmart PC it was in
a desktop environment I think it was
running emulated in a you know in an
emulator of some kind and you know
that's it's cool the news is confusing
because it's not it's not ready for
mobile devices it's not going to run on
the existing web OS hardware if you
still have a pretty three kicking around
or a touchpad that's what the webos
Community Edition is for but it was good
someone got it on the Galaxy Nexus right
yeah and it was almost immediately and
that people have been working on this
for a couple weeks so it's a little
deceptive it didn't just happen
overnight but the the people who've had
kind of early access to some of the
build elements I guess managed to port a
very very like a pre-alpha version of
open webOS to the Galaxy Nexus and to
the Asus Transformer Prime I believe
which is very exciting and there's no
hardware acceleration of anything so if
you watch the video of web open webOS on
the Galaxy Nexus like you try and swipe
from one home screen to another and that
swype action takes something like 15
seconds to complete you can watch each
frame go by yeah so it's it's and I'm
it's not even exaggeration I mean it
really takes that long so it's it is not
even close to an alpha build and there
are some driver complications and stuff
and whatever but it's it's news because
HP did deliver it it's out there the
community can now work on the the
massive pile of work it's going to take
to get to get the the software the
platform running on new hardware and
that's if that's exciting as anything
there's a lot missing though there's you
know there's a lot of stuff that were
that that relied on the palm back end
and the HP back end like the synergy
services that that came out with webos
fur
and that you know is that that webos
pioneered that everyone else kind of
stole over the course of the several
years all that stuff is not supported
like there's no official facebook app I
think there's a new browser there's a
whole buncha stuff that's missing let me
ask the obvious question here yeah let's
say they get the open webOS project
flourishes and developers and
professionals make it work very well hmm
on let's say a nexus galaxy nexus and we
get it on a nexus 7 and it works on a
lot of cool devices hmm then what so
you're gonna go to the App Store and
there aren't gonna be many apps and none
of them have been updated recently and
you're like food well um there really
are no new apps and well the interface
is cool but it's got none of the cool
features that iOS and Android has now
I'm just gonna go back to Android why
would you want well where's this going I
guess is what's the end game you see I'm
Kenya and I think from HTC's perspective
the end game is really oh god I keep
doing that I'm sorry from hp's
perspective the end game was kind of
evident if you watch the video of the
product demo of open webOS where where
Winston is like I think about he says he
says like think about a hotel what do
you want you want your guests to be able
to make reservations and print
directions they want to do it via a
simple and intuitive user interface like
this is what HP is going to do is they
want to make it like a kiosk operating
system and this is what they were
planning on doing it alongside their
smartphone and tablet stuff when they
were all in on webos and they were like
we're gonna do smartphones tablets
printers toasters whatever we're going
to do all this stuff and instead now
they're you know instead of the
glamorous fun exciting consumer space I
think this is what this is how they're
going to try and squeeze a little bit of
value out of webos what but even then
webos never was extremely smooth and
refined sort of like project buttered
into Android and how I Iowa's has been
all along if you're building a kiosk for
a hotel why wouldn't you use like
Android or we just use you know a touch
screen windows 8 terminal thing that's
that is a really good question that's
been my question as well I'm like if I'm
a hotel manager and I'm like
well I've got a choice between windows
which has a lot of you know solutions
already ready for it in blah blah blah
why am I going to just hop on this OS
that that really nobody's talking about
and that is backed by some company
called Graham that I know nothing about
and it'll be a little bit cheaper
because it's open source and you don't
have to pay licensing fees because I
don't know I don't know if the fifth
it's worth the headache to save you know
100 or 200 bucks whatever takes to buy a
copy windows 8 / install yeah I don't
know either and I you know I'm not sure
that HP knows really I think that they
are they have their eye firmly on on
Windows 8 for tablets and on whatever
they going to do on phones which better
be windows phone 8 in my opinion so I
don't know I think that this I think HP
is kind of delivered on their final
promise and they go out of their way by
the way to say that I am incorrect that
this opinion is wrong they're like we're
not just going to abandon it now you
know whatever but like everyone's gone
you know the NGO team all went to Google
the annual framework you know the
architecture team there's almost nobody
left in the department I think I think a
couple of a few people are following on
Twitter that still worked in the webos
sub-sector of the personal systems group
have all gone sorry I don't know the
whole thing is great to see but what's
the impact of it yes it's great they're
putting in you know these hours they
might not have to and delivering on
these promises but what of it yeah it's
gonna be only the only do you want to
see that would be extremely exciting but
I think there are so many barriers to
this happening is if the development
community got together sort of like
science sort of like the cyanogenmod
team they said we're gonna make a really
good product or and release it on
multiple devices and then suddenly it
becomes a maybe an even more distant
third or a fourth operating system that
people run on their phones and it gets
developer interest and people are make a
poor again and sort of it becomes like
owned by this team of developers that
cared deeply about it sure and I think
you know that's that's definitely a
possibility I don't know exactly what
Graham actually is every time I look up
gram I just get more and more confused
but it you know that there's there's a
lot of kind of
there's a lot of chefs cooks in the
kitchen you know there's a lot of hands
in the pie i'm not good at metaphors
right now there seem to be a lot of
groups kind of not vying for control
Randa like that but you know with
working on this and I don't know I don't
think we're going to see anything come
of webos mo more than outside the
hobbyist community because even the app
catalog which is yet which is just full
of abandoned where now is turn it is
required I mean HP it needs HP to
survive because HP hosts it I believe
moderate sooo yeah and so it's like I
don't know you know I I'm excited I'm
definitely going to load hope and webos
when it becomes available i'm going to
load it on whatever Hardware it can run
on four in a smartphone perspective and
i'm looking forward to doing videos and
writing some pieces on it and it's but i
don't think it even has a chance of
getting back to any kind of commercial
viability at all it's no longer a
commercial interest it's you know at in
smartphones at least and tablets oh
absolutely yeah but you know what that's
uh whatever this is we're going to the
future and that's that's all right
there's plenty of more players i'll be
showing up over the next year there's a
that new me go spin off sailfish the
firefox OS on the horizon right and we
love them with new choices there are and
then there's that other one that sprint
just backed a little while ago i forgot
the name of it but yeah there's there's
a couple i I'm actually a little bit
buoyed by that me go effort because they
seem to be really we talked about that
I'm on the earlier pod one that excuse
me early s podcasts where these guys
were like yeah we thanks nokia but we
really were working on this awesome OS
and we still love it so we're gonna make
it work and they've managed to raise a
lot of you know support i think they
just announced from hong kong that they
had established an alliance for coding
apps is that right this isn't on the run
down i just it just leaped into my head
well yeah maybe we'll talk about in the
next podcast because we're running low
on time i want to hit i want to hit
reader mail real quick before we jet out
of here we have thank you everyone for
writing in as usual we've got three
pieces of mail
today the first of course of course
because that's me I cannot I cannot
adequately pronounce the name of the of
the writer but i'm going to give it a
shot this is from eddie sham shahzad i
did the absolute best I could he says my
name is Edison I'm from Pakistan just a
little quick question I wanted to ask
which is the best smartphone browser IE
9 for windows phone 7.5 safari for the
iPhone or androids default browser and
which is saying is probably chrome
you're only talking stock browsers here
um I think you know it sounds like it
sounds like it sounds like these are
kind of the choices we have to work with
we've got you know it's iphone safari I
a nine so yeah so this yeah yeah I think
we're talking stock browsers for my part
I want to say since chrome is kind of
shipping on more and more android phones
as the default browser or at least it
seems to be for me that is the best
browser i will love to hear you guys
response it's it's the chrome is the
best for me because i tend i sync it
across my desk top all my mobile
instances and so I kind of have this
very non secure environment but this
very convenient environment where I
don't have to re-enter passwords or do
anything like that I just log into
chrome and everything is auto completed
for me I know that other browsers do
that I'm livid heavily google experience
so if you are fully embedded in Google's
ecosystem then I think chrome is
probably one of the best choices you can
make what about you guys Brandon yeah um
you know safari on the iphone five works
exceedingly well I like the location of
the bookmarks on the bottom of the
screen I think tab management leaves a
lot to be desired but you could get
chrome for the iphone 5 and then you can
do that awesome sideswipe but then it's
using the same Safari engine so it's the
same exact speed I I have always liked
if you if you you know route over here I
go through if you root an android phone
and you're running the stock browser for
example in the galaxy s3 I think that's
awesome and then if you're if you're
using paranoid android you can set the
DPI so that you see the tab
at the top so I I've found in most cases
the stock browser to be a little bit
faster than chrome on Android and I
don't know why that is I think I still
think Chrome for Android is not fully
baked yet so I like stock uh Android
Browser the best probably on a fastest i
think i'm gonna have to mirror those
sentiments I'm not much for you know
sinking bookmarks across devices stock
Android browser does what I needed to do
it's fast enough for my purposes and you
know it's gonna be on every device so
you're familiar with it you pick it up
it's it does what it needs to do cool
yeah there you are I guess in it I guess
ultimately in a very broad sense the
best browser is the one is the one that
you can get and if you happen to be on
Windows Phone you know and ie9 is kind
of your your your your only option stock
wise and that's I hope that that hopes
that I hope that answers your question I
I have a I have an inkling that if you
get a device like the windows phone 8x
or Lumia 920 with a dual-core cpu
running with Windows Phone 8 I I have a
little feeling that that might
outperform uh even the fastest browsers
I think just Microsoft's done such a
good job with the windows phone browser
even its windows phone 7 + 7.5 is just
remarkably fluid it was excellent wasn't
it yeah yeah that falls under like that
kind of broad user experience user
interface umbrella that Windows Phone I
sort of always done really really well
and yeah I agree i'm looking forward to
trying it again when I snap up a windows
phone again which is an overdue event
this next one is from ryan field from
california who has two questions about
google's acquisition of Motorola
Mobility sit and we talked a little bit
about this earlier but so they bought
the division of the company now what a
razor Nexus I would really love to see a
motorola Nexus device because the
outstanding build quality but Ryan makes
the point that yeah the Samsung seems to
be the kind of the preferred partner
here they really haven't done anything
with Motorola yet to make their purchase
seem worthwhile do you guys think we'll
see a razor Nexus it's just a it's a
matter of time I mean I think we talked
about this in
the previous podcast where's right yeah
the acquisition finalized this year I
mean it takes sometimes 12-18 months to
create entirely new product and Motorola
already had an existing roadmap and
we're seeing it roll out now with the
you know that the razr HD and razr HD
Maxx and razr and razr I those were
developed probably in 2011 at some point
maybe even talked about the late late
2010 so we I think we'll see obviously
something come out that's Nexus flavored
from Motorola but it might be at the end
of next year and I'm not so sure about
that I think there might be something to
having motorola have the separate
identity have you know this look from
its phones it has these you know
everything looks like a sheet of paper
from Battlestar Galactica with the
angled edges and what the Kevlar it's
got it it's it's own thing and it they
don't look like the devices that
Google's been involved with and I think
that could be a good thing it gives
people more options I mean you like
Brendan said we don't know how since
that everything was seen so far since
the acquisition isn't based on stuff
they've been working on for months and
years prior to this I don't know how the
new leadership is going to affect things
I'm hoping that they keep things
separate but love to wait and see it's
funny though people I think people
expected a lot more right around now
like they I don't think anyone expected
for us to not even feel the acquisition
and I don't think I don't besides having
Chrome as the default browser I don't
think we really feel it and it's you
know it's it's kind of funny yeah I mean
you can see it if you're looking for the
subtleties you can you can find it and
devices like the razr m where it's like
oh yeah this is a much lighter skin than
it was even a couple device devices ago
and then of course there's chrome and
and things run a little bit more fluid
like you know you can kind of sense it
but I agree there's nothing overt
there's nothing huge that we're seeing
from it I just want to share in that
that hope that Motorola retains its own
device identity particularly in the
hardware side software I don't care what
Google does to to motorola's software
customizations as long as that circles
widget can stay there
because their hardware the motorola
hardware is great i agree i love the
kevlar i love the cut corners and i hope
that remains so yeah I think then I
think personally will see a motorola
razr nexus razor Nexus at some point yes
but I don't know no idea when second
question from from Ryan is just a quick
one is my second question has to do with
motorola's promised update of Android
for that one jellybean to the original
RAZR my current daily driver do you
think we will see the update to the
original droid razr yes no my answer is
now considering the news we got today I
don't if it if it lands I will be
surprised everyone's pulling up
Motorola's list right now yeah I know
I'm like I was the official word because
the razor is more a flagship phone right
then then then the the Atrix 4G and it's
a newer phone than the Atrix 4G so it's
it has a greater chance of getting jelly
bean update but I don't see I don't know
I don't see it happening this is just me
being a little pessimistic on account of
this never ending story of OEM is being
like oh yeah we'll get around to that Oh
mark wear specs on the razor aren't that
different from the Atrix 4G main gig of
ram 1.2 gig arts dual core that's if
there was a good reason not to do it for
the atrix then maybe the same applies to
the droid razr that's a good point and
think about that if we don't know if the
reason was technical or just a figure
that legit weren't enough users left to
make it worth their while right and I
mean well but there's and there's a
disparity there no doubt too because I'm
sure the Atrix 4G didn't sell as well as
the droid razr you know I mean this is
true yeah so I don't know motor
apparently motorola according to ryan
Motorola's promised one hundred dollars
if the update doesn't come I didn't know
about that that's interesting it is
interesting but I would much rather have
the update because the money only goes
towards a new motor filler built device
and the razr m is not my cup of tea I
feel you right yeah I don't know I don't
know we'll we'll have to see I'm not
confident in it the the final question
we've got it comes from
Brendan Clark who's asked us a question
before this one is very very specific I
just don't know I have another question
this time in regards to the acer a 500
just curious if you know if there's a
possibility of a jelly bean update
everyone's definitely amped on a jelly
bean update for their individual devices
and I totally get it I have seen and I
looked at this very cursorily right
before I came on the air and it looks
like there's a ton of custom jelly bean
runs it's like a like some CM whatever
builds out there for it but I have seen
no inkling of an official update have
you guys I don't think so um yeah I've
actually seen a lot of news about the
case or a series of devices getting
jellybean through custom roms on XDA
mm-hmm um certainly not everyone wants
to read their device but if you know if
you want jelly bean okay sometimes we
got to do something yeah some things to
get it you gotta see through gotta break
some legs to you know everythings it's
less objectionable to talk about rooting
tablets then I need to the customization
with phones especially when you're not
dealing with you know carriers and all
people I feel are a lot more comfortable
taking it sort of step with the tablet
so maybe that is more of a viable option
than that we're talking about an actual
Android handset that's a good point
because I think most people get their
tablets through amazon or newegg and not
necessarily the carrier unless they're
getting you know one with data yeah yeah
the notion of buying a tablet in a
carrier store has always been kind of
weird to me I've never wanted to commit
to that kind of like yeah I'll buy this
tablet for a subsidized price with a
with a contract on my tablet I don't
know that maybe i'm weird yeah and and
that's I think a lot of people have that
fear because it's so like ominous to
sign that two-year contract and you know
tablet you know you're like well am I
gonna use the data am I not going to use
the data which is why i love love love
what the ipad does where you can turn on
data when you want it when you need it I
wish every tablet did that it's
brilliant me too yeah no agreed I was it
was one of the first pieces i wanted to
write when I came on board in February I
was like I want to talk about this thing
how I go into a carrier store and the
tablet section is always the like
there's there's always like this
tumbleweed blowing through no one's ever
playing with the tablets and the carrier
stores
go to where as you go to bestbuy or you
go to a an electronics retailer that is
kind of broader yeah there are people
playing around with the tablets you want
to see what's going on because you don't
necessarily have to get them with a data
plan and that's you know yeah that's a
strong disincentive I think anyway
Brendan good luck I think you should if
you want jelly bean certainly you're
going to get it faster on the a500 if
you if you are able to get your hands a
little dirty and you should you know
that's fun you should do that and I tend
to run stock and i even i will say that
it's fun to to trifle with with the
tablets innards every now and then so
