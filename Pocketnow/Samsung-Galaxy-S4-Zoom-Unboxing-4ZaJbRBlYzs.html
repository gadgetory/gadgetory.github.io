compare it we're going to analyze it and
review it and at the end of our coverage
we're going to let you know if it's a
phone with a camera or a camera with a
phone I'm Anthony nod this is PocketNow
and you're watching the Samsung Galaxy
s4 zoom unboxing let's go check it out
this is the Samsung Galaxy s4 zoom and
these are the obligatory scissors while
we open this FedEx packaging coming to
us from our friends at close that code
at UK let's talk a little bit about this
device with the samsung galaxy s4 zoom
we are concluding our series of
reviewing the phones that Samsung
introduced at its London premiere event
if you've missed our galaxy s4 active
and Galaxy s4 mini reviews head over to
pocket now to catch up and remember to
subscribe to our social media channels
to stay up to date and while Samsung is
marketing this as a phone with a camera
you tooth looks many are considering it
the other way around a camera or a phone
if it matters to you we'll let you know
what we think in our full review so
here's the box and aligned with all the
other Samsung boxes of 2013 Linna s4 S 4
active s4 mini and the tablets
artificial wooden texture on recyclable
carbon printed with soy ink the front
has the picture of the device itself
with the zoom lens extended and also we
got some branding action going on on the
sides and the back calls out some
specific features of the s4 zoom we got
the imaging features being mentioned
first like the 10 times optical zoom 16
megapixel autofocus camera with optical
image stabilization of course paired
with a 1.9 megapixel webcam and then
comes the rest like the 4.5 inch Super
AMOLED screen 1.5 GHz dual-core
processor and a 23 30 milliamp hour
battery
obviously this s4 zoom has 8 gigabytes
of internal storage cracking the box
open reveals the air quotes phone itself
which you put to the side underneath the
carton there's your usual pros the
obligatory USB cable for syncing and
charging like you don't already have a
kilometer of those the charger which in
our case came with a UK plug as well as
the headphones which are always nice
with additional gels there's a 23 30
milliamp hour battery bundle let's take
a look at the device itself and switch
to the special screen protector peeling
cap
now that we've got the plastic off if
you look at the Esper zoom from this
angle you might think it's an s4 as for
mini s3 or you name it however if you
turn it to the side or to its back you
will realize that it's not on the front
we have like on every other Samsung
phone the earpiece up top flanked by the
front phaser and sensors to the right
and left a 4.3 inch qHD Super AMOLED
screen a physical home button as well as
capacitive buttons for back and menu on
the left there's a tripod mount as well
as a micro SD card slot for expanding
the small amount of built-in storage and
a lanyard hole the opposite side
features the power button volume rockers
as well as a huge shutter button we wish
we would see more of those on phones now
turning it to the back we'll see the
magic we've got a 16 megapixel camera
sensor with 10 times optical zoom lens
and also optical image stabilization
xenon flashes in there's also a focus
assist light you got the speakers and of
course a camera grip since this is a
camera with a phone or is it a phone
with a camera let's not forget about the
ring which is used for zoom and other
functionality we'll talk about that
later in future videos the top features
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack as well
as the microphone and an IR blaster on
the bottom there's the microUSB port as
well as the flap for battery and SIM
card slot while rebooting the s4 zoom up
for the first time let's recap the specs
there's a 4.3 inch Super AMOLED screen
with q HD resolution which is 540 by 960
a 1.5 GHz dual-core processor one and a
half gigs of RAM eight gigs of internal
storage out of which five are usable of
course expandable via microSD a 16
megapixel main camera on the back with
10 times optical zoom 1.9 megapixel
webcam 23 30 milliamp hour battery and
Android 4.2.2 jelly bean with TouchWiz
on top of other specs include Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and
see as well as a 3G and LTE radio
capabilities one might say that the
Galaxy s4 zoom is more like a galaxy s4
mini but a huge camera rather than a
galaxy s4 because of the specs which are
almost identical with the mini more on
that in our upcoming videos and the
review itself yes
no that was my zoom lens everyone is
gonna do it for today for the samsung
galaxy s4 zoom unboxing i've been an
sandy nod you can follow me on facebook
