pocket now calm if you've been waiting
to get ice cream sandwich on your Nexus
S you can do it now and we'll show you
how in this video let's get to it so
Google is going to be releasing Ice
Cream Sandwich for the nexus s in
particular and lots of OEMs are going to
be releasing updates for devices that
are out now but right now this is the
beta version of ice cream sandwich on
the Nexus S there's a lot of force
closes he probably could use this as
your daily driver if you wanted to but
really it's more so for test purposes
right now and generally it works quite
well all the features are there Wi-Fi
data everything is working we put a link
up in the description and tell you
exactly where to go to get the files all
you need is a rooted nexus s and it's
extremely easy to uninstall it's like
installing any other wrong so let's talk
about ice cream sandwich and how it
feels on an actual phone we've given you
a tour of how Ice Cream Sandwich feels
in an emulator but there's nothing like
getting it on an actual phone and
feeling what it is what kind of
experience it brings so of course in Ice
Cream Sandwich we've multiple home
screens and along the bottom we have a
little slider that shows you which home
screen you are on we also have the dock
on the bottom here you can add and
remove too so let's say we just want to
put settings down here very easy very
obvious stuff to do there's a new
application tray which is organized by
apps and widgets and you can swipe to
the right and you see again that little
notification down there that little
slider that shows you which screen
you're on we can also go over to widgets
and this is right out of honeycomb the
tablet UI so we can take an analog clock
drag it over to a screen on the right
pop it there we can go back into the the
widget tray here slide over to the right
you've got many pages of widgets as you
can see here it can add a Google search
to this page and drop it there and there
you go it's it's very simple it's very
reminiscent of of using honeycomb and
there's a lot of other little changes
like to add wallpaper you no longer tap
on the menu button in fact that does
nothing in a lot of cases you tap on the
background and that'll bring up your
wallpaper picker
kind of makes sense doesn't it so
another thing you can do with ice cream
sandwich is selectively wipe away
notifications and there's actually going
to be an alarm that goes off in a minute
so that we can test that out but before
we do let's jump into the browser
because the browser UI has been changed
a little bit so we're already loading
here Emma and gadget calm and maybe we
need to refresh it there okay here it is
and over here on the left if you tap on
the fav icon you can actually change
between mobile and desktop view right on
the fly which is a great feature there's
also a new UI for switching between open
tabs so this is what it looks like it's
pretty fast it's pretty quick and
intuitive so let's go to pocket now here
the browser is pretty facets it's
definitely buggy in this beta version of
ice cream sandwich in fact it's not even
working most of the time and there it
goes it's a lot better with mobile web
pages okay so there we have an alarm and
if we it's news go to notification shade
there it is watch this you can swipe off
or maybe not I guess alarms you can't
swipe off because it's still there but
things like text messages and emails you
can wipe off the screen which is a
really nice feature so we've got lots of
new widgets that come right out of
honeycomb kind of these built-in widgets
that are almost a frame so we can scroll
within the widget itself which is nice
we can tap and hold on it and resize it
although kind of limited in how you can
resize it in this case you really can't
at all but a lot of the other widgets
you can resize which is nice so you can
really take advantage of your home
screen space we've got this google
search bar right on the home screen
it'll bring up a google search obviously
let's dive into settings here and see
what has changed a lot of things have
changed they really reorganize the whole
settings menu so instead of getting item
after item after item you get categories
so there's wireless and network there's
device there's personal and everything
has this holographic you I look and feel
kind of looking like the tron movie
right so with these fluorescent blue
colors and very modern-looking interface
that they've brought the ice cream
sandwich so this data usage thing is
cool but it
only works if you have a data card in
this will work with your data connection
this beta version of ice cream sandwich
so you can test it out it lets you set
caps so that for example when you get to
a 250 megabyte data cap it'll tell you
so you don't go over and are charged and
overage let's go back we've got a lot of
other things that are taken out of
gingerbread and honeycomb let's go to
applications see if anything has changed
there so we got a kind of a new UI here
and we can swipe to the right or
sometimes again you can tap to the right
see if that's wipe works it works in
some screens but not in others for
example if you go to the phone UI you'll
get three tabs along the top see that
and we can actually swipe between them
really cool effect their kind of reminds
us of Windows Phone 7 actually the way
that it does that let's go back into the
settings menu see what else is in there
so the stuff you're used to seeing
accounts and sync security backup and
reset if we go into about phone you'll
see that we're running on Android 4.2
task you I in Ice Cream Sandwich it's
taken right out of honeycomb so if we
tap and hold on the home button you'll
see what I mean it shows you open
previews of all the apps that are open
this is a cool UI because you can take
out your thumb and kind of flick between
them and land on the one that you want
very easily now what you'll find is that
a device like the Galaxy Nexus has a
constant built in virtual multitask
button along with the home button and
the back button just like honeycomb
older hardware like the Nexus S you
still have to take advantage of the
hardware keys which means that the
multitask you I isn't one tap away it's
always going to be a tap and hold tap
away because the home button here has to
serve two purposes where's on the Galaxy
Nexus there's a home button and a multi
task button so it'll work on legacy
hardware no problem just not as
intuitively as you'll find on the Galaxy
Nexus that's coming out and future Ice
Cream Sandwich hardware let's dive into
the mail application hopefully there's
nothing there that does private does it
look like it so the mail application
looked and feels a lot like honeycomb
once again so we've got quick
Shinzon the bottom if we go into the
menu there are far fewer options there
are only two options they're really
trying to take in in Ice Cream Sandwich
the the settings out of the menu and
kind of put it right in front of you so
here we have all these buttons if we tap
on items these things down here will
change and you can impact what has been
checked with these buttons and that way
you're not having to dive into the menu
all the time you the functions that you
use the most are out in the front so a
really nice new email you I there's also
a nice new calendar UI and here's what
it looks like and of course you can
drill down into the days and and
everything like that and also folders
are a little bit different in Ice Cream
Sandwich as you can see they pop up
their kind of nicer looking and let's
see how you add a new folder if we take
this and dump it on top of there hey
does that look familiar it comes from
the iphone so you drop it in there and
you get a little preview and a little
listing of all the apps that are within
the folder unnamed folder so you can
rename it you know hello done now you
have the hello folder and the google
apps folder which contains all the
google apps that you've come to expect
so a lot of little changes and a lot of
UI changes in Ice Cream Sandwich
definitely the biggest interface change
in a while what we're going to do is
spend a few days with this we're going
to update it once the new beta comes out
and give you a report once we get to
spend a bunch of time with it on how Ice
Cream Sandwich feels on legacy hardware
and of course will be getting the Galaxy
Nexus in here relatively soon and show
you how a maid for ice cream sandwich
device looks and feels if you liked this
video please give it a thumbs up and
again check the description if you've
got an XSS and you want to try this on
your own thanks for watching that's it
for now
