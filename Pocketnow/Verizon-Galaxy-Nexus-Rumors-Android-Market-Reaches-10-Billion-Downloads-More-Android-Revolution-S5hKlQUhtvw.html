live Android on sweets the ten billion
mark and downloads the Verizon Galaxy
Nexus is nowhere to be found
all this and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm hi Metairie better
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
Android revolution but sure we go
through what's hot and what's not in
sighs a lot of Google's Android project
let's start this week up what's hot
that's right we all have a lot to
celebrate the Android Market just
launched a new promotion where they're
selling lots of key applications for as
little as 10 cents each and well you
know what's the catch because it's only
lasting for ten days and well the fact
is there isn't a catch Android and
Google just thought they'd have a
promotion and celebrate because they're
now selling and downloading 10 billion
applications in the Android Market so
don't hold your breath too long hit the
link of the description for details on
which applications are on sale because
there are lots of really good apps there
that you could just get for 10 cents
that other smartphone releases for the
week it was just a matter of time before
carriers went crazy over the white
version of the Samsung Galaxy s2 so your
calendars for these ever 14th and you're
on t-mobile as they're releasing it the
LG Nitro HD just made it's great to AT&amp;amp;T
when it was much expected also specs are
really compelling and decent and expect
our video coverage on the device very
soon panasonic has also announced their
presses in the european market with
android the company teases with us the
slim shape design which looked quite
well sadly until they start talking
about specs because they mentioned qHD
resolution on a screen for next year's
hardware not really nice out of this
week's leaks the Motorola Droid 4 still
is nowhere to be found except for the
Droid does website and a lot of
specifics on release states are still
not there yet but we're hoping that soon
Sony Ericsson's LT 28 8 he just got
bluetooth certified with this weird name
called a dream 6 now I wonder what that
means apparently the 80 at the end of
the name is for AT&amp;amp;T so hopefully that
will be soon the HTC merge recently
popped up on camera also with some
verizon love though still no release
dates they're out of this week's
coverage make sure you catch Dan
Webster's full review of the HTC Rezound
which got some really great ratings so
far really good device
Joe Levi also brought this really good
video on the differences between the
Nexus One the Nexus S
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus which is their
new flagship device though well there
are quite differences there he also
offers this really great article on how
to root that samsung galaxy nexus that's
already on your hand and if you want
Google Wallet working on non-supportive
Android smartphones make sure you catch
the Levi's as video on how to do it
software update seem to be the only
weird news is holiday season the Samsung
Galaxy S 2 Epic 4G Touch squirrel
CatDog woodpecker whatever you want to
call that thing just got an update the
t-mobile sensation 4d touch also did and
the moral of Droid Bionic also got
enough they thought all this is in the
name of bug fixes so make sure you
update now the European version of the
HTC Incredible S just got enough they
fill this time it's not to get bug fixes
but instead to get Sense 3.0 updated so
hey hit the link because you really need
that update it's worth every megabyte
now if you're rocking a Sony Ericsson
device well hit the link in the
description because it provides you
details on how to get Ice Cream Sandwich
on your devices whenever that's released
for Sony Ericsson devices right now
Google has just launched a new service
called Google Currents that intends to
compete with Flipboard and bringing you
a magazine style UI for your content the
app is free and it's quite cool so make
sure you hit the link in the description
doesn't scratch for clock and now turns
on your iOS or Android device so far we
must admit it's really quite compelling
the service is really quite worth it
because you're able to experience all of
our content our reviews and just about
everything even our video in one place
really cool so make sure you subscribe
down below
that is for what's hot let's continue
over what's not in well hey where is the
variance of the Verizon Samsung Galaxy
Nexus nobody knows when we're getting a
release take some of us are assuming
that it will happen on December 13th
others are blaming the fact that it has
NFC but it's not being supported by
Google Wallet it seems to rise and wants
that but apparently only Sprint is in
that mix so not really sure what's going
to happen but again its NFC and Google
Wallet or the only problem that why
don't you just release the damn device
and let's get it out there and have
everybody happy and then once you're
done with that you'll release the
software I think now Harkov that means
everybody's expecting it that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm playing it or you better
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
