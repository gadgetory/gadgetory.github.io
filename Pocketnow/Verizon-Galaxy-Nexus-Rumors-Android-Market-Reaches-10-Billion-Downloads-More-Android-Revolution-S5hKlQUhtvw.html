Beats Audio is now live Android on
sweets the 10 billion mark and downloads
the verizon galaxy nexus is nowhere to
be found all this and more coming up
right now
hello everyone I'm high Meadow iveta
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
android Revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not in
size a little Google's Android project
let's start this week up what's hot
that's right we all have a lot to
celebrate the Android Market just
launched a new promotion where they're
selling lots of key applications for as
little as ten cents each and well you'd
ask what's the catch because it's only
lasting for ten days and well the fact
is there isn't a catch Android and
Google just thought they'd have a
promotion and celebrate because they're
now selling and downloading 10 billion
applications in the Android Market so
don't hold your breath too long hit the
link of the description for details on
which applications are on sale because
there are lots of really good apps there
you can just get for ten cents out of
the smartphone releases for the week it
was just a matter of time before
carriers went crazy over the white
version of the samsung galaxy s2 so your
calendars for these ever 14th and you're
on t-mobile as they're releasing it the
LG nitro HD just made its way to AT&amp;amp;T
when it was much expected also specs are
really compelling and decent and expect
our video coverage on the device very
soon panasonic has also announced their
presence in the European market with
Android the company teases with this the
slim shape design which look quite well
sadly until they start talking about
specs because they mentioned qHD
resolution on a screen for next year's
Hardware not really nice out of this
week's leaks the motorola droid 4 still
is nowhere to be found except for the
droid does websites and well specifics
on release dates are still not there yet
but we're hoping that soon sony
ericsson's LT 2880 just got bluetooth
certified with this weird name called a
dream 6 now I wonder what that means
apparently the 80 at the end of the name
is for AT&amp;amp;T so hopefully that will be
soon the HTC merge recently popped up on
camera also with some verizon love those
still no release dates they're out of
this week's coverage picture you catch
Dan Webster spill review of the HTC
Rezound which got some really great
ratings so far really good device jolene
I also brought this really good video on
the differences between the nexus one
the Nexus S
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus which is their
new flagship device though well there
are quite differences there he also
offers this really great article on how
to route that Samsung Galaxy Nexus
that's already on your hand and if you
want Google Wallet working on
non-supportive Android smartphones make
sure you catch the levis video on how to
do it software update seem to be the
only weird news is holiday season the
samsung galaxy s2 epic 4g touch squirrel
cat dog woodpecker whatever you want to
call that thing just got an update the
t-mobile sensation 4g touch also did the
moral a droid bionic also got enough
they fill all this is in the name of bug
fixes so make sure you update now the
european version of the HTC incredible s
just got enough they fill this time it's
not to get bug fixes but instead to get
sense three point no updated so hey hit
the link because you really need that
update it's worth every megabyte now if
you're rocking a sony ericsson device
will hit the link in the description
because it provides you details on how
to get ice cream sandwich on your
devices whenever that's released for
sony ericsson devices right now google
has just launched a new service called
google currents that intends to compete
with Flipboard and bringing you a
magazine-style UI for your content the
app is free and it's quite cool so make
sure you hit the link in the description
doesn't scratch for clocking out current
on your iOS or Android device so far we
must admit it's really quite compelling
the service is really quite worth it
because you're able to experience all of
our content our reviews and just about
everything even our video in one place
really cool so make sure you subscribe
down below
that doesn't for what's hot let's
continue over what's not in well hey
where is the variance of the verizon
samsung galaxy nexus nobody knows when
we're getting a release date some of us
are assuming that it will happen on
december 13th others are blaming the
fact that it has NFC but it's not being
supported by google wallet it seems
arise and wants that but apparently only
sprint is in that mix so not really sure
what's going to happen but again is NFC
and google wallet or the only problem
that why don't you just release the damn
device and let's get it out there and
have everybody happy and then once
you're done with that you release a
software update now Harkov at me
everybody's expecting it that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm paying that or you better
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
