hangout series from pocket now where we
will out where we let you another
listeners viewers readers of pocket now
ask us questions and give us your
opinion about the hottest and newest
devices on the market we've got some
time to make up for since episode 2 it
has in fact been two months since the
last year review episodes it's a pretty
poor showing on our part we apologize so
today's devices number three in order to
make it up to you we've got the Nokia
Lumia 1020 Google's Moto X and the Sony
Xperia Z ultra and who these devices
well well we the bonus hold on I want to
introduce you and then you can give me
the bonus or because I still don't think
I know what it is because i only have
two of these devices it was actually two
yeah oh is it well if you don't know me
i'm michael fisher editorial director of
pocket out for new people in the room
and my co-host today the interruptus
maximus Taylor Martin the one bringing
you the Z ultra all the way from the
Carolinas how have you been morning and
what fancy things have you brought us
I've been great and we need someone to
mute their Mike I'm gonna have to do it
for them yeah it would be awesome all
right yeah they don't even have video so
anyway yes I have to I've lost all video
feed to I have two special devices that
we're gonna I guess open up the floor
for as well one is this baby right here
Nvidia shield yes I have had it for
about a week now and the other one that
I've had for a little bit longer the
nexus 7 not to be confused with the
xperia z ultra so that you have a both
of those Siculus in terms of the
footprint on those yeah we I don't
really want to necessarily talk all that
much about the new Nexus 7 like it's not
that that's old news or anything like
that but it's here in case you want to
talk about it in case you want to toss
us a quick question so since it's been a
while viewers let me break the format
down from newbies and we'll get down to
business viewers have five minutes
apiece to ask us questions about either
of these devices and at the end of their
time that you need to give your own
opinion numerically on each we used to
do thumbs up or thumbs down but that
didn't really mean anything and since we
give numeric scores on our reviews it
figures that maybe you guys should give
numeric scores as well
so we're going to ask you for a one to
ten value on each device at the end of
the show will tabulate the scores and
we'll get a rough picture of the pocket
now readerships opinion on each of these
devices now remember folks when we bring
you on the air your comment or question
has to be related directly to one of
these I guess what six devices that
we've got here but really uh one of
these three devices that are that are in
the headline lumia 1020 Moto X and the
Xperia Z ultra we want to keep
discussion can find those to keep things
going so Taylor I think the rules and
regulations are out of the way isn't
that correct uh yeah sure why not good
well i'm gonna kick things off by saying
I'm very excited and I'm going to ask
Taylor Martin to choose the first
respondent for episode 003 of the UU
review Taylor go for it okay wow I
wasn't expecting this um at least at
least I have video feeds back yeah that
is a good thing that's good um let's uh
let's go with ro ro L said how it's
pronounced royal van I can please uh
unmute your mic there put your head but
headset on welcome to the urea hello
hello I saw you had what is that in
lumia 920 so 920 yes yeah row where are
you calling from today from belgium
ultima nice oh very nice it is uh it is
evening over there do some what is it
isn't it yeah it is actually i should be
studying right now but this is more
interesting this is more fun right yeah
yeah it is rui are you a student I'm
trying to be one let's leave it at that
understood very well which device for
you are you calling it about what are
you most excited about the Lumia 1020 of
course i own a 920 so yes indeed and
which shape which shape what color of
the 920 do you have there is that if I
have a yellow one well you BL / yellow
phone buddies that's actually yeah now
of course there's actually there's an
interesting story to this yeah I won
this device one ice yeah I didn't pay
thankful for it but I wondered it I
really wanted it that's why I actually
joined in a joint in a contest on
facebook and I want did you win it from
nokia or from another cider from nokia
from nokia I got it directly from Nokia
wow so they made kind of like an instant
friend in you didn't they yeah they did
I thought was a ready dear friend but
more that's great how long ago was this
how long have you had it uh half a year
cool so you wanted basically when it was
released almost servicer shortly i know
that februari from februar it was like
two you have four months after and one
cheese God time goes fast yeah so the
1020 is you know from the front side of
course we're looking at the at the 920
again yeah so my question is is this it
feel like in 920 uh when you hold it so
when you hold it and Taylor can of
course jump in on this as well like when
you hold it I just sold my 920 on ebay
so I don't have mine anymore but when
you hold this device it it looks from
the front as though you have a 920 in
your hand it looks everyone else like a
920 it feels nothing like the 920 in the
hand the 920 you know has that very nice
boat like feel and you know it's well
balanced and stuff like that and the 10
20 men this this thing you know the
camera housing it doesn't look like much
in photos but when you're holding it in
your hand it doesn't quite feel right to
hold it like this because you've got the
cold feeling camera housing on you and
so you kind of want to end up doing this
and so you're holding the phone quite
high in your hand then it it's not the
most comfortable phone I've ever held i
will i will say that Taylor do you would
right here um yeah it takes a little
getting used to I actually hold mine and
put my index finger above it so it does
get in the way so when I was first
trying to hold the phone I was like
trying to figure out where to put my
fingers because it was just kind of
getting the way but after you use it for
a little while you just kind of it's
there so you kind of forget about it but
it doesn't really get in the way I never
really had a 920 I was there for the
launch event and I couldn't touch it at
the launch event they were very adamant
about not letting anybody get near them
and I remember yeah I did though
and I got a little time with it that I
wasn't supposed to get but uh and all
enough a feel for it but I don't know
what I will say is that because every
finish of the 1020 is in Matt it helps a
bit i mean you know that your yellow 920
there is is glossy and so yeah it is it
couldn't be a more different feel if you
tried it's so smooth and it really know
oh yeah I I helped 805 Lumia 800 phones
in the past and my my brother has a 620
a matte finish it feels completely
different oh really the sixth one nice
and yes makes some like if you know if
you can hear that it makes a weird noise
like it sounds and feels weird yeah it
definitely i don't know if it's like I
think futuristic is probably the right
term it feels um you muted you got muted
Michael someone muted you yeah that
wasn't very nice of anyone but yeah so I
you know it definitely feels futuristic
which I which I really like do you have
any a bit before we you know monopolize
all the all of your slot by talking any
other things you want to know about the
1020 yeah you have the the buttons here
on this side and the camera bezel here
there's ear conium feels kind of nice it
doesn't scratch at all but the material
on the 1020 is actually a different one
it's as premium looking and doesn't feel
as pretty as this was the sir yeah I
remember that now I was always calling
the Lumia 920 buttons ceramic is it is
it the same thing in the same thing yeah
so the it was one of the first things I
noticed when I unpack the box that how
different the buttons feel they don't
feel at all like like plastic on the
1020 like they actually do feel like
quite high quality you know that on the
920 they're kind of glossy you know
they're shiny and video and of course
the the camera bezel is as well I mean
these are all aluminum and they're all
mad they're not a matte finish but there
you know I don't know if it's like a
vapor deposition or how they do the
coloring here on the black but it feels
and looks very premium when you do put
your fingers on the camera module if you
want to do that they it is definitely
cool to the
touch and I was like anodized aluminum
yeah yeah I wish I could get like a
macro shot of the material here with a
like a microscope or something like that
because it's not quite like sandpaper
it's nothing like that but it's
definitely not in the least bit glossy
but it does feel very good and brief the
buttons still have very nice travel
they're very you know they're responsive
physically so I I don't miss the 920's
buttons if that's what you're asking
okay well moving on to the camera of
course the main selling point of this
phone yes well the pro camera
application how does that what does it
work good is it better than the original
application well I've heard it a little
bit slower than it used to be actually
in taking pictures and yeah no question
this takes an awful lot of time right
Taylor I mean you and I are on the same
page on this right yeah and it's because
you're using a 41-megapixel sensor and
it takes a minute to fire up like you
have to hand crank it to get it to open
and yeah like if you actually want to
see what that what the load time is I
mean we'll do a little low press here
like here we go I'm going to do three
two one I'm pressing and holding and
we're waiting for boot and now the
camera app starts and the camera is
ready and they're finally there we are
and also with the latest yet it is quite
a fan time you're right i'm gonna do
that what's nice though what was nice is
that it actually went wants to start it
up it was there but then nokia updated
the app presumably to increase its
stability and now like for the first 10
seconds the app is up it's actually a
little laggy I don't know what their mmm
what they did to it but it's definitely
a much slower camera the plus side
though is that you're no longer stuck in
the Windows Phone default shooting yeah
which is just so hamstrung and
featureless you know that I think it's I
mean Taylor do you agree that the pro
camera app is basically the best thing
ever oh yeah a manual focus on a
smartphone is awesome yeah Brandon was
exposure time or shutter speed rather
yeah Brandon was messaging me while we
were recording the podcast and he's like
do you leave all your settings on auto
or do you switch in the manual and all
this other
and I said if you're having trouble
locking focus on something up close use
the manual focus in it lock we I can't
normally focus business oh so there
are a lot of things you can't do with
automated software that you can do with
this even if with third party apps and
stuff yeah so roll at you know I'm sorry
is it is it Rowell or is it roll how do
you control its rule when when you get
the 920 when you get the pro camera app
on the 920 I think you're really going
to enjoy it I think yeah so we do have
to move on I do want to ask you for for
your to cast your numeric vote on behalf
of the 1020 based on what you know about
it or based on 1 to 10 what you've read
so far and your personal feelings where
would you put it I put it at an eight
point five 10 20 because actually if I
may elaborate yes because it's it's I
like Lumia as a Nokia in general windows
phone is a good operating system and
Nokia did it I hadn't made the right
choice going with it and the 1020 is yet
the next step in also in with the
imaging no but not as good at but also I
would have given it a higher score if it
had if Windows Phone supported higher
specs I know it's an old it's an old
story and actually a bit of stupid one
because specs don't always compared to
actual user experience I actually speed
tested my 920 with a store unit galaxy
s4 and it didn't feel particularly
faster so boom yeah yeah it's definitely
I understand yeah it's you know it's
impossible to look at the 1020 without
saying yeah these are a lot of the specs
we've seen before even though the
experiences is very is quite excellent
actually it's it's a Microsoft fold it's
in no way or no careful it's true well
rule thank you so much for for joining
us for the you review we really
appreciate you coming on the air and
talking lumia 1020 with us and we will
we will hopefully see on the next one I
hope so too I don't enjoy it
thank you very much like once we'll ask
you just I didn't mention this in the
intro folks we do it we will ask you to
please drop off live show yeah we're
gonna have to mute your mic there Pablo
and yeah please ones once were through
if we if we could ask you to make room
for somebody else by dropping off the
air rule once again thank you thank you
yeah I pleasure alright Taylor you get
that score down yep 8.5 on the 10 20
you're the best pillows dever I think
it's time for me to choose somebody
isn't it it is I want to talk to
Benjamin over there no sense no sense
waiting on this and making a big
dramatic production let's just get
Benjamin to unmute as Mike and say hello
welcome to the you review a little bit
Fisher in Taylor Martin no muting us
anymore yeah sorry no nothing wrong with
Stephanie boy yeah yeah hang out uh a
little bit of a UI lining yeah yeah you
must need like an administrator actions
for it so nobody can do that so yeah
what it is yeah well welcome to the you
review at any rate and what device are
you uh calling it first of all were you
calling in from sorry in from Denver
that's right we've spoken before I
remember yeah yeah um what uh what
device are you is most tickling your
fancy today well this is probably not
mostly for me but just thinking about
devices in general it have to be the
Moto X ah being a fan of google that you
can you can kind of tell all the colors
today yes yeah where the colors today
just for you guys no not really um just
for the fact that you know with with
motorola and google kind of putting out
a device that's need nowhere in nowhere
close to top-of-the-line specs but specs
that are good enough for what sounds
like really great battery life and like
in michael's review when he talked about
it feels really nice you can throw it in
your pocket with your keys and your
change you don't really have to worry
about it kind of looking for something
that's just really really a quality
piece that's mass-produced that has a
couple nice software features not so
much gimmicky as much as I think
Samsung's can be even though partner are
helpful but some stuff that I think
more general people could use or people
that are new to smartphones or things
like that to you kind of agree with that
anything completely and you know I X
here and you know I'm gonna go and lock
the camera myself here so I can just
kind of spin it around and and talk
about it for a second I mean you are
you're absolutely right the feature set
I'll talk about that in a second but
just the physical build here you know
this is the most boring one you can get
this is the black one and it's got no
customization in terms of color and I
mean you know the buttons are chrome
what could you do we're gonna get a
custom built here Motorola has actually
is it I think we got I think we have
maybe two more coming and we'll be able
to see the different colors and see
what's up but the thing is you can the
minute you take this thing out of the
box you just it if this is me talking
and maybe it's because it resembles a
pre plus from back in the day I don't
know you can feel like you can feel
totally natural just putting it in your
pocket throwing it on your couch just
tossing it around like it's a phone
you've been carrying for months because
it feels so natural in the hand the soft
touch that's not quite soft touch well
round back for a group little dimple
around back for putting your finger
there up against your head I mean it's
just it's not flashy it's not trying to
out cool everybody but it is a really
really nicely designed phone and
physically I adore it right well but and
then the feature set as well I mean you
know you're talking to samsung samsung
level of feature spam is not what we're
seeing here at all no absolutely it's
just it just kind of little things that
are you know kind of helpful being able
to lay in bed ask what the you know
using google now and stuff like that
Beckett just see what something where
that's a lot easier for somebody new to
it or just want something that's
straightforward and they're not looking
for top of line specs and like you said
it's um you know a lot of a lot of
smartphones nowadays they feel so
fragile like you have to hold it really
tight me put it in your pocket and then
you're worried about sitting down
because it's gonna poke you in the side
or you're gonna sit on the back like
like my buddy who was who had a note to
he was always worried about he's worried
about you know folding the thing in half
when he would sit down with it in his
pocket but you and yeah well I think
Taylor Martin knows something about
uncle owns in the pocket right yeah this
thing it it's glass on the front and
back and I feel like anything and
everything
do with it just sitting in on the table
I'm sitting it down on the foam that I
have for my mic or just sitting it on
other devices so I'm not just destroying
it you're right good you're babysitting
it right i mean we have so many of
devices are built this way you know what
i mean i'm not going to go out here and
say that that's stupid and people
shouldn't do that because really the HTC
one is one of those devices I baby and I
think it deserves the babying because
it's a beautiful build but it is no
getting around it it's so refreshing be
able to carry something like this where
it's like oh man I just oh oh it's on
the floor because who cares because it's
gonna be able to deal with it and it's
not gonna look like crap after falling
once or twice I mcgrane well that's the
whole thing and that's not what I what I
think they nailed on the build was
something that when people grab it you
know they look at when they have a you
know that and I know HTC One you know
side by side they can say I hold this
one and hold this one which one you know
feels more fragile right oh you know
which one feels he you know display and
all that stuff you know when I that
specs you're really not making that much
of a difference I mean a 1080p display
720p display if you can make out the
difference great but honestly it really
doesn't make that much of a difference
not only are gone on on the people know
and people and the people in the comment
sections who who tell me that I'm an
idiot because I this funny p display is
just so yesterday this look so nasty
like no no that's not true at all right
it'll look nasty but but I can see the
difference well but that don't know I'm
not saying I'm different when the DNA
came out I think you and I were both
there and and we was like oh wow this is
amazing i thought a 1080p screen was
going to be nothing but know this really
is legitimately better no it's it's
better there's no getting hard it's it's
better but unless you make literally
looking for it you're not going to see
the difference if you're if you're a
mass-market consumer to whom I just
targeted you're not gonna be able to
tell the difference well we sort of your
use cases yeah yeah go ahead Taylor
sorry I didn't mean interrupt oh no it
it's okay I interrupt plenty of other
people but yeah ninety percent of your
use cases you're never gonna notice the
improvements from a 1080p display if
anything it's it's detrimental to the
performance
because you're pushing more pixels but
the only time it ever really matters is
if you're watching a movie or playing
game you get better graphics and that's
that's a very small percentage of my use
at least we're going to have to we're
gonna have to move on your Benjamin we
love talking to you have a final
question or anything but we didn't get
to before I ask for your score oh just
kind of talking in general there was an
article that came out I don't know if it
was by one of you I don't think it was
but it was just talking about you know
there's a difference in smartphones
these days you have ones that are for
text tech geeks you know they want the
2.3 Snapdragon 800 in a in a cell phone
or you know the other people that just
want something wants something that
feels good in the hand and that can make
a call like I mean my wife I asked her
what do you want you want this with this
spec she's like I don't care i just want
it to work but i refuse to get her an
iphone but other than that but you don't
pretty much how it's how it's split up
to is just you know the the phones that
are built for the tech geeks and the
phones that are built for the masses and
i think even though i haven't held one I
haven't reviewed 1 just watching and
looking at all the reviews and watching
your review Michael and stuff on just
seems like they really nailed it with
the Moto X and hopefully one day maybe
pick that pick that one up I'm not
really concerned about the custom
ability just kind of you know that with
what they built it for I really think
they nailed it you know and I think
there's no question about it I
completely agree and it's good to know
you and I are in agreement there this is
the phone that is built for it sounds
like you're why every man yeah the every
person and I think if guru Google puts
the ad push behind it that we've heard
they're going to I think it'll do very
well yeah yeah but I will ask for your
score though let you off well I think in
the aspect of what I just talked about
with it being produced for the mass
market and getting the you know it's not
for the techniques I think it's I think
it's a nine a nine I like it but Ben's
where I like you because you qualify
your remarks so that you can take some
of the heat off yourself in the comments
I like that there's a tactical mind it's
good strategic work no really a nine out
of 10 that's that is a solid score and
I'm sure we will we will have others and
Benjamin really thank you for for
calling in again we love love talking to
you and well hopefully we'll see on the
next one yeah thank you I'll take care
and keep I keep doing what you guys do
you keep me entertained for sure well
give we'll keep trying you keep watching
thanks a lot man yep see you guys take
care well Taylor you got that score down
nine out of 10 for the moto x yeah we're
getting some real work done here people
this is nice i like this yeah what are
we doing are we averaging these at the
end i don't know / down I don't know
we're flying by the seat of our pants
wear robes dude it's Friday alright what
we're crazy it's crazy uh Taylor it is
your turn to select the next participant
all right um I'm so bad with names
what's so bad you're not as bad as I you
can take comfort from the fact that I
will always be better at worse than you
at for enunciation all right okay um is
a gesh I guess Jer Jer I don't know how
to pronounce your last name or your
first name for that matter I I had
forgotten to we've spoken before we
bring your microphone off and tell us
how wrong we are or back on and tell us
how wrong we are on your pronunciation
there oh it's all right i want to change
is for a while but i haven't gotten
through know what how's it pronounced
now just so we can we can call you know
it's it's you're pronouncing it well but
i'm looking to change the since it's so
awkward people would say understood well
we will we will just say hello and
welcome to the you review yeah welcome
back yep get what you give are you you
do backing off right so yeah what device
are you here to ask us about today I was
interested in uh the Lumia because I am
yeah I recently sold my HTC Titan there
was a witness on Sanford any device and
I was very interested in getting windows
8 device and I saw your review from the
80s the the Samson so I decided to get
it and I've been really impressed with
Windows Phone 8 so far good see i was i
was very terrified for a second i
thought that sentence was gonna go I saw
your review for the t VES and I bought
it and I hated it why did you score it
so high so it happened they have the
device oh yeah there you go t vas there
it is that is the very unit we reviewed
yeah so guess you used to like the deity
message is treating you well yeah it's
it's the Kasai I was playing around like
on my job with a Lumia 920 while back
and I fitted it against an s4 and I
don't know it's even though it's dual
core it's just so fast and smooth I can
you compare it to any android phone yeah
that's Windows Phone 8 for you unless
you've got something really wrong with
the hardware it's gonna be smooth no
matter what so it's yeah yeah neglected
to ask you did where are you calling in
from I'm Holly from Holland okay island
yes we're getting we're hitting all four
corners of the world today that's right
I love these things so guess you are
thinking of jumping to the 1020 sorry I
don't mean to burn your five minutes
here yeah like um of course i just
purchased it at CES so i'm probably
going to get the one of the Lumias when
it when it gets a little cheaper i just
wanted to know does the extra two
gigabyte of ram which it has does that
make any difference in speed compared to
wonder so why don't I'll jump in and
then Alaska large phone 8 devices I'll
ask Taylor if he agrees or disagrees me
here that the two gigs of RAM on the 10
or 20 provide almost no no difference in
in day-to-day responsiveness we're where
it really assists I think is in the the
pro cam app which is a very very very
heavy title and we were doing I think
you were here for the for the for the
test but if I can go ahead and lock the
camera on me there yeah like press and
hold on the button we wait for the app
to load finally the camera module is
ready and here we are and now we can we
can take our shot and then in between
shots it's saving a 34 megapixel and a
5-megapixel so it takes some time now
we're ready to shoot again and with the
UI elements the way they are with the
just how heavy this app is I think this
combined with the gallery the smart
camera I kind of thought I think that's
why they threw the two games in I it's
not for day-to-day responsiveness I mean
it feels like a 920 in normal use it
feels like in a TV s it feels like any
other windows phone 8 device all right
yeah the only other I guess benefit from
having an additional gig of ram is the
ability to have more apps in memory
obviously but I haven't really noticed
any sort of improvement there from any
windows devices with one gig yeah
because there's a hard stop isn't there
like a multitasking launcher there's up
to five cards isn't that right or
something yeah so you don't get a huge
boost in anything from that and if you
back out of a nap if you hit the the
Windows key it's gonna close it anyways
well the bad kids yeah there's there's a
there used to be you know it used to be
easy or it used to be complicated but I
understood it like in Windows Phone 7 it
like the back key would close the app
the home button would suspend it and
then they were just canceled but now the
the behavior is different now and I must
admit I don't fully understand it
because I don't need to as just putting
my regular user hat on because windows
phone 8 works seamlessly enough most of
the time I don't need to understand the
multitasking i wish i had more cards in
the multitasking view but anyway yes i
return to your question guess it's it's
it's just like another Windows Phone
device in that regard I've been back on
oh go ahead I don't yeah go ahead I have
a guardian I'm sorry how big are the
images that are stored like they're so
there's two files I like the small one
end and the big one like 34 megapixels
like how is that fill up the internal
memory cuz and I have any expansion yeah
well I the the smaller images the five
point three megapixel images are about
one to two megabytes let's say your your
most elaborate pictures on your five
megapixels they're going to be about two
megabytes if not a little bit over that
the 34 megapixel images are going to be
about 92 I've seen upwards of 12 so just
depends on what's in the shot but it
does get pretty pretty large up to 12
yeah you did no one writes per image
like I've aggressively manage your your
gallery like I go in every now and then
and I like will to tap a bunch of photos
that I don't want i'll just get
out of there you can use the windows
phone software to do it with a cable and
stuff like that but like doing that
often but you really want to keep an eye
on that because on the review unit I had
it just oh my god I filled that I didn't
fill it up but I probably was pushing
twenty-five to thirty percent of total
memory consumed just by pictures after a
week of course i was taking like a
hundred photos a day but you know what I
mean yeah I'm gonna go look in mine
because I haven't really deleted much of
anything yeah so I guess it and you're
right that's not expandable you know you
want to make many liberal use of your
SkyDrive account and that kind of stuff
to make sure that you don't fill up the
phone with with everything so it's yeah
I wish there was a 64 gig version but I
think that's gonna be exclusive to
telefonica my thumb I've used about a
third of my storage I'm at 10 gigabytes
used of 30 yeah so and and I have
deleted some pictures yeah just because
I I'll sit outside or at night and I'll
sit there and you know tweak exposure
times and all yeah like I've got a whole
rose in my gallery where there's like 18
photos to get one like okay one because
I've had to play around so much yeah
guess before we ask for your score any
any final questions on the 1020 that uh
missed you well I've been I think I'm
pretty well informed i also will i don't
know if i can do that but i also wanted
to ask like one question about the z
ultra's display shirts i also own an
xperia z myself the screen epson improve
but I heard like that the new Z ultra
has some kind of journalist technology
or something for screen yeah so it's
it's improved I can't do a correct
comparison because it's been months
since I reviewed the Xperia Z and all I
really remember about that phone was
contrast was really low and viewing
angles were absolutely horrible you hold
you hold the phone at any sort of angle
and it just turns white so uh and and
you get the same effect on the tablet Z
it's got pretty pretty terrible viewing
angles and this one is not that much
better it's a little better I can hold
it and I can see I mean the viewing
angles are better
but you can definitely you definitely
lose visibility when you you angle it
but other than that the the display is
is better this one is the hspa+ model so
it is running with the Mobile BRAVIA
Engine 2 instead of the X reality
technology so the software update should
not it probably won't arrive before I
said over the phone so I don't know if
that will change anything galley so the
phone as it is the display is is just as
great as the Xperia Z's display in all
the good areas because that that display
had good color reproduction with the
Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2 and it was bright
and it was crisp this one is about the
same so it's not a huge improvement cash
since we just touched on the on the
Xperia Z ultra will will stay confined
to the 1020 and ask you for your final
score before we kick you out the door
with thanks yeah um final score that's
hard I think based on my experience with
Windows Phone 8 like just like well
performs plus the Attic value of like
the best camera you can get on the phone
I think I would give it a nine out of
ten simply because I think if the is the
most powerful in the phone you can buy
right now yes indeed I don't think
you'll find anyone will dispute that
unless they really need a removable
battery or micro SD and then they've got
your phone and certainly you can't
discrete on the camera so 9 out of 10 is
only a tenth of a point away from what I
gave it so I have no choice but to tip
my hat to you sir all right yes thank
you for joining us that they were really
appreciate it and it was good to see you
again thanks for calling back probably
guys yes I was really awesome absolutely
man have it have it have a great night
and we'll see you again soon all right
keep doing what you doing man all right
rice lewdly all right so I think it is
uh it is my turn to select somebody and
boy the timing could not have been worse
I I wonder if I'm kind of looking at the
ribbon down below here and yeah so
for the guys for the first half of the
show basically the down in the ribbon
was it was an old friend of mine and I
wonder he has not come back he it wasn't
transmitting video but I hope he comes
back if he comes back I'm going to jump
to him because I I've never had a call
in from someone I know or someone
outside of pocket now on the you review
and that was the first so that was
lovely but now he's gone son I have to
pick someone else and that's alright
that's alright we don't mind that um he
realized it was that old Fisher guy and
he back though yeah I want to talk to
this guy this guy from high school I
didn't like him then either nevermind
anyway I think we're going to go ahead
and and hop on over here to the name i'm
going to have the most difficulty with
and I'm sorry for it in advance Abhishek
can you unmute your mic and enjoy us
yeah I know it's a good smile there
DeadMau that says you just slaughtered
my name this is from mr. appbrain and we
recognize that drum set from from days
past welcome back to the European oh
thanks for having me against absolutely
well you are you're always welcome was
at the pocket now live with you review
that you joined last time I don't really
believe yours the bugging out live okay
is this your first time of you find them
yes cool well welcome we keep things uh
kind of light and fast on the you review
and woody just to say just to say just
sit my name is Abby shape Oh an icon
next day so it's Abhishek it's Abby
shake obviously all right that's all i
can get with my lazy america i have a
 hey give that Abhishek fell back on
here no it's I will do my best but no
guarantees i'll pronounce it any better
next time what device are we are we
calling in about today the Moto X the
Lumia 1020 or they xperia z ultra
Trinity 720 is the popular device of the
day well here it is again and I am ready
for your question or comment sir
okay my first question is that there
have been some cases i like i was
reading this report in pocket now 27
Jesus as a 1020 is not so they were
disputing the 1020 title as the king of
the smartphone camera camera segment
saying that's 80 it is better this is
better that is better just the few and
far between but still is a truth is any
truth in this so there has been there
there has been a giant wave of adulation
that has followed this phone because it
is the best camera you can get certain
on Windows Phone and pretty much on any
smartphone ever the only exception to
that really is the PureView 808 the
original that that preceded it and we
have a very enthusiastic commenter who
visits pocket out very often on comments
on all the 10 20 posts who backs up his
claims that the 808 beats the beats the
pants off the 1020 with hard data and
comparisons and it appears to my eye
that the ADA way does indeed school the
1020 in image quality yes but is it
really a smartphone right that's the
Nick runs Simeon it also three inches
thick right so this is I'm gonna lock
the camera on me for a second this is
the this is the 808 it is we know what
it looks like but just to refresh your
memory it is a monster even compared to
the 1020 which we've been calling kind
of a monstrous warthog the 808 is is a
real brick it runs an operating system
that is dead for all intents and
purposes as far as future development so
it's not a phone that anybody would buy
so it's not really relevant it's thicker
than my note 2 and the Lumia 1020
stacked on top of one another I mean
yeah that really logical right so so
there's there's two schools of thought
here one is listen it doesn't matter
what the 80 80 80 80 has a better camera
anyone who wants the most excellent
camera available is going to get a 10 20
because it runs on a relevant platform
and nobody ever really bought the 808
particularly in the States the other
school of thought is yeah but Nokia is
getting away with saying that this
the best camera ever when in fact they
really made a lot of compromises coming
from this phone to this phone so it
depends I guess and what kind of mood
you're in but I think and we'll ever
comparison coming up next week between
these two phones where you'll be able to
see for yourself some of the some of our
results that we get but I don't think
there's any question that the 808 is is
a better camera sadly yeah but I know I
read like worry about this I give me too
i know it and it's it is a little
annoying when it's like every post it's
like this you know somebody's got an ax
to grind and that's you know all right
but whatever so every check hopefully
I've answered your question to some
degree but you will have to wait for the
comparison to see our full results there
yep I guess I was just bought it because
i was thinking of in 10-20 after losing
the obstruction is my world uh we're
sorry so we sort of lost you in there a
little bit you were thinking of getting
that getting for 10-20 for yourself is
that right yes yeah but you know I don't
think you should be discouraged from
that unless you plan that's the thing
that's the danger that these comments
can can do because unless you're you
know unless you're not planning on
unless you're planning on getting the
808 instead of the 1020 it's totally
irrelevant the 1020 still destroys any
other camera out camera phone out there
I mean it you know it's it's a
distracting argument that really unless
you're fine i'm getting an 808 doesn't
make any sense who's unwrapping a
chocolate if you're if you're if you're
in the chat and you don't have your mic
muted please do muted uh there are any
questions any other questions on the
tenth one you have abhishek oh the gen
20 know what I was asked to ask you one
thing about more licks sure we have
about one minute left so please yeah the
more it now I wanna know like what do
you think of the customizable you know
the customizable look and feel good
because you actually is it actually
matter what the phone looks like as long
as it performs well is it really that
important how it looks like I think that
you have stumbled across one of the
great divides in smartphone discussions
it's a form over function or a function
over form
know how Taylor feels about this I want
to ask him but I will say yeah it
matters a lot to me i am i just said
this in an article about the LG g2 i'm
i'm a pretty shallow guy man I I like my
phone's to look good I like them to be
the color I want I don't want to be
carrying the same thing everyone else is
maybe that makes me you know understood
yeah maybe that makes me a super hipster
but yeah it do to me I'll even sacrifice
a little bit in performance if I can
have a device that looks and feels the
way i want so that's very important to
me Taylor I feel like has a different
opinion no well sort of i don't care if
everybody is carrying the same phone i
have an iphone and I carry it from time
to time probably won't now because I
have 2 1020 but um there is this thing
that people say that a phone is greater
than the sum of its parts and a lot of
that generally has to do with the design
the build quality and and everything the
ergonomics so yes how a phone is
designed how it looks its color how it
feels in the hand all of that matters to
me I had a very heated discussion with a
friend he is galaxy no he actually has
an HTC One and he's mad that he listened
to me and got the HTC one over the
galaxy s4 and he said mainly because
it's plastic and that's why it wants it
and I can't wrap my head around it so
it's really just preference exactly is
yeah I prefer a phone that if I paid six
or seven hundred dollars for a phone I'd
like one that it feels like it's worth
six or seven hundred dollars not like
someone melted down a happy meal toy and
made one out of that plastic so so I
feel like every check you you are
definitely on the function over form
side of the equation perhaps and that
the beautiful thing is there's plenty of
phones out there that have a lot of
great performance and they kind of look
like they look fine they're not doing it
much special in terms of in terms of
bills so only I'm faces only mothers
could love it's exactly right right
exactly uh so abhishek i think we are
going to have to move on but I love your
questions and I
we'll ask for your score if you don't
mind you can do just the Lumia 1020 or
you can give us a score for lumia 1020
and the Moto X if you prefer let's go to
enter Indian a plan to an 8.2 on the
Lumia 1020 did you get that Taylor yeah
very very nice and I'm sorry did I did I
hear you correctly you're not going to
you don't have a score for the Moto X at
all is still thinking about that grandma
say I actually lost my connection i got
a vice probably any demi oh sure i was
just saying i was just making sure that
you did not have a score for the Moto X
is that correct yeah I don't know yeah I
don't know I don't care about that no
problem I projec thank you very much for
for calling and thank you for your
intelligent questions as always and if i
seem to recall your brother's the
drummer so I hope you get some sleep in
between all that drumming actually it's
already past midnight is well yeah it's

like what what that's a tech blogger
ride around in technology yeah that's a
Taylor pick it up pick my job to people
in the real world is you play with
phones for a living you must be a nerd
and that's very much it aren't you glad
news and we'll work with asphalt yeah
that's why you got hung up in traffic
this morning on the way to the podcast
or two minutes I don't know it's doing
my other job you know I work for a
cement company I Drive a cement truck um
should we go with someone we've we've I
may never get I guess everyone in here
is uh is regulars just pull the trigger
buddy done mad at me all right let's do
a high octave oh I haven't talked to him
since since the live it's been a long
time not just a whole regulars and I'm
only I'm only choosing you because I
know that you're gonna ask me questions
about the Xperia Z ultra and the Nvidia
shield I also want to say hi Otto that's
a killer haircut you got there dude yeah
thanks I got it all shaved offer Club
cut I need a haircut too but anyway what
device are you gonna you're gonna please
me with the
questions about I don't know if I hit
videos shield uh-huh there's not much to
talk about there's like five games right
oh yeah there's a yellow Lumia yeah wait
a minute wait a minute wait what about
when did you get this I didn't know that
you were in possession of a yellow nokia
lumia but we came out yeah I knew he had
one because he was uh he was tweeting me
about the camera grip you wouldn't be
looking for a camera grip unless you
headed to in 20 ah nice detective work
there Taylor Martin Wow alright so we're
jeez I wouldn't expect in this I thought
I was gonna get a break for a second oh
we tell her you have a 1022 I'm gonna
lean back good yeah oh yeah so what
questions do you have anything oh yeah I
didn't wanted to like ask but have you
faced people about the UM that the
hardware side on other than the camera
off compared to other nokia phones cuz
like I uh I just spent a couple weeks
with the Lumia 925 before I got this and
I like the new me and I 25 body Utley a
lot better than the n20 well yeah I
haven't used a nokia device since the
the 909 hundred was very similar in
design I was smaller obviously but it
felt very similar it had a little more
of a rough finish to it than the 1020
I'm but I fill the tin 20 feels a little
more Hollow I don't know if you would
agree with me on that it feels like when
you tap maybe not hollow but like when
you plug it in and different things it
just feels different I can't put a
finger on it no you're right it feels
like they they knew the camera module
was going to be big and beefy it's going
to be a big meatball in the mobile phone
so they made the rest of it they just
withdrew everything possible from the
rest of it so you get this feeling of
this kind of interesting imbalance I
just didn't flip everybody off but like
there's no way you could possibly
balance this phone in anything
resembling a normal man
you know yeah so yeah I mean it's what
was he it's unique right i mean it's not
a feeling I get from anything else out
there as a matter of fact I said this in
a review but it feels a lot a lot like
holding a galaxy camera almost or maybe
even the galaxy s4 zoom not to the
degree that we're talking about here but
you know it's that I also you got that
top-heavy kind of feel going on there
but um I much prefer this I'm gonna get
out the camera but it is that by topic
hey I mean I'm carrying a camera like it
like a like a NEX and putting it to your
ear he's uh it's not that it's not that
bad so right you it's it but it's funny
like I you know I don't know if I
necessarily expected it to be to feel
quite like this i mean it is an oreo
sized thing on the back of the phone and
when you get me it's very it's unlike
anything i've held before but so i could
understand why you would like the 925
over this from a form factor perspective
yeah you know um but mostly it's the way
the the 925 just has the aluminum bat
ground around the other sides and i know
plastic on the back but because that
soft touch plastic with the aluminum
where your fingers are actually feeling
it feels right now it's great from the
straw it yeah i'm jealous you because I
you did Anton did the review on the 925
for us and I know that 925 is retail
available now but I never got one so
I've actually never handled a 925 I
should go to the tmobile store and look
at it but I I can see how it would feel
slightly more premium but the 925 to me
you turn around back on the 1020 okay
you got camera module and that's about
all you've got it maintains the old
Lumia design style the 925 seems to be
really confused about what it wants to
do with its backside you got that big
camera lens and you've got something
smaller underneath it you got like a
weirdo grill there's penetrations for
other stuff it just doesn't it looks
unfinished to me
hi was like like whatever I'm just great
I I grew it um sorry we got a latency
issue there so yeah yeah I feel like Han
toes working on like a like a like a
dial-up connection where we uh yeah we
can't hear you can't cut out you're like
I'm have you I feel like I recently had
a last week I was in New York and I had
like no connectivity whatsoever and like
I feel like it's that kind of that's
good that kind of thing is going on here
he's tethering on his own on edge or
something yeah Hatter you're like are
you on that t-mobile fogey what's going
on mom was it LTE in my apartment on my
one but not going well might be getting
okay speeds there but I think we got a
latency issue before we lose you
altogether why don't you I'm so glad you
have a 1020 because I mean your scores
are that the score is going to be
eminently more valuable in this in this
particular half hour what's up what
would you give it to zero to ten what's
your what's your evaluation there you
know um I I really ended up liking when
there's not a lot more than I thought I
would so I I like give it8 half to nine
done mmm gotta give us a real value say
I can't we were not allowed to skimp on
specificity when we put a review scores
up you gotta pick a number brother give
it somewhere between a five and a 10k
night 7 then 8 points that we're gonna
go all right points all night look at
ten-twenty is doing a nice job here tell
you got that spec down yeah I'm pretty
sure average right now is eight point
like 8.64 that man you know spoilers no
spoilers we do the math at the end oh
sorry I think so we weren't doing any
math you hate okay that's right I do
but not none them in the name of science
hi Otto before we let you go and Devin
is free to chime in on this as well any
feeling on the the Moto X or the the
xperia na xperia z ultra why can i
remember the name of that thing I can't
remember storage for five days yeah it's
weird yeah i actually just wrote a i
just wrote a little most about here is
the ultralight site yesterday hey I like
the i'm not sure that i could ever use
it because it's so big Taylor's hands i
have more handsome thing let's do a
little size comparison this is the note
2 and this is the z ultra uh yeah that's
all i have to say it is not so good it's
so man it's like a nexus 7 it really
really is it is closer in size to the
nexus 7 which i don't know if i can it's
closer in size to the nexus 7 then and
then any other phone yeah it's pretty
much the most ridiculous thing ever I
look forward to reading your review oh
you know okay I do kidding uh i oughtta
Devon thank you for joining us I you
listen uh work on that ping brother find
fun find what's going on between you and
you and our friend the cellular network
we got it we got to see a face clearly
you we had a better streaming experience
when you're in your car on a lunch break
the hell's going on over there in the
middle vain it's funny it's like waiting
for a volley just like waiting for
telegram volley times its ragu so I'd
really fun guys the pong yeah Eric
alright guys thank you for for joining
us as always I hope you have it a nice
weekend will see on twitter where the
where the info flows freely and quickly
okay see ya later don't you guys later
all right ah that was uh it was a good
time
I'm I had to when Devin always nice to
see and i think i'm going to choose
someone i have not spoken with before to
move us on we're coming up on the hour
mark so we'll go with a couple more
guests on the air here today if you're
just joining us please remember to mute
your mic on the way in and please
remember we're confining our discussion
to Lumia 1020 motorola x or Moto X and
whatever that so anything is called
xperia z ultra for though I think the
problem you're having is because you
reviewed the tablet Z you gave it up
let's see so you're willing to say like
old Rosie something what would have been
a cooler name anyway Rosie now Taylor
Dave shake it makes a really great point
in the chat that i said i was going to
lean back for that last one and then I
just come kind of like trounced your
hosting duties so yeah I got those like
10 20 and you're like smack I didn't
mean to do that I apologize uh so why
don't I would like to talk to a Gaston
and I wonder Taylor if you might welcome
him to the show yeah um agoston and i
have i've talked it he just dropped out
yeah I said his name and dude bailed um
yeah we have a check his back we're
gonna have to ask him to leave as well
oh yeah Abhishek is it is he back I
don't see him well he's not at the chair
but I don't know if he ever left oh oh
you're right oh yeah yeah okay I'll work
on that I'm just gonna go ahead and get
them going to go ahead and boot him I do
not also want to block him know yeah
that was my bad okay abhishek's gone and
we liked his input but yeah so let's see
if as our target returned he has not all
right we're gonna go with yalls Taylor
you go ahead okay so I'm gonna have to
ask you how about I ask you to select
someone and then since i'll return the
favor yeah that would be wonderful if we
could because we haven't had a lot about
it so Zack I believe as a question about
the z ultra and sexy Kelvin but walla
walla well Mike we might get to you in a
bit alright so Zack hi i have actually
questions for all three I wrote him down
okay nice
so no first question is could you
compare the Z ultra to the nexus 7 in
specs in size alright so specs is quite
simple the display is larger on the
Nexus 7 its larger with a higher
resolution higher density your battery
is larger in the nexus 7 you get a
40-something milliamp hour battery I
can't remember this one is 3050 I think
it's no no it's 3950 that's what it is
this is 3950 this is 30 50 so you get
900 million Bowers s4 pro which is
actually a Snapdragon 600 slow like the
crate there there's a dispute going on
about that but it's it's a crate cpu
clocked at 1.9 gigahertz this is a 2.2
bigger Snapdragon 800 which is much much
much more powerful LTE support obviously
this one doesn't but LTE support
eventual LTE support and same RAM and I
think that's about it on on specs unless
I'm missing something cameras 58 I don't
want to take a picture with either of
them because they're so big but nice
Thank You miles that's um I thought that
big that's an enormous phone that is
like that's that I pictures I picture
someone like me talking on this is an
ipad 2 right here hello yeah it's it's
really big and the the thing is like
there are a lot of phone applications
that won't install on the tablet Z or
not the tablet Z Z electro yeah it's
hardly there are phone applications that
will not install on the Z ultra because
it's not really a phone it has a tablet
DPI which is dots per inch I don't know
what the exact DPI is I probably need to
install an application to find out but
the DPI is so low that it actually
registers as a tablet for many
applications so Photoshop Touch they
have photoshop touch for tablets and
photoshop touch for smartphones you
cannot install photoshop touch for
smartphones on the z ultra but you can
install the tablet so there are a
lot of interesting things about it that
allude to the fact that it's not really
a phone it's a tablet with an earpiece
you think we're gonna be so I think
we're gonna be seeing more of that as as
time goes on in smartphones and tablets
like the line continues to bleed between
them and it's like some apps are
optimized for one device and not the
other I mean it's like yeah anyway Zach
sorry it's hard in traffic engineer okay
number two would be how does the camera
on the Lumia 1020 compared to a
mirrorless or DSLR camera oh that's
tough i haven't done of like an actual
comparison but i will say this the white
balance on the 1020 is very finicky it's
either on its either spot on or its way
off and the other you're going to get a
higher resolution image but that doesn't
necessarily mean it's a better image
your micro four thirds or my NEX which
is not micro four-thirds it's it's it's
own little NEX brand it's a mirrorless
cameras a mirrorless micro four thirds
or your slrs you're going to get a much
better picture with out having to adjust
your shutter speed quite so drastically
because the sensor is much bigger and
you're not going to get as much noise as
a result on their side Wow okay yeah so
you're not getting DSLR quality in a
phone but you're getting really really
close to it closer than we've ever been
before I guess is the best way to put it
difference and what would I be I'm
wondering how I'm kind of well not
really in the market for our fur because
my dad will not buy me one cuz I'm not
you know okay don't need to explain that
but anyway um yeah about and also is the
Lumia 1020 good for me because I'm a
heavy google user i use google
everything i've got three gmail accounts
I works works really well with with
gmail but if you're using other Google
services keep drive hangouts Google+ if
you're using all of that stuff it's
probably not the best choice unless you
have an Android tablet or something on
the side so if you're a heavy google
user windows
one is not for you and that's why I'm
struggling to really use it full time
because i use so many google services
okay and this is my last of three
questions it's the motor of X worth it
for a power user so yeah sag the Moto X
is getting an undeserved reputation for
not having enough cojones to run some
some really cool stuff but you know I
will admit I haven't I'm not a heavy
smartphone gamer so I haven't loaded
this up with some crazy like 3d gaming
title but it performs well in ice storm
and performs well an ice storm extreme
this is a custom chipset it is not know
it's getting a bad reputation for kind
of no reason the display even though it
looks small because the device is petite
is actually 4.7 inches it's 720p if you
have a problem with 720p as opposed to
1080p it won't be the device for you
really I know man it's it is a solid
solid little phone and I'll take you
know I would I would be hard pressed to
find somebody who's need exceeded this
phone's capabilities it's not what I
would think of as a power user device
because it doesn't have micro SD it
doesn't have a removable battery but
those things aside it's a capable little
little guy and I I will look forward to
seeing how it does in the real world
yeah but is it worth it for the price
like spec surprised it's gotta work off
well you gotta remember the the price is
inflated partially because it's
assembled here in the United States if
that means something to you then you'll
you'll pay a little extra for it at
least that's google's hope yes could you
get did you get a phone with equivalent
specs for the same price on contract or
better specs absolutely you can it's
just a question what you're what you're
really shopping for graduate again it's
the phone is greater than the sum of its
parts which warrants a larger price so
it's it's not necessarily specifications
alone granted I feel that there should
be some sort of price cut because it's
using older technology at least in
chipset GPU but that aside I think the
price is justified okay um I don't know
if there's anything else to say
they're definitely exact we have to get
some input from you brother we need
we've talked about the 1020 we've talked
about them all actually give us a score
or meet one of these if you will from
one to ten okay xperia z ultra um oh I'm
thinking maybe for me since it's um way
too big for me I mean that thing is the
size of my head I mean like I mean it's
a third of that it's more than a third
of an iPad and I would be I don't have
my kindle fire out from last time but uh
Rick I am it won't charge a brief did or
something that's fine its type in
totality anyway it's like almost that
size but anyway I'm but so experience
the ultramarine 7.8 or eight has amazing
specs um and then the same question I
talked about the nexus 7 so i will
mention that's a nine-point-oh at least
and what about one of the 10 20 and
there and the ex um the 10 20 and I
dreaded an eight-point oh and then X
maybe seven point eight or eight
somewhere in there say which one is it
that's uh yeah pick up n it down for us
um I'll give it an eight okay so I've
got eight eight eight across the board I
already ate across the Boston plus nexus
7 even though that's unofficial but that
I'm reading at a nine all right Roger
that all right well we got the scores
mark down Zack thank you for joining us
really appreciate it's nice to have you
on and uh and thanks for hopefully you
got a smart phone soon yeah charging
that's my charging i'm convincing my dad
it's not the real good bring him on next
time we'll talk to haha skin serious
will convince him no no I don't want to
that don't get involved and I'm kind of
getting I'll gotta get even thank you
for having me Zack thanks for joining us
again we'll we'll see you next time hey
take care take care Taylor I think I
think you and I are down to the last
guest on the show we got to close this
one up so would you care to right a
wrong that was made by technology a few
minutes ago
yes yes agoston I sorry he told you
would you disappeared can you hear me
now yes oh yeah we can hear you welcome
to Tori guys I have a phone that I have
to answer and if it rings I have to go
and it just rang in the same second so i
will be shot and if the ring if the
phone rings that level and so but that
my question its own philosophical
question okay so yeah i was reading your
interim and it was about you know the LG
g2 with the stat dragon 800 coming in
the picture and you know this is your
work and this is my human interest and
hobby but I sort of start sensing that
these new devices coming out with
greater and greater specs they don't
influence me the same way anymore you
know I feel that when the HTC One X came
out that was magical even the older
phone was that magical but you know then
the galaxy s3 but now just like Wonder
super device follows the other and you
know I feel that this the spec sheets
and the improvement of them is pointless
so the direction must change and so I
have two questions one is do you feel
this in your in your everyday work and
the second question is if you want to
relate this to one of these phones
having my baby related to the Moto X
which is a phone that doesn't want to
you know do the spec for so long honk
that you know maybe the next new thing
is an all around its own that's can do
everything you know yeah that's
wonderful I that's a what I would
normally call it a pretty broad question
and statement combination but it's
perfect for this episode of the show
because
we're sitting here with three devices
that run the gamut and we're sitting
over three devices that try to overcome
that obsession with specs right we have
the Lumia 1020 which is built not to
impress on the spec sheet but to blow it
out on the camera and it largely
succeeds it has the best camera you can
find on almost any smartphone and then
we have the Z ultra with Taylor there
which is just the biggest baddest of
everything that doesn't necessarily mean
it's optimized for anything right but it
also it's got some interesting aspects
to it such as I believe it's waterproof
right yeah I pity ip55 and 58 dust
proofing and water resistance yes okay
so yeah so you've got that element to it
and of course its sheer size is
ridiculous but it is doing something
different and it's light and thin and
and there's that aspect to it and then
we have the moto x which you know as you
said a ghost on its its refusing to play
the specs game it's saying listen we're
gonna cobble together a whole bunch of
disparate elements to create the
experience that we want to deliver and
we're going to focus on a couple
different things so um you know I think
that to answer your first quarter your
question first and Taylor well I'll ask
him to chime in on this yeah it's scary
to see the spec war is just kind of
becoming all about what's on the sheet
and it's like oh yeah yeah this is just
another processor a couple bumps and
gigahertz and there were three gigs of
ram well that's that's exciting what the
hell do I care right that's scary
because it this industry is is not in
danger of becoming boring but if it
keeps going in that direction I mean how
much how much more entertaining can kind
of pissing match really be so I think
we're sitting here in this episode
though three examples of phones made by
manufacturers who understand that they
have to differentiate based on stuff
other than them specs so I'm hopeful I'm
left hopeful with these three devices
for the future not scared of it what do
you think Taylor yeah I'm kind of to the
same point as a Gaston I'm uninterested
by a lot of new devices if you followed
my stuff recently you know that I'm not
really excited about the LG g2 I wasn't
excited about the s4
I was a little excited about the HTC one
and it didn't necessarily play the spec
game as hard as others for megapixel
camera being part of that whole
reasoning behind the HTC One these the
ultra I love big phones that's absurd
the Z Ultra is absurd it's too big it
the specifications do nothing for me
because it's above and beyond what I'm
ever going to use so I realized a long
time ago maybe six months ago maybe a
year ago that specifications on modern
smartphones then were above and beyond
anything I'd ever need mm-hmm that's one
reason I still carry the note to
specifications aren't the greatest but
it works it does what everything I
needed to do the that's why I want the
Moto X its effects aren't great but it
does everything that I needed to do and
above and beyond touchless control to me
is amazing I haven't even used it and I
can't wait to because it's something
that should have been done a very long
time ago my phone should listen to me if
my computer can so should my phone you
know and and there's this whole thing
all these manufacturers and Motorola was
spot on and saying that smartphones are
more powerful but they're not any
smarter than they were two years ago
three years ago they're not yeah um so
though the manufacturer making a phone
contextually smarter than previous ones
without improving the horsepower or
what's in under the hood by all means
you get my I don't know kudos yeah sure
I'll look back from me and Motorola is
the the prime example of it because and
I should have actually led in with that
in August and you know they basically
said well you said they said and when
what Taylor just said is that phones
have been getting more powerful a year
after year after year but they haven't
been using that power intelligently and
until you have a phone that understands
where it is a lot and understands what
situation it's in an is contextually
aware it's it's it's not going to be
impressive it's just going to be
impressive in the same way that a muscle
car is you know or you know like a race
car in terms of speed and all this kind
of stuff and
yeah I I really do think we're starting
to go in the right direction but I think
other manufacturers have yet to key into
that can I make a parallel that I didn't
want to make but I will and the allergy
it's kind of like my car I don't want to
talk about my car all that much but um
everybody gives it hell because it's not
the fastest car ever it looks a lot
faster than it actually is and that's
the truth a car was not designed to be
fast the car was designed to be fast
around a track to be able to be fun to
drive it was about the experience and
that's one reason I like a moto x for a
long time cars were about having the
most horsepower being able to launch
faster than anything else and just
putting as much crazy nonsensical stuff
into an engine and launching it off the
line and hitting 300 miles an hour but
then you come upon a turn and you can do
absolutely nothing but slam on the
brakes and it's kind of that I don't
need a phone that just can absolutely
just blow the doors off everything I
want something that can be fun to use
and it's all about the experience so I
quit caring about horsepower in cars I
quit caring about clock speeds and
phones and more about experience and and
how those manufacturers optimize that
experience and what's in the phone I
think that pretty pretty well sums it up
there and agoston are we are we in the
neighborhood of what what kind of
response you were looking for you you
got us into philosophical mode and I
fear that we talked your ear off no i
think i think very good answers and my
money commented on XM e fails to be this
at least when i meet your camera
devaluations i think that you're wrong
yeah i cannot disagree the camera on the
hardware side that camera should not
have been a compromise and it is it's a
delight to use in software but the
results as you saw our middling so that
I agree that's that's a very
indisputable failure so it but you know
aside from that what's nice is that
there are people out there who just need
to take a shot that they can put on
Instagram and put a filter on it and
it'll look pretty good and you know it
will work in that regard I'm not that
person though so for me it would be very
difficult for me to carry the Moto X as
my daily driver because of that
underwhelming camera so you're right and
that's a point we don't remember as
often when we talk about its cool
features and I thank you for the
reminder even though it makes me a
little sad yeah the camera is probably
the most disappointing thing about that
phone yeah Julius I'm saying how nobody
really manages to make that perfect
android phone take the the iphone I mean
I know it's not discussion but really
it's like a Taylor said no good at
everything really good at everything I
still don't know my some issue comes in
no you're right and either there's
always some some form of compromise and
and yet so is it's always difficult to
wholeheartedly recommend an android
phone to a wide swath of people i mean i
recommend android phones all the time to
people i know and my friends and some of
that but it's tailored because of my
knowledge of what they use it for you
know people who want a lot of features
are going to want a galaxy s4 people
want a aesthetically beautiful device we
want an HTC One you know etc but you
know the Moto X it gets very close to
being that phone it's like oh it's the
android phone for everybody but it's not
because because of that cameras you're
right but uh we do have to wrap it up
august and so I want to ask for if you
would be so kind as to contribute your
your score and we now have enough scores
for all these devices so you can pick
the one you want to score I assume it's
gonna be the Moto X though okay but
actually yes well I want our gift here
Maksym eight and had without the summary
page instead yeah my seventh on quest
I understood well that's that's an 8 out
of 10 and that is a that is a solid
response is a little higher than I then
I thought you would go I feel like I get
the impression you're being a generous
generous guest it's true uh-uh eigersund
thank you so much for calling in and
where are you coming in from today okay

you wait two months for this one but I
do want to thank you everyone is
currently here and everyone who's
already signed off before we go Taylor
how are we looking on the scoreboard
have you done any mathematics um I did
some earlier i'll need to update some
numbers for the 1020 but the xperia z
ultra got two votes series the ultra got
to two amazing votes and what what are
we ate and ate we lost your audio by the
way or maybe i just because i started
typing am I done I my back your back the
Z ultra got an eight out of two scores
that is hilarious I really thought more
people going to ask about that and maybe
we do we just didn't get to them but
alright well the Moto X got three I got
an eight and eight
I in which puts it at like a 8.7 yes
sounds Snowbell right sounds like it's a
bad in the neighborhood right 8.3 I was
wrong 8.3 oh yeah it would been 8.37 it
for nine and nine and eight but uh you
know why aren't steely-eyed missile man
and NASA good I always double-check
measure twice cut once right yeah that's
what zipcar tells me but the other way I
measure once and cut twice yeah and what
about the 1020 how we looking there uh
do maths you have to do maths yeah right
well Taylor Martin doesn't maths I'm
gonna let everybody know where to find
us on the internet that is going to do
it for us today right as soon as Taylor
gives us the score follow us on social
media Taylor is at casper tech i met
captain two phones as always you can

through into the weekend thank you for
being patient with that as we waited
through LG and Motorola events and if
you have a question a topic a suggestion
for the you review email us at you
review at pocketnow.com one of these
days I will get to checking that inbox
and Taylor do we have a number yet yes
we do and the number are we looking at
10 20 is eight point eight point five
six six six six six six so 8.66 on the
Lumia 1020 so what is that lumia 1020
8.6 moto x 8.3 Z ultra 88 well we have
generous viewers and generous reviewers
and that's that's so nice so guys let us
know like I say email us you reviewed
pocketnow.com do you like the numeric
scoring we appreciate you doing a little
bit of work for us as we head into the
weekend so thank you for joining us and
