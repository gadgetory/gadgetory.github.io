PocketNow com android on the HTC hd2 has
made tremendous progress thanks to the
guys at xda-developers let's run the
heretics e boot loader and i'm going to
show you how far it's come its really
remarkable let's get to it all right and
here we have the nexus one boot
animation and it's going to go into
android 2.1 in just a minute okay and
here we are and this says welcome to
nexus one we can skip this wizard by
doing for presses in all four corners of
the screen so here we are this is
android 2.1 working very well the
internet is actually working i'm getting
four bars on AT&amp;amp;T so i can use the
cellular data i can also use Wi-Fi i can
even make calls but most of the time the
speaker doesn't work so that kind of
makes it pointless so i can swipe to the
right it's updating the widgets i'm
going to get on the internet in a second
so that we can actually go to some
websites and the live wallpaper works
perfectly it's really amazing so let's
go into the phone application and i'm
going to dial a number and i'm going to
press call and what you're going to see
that's going to dial out but you're not
going to hear anything that's let's wait
just a second here okay so right now
it's connected and you can't hear
anything if i put on speaker nothing
comes through so that's one of the
biggest falls but almost everything else
works so let's go over to Wi-Fi and turn
on the Wi-Fi radio and then i'll connect
to my wireless network and the internet
works and applications work and its
really really close to being done here
so i'm going to dive into settings and
connect to my Wi-Fi network this is very
much further than it was last time we
checked on the the the status of android
on the hd2 i'm gonna type in my password
here alright and i'm connected i'm going
to jump into the browser let's let's go
to a website we'll just go you can see
it's working we're going to engadget
and it works and click on a link see the
accelerometer works and it does very
nice very good a lot of these buttons
over here work to to action on Android
we can go into the market set up a
google account let's go back home go
into the application tray look around at
some of these programs here the widgets
work so you can go to a blank screen tap
and hold add a variety of widgets
different clocks very impressive to see
Android working on an hd2 almost so well
that you could use it on a regular basis
it's not registering the battery up here
so it's it's closed it's not there but
it has come a long long way from where
we saw it previously I'll put a link up
on pocketnow.com on how to get the
latest build of android 2.1 for your HTC
hd2 that's it for now thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
