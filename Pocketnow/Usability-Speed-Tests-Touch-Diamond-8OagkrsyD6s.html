and we're going to try some usability
speed tests on the touch diamond with
the latest 1.93 ROM touch diamond uses a
new touchflo 3d interface with a sliding
panel so we're going to see how that
works in these abilities speed tests
first test is going to be starting from
off and switching between email contacts
and calendar app patients so here we go
where do you go this calendar contacts
email now that was kind of cheating
because these panels don't really show
full emails it's just previews in the
context of just favorite contacts so
let's do it again with regular windows
mobile ready go
and
alright
so a lot of finger movement going on
their next test is opening a third-party
application that's not on the Start menu
shortcut keys any of that now buried
within the interface so here we go ready
go
artists
next test is opening a web page favorite
so let's go back to the home screen
ready go
and now Stern's load
we don't care about the load speed
because we're on edge and out those
speeds vary so much but there you have
it not too bad next test is finding a
specific artist we're going to go with
Weird Al Yankovic and play music from
that artist so from the home screen
again you guys start there where do you
go I missed it
nervous next test in this is a new one
is we're going to add a new contact so
back to the home screen this is going to
be a little more difficult because
there's no menu here for new contact all
right ready go
uh-uh
stay
network
and there we go
less tests going to be creating an email
to that contact we just created started
from the home screen here we go go
and it's
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
