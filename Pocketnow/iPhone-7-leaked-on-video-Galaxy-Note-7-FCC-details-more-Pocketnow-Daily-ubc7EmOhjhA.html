what to expect for the iphone 7 Samsung
has already begun its regulatory
approval for the expected galaxy note 7
and deals for the ZTE axon 7 continued
to sweeten the pot I'm hi Mary vetta it
is Friday I am loaded with meds and now
I can't drink how am I supposed to go
about this this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you are in the market for an iphone SE
and we actually recommend that phone a
lot US cellular has the phone right now
for two hundred dollars prepaid yeah I
know we didn't get the number one two
hundred dollars obviously the catch here
is its US cellular it doesn't have the
best network in the world but man for
two hundred dollars that is a steal you
can learn more than like in the
description and after ZT really
surprised us with the price tag of the
axon seven four hundred dollars for
pretty much the same phone you get with
the galaxy s7 guess what the company is
sweetening the pot with a few deals one
of them particularly again in the link
in the description you get some monster
and plus over the ear headphones Valley
out of a hundred dollars if you preorder
the axon seven I know I wouldn't think
about it I actually really really liked
that phone and we can not wait to tell
you more we review for those of you that
have asked us why don't we use verizon
phones mainly because we can't really
switch around their phone number because
cdma kind of locks it into that and
that's the case for verizon and sprint
but this is rather interesting as we've
got news today that verizon is putting
cdma to rest it's not happening now but
set your calendars for the 31st of
december 2019 by then cdma is going to
say kaput and it seems that LT is going
to be the way to go and we also know
that 5g is coming it falls over the l
team that work on another spectrum we
can not wait to see how technology
evolves over time I was will the
spotlight over to Samsung we cannot wait
to see the Galaxy Note seven at
Samsung's event on August second but we
noticed that the company is even
certifying an unlocked variant today we
get documentation from the FCC we really
can't confirm specifications or
design yet from those documents all we
know is that there is an unlocked
variant also being approved so yeah you
have that option apparently that unlock
variant works on all four US carriers
but then again the carrier barons
apparently will have something specific
for each carrier that we cannot wait to
confirm and finally the very hot news
today have to do with the iphone 7 we've
got a seven-second leaked video terrible
quality by the way but it shows us two
variants of the iphone 7 that apparently
are fully assembled we see the apple
logo this time which in the back was
still cut off we see the camera modules
we see the speakers there is no
headphone jack it seems that that is
going to be the case with the iphone 7
definitely all these rumors are pulling
to be true and let's face it the phone
is actually not ugly at all but then
again that is my opinion let us know in
the comments down below what do you
think about this video what do you think
about the phone is it enticing for you
or not I actually like it but I'm more
inclined to go Plus this year for the
first time ever mainly because there are
significant differences according to
rumors leave us a comment down below
