in a while and it definitely shows so
for me getting the Huawei talk band b2
in my review queue was kind of an
impetus to start caring about my fitness
well so far that I can help myself but
that's another story
I'm Jules Wong with pocket now and here
are a few thoughts about the b2 what it
does what it doesn't and where we go
from here
exercise tracking is the raison d'Ãªtre
of the talk band b2 it's especially
helpful to quantify what my commuter
biking does or what the heck all that
walking idea is worth having a device
provide that for me is quite motivating
until you dig into the numbers first of
all the step counter on this thing
doesn't feel accurate I know I know I'm
turning into Stephen Colbert preaching
truthiness here but from my experience
when I'm actively tracking my steps when
I take one or two of them the BT logs
them down as two or three there's no GPS
on the band so it doesn't convert
distance traveled in two steps and while
I would understand that I have a wider
than average gait if there are reasons
as opposed to just one reason to ask for
my height I would want it to account for
step length also the talk band undercut
my biking session what the b2 says was
16 minutes of cycling was actually more
like 35 well - live shooting for the
video yeah so there's doubt about the
way it tracks my exercise but also doubt
about the way it tracks my sleep because
it can do that and while the lengths of
each session seem to be correct I'm not
sure about how the light sleep deep
sleep break down to work let's get back
to what hallway does with the data here
and for its part there isn't really much
you connect your phone to the band via
bluetooth download the huawei where app
and from there you have your exercise
and sleep plotted in charts and
timelines
you can modify step goals as well as
adjust when the band notifies you to get
up from your sorry Duff all day but if
you want more context than that you'll
have to connect the Huawei app with the
up app from jawbone
which is promoted prominently at first
startup now if you want to incorporate
the jawbone philosophy of gamifying
Fitness in addition to the whole
tracking your trends thing and whatnot
I have nothing against it I just don't
have any friends I know of that are into
this tucked away into a corner of the
huawei fitness app is another
third-party app connection this one to
My Fitness Pal it's primarily a food
diary and calorie counter powered by
Under Armor and while I do want to
consider using this app and more
disappointed at huawei for not
incorporating more of these two apps
functions into its own app rather than
having to rely on them
Samsung S health this is not and it
makes all this health mindfulness more
of an inconvenience than anything else
lastly the b-2s main branding is talk
band so there has to be some sort of
headset use there and there is you can
take calls or make them but you have to
go through your phone for me though it's
mostly used for streaming radio getting
the most volume for your ear requires
choosing the right earpiece but the
quality is pretty good though you still
end up having to press the module into
your ear in louder environments like the
subway but to be honest for the mixed
uses that this device is intended for
I'm perfectly content with this
performance the b2 still tracks my
exercise while I'm listening to another
public radio big athon and in a way
having no wires to worry about not even
a little bit that other bluetooth
headphones have well it's liberating
and those are my first thoughts on the
fois we talk band b2 we'll be logging
some dedicated days of exercise and
bring you more information soon in the
