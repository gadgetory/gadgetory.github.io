over i'm anton dino I'm hi Mary vera and
let's go through the things that we
liked and the things we didn't like from
the show so the first thing I liked was
Sony's the Sony Xperia z2 and the sony
xperia m are great devices but i'm
really hoping that the xperia z2 which
is pretty much the xperia z1 fixes my
main concern with the z1 which was the
camera quality of course we have the
same ruggedized built the same aspect
larger screen smaller bezels it's a
phone which I like but I'm not sure I
want to get it until like I address my
main concern which is chemical now tell
you this much from the guy that reviewed
the Xperia ZL man this display on the z2
is gorgeous it is in your face gorgeous
you know even if the angles were bad I
just liked it so much that I would love
for this to be my next finger happy to
see that Sony is continuously improving
on its display starting from the good
old Z back in the days which had a
minute display yeah we're working there
they're working their way up the z1 how
to grade this parade the z1 compact
about a better display and now that z2
and even better triluminos and yeah even
in the case of the tablet Z 2 we're kind
of disappointed at the fact that it's a
low resolution tablet but you don't
really get a lot of rugged tablets out
there so it would be a good option for
you to buy later on up next let's talk
about nokia we never thought we would
hear stephen elop say android you need
an only say android he launched three
phones running android now this is a
fork version you saw the hands-on videos
links in description for details we
never thought we'd see this and it's
really interesting because according to
nokia this is the platform that's going
to make people reach windows phone which
is something i really don't understand
right Tony sandragel hell
nokia and microsoft through the services
bundled but what i did not like and
maybe because my expectations were too
high based on the rumors we have heard
there was no Lumia announcement I was
really looking forward for a high and
Lumia device I mean mwc is nokia and
microsoft of course we had the windows
phone 8.1 announcement but we really
wanted to see that that maybe last big
bang from Nokia saying that this will be
probably the last noumea which we're
going to do before the microsoft take
over and it has this this and this but
instead we just got the ashes and the
exes yeah this was pretty much an entry
level event and again so far we are
really hoping to see if Nokia is going
to give us more Android and higher end
devices even though they said they
wouldn't again the XL was not that bad
but you'll get have to see it for
yourself and then there was LG we heard
about the jeep Road to the follow-up for
last year's optimus G and the
competition for last year's no three LG
pretty much announced the phone with all
of its features before the show we had a
hands-on actually their booth is close
by it is a good phone that is a fast
phone but is it really a competitor to
the note 3 I mean it tries to be phablet
but it's missing that single point for
multitasking which turns the phone into
a phablet
stylist I know it kind of reminds me of
Huawei for example we saw their mediapad
x1 it is probably the tablet phablet
that probably everybody wanted because
yeah it is a 7-inch tablet that's made
in his bones form factor it's a really
cool device but then again we still need
to see more credibility from huawei but
it comes to build quality when it comes
to the design of their UI we saw the
same with ZTE again most of the updates
that we got today were just updates a
lot of iterative updates and probably
probably why way was the only one that
did something out of the ordinary with
the talk then be one or with the media
paddocks one but yeah these some of
these Chinese companies need to step
their game up a bit when it comes to the
high end sector of form factors and
everything and we do hope to see you
know why way at least succeed with the
media paddocks one I really can't wait
to get a review unit of that one yeah
and also ZT who is actually blows by the
head there grand memo to now ZTE is
trying to focus on the mid-range gburg
phablet market we've seen recently to
boost max yeah on boost mobile in the US
and the grand memo to is just it's just
that a mid-ranger phablet
HDC also has a palette which is a
mid-ranger but I mean I know you talked
about yeah but I want to give him a full
segment just for them all is he I'm
gonna be very specific about HTC if you
saw our video intro we didn't even talk
about HTC we knew that we had an event
but we were not expecting them to
announce anything honestly we knew that
they have their march twenty fifth event
and you know I'm gonna be very honest
with you I am very wowed by HTC and I
haven't even seen the m8 I'm expecting
about this desire age 16 this is
actually the first time that I desire a
desire ever since the desire HD so many
years ago it is a phablet it is a big
phone but there is nothing cheap about
it even though the specific Asians are
low it runs KitKat and remember kit kats
designed for low specifications the
phone was beautiful sadly we couldn't
talk about the UI for specific reasons
that he asked us but you know if this is
the desire 816 if this is the mid-tier
phone man can you imagine that m8 unless
you're at that person who hates the
iphone 5c because the desire 816 has the
same polished shiny plastic on the back
then in that case that's not for you you
have to else it's an excellent bone he
had to be honest with you i think the
desire existing was a great way for hcc
to say hey wait up build up the
anticipation build up the anticipation
because this m8 is going to be hot and
we all want HTC to survive guys the
pocket pc ecosystem was born out of an
HTC partnership almost 15 years ago we
want this company which pioneered the
industry to grow and yeah this is kind
of the HTC that we were hoping for even
though we
we're gonna get much and we actually did
and finally for the hottest tickets of
mwc 2014 I have to say it the galaxy s5
was the hottest thing here not
necessarily because it is hot meaning
it's actually just an s4 with another
back cover and a couple of extra sensors
but it's going to be the hottest phone
of the year Samson's got the marketing
power of the marketing push and they're
going to sell millions of these phones
actually sad to say this because i feel
that samsung could have tried harder but
then again we've been bashing samsung
for years about so many gimmicks I loved
Michael Fisher's recent editorial he's
like wait a second guys this is actually
what we wanted we wanted a samsung with
less gimmicks and better focus on things
that actually matter they kind of
delivered what we were asking for I
guess we were just looking for a better
looking device how about you Tony in my
book the s5 and disease you are really
the two hottest things because if you
take all these specifications on paper
I'm not talking about the looks on paper
to z2 is actually the better device if
it's looking better or worse than the s5
that is completely up to you so
coming back to the s5 I really think
that we have to somehow not fall into
the trap of bashing Samsung because of
the rumors which have amped the
anticipation which has have grated the
buzz we've heard about those two K's
greens and whatever cameras no yes
samsung with the s5 is doing whatever
they want to do they need to do for
their specific audience those who are
fans of the brand of Samsung and it's
got the same looks yeah it's got a
ruggedized build it's waterproof it's
got a heart rate sensor it's got a
better specification than the s4 so i
think that the s5 is a great device may
be the only one that the topic this year
would be the sony xperia z2 and ever HTC
will do next month yeah i like the z2 as
well but anyways that is a super
question of this video what was the
hottest device for you which one that
you like the most from our 50 videos and
the museum's i had a lot of morally
still got more videos coming up but
leave us a comment tell us which one did
you like the most do you agree with our
opinions are not in our case again the
z2 would honestly be the hottest phone
even though it looks so much like busy
one but this is a comment down below we
can't wait to hear from you some more I
want to specifically thank everybody for
