analysts already have some recommending
to go crazy on Apple stock HD has
already begun to tease something to
squeeze from the HD see you 11 it seems
that Huawei and elbow are considered the
most aggressive OEMs of q1 I'm Jaime
Rivera and I do believe that Ferrari
should reconsider the edition of this
particular branding this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals those of you in the market for the
LG G 6 which is one of the smartphones
we most recommend this year there's a
very good deal at B&amp;amp;H where you actually
also get an LG watch style for $650 and
the watch style for those of you that
are not looking for a very bulky watch
it's a very good option and it also
works with all those Google bad so
anyways you learn more in the
description also of a spotlight over to
the IDC the company has now provided
insight on how smartphone OEMs are
performing and this is very interesting
even though Huawei Oppo and VEVO are not
at the top these companies are
considered the most aggressive the
reason why is because if you notice
Samsung and Apple for example there's
very little growth in these companies
whereas in q1 in the case in particular
Huawei opal and vivo each have no less
than 20% of growth that is crazy and it
should just paved the way for what to
expect very soon now let's start about
Apple's WWDC which always happens in
June those of you wondering what we're
getting we're not getting the new iPhone
most likely most likely getting a revamp
and Macs but interesting we've got some
trusted sources claiming that Apple is
also working on a speaker that it
actually ties into the whole reason why
Apple acquired Beats Audio the fact that
they also want to make a smart speaker
to use Siri people to LexA let's see
what we get and speaking of Apple this
is rather interesting Anna Lisbon really
you know recommend that investors buy
Apple stock last year with the iPhone 7
neither did a with the iPhone 6s they
all predicted that these phones were not
going to sell well and that was the case
well not so well but not to break the
same records it turns out that analysts
are now telling investors to buy Apple
stock like crazy B's apparently it's
going to grow up to 30% that's a big
number so it means that the iPhone 8
could be a great phone let's see what we
get and finally the very interesting
news they had to do with a little teaser
that he just published on its you 11 by
the way the U 11 is not the official
name it's the one that we're all
assuming we're going to get and
apparently in this ad the company is
teasing that it's going to squeeze the
question is squeeze what is it going to
squeeze the bezels over the excessive
space that we got on the you ultra or
could it be that the company will follow
the ad and will squeeze its brilliance I
have to remember that the company's ad
many years ago was quietly brilliant so
could it be that that's going to be the
case that's debated in the comments down
below what do you think that HDC means
what do you think that we're getting
with the U 11 that's going to squeeze
any sort of brilliance in my case I mean
HTC has always been brilliant about
design but didn't prove it that way on
the U ultra so let's see what the
company is up to we'd love to know what
you think in the comments down below
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
video was filmed follow us I'm backing
out our comment hit that subscribe
button down below for more videos like
this one it also follow me on Twitter
Highlanders quarterly that aren't into
the ground a tiny memory that please

what you saw I am hi metric that I think
so much for watching we'll see you next
