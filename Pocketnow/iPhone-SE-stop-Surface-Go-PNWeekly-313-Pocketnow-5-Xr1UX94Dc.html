was sure that said like zero and then
and then I made it okay okay take this
can I start over I guess I should I'll
just say it out loud and and we'll see
what happens okay ready Microsoft came
rip warned ready this week with a small
convertible tablet that starts out at
399 unfortunately unlike an iPad if you
really want to take your computing
somewhat seriously you're going to need
to spend upwards of eight hundred
dollars on a surface go does it makes
well sort that out and look into the
five camera trend that seems to be
cropping up for the future plus a lesson
on case design why if you don't care
about the blockchain you should probably
care about HTC and the impending death
of the 4-inch iPhone again all this and
more as we unfold the week's news and
then get a bit of dust in it and then
make the keyboard not work but at least
the keys are quiet and the chipset is
updated I don't know what do you expect
from the MacBook Pro it's the pocket now
weekly episode three one three recorded
on Friday the 13th of July 2018 this is
the show from pocket now in conjunction
with xda-developers that delves into
everything that moves and is technology
from smartphones as tablets and
wearables it is the stuff you probably
couldn't make up even in your wildest
imaginations as a kid i'm jules wong
news editor at pocket now joined by
editor-in-chief still anton d nudge
hello together morning good afternoon
good evening everybody good to be here
how are you I'm doing just well if it
wasn't for that little flood that I did
on the technical side here but hey we
apologize we all make mistakes and we'll
live with them I apologize too and we'll
just move on from that how was your week
by the way my week was busy but that's
nothing out of the ordinary although my
weeks are busy but it's been an exciting
week but I can't say this much I'm glad
it's over or it's about to be over
because as soon as I hang up this
hangout I'm gonna be out of here you're
gonna have dinner you're going to be out
on the town it's gonna be great anything
just to get out of the office indeed
definitely a busy week for us here as we
make the transition obviously you've
probably seen the posts by now that we
are working with xda-developers in a
very obviously synergistic capacity here
so sooner or later you'll be seeing
changes they're gonna be for the good
and both of us are gonna be a part of it
to lead on the transition and and it's
gonna be a fun time I guess
exciting at least at least yeah it's
gonna be the base level exciting and
then who knows what will happen after
that so a lot of stuff that we want to
talk about this week and we encourage
you to chime in as well
I have phones over here that have
Twitter on them and we want you to speak
out on that social platform using the
hashtag P and weekly P and weekly is the
hashtag you're looking for comments on
some of the news of the week and again
if you happen to be on emails if you're
not listening to this live at noon on
this particular day
well fine and head on to your email
clients and then go to the podcast at
pocketnow.com and just ask any question
you want
we'll try and see if we can answer it so
lots to look forward to and in the
meantime we shall start off with the
surface go so this happened this week
cuz it happened on a Tuesday night I
believe a hardware chief Panos Panay of
Microsoft kind of just leaked well not
really leak because it was official but
just put out little pictures videos
everything about the surface go which is
what he says to be the smallest
lightweight surface yet of course I
think he said that about the surface
laptop it seems like everything is
getting smaller you know just more
miniaturized this is seen as the iPad
competitor here or the Chromebook
competitor as opposed to the surface
laptop which was 999 dollars not euro
dollars and this is going to be kind of
a well it has the Intel Pentium Gold
processor which is a good step up from
Celeron and it gets and the everyone was
yeah the m's yeah yeah definitely
but there's a lot of interesting kind of
catches that you have to look forward to
especially what I'm talking about
a 399 base price here because well first
of all the base part the base model has
four gigs of RAM
but the storage here 64 gigabytes
that's emmc if you upgrade to the one
with the 128 gigabytes that's an SSD and
that's certainly going to give you
faster performance and memory and it's
$549 and that's not even to say that you
don't get the type cover which they're
heavily promoting and you don't get the
surface pen those are separate costs
just like if you get it with the iPad
you get the Apple pencil for $100 you
get the covered with the keyboard for
$130 and it's the same thing over here
so if you really want a pretty okay
computing experience with the surface go
you're looking at $800 ish
so um Tony I just want your kind of
first blush first reactions to all this
I'm trying to make a sense of why this
product exists why it's out there and
I'm I'm having a hard time figuring it
out because there is the surface which
is the most the pros which is the most
the more powerful unit and whether it's
tablets or the laptop version it doesn't
really matter and then we have this
lower end entry-level ish model which is
indeed cheaper but as you said if you
add a keyboard if you add the storage
option which is the SSD version with 128
gigs you're pretty much up in the $800
zone and it's it's running Windows
version which is the s-1 grant that it
would be upgradeable to Windows 10 home
but for $900 you can get a MacBook Air
which is a full-fledged computer with a
more powerful processor so I guessing it
all depends on what you want to use the
device for if it's some lightweight web
browsing some emails or maybe some
multimedia then absolutely if you're a
Microsoft or Windows fan you can go for
that and you can even save a hundred
bucks off of the MacBook Air but if you
want to do anything more serious not
that the MacBook Air is such a powerful
computer but I myself and mr. Mobile can
probably testify we
have rendered lots of videos of MacBook
Airs and V until until his one blew up
four years or three years after doing a
lot of video editing stuff it really
held his ground so and trying to figure
out what exactly is Microsoft Microsoft
strategy here who are they targeting
because it doesn't seem to be neither
the simplest kind of device to compete
with Chromebooks it doesn't even seem to
be the kind of device to compete with
full fledged computers it's an
in-between product and I guess that
that's that might be its niche
well I think it was a particularly bad
week to be announcing this especially
because we got word last night from
Bloomberg that they're working on or at
least Adobe is working on Photoshop
full-fledged Photoshop for the iPad
which kind of takes away more of that
air that the surface co would have in
making the argument to lightweight
computing which I mean well does this
really mean that Apple was getting in
the right sense of marketing its iPad
with like what could be what computer
what's the whatever that girl was doing
on the bus and whatnot and then kind of
making that kind of glib claim as
something as it might be I am I am
trying and and so far I've succeeded but
I'm trying really really hard to not
compare a computer with the iPad or the
iPad with another computer because at
the end of the day the iPad powerful as
it is with the powerful and strong
ecosystem of apps that it might have it
is still a tablet it is still running a
mobile platform and Windows 10 whether
it's an S or Home version or Mac OS it's
a desktop operating system so
limitations are there of course for the
iPad due to its operating system there
might be some limitations on Windows s
as well but in my mind they just don't
compete so I wouldn't compare the the
newly newly announced the surface go
with the iPad I will
compared it against the the MacBook Air
or or something on though along those
lines really that may be that may be
something I mean Chromebooks I guess
would be the other branch of things
especially as we see a lot of push
towards enterprise or education fleets
deployment what is this
provide Android is also getting its app
games up and they're becoming more fully
featured as well yes sure true again but
with a Chromebook correct me if I'm
wrong I have not used one and isn't your
operating system basically isn't your
your device basically booting off of the
web it's not putting off of the web it's
it's its own contained device but it's
really all the family relying on the web
yeah except they've really taken the
integration with Android apps pretty
seriously so if you run them off your
local storage of me and that's totally
fine
and that's kind of their way of cheating
into an ecosystem I guess then I guess
there's your competitor for for the
surface go it's grown books on one end
and it's the MacBook Air on the other
head interesting well we'll definitely
want to see where this goes and if the
sales kind of even out between that kind
of I'd like to hear from listeners where
do they think this product is is
situated what's Microsoft targeting with
this product because it can be a
poor-man's laptop and it also can be a
poor-man's iPad it's it's for me it's
not really clear yeah it's not really
clear to me either
especially if they're taking the Apple
route of accessorizing and additional
cost
so definitely chime and hashtag P and
weekly on that we'll get to your
comments in a little short order
in the meantime staying with the
Microsoft theme we are gonna talk about
the surface phones a glass a dram but a
slash whatever and it's only in terms of
sentiment here because I mean I don't
the story is that there are 15,000 are
fans that are writing a petition for
Microsoft to keep this secret project
alive where I mean renders have pictured
it to be this kind of switch-like thing
just Nintendo switched like thing where
you're able to combine two screens and
then turn off one and then have the
other one turned into as like a work
surface where typing and whatnot but um
well the fact is is that the story is
that 15,000 people have signed a
petition and uh so this fan base is
really really weird in terms of mobile I
think there's always been a concern or
at least an insistence that Microsoft
needs to have skin in the mobile game if
it wants to compete past the second
decade of the 21st century and this
they've been trying so many ways so many
times they've done it through many
iterations of its Windows Phone platform
they've left behind a whole bunch of
people along the way just because you
know they didn't develop bridges between
the version you know from mango to eight
from eight to ten some of them want some
of the phones weren't gonna be supported
on the way up and some of them some of
them in making the transition to the
Windows 10 mobile were promised to make
the upgrade but eventually did not get
that grade and there was also the whole
debacle of acquiring Nokia for its
hardware and devices services and that
didn't end up going well they wrote off
the whole investment so I'm wondering
what these people see in Microsoft that
I don't necessarily see as strange to
use your words as strange as this
fanbase is I think they deserve our
entire respect and Microsoft's respect
which is in the first place because if
it were in for
or whatever's left of this so-called
fanatic fan base for a mobile platform
which its maker killed Microsoft
wouldn't have had half of the success it
had a couple of years ago so there's
that but on the other hand everybody has
moved on from from Microsoft's operating
system on a mobile even before Microsoft
officially killed it off because they
entered the game late there was this
entire conversation back then whether
Microsoft is late to the game and there
were any saying they were they were many
hoping that they are not as it turns out
they were late to the game but that's
not what got them to lose at this game I
think that they made some some decisions
some strategy decisions which got them
to this point they were trying to a
completely different approach and oh my
god yes
Windows Windows Phone the the original
version Windows Phone 7 I think with the
live tiles was a great concept but then
again along the way it just they didn't
necessarily manage to keep up with the
demands on the market and it's a circle
back to et or Microsoft Nokia analogy
yeah Microsoft managed to acquire Nokia
but not yet didn't manage to to save
Microsoft so there's that I don't think
that 10 15 or even a hundred thousand
people would be enough for Microsoft to
actually manufacture a product or to get
back into the mobile game I do think
that the the market still needs
Microsoft as a player but Microsoft I
don't think is willing to play again at
least not as in terms of software OS and
hardware maker they are really really
still deep in the game with with
collaborations with with Android
manufacturers on their services
Microsoft is pushing their services
really hard now whether that's Outlook
or word or the entire office package for
for mobile but I don't think we'll soon
or ever
well let's never say ever but I don't
think we'll soon see Microsoft a key
player again neither in the in the
smartphone manufacturer nor smartphone
mobile operating system game
would be cool to have a phone from
Microsoft again especially if I'm
looking at the renderer right now
the Andromeda it really resembles the
I'm not sure which model it was the
Xperia which was the the foldable Xperia
back three or four or five years ago ZT
I think has something similar it would
be cool but I don't think that it would
self enough to justify its existence
maybe you know very limited supply would
a huge price tag attached to it just for
bragging rights but other than that
still commendable effort from people who
are still supporting Microsoft I think
just the cap off the past here that they
made Microsoft at least ambitious
one-time moves that were not supported
by a sustained software development and
support and that was really just
unfortunate for the ecosystem in general
and it didn't really work out for them
so moving forward I mean everyone is
working on convergence
even though Apple is kind of the you
know Dark Horse and saying that oh we're
not gonna merge iOS and Mac OS together
they're still kind of working strange
behind the scenes as evidenced by the
Photoshop rumors for iPad and there's
also Google which is working on its own
thing that was formerly called Andromeda
OS but is now kind of I forgot I forget
the name of it fish' fuchsia and it's
gonna be this multi form factor kind of
thing that can form fin so Andromeda OS
for Windows yeah is said to be going to
be the same thing just multi form factor
windows full-fledged
power wherever you go so I mean it makes
sense but it will be a couple years at
the very least I would think - before we
get to that point so if we ever if we
ever do it sometimes if you like it
feels like we're going so fast we're
kind of like the Road Runner and read
easily do a whole bunch of little tiny
progressions like bezels and whatnot but
we don't really take a
look at the big picture that often and
sometimes it feels like we're kind of
like the background does it move and
we're just Keaton we just keep running
up the stairs and it's like there's no
end in sight but eventually we'll get
there I think that that Microsoft has
been aside from the fact that they had
those decisions which got them to where
they are now I think that they or
Microsoft's competitors let's say that
Apple and Google and if we talk about
device manufacturers all the rest
whether it's ham song LG Huawei you name
them they're so far ahead that I don't
think that there's anything Microsoft
could do at this point they had they had
like what when was Windows Phone first
launched 2012 2013 somewhere around that
they had five years half a decade to do
something meaningful which leave it up
to a point still not enough to catch in
several regions double-digit market
share but it's it was still a starting
effort they should have built on that
but now after they completely gave up on
the approach and they took a step back
if they are missing from a game for for
a year or two the gap would be so so big
that Microsoft will not be able to just
Bridgette it's like a boxer who just
sits back home and eats pizza and drinks
beer for six months and that his first
match the opponent is just fit and in
best shape I think Ben Folds wrote a
song about that I'm not sure if you've
ever are familiar with his work no but I
will definitely look him up I didn't
quote him but if that's a quotes then I
will give credit for credit you well
it's it's good music in any case let's
talk about the iPhone se in the iPhone
10 a couple of analysts here from
bluefin research say that they're gonna
cut Apple is going to cut production of
the iPhone 10 in iPhone se at some
points to make way for the new iPhones
for this year and from what sounds like
it doesn't seem like we're going to get
a continuation of either model
iPhone 10 that's the stock here and
again an iPhone se
a two-year run I guess you could say and
it just served we talked about sequels
for the whole like from all the way from
fall up until maybe like a month ago
and I think it was me yeah things have
fizzled out from Alex are the case
manufacturer because they always seem to
have the inside track on these sorts of
things and they say that iPhone se 2 is
not going to be happening so unfortunate
for those fans that really wanted an
updated version of the 4-inch iPhone I
guess kind of maybe it's not right to
say let's do a post-mortem but what do
you think the legacy of the 4 inch size
at this point while I have the utmost
respect for or for all analysts I have
never trusted analysts I don't know why
it's it's just it's just if the problem
is with me not with them I think they're
a bunch of people who are just defining
on something and claiming knowledge of
something just like us granted we've
been doing this for 10 years and closely
monitoring the industry analyst or
analyst anyways I think it makes sense
for Apple to kill the iPhone se because
apples habit of releasing a new
smartphone every year makes last year's
phone obviously a cheaper option and the
other phone which was a two-year old
phone now so for instance in this
particular case the the model from 2016
will become the lowest and the cheapest
phone having an even cheaper se phone
granted in a four inch form factor no
longer makes sense because if you look
at the entire market right now I don't
think that you will find many phones
which are 4-inch big 4 inch small you
name it I think that we are now at a
point where the standard is pretty much
getting closer to four point seven and
above maybe five plus so
any people who would probably use it and
buy it but once Apple draws a line and
they make their calculation it probably
makes a lot of sense for them to say ok
we're not going to sell hundreds of
thousands or millions we're just going
to sell a couple and it makes no sense
for us to just hold an entire production
line captive because of a unit which
might or might not succeed so we're just
going to free it up use it repurpose it
for something else and maybe ramp up our
production yields to support production
for whatever model is selling best and
for the iPhone 10 there were rumors I'm
guessing it will pretty much be certain
at one point soon that the iPhones hand
will not have a sequel in its current
iteration as we know the iPhone 10 which
you could make sense because the iPhone
sent was a anniversary edition an
anniversary release the next iPhone will
probably take a lot of design cues and
elements from the iPhone 10 so there's
that there's that that means that the
iPhone 10 as expensive as it is now will
become even more expensive once
nobody will produce it so if you will
have next year a top-notch iPhone 10
it'll be a lot more expensive yeah or
you could just Apple could use that as a
paradigm shift for their design and just
make everything kind of that weird
design that they had with the notch and
and the super Retina display and whatnot
so aside from aside from our our own ex
colleague Juan Carlos Wagner who really
was the only person enjoying the iPhone
se I haven't seen any in the wild as
strange as it may sound I've seen people
with very very small hands even ladies
with even smaller hands use iPhone 8
pluses at one point I even made a joke
that the iPhone 8 plus screen size is in
many cases as big as their entire head
but I think that what I'm trying to say
is people are no longer looking for a a
small device they're looking for a big
device because number one they're
consuming a lot of media they're
consuming they're watching a lot of
movies streaming YouTube Netflix they're
there showing off their pictures and a
bigger phone speaks for maybe a bigger
ego I don't know
[Laughter]
we're getting get in trouble with the
people's small hands and big no III was
I have huge hands and I was using the HP
veer so there it couldn't get any more
awkward than that well I was about to
only just mention someone's name who
rhymes with Ronald dump I'm just not
gonna I'm not gonna get into that so a
couple of comments from the hashtag peon
weekly on Twitter I do want to give a
shout out Peter Hagan says do you want
to give a shout out to Tony and Jules
for getting through this week you have
both done a great job and I will
continue to support PocketNow in any
capacity I'm able to do a transition
like this is rough but all my thoughts
are with you thank you for that usually
report says what I cannot understand is
why call it surface for the surface go
up until now the surface was a more more
like a premium product so it seems
Microsoft wants to take down wants to
take down on the mid-range market but I
don't see what good this does to the
service name I think it kind of did
values it in the sort of sense or well
maybe if because they had the surface 3
for the longest time and that was kind
of the entry level to the market but I
don't remember any kind of critical kind
of really take downs of that device it
was just it served its purpose and just
I'm just happy to see that then we are
not the only ones not understanding what
Microsoft is trying to do with the
surface because this is kind of layers
on layers of a surface or the space
surface device like I feel like the
surface name encompasses a whole
experience yeah lock in stock and this
doesn't provide it so yeah the correct
if I'm wrong but I think that's surface
as a brand as the word as as Microsoft
first used it didn't refer to that huge
touch capable table which you are able
to interact with either via touch
placing stuff on it wasn't that the
initial surface and then we went into
the surface computers and the surface
thingy on a wall that did come first I
think it was the surface big ass full
table yes yeah yeah totally it's I'm not
sure whether it was called a surface hub
or something else but nonetheless it was
a surface it was a surface a large
surface literally so yeah well we'll
have to see how the surface co develops
and if consumers will take to it at the
very least so talk more about that in
just a bit in the meantime we'll take a
break here and tell you a little bit
more about one of our sponsors
the PocketNow weekly is brought to you
by LinkedIn jobs now you probably know
LinkedIn as a networking site that helps
you connect with colleagues references
and potential employers but if you're
one of those employers looking to hire
the right candidate for your specific
position why not consider LinkedIn jobs
after all seventy percent of the u.s.
workforce is already on LinkedIn with 22
million professionals looking at new
listings every single week and all of
them are already sharing the skills
experiences and geographic reach they've
gained over the course of their careers
why not put that data to work for you
hundreds of thousands of businesses have
already posted their positions and they
rate LinkedIn jobs 40% better than the
average job board for getting them the
person they needed actually you might
just find someone that you would have
otherwise missed elsewhere and if you're
not with LinkedIn jobs already you don't
have to miss out get $50 off your first
job posting by going to linkedin.com
slash weekly that's linkedin.com slash
weekly for $50 off terms and conditions
apply welcome back to the pocket now
weekly and we have a little bit more for
you in terms of the phone side of things
I know we're kind of going into
the well the middle of the surf of the
phone and tablet space phablets more
than that I'm not sure but and then we
also talked about the death of a phone
and I really want to encourage the the
mobile industry to keep on living at
this point so why not have five cameras
on every single phone that you produce
just the thought so last week I believe
all right maybe a couple weeks it was
there was two weeks ago yes because it
was the episode on which I was here and
I have such an issue because I will have
to probably just repeat everything I
said two weeks ago about the LGD forty
but nonetheless it's an interesting
conversation one that I'm going to pull
out the script for you and you can just
read it off right there so we're talking
about the gout cs10 even though the
galaxy note 9 has not been released yet
and we're gonna just say it
and the biggest bouncy s 10 variant will
have five cameras three rear cameras and
two selfie cameras of course we we have
less of an idea of what that was
that's gonna be about because we had
some sort of reporting for the LGV 40
which is supposed to be out this fall
where the we had an idea that maybe LG
was gonna do its usual kind of wide
angle and then super wide angle for the
back and then do some sort of
stereoscopic facial authentication for
the front and with over here we mom we
don't really have much of an idea there
- selfie cameras maybe one of them was
gonna be wide angle and then the three
on the back is I well they say they're
it's gonna be the zoom wide and it's
super wide but and because we saw I saw
the p20 Pro review or the in-depth
camera photographers guide from Adams
Elaine and he found that the 41
megapixel sensor
or whatever it was was really just the
best all-around camera sensor that he
used and I agree I have to agree the
sensor didn't really you know do its job
the best and then the regular kind of
monochrome sensor was didn't really do
its job too well or at least I mean I
guess Adam would sort of characterize it
differently but you know that's the
takeaway I got from this so it all
depends on whether or not samsung gets
its gear together and makes each sensor
the best at what they can do
I just just to be very very clear in my
opinion I still don't think that it
makes sense for Samsung to release three
Galaxy S models even if we're talking
about s S Plus s Pro regardless of the
name beyond zero beyond one beyond two
not that it wouldn't sell because
Samsung is at a point where regardless
of what they put out just like Apple
just like there are there are not so
many companies which can pull this out
but Samsung and Apple can pull this out
if they would have probably five models
they would sell like hotcakes as well it
doesn't make sense in my mind from from
a strategic point of view from from a
product family point of view I touched
up upon this and I talked at length two
weeks ago so I'm not gonna reiterate
this but again I was wrong before so
don't take my word for it I'm just
saying that in my opinion that makes no
sense but let's just play with the idea
of having a pro or plus or whatever you
name it five camera phone again I can
only say what I said two weeks ago if it
makes sense if that added camera brings
value to the customer brings value to
the user then sure please slap it on and
make it do some wonderful things for you
but just don't add it for bragging
rights because every component you add
to a smartphone dramatically increases
its price point and phones in 2017 and
2018 have already
come so expensive of course they bring
tremendous value to your life now
nowadays you can basically live off of
your phone but just don't add something
which will further increase the price
point if that something will not bring
value to your life and when it comes to
cameras of course we all love our
smartphone photography but but I don't
think that maybe instead of just doing
one extra camera for I don't know one
added feature or a single feature
whether that's zooming in or wide-angle
or anything maybe invest in something
else battery life or any other feature
which a user could find useful on a
day-by-day basis because the camera yes
of course you use it daily but how many
times do you actually use a specific
mode of the camera or a specific lens in
the dual or triple and setup so that's
that's just my two cents on the front
it's okay it makes sense whether it's
stereoscopic four for phase detection or
for extra added bouquet effects that we
so much love because we all love our
beauty shots with bouquet effects
especially from a selfie perspective I
can't live with it without it I'm sorry
the yes it's it's a natural evolution
it's an extra level you should know what
really young man say what you rewrite
here pouring up my soul to you guys
seriously face recognition is indeed the
the next step we are heading towards
that Apple kicked it off he was not the
first one but they made it mainstream we
had the iris scanning we will have face
mapping of course that's definitely
doable but others have done it with a
single camera as well so I'm not saying
it doesn't make sense I'm just saying
that please guys if you do this if you
add five cameras or six cameras just
make them useful everything is an
adventure reality man everything is
gonna be five cameras six cameras and
whatnot I think I think it's going to be
why there's a you know trend of the year
things that doesn't get carried on into
the next dimension well I've got an idea
of whoever whoever's a smartphone
manufacturer because I know that they
all listen to our podcast just slap a
single 360 s against it
60 camera on your smartphone and boom
you got it you've got front you got back
you've got left you got right you got up
you get down there you have it you solve
the problem I wonder what that would
look like and what like a feasible
design would be for that kind of thing
if just copyright and Trademark my idea
and just give me I don't know two cents
on a dollar two cents I'd own that's a
pretty reasonable royalty rate yeah I
think that that'll do good all right
deal
all right let's talk about well let's
talk about an anecdote here let's talk
about cases let's talk about the one
plus six so it's one of these little
went off stories on reddit that seems to
have gotten a lot of traction in terms
of the one plus six and that involves
the nylon case that you can get with it
and I was actually talking with one of
our PR relations with a PR
representatives excuse me over at
one-plus about the story here and it
starts off with this guy who got a one
plus six recently has always had on in
that nylon case that looks pretty snazzy
with it we saw a little bit that with
Jaime Rivera showing off the red colour
last week and it looks pretty good and
he's only had about a few days he's let
he he has a daughter and you know how
kids always seem to get their hands on
things and then sometimes you know they
drop those things and things happen
after that but you know you would figure
you would figure with a case on at least
that covers the full surface of the back
that it will probably protect the glass
back of the oneplus 6 from cracking well
after what three drops you said the
picture that we see on the rundown here
or at least on this story which you can
get onto the rundown at pocketnow.com
but the story here is not pretty we got
some spider webbing going on some
chipped glass coming out of there and
you know the design of the case comes
into question here because it there is
not like a full but it's a full blown
per case but it's it doesn't cover the
buttons because I mean they could have
installed like proxy buttons where it's
like a plunger and you could just like
you know press the plunger in order to
press the button and whatnot but there's
actually just negative space instead you
know where the crack originates from
that little bit of negative space
between the volume rocker and the glass
that really it's like really annoying
really like just horrible and I hate it
and well I guess there's always a lesson
to take out of this because even with
cases like you know there's always that
debate of naked and case and whether or
not you use either or go with either of
lifestyle but like your expect for a
case that this would be okay that this
would you know you'd be able to get some
protection out of it and but I mean I
don't know what do you think because I
do have a the follow-up to what the
original poster of this said I'm trying
to do phrase this in a way to which
would not offend people but I'm I'm not
going to be the the likable guy now and
I'm probably going to play the devil's
advocate a phone is not a toy a phone is
also a thing especially nowadays which
breaks easily so I'm not trying to point
fingers or put the blame on anybody but
just how many times does your kid need
to drop your phone in order for you to
no longer give it to him or or for you
just put it one shelf higher so the your
kid cannot reach it I'm not saying that
that it couldn't happen it could have
broken at the first drop what I'm saying
is that these phones are not meant to be
abused especially since the trend
nowadays is is glass and we have an
editorial on the on pocket now written
by Nicholas gray about how he's tired
the glass back phones and actually when
when we we played along with the idea of
running this editorial I asked him okay
why why are you so much against
against glass backed phones because he
broke his glass back
HTC as well and I told him that yes
glass breaks glass is birth is pretty
but glass breaks I personally have not
dropped a single phone in my life but
that is me but at one point where you
are spending so much money so much
dollars euros you name it on a on a
phone you'd expect to take more care of
it now I'm not saying to just put it on
the table I never use it but just don't
don't drop it don't throw it around and
especially if you do have a kid you
might wanna Chur buy him buy him a phone
if you want your kid to have a phone in
its early ages I wouldn't give my kid a
phone until he would be probably almost
14 15 16 years old because I really
think that that's not what kids needs to
do but if you decided that your kid
needs or wants a phone just buy them
either a rocket phone or something
really cheap which he can toss around
just cherish your your flex your toe
that's my two cents I'm pretty sure many
of you you will not agree with me but
this is my strong belief that it's it's
the users fault if this would have
happened I don't know because of
overheating while charging or a design
flaw
yes but any phone made out of glass if
you drop it once or twice it'll break
and there's no case on the planet that
will probably save it save for the smart
phone airbags which I've seen that were
invented like one or two weeks ago
yeah that's an awesome invention but
that's that's the truth act of it even
if it's even if it's an aluminium phone
it'll get a dent it'll not break but it
will still look ugly or maybe a couple
of other boxes I don't know like yeah a
couple of them but like I agree that I
case is not an insurance policy you
don't get anything back from the company
just because you were able to break it
with the case and yeah I guess you know
there's also the reasonable use kind of
parameters that we have to look at oh it
dropped like a couple of feet because
you know the child's from a couple feet
tall or and it just happened to hit that
kind of area where that kind of cracking
could happen like there are a whole
bunch of factors here
but the fact is is that no case bats a
thousand there there is no 1/2 percent
guarantee in terms of the hardware
physical kind of protection for that
kind of thing unless you actually go out
and say hey insurance provider I want to
pay you this amount of money and I
expect you to give me something back so
if I ever break it so I definitely agree
it seems like the original poster
definitely agrees with that acknowledges
his position in terms of getting a
repair which I believe the quote was
$80.00 and that's not including shipping
and handling all right trying to do that
for your iphone and see how much oh yeah
all the way oh but I mean you could just
keep the case on all the time after all
it's just a design thing the internals
were not harmed the he got a display
protector which again kind of goes into
what we're talking about in terms of
hardware protection but still the the
display isn't correct internals are fine
and it looks nice with the nylon case so
why not just keep it on all the time so
I mean everyone will have their kind of
philosophy on this I encourage you talk
to us hashtag P and weekly because this
is kind of the everyday hust sort of
thing that we kind of go into whenever
we're buying a phone and it's like hey
what how should I live my life with Mike
and there's there's always the the other
side of the coin the other side of the
story I have had plenty of phones in my
life because I'm a reviewer but I also
love tautology and I always always
always on the phones which I have
purchased myself from my own pocket use
cases because number one it offers
protection when you drop it it might
survive don't rely on your case to save
your phone when you drop it but it might
survive on one hand on the other hand
keeping your phone in a case will ensure
that next year when you want to upgrade
or you want to sell it your phone will
be amid top-notch can
and your resale price will be much
higher than what you get for a phone
which is all jacked up on the back or
cracked or scratched so for me that's
also an investment air quotes decision
thinking long-term that if I have the
iPhone 8 plus now if I keep it in a case
maybe next year if it's in mint
condition I need to just put a little
bit more towards it's to buy the new
model than if it would be completely
ruined but I understand that not
everybody is like me and I understand
that for some people a phone is really
just the phone so there's that Andrew
Wallace says well I'm going to stick
with my aluminum 8 9 long yes yes yes
great that's always always kind of a you
know glib responsive again it's a valid
one because if you if you look hard
enough you'll find something else that
you'll want in the phone marketplace so
hey I mean good luck to you if you're
looking at the marketplace right now in
2018 but if you should be able to find
something hopefully let's move on to our
final topic which I know everyone has
been kind of dumping on and so I just
wanted to tackle it just because I
wanted to do the whole devil's advocate
thing in terms of defending HTC because
I think since the start when they
announced this Exodus this blockchain
phone I was making the case that they're
not viable as a mainstream smartphone
maker there's only so far that they're
able to act as an ODM because Google now
has all their hardware engineers that
they need and they probably won't be
coming back to HTC to continue giving
them money so this if there is anything
that they want to try it's gonna have to
be something that differentiates them in
some way and be it this via a blockchain
phone be it a 5v our phone which has
been kind of hinted at a couple of times
I feel like the specialist way is
something that's worth trying it and
worth seeking at the niche audience if
they can the blockchain is kind of a
harder argument to talk about here
because people are very dismissive of it
they don't understand it and it's just
like anything if you're talking with
your child and they start talking about
the latest trend you probably won't
understand it but it's still a valid
thing because like in the past several
months we've seen the blockchain used in
China to keep a copy of a manifesto from
a sexual assault victim at a Chinese
university and in a society where in a
government where the government is very
censorship heavy and was able to scrub a
lot of the references of that sexual
assault case against against the
allegations against the teacher the
story survived and so that's one way
that this whole blockchain thing can
still work out and even though we're
talking about a lot of these typical
cryptocurrency crypto kitties which
they're partnering with to kind of up
the appeal of this thing this probably
around $1,000 phone I mean it's there
there's some importance to it I think
it's a you should be encouraged to look
at some of the stories maybe a couple of
podcast about box chains explaining what
it could do and explaining virtual
reality for what it matters because who
knows because these are emergent
technologies and if they're going to
have increasing role in our lives which
these experts advocating for those their
standards say they are then well you
should probably at least take the time
to not be afraid of it that's my take
what do you think I I was I was hearing
your your words and I'm not gonna say I
didn't understand everything you said
but there were some things I didn't
understand and if I found it's funny
that you mentioned the younger
generation kids and the older generation
barons fathers in this particular case
it shows that you're like 15 years
they're younger than than I am because
you're so much into this I need to be
into this because this is my job but I'm
just trying to imagine a scenario that
you need to explain or a kid needs to
explain his dad what blockchain is
anyways I think it's it could be even as
simple as like some of the McDonald's if
you go to you know you know at fast-food
restaurants they have the start starting
to incorporate screens you don't go up
to counter anymore and some people sort
of have trouble with dealing with the
screen so there by the way this this
episode is not sponsored by McDonald's
but we are but we are welcoming them if
they do want to getting back to to the
serious topic the issue the HDC I think
that HDC sadly and I I say this in all
seriousness I'm really really sad that
HTC has lost its compass I really feel
that HTC is a shadow of what it was
years ago and that they're really
desperately trying to do something
meaningful and I really think that going
with a niche product will not be the
proper decision to save the company in
the smartphone business I think I don't
have a major in business I don't claim
to have any knowledge of how the market
works if you are a smartphone
manufacturer but in my mind
you can become meaningful if you do a
product if you manufacture a product
which sells volumes now if you're if
you're limiting your options from the
get-go and you're coming up with a
product which is addressing only a small
chunk of the audience granted I think
that there in the article you mentioned
there are about 30 million blockchain
users that's even if each and every one
of them would buy an HTC Exodus it still
wouldn't be meaningful in the grand
scheme of things when Samsung and Apple
sell huge volumes and even LG and Huawei
and ZTE and so on so I think that having
a niche product like this would make
sense if it goes in bare or as an
alternative to a product which is a
flagship product in the top even five
which sells volumes so
yes granted but correct me if I'm wrong
and this is a question to you Jules or
to anybody from from our audience who is
knowledgeable in the blockchain and
mining and everything can't you already
do this stuff on your regular smartphone
I mean you can mine for four virtual
currencies you can basically use any
sort of horsepower available in your
device whether that's a laptop a
computer a phone or a website a server
to mine for these currencies do you have
to have a special what's special about
the set HTC Exodus so I mean in terms of
just mining for it cryptocurrencies
which is kind of the main
attention-grabbing sort of thing that
has been associated with the blockchain
you don't really need any well it's it's
just mainly concentrated on raw
horsepower and a lot of it to crack into
a lot of formulas and to authenticate
certain things and you know whatever but
I think the wider applications should be
considered here which is access to a
decentralized app service and an app
store that you know you something like
Cydia as opposed to the App Store where
you only get verification from other
users of that network or you internet
traffic like that can act as as its own
sort of a VPN in sort of a way so that's
a sort of the larger picture that they
want to take of this but in terms of
cryptic and so you can pretty much do it
from any computer it ends there's always
a concern that some sites are going to
use whatever like they're going to
attack your computer and use whatever
spare computing power that you have to
mine for cryptocurrencies without your
authorization so there's a whole bunch
of other kind of them worries that you
have to make when it comes to using non
non specific types of computers well
there's there's that I just want to give
a shout out I'm looking at the comments
here to come on I lost it where are you
yes
Pedro Pedro and Ronnie thank you I don't
think I'm out of context I think that
there's a huge
difference between the region you are
living in and the region I am living in
and then there's also a difference
between the people you're surrounded
with if I haven't seen people use iPhone
SES it doesn't mean that the iPhone se
is not a phone which is worth selling or
buying it it just means that in my life
where I live where I travel I haven't
seen people use it if you think that
that's out of context by all means but
please give me some some of your
arguments as well aside from the fact
that you've seen two people use an
iPhone se yeah well I think Mattala port
gave an example back on Twitter that the
iPhone se was a fairly popular from the
Netherlands for some reason I'm gonna
have to look that coming up I was trying
to look at Pedro's comment so that we
could but he just , dated a couple
minutes ago now the iPhone 5c was that
was a flop poor choice of hardware and
design so talking about the iPhone 5c
and how it was executed as opposed to
the iPhone se and yeah there's a whole
bunch of arguments that could be made to
say that both of them were framed
differently 5cs see a lot of them share
a lot of space share a lot of
similarities in terms of form factor and
like what they did it's just the
branding the imaging was not really
right for them so definitely agree that
case and there's just a whole bunch of
other appian weekly comments here I
Daniel Mladenov speaking of HTC and
cracking glass backs can HTC make
another aluminium unibody flagship
before throwing in the towel I second
that opinion I still well I don't have
the HTC ten that I had about a year and
a half ago but I still have the One m7
so H do you see if you're out there
basically make it an update to this I'll
be fine
you know there's there's there's one one
thing which I wanted to touch on of
course you need to have a glass back
smartphone if you want to take advantage
of
wireless charging to me and my mind that
makes sense either you have wireless
charging or you have aluminum back
phones what doesn't make sense in my
mind is for a manufacturer to produce a
product which does not support wireless
charging and still make it glass back
and say that this was a decision in
order to improve
I don't know reception or antenna
performance come on guys I mean we've
seen photos from 2000 and moving forward
through plastic aluminum and all sorts
and none of them had great big issues
with reception except the death grip of
the iPhones of back then this doesn't
make sense in my mind to use this
particular argument it does make sense
if you're going the wireless charging
route but if your phone doesn't support
wireless charging just maybe consider
doing a phone manufacturing the phone
which is an aluminum phone and it won't
break but then again if it doesn't break
you will never repair it or replace it
too so there's that nope
and finally from Peter hatin given
Samsung's past with previous flagships I
worried that we could have five cameras
for five gimmicks plus the design status
it would likely create I think it is
difficult even for Samsung to make each
a good implementation to stack up to
completion Galaxy has 10 a lot of
software that has to be implemented with
that and unfortunately even with Samsung
as big it as it as it is for a chaebol I
don't think they have the dedicated team
sticking to not only great but maintain
those individual features therefore our
if we're already going to get like all
these features with each lens or each of
each little change I don't think that
really makes sense so it'll probably
just be kind of augmented by the same
sorts of a Rai insert acronym here so
yeah like I guess I guess that's my
that's that's the that's the base the
default state that we're in green yeah
I really did I want lunch I'm so hungry
right now so and you probably want
dinner too you want you want to get out
of the house so thank you so much for
participating in thanks thanks for
having me anytime you need me just say
the word indeed we'll have you back on
