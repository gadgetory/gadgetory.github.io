weekly hello and welcome to episode 02
eight of the pocket now weekly the
once-a-week podcast from pocketnow.com
where we discuss what's awesome and
what's awkward in the world of mobile
technology I'm your host Michael Fisher
and joining me this morning from seven
hours in the future is the man of steel
managing editor Anton Dean naudia good
morning sir good morning everybody good
to be back and the man with the optimus
G editor-in-chief Brandon minimun good
morning to you here's the thing we
started off friends it was cool but then
it was all pretend yeah that's even gone
oh that would everything just got
immeasurably better thank you I was
about the shazam you it's actually a fun
trick to play on people because it
sounds like you're about to say
something here's the thing it does we
start off friends and they're like oh
you're something here singing Kelly
Clarkson I've done to my wife like 11
times and she's getting tired of it I'm
just gonna say I'm sure she appreciates
that still after after all those 11
times I was wondering if if it reminds
me of those fake out answering machine
messages from the 80s oh yeah like you
know the answer machine because like
hello hello hello ah gotcha i'm not
actually hear that yeah yeah just
mention it because whenever i get a call
from somebody I don't want to talk to I
answer live but I'm blame my voicemail
it's like hi this is sony and i'm not
here and then depending on what he or
she tells me I'm just back or not that's
awesome there used to be a call
screening on some cell phones that would
allow you to do that like it you could
for 30 seconds you could listen to the
person leaving the message and then
decide whether you wanted to pick up or
not oh yeah it was awesome we have a lot
of announcements and we have a lot of
thought thread we have a ton of topics
this is ridiculous I thought we were
going to coast through this episode to
be honest I mean we're in the low
between CES and mwc and I thought it was
going to be a slow week but absolutely
not this has been leaked city things
have been crazy so let's
jump right into it and let's get to the
announcements pocketnow is in the middle
of is still after like almost a year is
in the middle of a whole bunch of
changes ninety-eight percent of which
are awesome and I'm only saying that to
cover ourselves because I'm sure there's
some not awesome but I just can't that
was about to say would I was like what
two percent but no one of them is is
really really cool and I get to
participate in it when it comes up
tomorrow but I need Tony to talk about
it since it is his brainchild so Tony
tell us a little bit about pocket now
live very quickly well very quickly
everybody has been asked or most people
have asked us for a video podcast and we
decided to keep it classic because you
cannot beat a classic but we thought
that how about we do something for those
people and those so for fun and for
everybody so bucket now life will be a
weekly hang out with the readers a very
casual one where we just sit down as
friends talk about all things mobile and
people just can join say hi ask
questions and stuff like that i will be
you'll hang out right the google hangout
yeah which will go live on our youtube
channel and then once it's done it will
stay there as a recording i will be
hosting it weekly except for when the
editor-in-chief will be joining us that
is going to be his show we're gonna have
a neat Brenda and we're gonna have lots
of fun yes we are and I this we already
had kind of the pilot episode last week
and I was not on the air i think i was
filming our commercial at the time but
it looked like a ball i watched about
the first five or six minutes of it and
I thought two things i thought well
first i thought like I really want to be
on the air and I kept like shooting a
mast remember the email yeah so annoyed
but I was so so jealous of Brandon's
fake sunglasses and high maze devil
horns and Anton's real cigar yeah that
was not an avatar no it was not a
problem I was and actually I have some
Honduran cigars from hi my so I could I
too could join in the cigar this
ignorance now those are for me but no
those are those your prop idea what I'm
gonna be hell over you were supposed to
bring them to me to Barcelona no there
me either who's like it'll settle this
offline all right that sounds good um
but so good I'm very much looking
forward to my first time on the
unpacking now live so but just as a
clarification and thank you John you for
saying what I forgot to the weekly is
for now and for the foreseeable future
going to remain an audio only podcast so
if you want to see our faces we are very
flattered and thank you continue
listening to the weekly but watch pocket
now live as well and pocket now live
sisters talking alive is not a video
yeah ha no it is nobody let me be clear
it I think totally different and unique
and less structured exactly it's not
just gonna be the weekly Redux it's it's
it's much more casual and and just an
entirely different kind of fun so that
aside pocket out alive announced we are
gonna jump into a thought thread which I
had a broad idea for today but then
Brendan had a better idea which was more
specific we like specificity and
increasingly incredibly we like LG
Brandon take it away LG uh so i was
using the iphone 5 since since it came
out and it's gotten to the point where
the iphone 5 makes me feel bad inside
because it's so boring the hardware it's
great it's then you know we've been here
before but i wanted to do something diff
i want to go back to android ms android
I feel like half the year I'm gonna
android half the year i'm on iphone and
half the year i want windows phone that
doesn't make sense ok so no i really
like the nexus 4 but there are two big
problems with the nexus 4 that makes it
impossible for me to use the first one
the biggest thing is to touch
sensitivity issues and people that have
the nexus 4 say you know what are you
talking about it's perfectly fine yeah
if you use it for long enough you're
gonna get used to it but if you're like
me that switches phones a lot you really
notice these things and so that was a
big issue and the other issue was the
lack of LTE well just so happens that
the world has created a phone that
solves both of those problems the
optimus G on AT&amp;amp;T and it's uh I was in
the I was at an AT&amp;amp;T store the other day
and I'm like I wonder if the touch
sensitivity issue is not there and it
should
right because it's the same phone but
it's not there which is kind of weird
and then of course it is out to eat but
I wasn't up for a new contract so i paid
like 400 bucks to buy this phone this is
very unusual for me to do to buy a phone
off-contract that's so expensive but I I
really wanted it and I'm really glad I
haven't um it it really feel I mean it's
so fast the battery life is boss like
like yesterday it was off the charger
for 14 hours i was using it heavily and
it's funny cuz when you we haven't fun
that has a really good battery life you
start doing things differently like I've
got the craziest live wallpaper i can
think of my screen brightness I screen
brightness baseline is seventy-five
percent so it goes between 75 and 100
percent and 14 hours later I was still
with twenty-seven percent battery life
after using it heavily and nice and if I
may when you're running that live
wallpaper on the optimist tree as I
recall it doesn't impact its performance
at all yeah yeah that escort pro is just
uh is just a sexy beast so so it is fast
you know it's a little boxy it's the
only thing I like and it's also very
fragile has the glass on the front and
glass on the back um but like I love
this phone it's the biggest downside is
that it's still an ice cream sandwich
but it feels like it's it's got jelly
bean which is strange like everything so
smooth and responsive and I don't think
and also another downsides of
development story's pretty terrible
because not many people have bought have
purchased the optimus G so there's no
cyanogenmod 10 for it yet there there
aren't any there aren't that many cool
custom roms but I'm really digging this
thing like I can see myself using this
for a while we do I think that was gonna
be my question like I also dig it and I
understand exactly why you dig it and
but can you see yourself using it for
for an extended period like I mean it's
it seems to be far enough away now from
the cutting edge considering its you
know delayed jelly bean introduction and
all that kinda stuff like it are you
missing any of that are you missing the
expandable notifications and the you're
missing out on some google now
enhancements to right well here's the
thing
started I mean yeah I am I i missed the
extended notifications and i miss google
now um to answer your first question the
way I was thinking about this was that
my next phone is going to be probably
the HTC m7 because i want that droid DNA
but faster thing with better hardware
and so forth and I want the 1080p screen
and five inches i can i can do that on
at all kind of phone that's not a
phablet but the problem is the the the
m7 is probably not gonna get released
until march and you know i can't wait
these two whole months or whatever it is
three months until until that so that's
why I got the optimus G cool so it's so
it's it's a it's a stopgap phones down
yeah it is a luxury stopgap it's one
that you're really enjoying using yeah
yeah huh that's that is awesome and good
on LG and you know we have actually some
news that I think we can we can kind of
leap into this if we if we want to
because LG II has some news that I just
I just I just can't believe you are not
the only one Brandon I I think there
have been a million Optimus optimus G
phones sold worldwide so far but more
importantly LG has just announced that
it managed to sell excuse me that it
managed to steal the second place spot
in total phone shipments from Apple in
the United States for December 2012 I
don't get it I I don't get it either i
I'd like the optimus G is the literally
the only smartphone that if you ask me
right off the top my head tell me an LG
smartphones the only one I can think of
I know there are others and I you know
if I tried a little harder but you know
it's not on retail shelves it doesn't
have a big big visual presence it has
almost no marketing support advertising
support here in the states at least in
my area and yet they've for December
they were second on on smartphone
shipments or phone shipments Tony do
what's the its smartphone its
smartphones yep i thought it i thought
this was including their dumb phones
then this makes even less sense to me
this is coming from what the
counterpoint research
Yonhap news agency has a report on the
counterbore research report so it's
basically a research report based on
analytics and just a small clarification
complete this is not the first time that
LG snatches the second place from Apple
LG was ahead of Apple before the iphone
4s it's the iphone 4s that managed to
get apple on the second place pushing LG
to the third and ever since the iphone
4s until recently apple's been sitting
on the second with LG in the third and
now probably with the iphone 5 selling
slower than the optimus g LG tube back
the second place but if you look at the
differences is just one percentage
between them so it's thirteen percent
for LG and twelve percent for Apple it's
not a huge difference but the fact
itself that LG is second is is an
excellent news because the US market is
dominated by south korean companies
samsung leads LG's the second and then
Apple is the first company which happens
to be a US company which is right there
in the top three but on the last pot
right I hadn't I just had no idea that
LG was moving this many units like I
mean I've never seen an optimist g in
the while I've certainly never sent a
view in the wild you know I just it's
it's stunning to me I think it's and I
don't think we're the only one judging
with the comments I don't think we're
the only ones surprised by this the the
optimus G was basically a phone for the
US market of course it was available in
canada japan and and in its home turf in
south korea but the US market was its
main market and i think from those 1
million phones sold the majority is on
the US market right what we've got to
speak in the optimus G I don't want to
get it too far away from this because
the the optimus g pro has been confirmed
for japan which will kind of help them
build the success even further we think
this thing I guess the improvements in
the pro Tony this is your story as well
is that it packs a faster version of the
s4 pro at 1.7 gigahertz that is that is
true and even though LG had no official
wording or information about this phone
its again Japanese carrier Angie
docomo who confirmed this phone as part
of its 2013 lineup and in that
confirmation we have some specifications
coming from the carrier and not from the
manufacturer itself so 1.7 s4 pro 5 inch
full HD two gigs of ram 32 internal
storage blah blah blah I'm thinking
we'll probably see this phone in
Barcelona at mwc LG's a little bit
silent because they want to show this up
they want to capitalize on the show but
NTT DoCoMo had to mention it as part of
their lineup together with the Xperia Z
tablet can I just say something here ask
a question please so so this phone is
going to Japan and we haven't talked
about Japan much the the perception I've
always had was that in Japan it's
already like the year 2050 like they
have all this advanced technology but i
guess the cool stuff yeah but but but
wait a sec do they have like do they
have phones that are several generations
ahead or something i don't think so i
mean like this is the best friend
they're getting which is a phone that's
coming to the US this year it seems that
the the phone technology in japan is at
the same pace as the US isn't it they
have some specifics market specifics for
instance of every Japanese film I've
covered almost probably still have a has
an infrared board and a TV tuner but
that aside I'm not sure the optimus g
pro will get to the US just think about
the samsung galaxy s3 alpha which is the
ds3 on steroids for for the same camera
here in japan that's a japan specific
phone but so well they have slight
upgrades but not huge different it's not
a huge leap between normal the rest of
us and them yeah yeah yeah that's what I
think it is I mean it's not like the
optimus g pro has a 16 core processor
with 128 gigabytes of ram in like a 4k
screen i mean these specs are all specs
that we'll see in the m7 so i would love
to know if if there's something besides
the over-the-air TV tuner which is built
in every phone in japan which is who
cares about that you streaming over the
internet they good what they do do I do
but but you know what I mean like
there's always this perception of like
that it's so futuristic over there but I
don't think that's the case anymore you
know I think that used to be the case I
yeah I think that they were always ahead
ahead
head and we started to reach parity in
the years following the iphone release
and I remember when they think when the
iphone the original iphone was released
in japan actually now it might be wrong
on this but i don't think it was a very
big seller and it took a long time as a
very slow burn over there for that too
to become a popular device and now it is
so i think there's a big cultural gap
there but i think that the the disparity
between you know the japan's lead on on
the rest of the world's for smartphones
go is not anywhere near as wide as it
used to be a high grade c go on i was
gonna say and if you look at some older
technology just modern technology i
think like NFC was was ubiquitous in
japan like 10 years ago and people
people are using it to make payments and
so forth and it took like some of those
technologies took the us a little bit
longer uh but but besides that i don't
think there's anything to speak of i was
about to say that i'm gonna take both of
your thoughts and take them even third
or about the only phone maker which
comes from japan it's sony which is
relevant I mean are they huge no are
they in the game yes but they have so
many other players like Panasonic sharp
if I'm Rico well these are old Japanese
companies and they are not relevant on
the landscape so they as far as market
is concerned they are a great market but
manufacturers from Japan are not doing
that well on international markets I
want to just to bring them back to the
optimus g pro really quickly this i'm so
very disappointed in this design and i
hope we get a different one because it's
essentially the optimus G with it looks
like maybe a little bit wider radius
corners and at home button it's kind of
home button and don't get me started
look like the sgs3 yeah well the real
disappointment is the back because the
optimus G that we're familiar with has
this wonderfully patterned back that
that really serves to set it apart from
every other device if you look at it I
mean it reflects light in a very curious
way it's a little like the Nexus 4
whereas this press image we're seeing
seems to suggest it's just a matte
finish regular old back it's like they
took the one special thing about the
optimist cheese physical hardware and
removed it for the clinic's no damn
sense today good that could have been
LG's thing but it looks like on the on
the g pro the back is removable which
they in which case they can't do the
cool backing that plus don't forget this
is a carrier phone I'm willing to bet my
buffalo nickel that the optimus G the
optimus g pro from ntt docomo will be
different from the optimus g pro which
will be sold internationally i hope that
that is true and i'm sure that that is
true and yeah and there's there's a
white one and but i think having a
removable battery doesn't preclude you
from doing some cool stuff like Samsung
did it on the ax t VES with that fake
metal you know there's another phone
that I'm thinking of that I can't
remember right now that's that did
something cool with a removable battery
door so you can do something cool with
it speak of removable battery I was
curious to see I think was you My gods
at CES that was swapping batteries sorry
yeah I'm like no my note 2 yeah yeah hmm
okay my question is how did you charge
that second battery I had to I had to I
was using hymas note 2 because he wasn't
using it cuz he was using the 8x so I
was like hey man can I borrow your note
2 to charge my other battery cuz I
didn't have a separate battery charger
for it so oh so so it's not you don't
have like a little recept little no cage
thingy which I would do if if the ports
were standardized on batteries and I
could use it for more than one model but
you know that all the batteries has
their different so can ya yeah every
time every time I I hear people scoff at
non-removable battery i scoff at that
because I I don't want to ever March
yeah I don't want to ever have to root
that's not like like good experience no
it's a lose-lose because you're you're
charging one battery you then you take
it out any charge another one and then
you leave that second one in the phone
and then you have this fully charged
lithium-ion batteries setting out for
you know days and that's not good for it
they prefer to be charged at about half
half charge or at least last time i
check the science a couple years ago
forty percent yeah yeah forty percent so
I mean and it's inconvenient and yeah
it's kind of annoying but I gotta tell
you and I wrote a piece saying that to I
was like everybody stop whining and use
external battery packs stop whining
about they have to do this but I gotta
tell you despite the inconvenience on
the charging side it is
really nice just to be out you know on
the trade floor or wherever and your
phone powers down you just swap in a new
battery rather than yeah but actually
anally think imagine having a battery
which will go through one day of heavy
usage without you swapping batteries or
charging constantly that now you're just
that's that's the world I want to live
in now you're just having a pipe dream
uh-huh I actually I got close to that
with a note too actually but no no luck
at CES it's as if that's a phone killer
we are we talking enough about about
Galaxy devices can we jump into this the
biggest rumor of the week I think still
from South Korea still from South Korea
we got word that then there's no update
on this that the render of the or the
official image of the galaxy s4 may have
broken to cover on picasa like a month
ago and nobody noticed until like the
other day now this is still this is like
buried in rumor this it shows a device
very similar to the galaxy s3 with more
squared-off corners a bigger home button
yay and kind of the typical TouchWiz
nature UX UI and there's a lot of
qualifiers on this we don't know if it's
real if it is I just want to come out
and say it I am bored already okay well
here's the thing i'm not gonna do it
again no seriously here's the thing
about the galaxy s4 samsung has two
choices one is to make a device that
looks like the galaxy s3 that resonates
with people the millions and millions of
people that now know what a galaxy s3
looks like or they could do something
different and I think for a company that
has sold so many millions of devices
that is profit focused it makes more
sense to go with the first option it's
safer and people are still gonna buy it
I mean there's gonna be a group of
people that say this this design is
tired and boring like like you Michael
but yeah most people mom and pop will be
like oh it's another one of those
newfangled galaxies it's the new galaxy
yeah but there's a fine line there right
because you know I feel like if you can
do that if you're taking the design
forward you can do that if you're
iterating and you are doing something
new with an existing design but it looks
like if this is true which you know it
might not be if this is the real design
it's kind of like
they took the galaxy s3 and someone said
now you guys went crazy with that their
pebble design let's just take it on back
a bit and it looks like it looks like
some kind of cross between a galaxy s2
and a galaxy s3 it looks like a step
backward to me I I'm sure that this is a
fake one you are there are ya first of
all as somebody commented on this
Samsung never used a battery percentage
icons and its renders plus we have the
same touch with you I Samsung always
launches new touch with you eyes but
just to get back to your design points
guys I would agree that it would be
normal or natural to deal with the
season samsung looking the same way I
mean the galaxy s3 the note 2 yes 3 many
about every recent Samsung tablets or
any device coming from Samsung is using
the same design principle and I think
that this is what they do they come up
with a new design every year use the
same design language for all phones on
that lineup and then next year bring the
refresh so I'm out of buffalo nickels
but if I had another one I'd say we'll
see a completely new galaxy s4 with a
new design I hope you are correct and I
would not choose to argue with you on
that and this does said I mean it rings
kind of odd this this particular render
and I agree with you that they would
probably show something a little bit
more bombastic on the software side and
I didn't know that about the battery
percentage clue so thank you for that
well uh something else to consider is
that if you click the picasa link it's
now taken down no that's interesting
yeah yeah that could mean one of two
things either that the there's been a
takedown notice to cease and desist then
this is close to the truth he had had
his share of fun and that's it ok so
yeah a lot of speculation on that we're
not really probably probably probably
probably not not real but we have more
speculation so don't worry about it we
have one of those exact inner peace I
think after Lee titled Tony more samsung
galaxy s4 rumors and speculation what it
what is going on we have we have a name
we have a code name kind of released or
not released but speculated upon called
projects je broj of jay is in is an old
project which was rumored back
the day and let everybody to believe
that because of the shape of letter J
the galaxy s4 might have a bendable
screen that's debatable but apparently
project J has recently renamed to LTS
out use or in Latin else use which means
higher and there are lots of reports but
one of them specifically claims that
there will be a larger 26 milli amp 2600
milliamp hour battery with wireless
charging capabilities yes Michael your
prayers have been answered yes and the
model number will be TI 95 which is not
a huge surprise plus then then there
come the other speculations which
probably everybody can think about the
8-8 core cpu which was announced at CES
a four point ninety nine inch full HD
display which again was in at CES but
nothing is for certain so let's that's
interesting I will you know these kind
of spec pumps are expected as you say
and the GTI 9500 is no surprise to
anybody 2600 milliamp hour battery gets
me a little excited that sounds pretty
cool and of course the wireless charging
I feel like it's odd because I feel like
if we were having this conversation at
this exact time last year and I've
written some editorials to this effect
like the wireless charging was so the
pipe dream and now it has in a very
short time to my eternal delight it has
become the new thing that everyone wants
to have or that some carriers are
demanding that that phones have I think
verizon is playing a very big part in
this in the United States so I just want
to say I'm happy I'm very happy to see
that and I wish that Samsung had
delivered more completely on its promise
to launch a wireless charging solution
for the galaxy s3 because it still
hasn't globally it still we've yet to
see that surprising i mean it's uh it's
become it's become pretty pretty entered
we just need some hot and sexy um dwyer
lyst charging devices like that thing
you sent you sent me like michael was
that oh yeah the tilt slightly yeah it
looks like if you took them like a like
a check mark and
it into the real world as a 3d thing I
mean I can't even explain it it is it is
so peculiar in its shape and its
multi-cut you know there are many colors
offered it looks like it's just custom
designed to match your HTC windows phone
8x or 8's or your Nokia Lumia whatever
any of the multicolored ones we should
be getting review units of these so I
will be sure to let everyone know once
it comes in so you should definitely
follow us on Twitter listeners if you
don't do that ah facebook oh yes and
unfit I keep I don't mean to keep
dismissing Facebook Tony's runs that
Facebook you've got a campaign like a
champ I occasionally want to answer our
own our own trivia questions or our own
when was the last time most of this come
from Brandon do they yeah whatever it
well then good on both of you we're not
done with Samsung speculation we still
have word of a possible what I think is
a very very accurate possibility for the
Galaxy Note 80 and we have written some
pieces on this we've been covering this
is one of the most fierce fiercely
rumored devices because Samsung has
basically come out and said that they're
going to drop it on us at mwc and they
have to fill in the gap with the s4 I
mean no s4 but no date exactly right
yeah they couldn't just pull another CES
for their like here's this TV and the
tweeting refrigerator you know it's I
need to do something mobile and this
galaxy note 8.0 if you haven't seen it
looks a lot like the the Samsung Nexus
10 except built for a portrait form a
built-in portrait style and this
particular example is white and the
screen resolution is terribly low even
for the size what is the screen
resolution is 1280 by 800 is not a
denied as yeah especially with a pen
input device where you're drawing
diagonal lines if you're into that kind
of thing it's gonna look like a
staircase input let's talk about that
because the did the S Pen is just bound
to be included on this sucker because
it's a galaxy note it would just be
stupid if it weren't but I did not
necessarily think
they could fit an S Pen into a device
that looks as slender as this one does
and maybe it's a little thicker than I
think do we have a measurement on this I
was about to talk exactly about this
yeah please those those of you who
watched the previous pilot version of
the hangout last Friday when I held the
ipad mini and my hands hi may Rivera
said that I make this device look small
I have huge hands I'm getting a fair
grip of the ipad mini and the ipad mini
is exactly 200 millimeters that is seven
point eighty seven inches in width but
this galaxy note 8.0 is to 11.3
millimeters so that's 11 millimeters
more I have huge hands I'm not sure I'll
be able to hold that with one hand
that's gonna be a problem because I see
that it has a headset at its top haha
and yeah i mean this mock-up actually i
believe it and Michael if you look
closely out the the back of it yeah in
the bottom left corner and that image
that you're looking at you can see a
little stylist yeah there is a crevasse
they're also looks to be some sort of
like it ear piece on the top at above
the sky love that finally somebody's
been answering my prayers but please let
me keep it with one hand let me hold it
I can't hold it that one to 11 is too
much even for my key chains I wish we
were I wish we were joined by by by Joe
on this episode the former the former
life tweeter of the podcast Joe Alleva
because this looks a whole lot even more
like like something out of Star Trek
Voyager and maybe that's why I'm
inclined to like it weaved things
getting all I've been getting a lot of
hate in the comments though because I
don't know people are not liking this
this render for whatever reason or
excuse me not render this legal design
this design I do I like it I me too yeah
I mean you know you've got a slight
bulge it's the well it's like you turned
a nexus 10 on its side and slim to town
interesting Lee I didn't like the Nexus
10 feet well maybe you're a portrait
kind of guy maybe um well I we'll know a
lot more about that as we get closer
damn NBC but let's jump into HTC if
nobody has an objection oh please do
because while we're talking about leaked
shots and renders and all that kind of
stuff we talked a little bit last week
on the podcast about the render of the
m7 that had leaked and the images that
have since become public or you know
whether on purpose or not have shown a
very very different device then that
leaked render that leaf render was not
that was that was like from 1994 I think
it's pretty bogus right I but you know
it excited me because that previously
crendor was like it had some cool design
elements I could suggest to the edge to
edge screen and it had those drilled out
holes on the top and bottom I am posting
trot yeah I mean it looked like
something different and this one like if
I hadn't seen that I'd be pretty stoked
about this m7 but I did see that so now
I'm looking at this what could be the m7
and I'm like oh wow you guys did the
droid DNA except rectangular it's the
droid DNA which is which is frustrating
yeah it's not it is for you guys but you
guys have seen it in the state the rest
of the world has not so it's exciting
for the the all the other people who
live in on this planet well as seven
billion minus 200 something million no
because you have to remember China has
the butterfly and yeah that's the same
device no doesn't it looks exactly the
same as the DNA yeah but it doesn't look
exactly the same as the m7 render no it
doesn't I'm or the big what are you
amped on it yeah yeah I couldn't wait
for this design and this this form
factor to get to Europe I mean I was
drooling over to Joy DNA like crazy last
year yeah so I'm I can't wait to find
this phone in Europe and get it you're
gonna use that beats audio no no I'm
just got a disabled and use my super
high-end earplugs well let's uh let's
talk about a little bit about the
software and that's cuz you know
physically we I don't want to go back
and forth on whether or not this this is
real or not or whatever but look at this
look at sense 5 i'm so nice yeah like 19
we have I agree like it looks it's very
very pared down from what we've come to
expect from sense it's flat it's like
Windows 7 to Windows 8 yeah yes yeah
yes um and and with that comes
efficiency in in in terms of the the
data that fits on the screen like the
the folders are outlined by this like
gentle outline and not this thick crusty
thing it's it's just you know I've
always really liked sense but you know
the the keyboard every button has a
little shine to it it's like well I want
any to shine is this is there like a
light on behind me it's you know like
this is I just this makes me even more
excited about the m7 because for example
HTC I think has the best email client
it's just so print Haute is really good
isn't it yeah I this is good I agree i
think the story of the m7 now if we are
to believe these rumors is going to be
software and it's going to be sense 5
and you know really that's where the
focus should be on an HTC device right
now because we've we Taunton so much
almost year ago about how much we loved
the One X is hardware and the One X's
display and not so much the camera but
you can't have everything but the
polycarbonate we liked a lot and all
that but really what held it back for
most of us i think was was sense and
being laggy and slow even though they
had slimmed it down a lot and if this
what we're seeing that from sense 5 is
at all accurate it's going to be
beautiful and if HTC has managed to
solve the responsiveness woes which by
the way they did quite a bit in the
droid DNA if you remember from from my
review they could have a real winner on
their hands with this sucker so I'm very
amped they could go go go go go go go
i'm gonna i was about to wrap it up mmm
okay since you said go 17 times i'm
gonna go go the problem is that can
competitively unless there's a killer
feature you're gonna have the HTC m7
you're gonna have the galaxy s4 you're
gonna maybe have the g pro or some
variant of it all with almost the exact
same specs hardware that's not that
different and what's going to make these
devices stand out is the marketing push
which hopefully HTC will do and and if
there are any killer features which we
haven't seen coated we haven't seen
killer features in a very long time I
mean maybe um you know PureView in
in the Lumia 920 or let's name some
other cool features a lightness in the
galaxy s4 or like well I mean beautiful
displays even though Mike hardware side
yeah yeah incredible camera performance
on non PureView device's battery
longevity I like the droid razr maxx
which improbably hasn't sold very well
but but you know it's gonna need one of
those it's a standout hmm I just hope
HTC One throw out another guy using the
phone from the airplane oh god that
commercial was annoying it's just it was
on all the time in the way that the
Samsung spots are but it was just not as
cool somehow I don't know such a concept
I'm telling you if they bring back the a
we always talk about so they bring back
the you campaign Oh God yet I mean I
will probably burst into tears just from
the sentimentality if that's a word like
yes my phone is the first thing I see in
the morning okay I love that I add god
that's my favorite I come out of all
time HTC please bring back the you
campaign it is so amazing you know I was
about to say oh yeah word on the virtual
street is that the HTC m7 will not be
launched at mwc oh right but it will be
launched earlier than nwc somewhere
around februari 19th most probably in
London or somewhere else at a dedicated
special HTC event now if this thing
turns out to be true then HTC is joining
the elite of Apple and Samsung and other
companies who are making dedicated
special events which will suck for you
and me Michael because we'll both be in
bound to Barcelona but we'll probably
see the phone at the show floor so this
is just a rumor right now but prepare
for this to happen it used to be that we
could spend our travel budget on going
to a few events a year but now we're
gonna go like 20 I know yeah yeah and
you know and I get and we talked a lot
about this at CES and I get why
companies do that but it does yeah just
make it a little less convenient doesn't
it we were just well we were talking
about another I won't get into that
right now until we get confirmation that
we are attending the the last piece of
news in the Android section for us is
this sony leak
which appears to fertel at a phablet
entry of their very own at six inches or
a little over six inches six point four
four inches please stop that is HUGE
that that's huge for flow in that
massive but you know what I whereas I
wasn't excited when Huawei did it with
the ascend mate at 6.1 inches I am I am
I could get excited about a Sony phablet
because I feel like the company has a
real eye for design as we saw with the
Xperia Z and ZL I and you know about a
billion phones before that I'm getting
I'm getting glad that we're starting to
like um we keep seeing OEMs go bigger
and bigger but there's a point at which
they can't like no one's gonna do a
7-inch phone because it's physically
impossible so we're almost there to
where we can stop seeing this madness
but I kind of agree with you my pot I
think if there's one company left that
can do a massively sized phone I want to
see Sony do it absolutely yeah and all
we have really is this picture of this
gloved hand in a lab holding the display
glass with this it's just it is massive
isn't it that hand got fired yeah yeah
let me everyone put your hands down
undelete yeah it would give it let's see
the rumored is it's it's 1080p kind of
like it would have to be right and so
but at this size the pixel density would
be closer to 340 PPI instead of which is
good we're still good it's still very
good yes absolutely but i like how
Steven puts it in this in the in the
article he says as you can see from the
pic it's not so obscenely large that
you'd struggle to hold it assuming that
its frame doesn't add too much the
models width but it could still be a bit
of an adjustment yes I would say so it's
it's monster so till we hear more about
that we can put that to bed but I just
didn't want to leave leave stony
completely out of the news this week as
we continue to reel from their fun
announcement at CES so let's jump into
windows 8 and windows phone 8 and kind
of tackle the rest of this news here
there's there's something from just this
morning I was so excited because I
didn't think there was much windows news
but then I was like Tony what are we
going to talk about he's like yeah we
just posted the story of this this
morning
this is the most exciting rumor I
personally have come across you can hear
my voice it sounds 6i Tony tell us about
the real PureView windows phone the
nokia eos which is not gonna be the name
and all the cannons gonna sue but yeah
here's the thing when when nokia
announced the Lumia 920 with PureView
technology and we wrote an editorial
about the fact that the PureView
technology on the Lumia 920 is not pier
view because the pier view 8 away no we
know how it functions and the Lumia 920
doesn't function like that but it has
optical image stabilization and Nokia
reassured everybody that there's peer
review 1 and peer review two and
PureView light and PureView XXL and blah
blah blah but it's the real purview now
the thing is that according to some the
verge sources we will apparently see the
real PureView windows phone which will
hopefully be announced at mwc together
with five other Lumia devices it will
pack a sensor similar to the one in the
808 PureView which begs for a question
if it's going to be a 41-megapixel
sensor will windows phone 8 support that
huge resolution and its camera
application if not how will they
overcome this but that's another topic
and it will apparently be made just like
the iphone 5 entirely from aluminium and
it will be a fully high-end premium
phone AT&amp;amp;T is gonna have it sometime
this year so that's all we know at the
moment about this and of course windows
phone on board this is the phone that I
wanted when I heard it before I heard
about the Lumia 920 when I knew there
was a PureView device coming to Windows
Phone and I don't think I'm alone this
is this rumor is the phone that I wanted
that I hoped for that I half expected to
come and I was like many I was pretty
disappointed by the 920 not being an
actual PureView device quote unquote so
I did this nothing could get me more
excited than this rumor I if this is not
true I will be I will just shut myself
in the booth by myself for a day and
kind of bleep the I will buy this the
minute it becomes available like I
I'm so excited about this go ahead
Brandon did you have something how did
you know i can do you take that intake
of breath I know yeah I did I I just
thought of something unrelated that we
didn't talk about the android section
I'm gonna bring it up real quick I don't
know if you guys saw this but I'm google
announced earnings and I don't know if
it was Eric Schmidt was talking about
two things that they see as an
opportunity in mobile and he was talking
about how phones still aren't good
enough and everything and and you know
people thought that he was referring to
the motor alexr what everybody said to
think that one is that the obvious that
phone battery life is still not that
good and so that that tells me that you
know this this mystery motorola phone
will probably have amazing battery life
but then he said something that people
don't really talk about which is that
when you drop your phone it shouldn't
like you know become destroyed as if the
future motorola phone might have some
sort of indestructible quality where you
can't crack the screen it's it's
resilient to falls that is entirely
unsurprising to me and i don't mean on
exciting I mean unsurprising because
Motorola has always focused heavily on
excellent hardware as far as durability
goes they're one of the only carriers
that do that internal board coating to
waterproof their devices they've always
been really rugged and also they've
they've had a big focus on battery life
for like like two years so that makes a
lot of sense to me you guys think that
this is a hint for the new motorola
super phone for TX yeah absolutely I do
probably yeah no it's good that you
brought that I mean no totally I we've
talked about kind of my love for
Motorola and where it comes from and
Sophie I mean the company doesn't do
everything right but man they can do
they do durability and battery life
better than almost anybody else so it'll
be exciting to see my my nexus 4 just
slid off the table does just walk away
is your optimus G does it have a case on
it yet no it doesn't and it's a little
bit better with the walking off the
table still happens but not as much
before we just to bring us back to this
the nokia windows phone thing despite i
will say that despite being disappointed
by the Lumia 920's camera not being the
41-megapixel beast of the 808 PureView i
recently yesterday took it around town
and took some photos with it alongside
the galaxy camera and that resulted in a
comparison video that is up right now in
which almost every commenter has agreed
that the Lumia 920 pictures despite
being having a narrower field of view
and despite being a little artificially
warm are much better than the Samsung
devices pictures now I don't necessarily
agree and you know the comments sections
are always kind of flooded with very
vocal windows my hands um but I have to
say that barring all that you know
throwing all that out the window the 920
still takes very very good pictures for
a smartphone so that sounds it's gonna
meet my 808 PureView in Barcelona it's
gonna say yeah we are now that is where
we're doing our galaxy camera versus 808
PureView comparison video right
Barcelona yeah yep that's going to be
some of the best scenery ever seen in
any of our comparison videos so I can't
wait let's see can we jump into the
Microsoft Windows Phone 7.8 SDK has been
released for all the poor people still
stuck on Windows Phone 7 hardware you're
about to get small tiles and actually
this story came out yesterday but I
think since then a new story has come
out indicating that the 78 package
itself is actually sitting on nokia
servers waiting for carrier approval so
this should be happening like right I
feel for the guys who are still stuck
with the Lumia 810 grid's and the 904
all the others who will get the 7.8 but
somehow I'm failing at becoming excited
about this yeah it's it's not terribly
exciting but it you know what but it is
though it's exciting if if you're one of
those people right and I feel for them
too and but you know if you dropped a
bunch of money on an 800 or 900 you know
you don't necessarily have the time that
you didn't have the money to buy a 920
you know
when it came out 10 months later or
whatever it was so yeah but me you buy a
new windows phone 8 once your contract
expires because you can sit with 7.8
forever now you can but it's good that
you know it's good that they're able to
it is their homes it is a little better
now and I actually for old a bunk I gave
smaller live tiles when windows 18 was
an outside I can't imagine going back to
just full-size tiles now I mean it's
just it's so much more efficient the use
of space on the screen now despite my
gap teeth you know who's excited about
the surface pro well apparently Jaime's
not I'm ready to I'm excited to read his
tantalizing article entitled this is why
I'm no longer excited about the surface
pro um wait is it up yeah oh boy i love
i love it and that's gonna need some
heavy moderation and i told him to
prepare his handkerchief or whatever to
just wipe off the amount of flag which
will fly his way oh god is what his last
one of his last windows fun pieces like
couple days ago ahead last time i
checked it like 160 comments after a
very short time boy oh boy so any let me
start about as sad as yes i'm gonna and
very very quickly about it i am excited
because it's a computer it's not a
tablet and having a computer in this
form factor is excellent for mobility
it's like having mac OS running on the
ipad it is from this point of view an
excellent solution for those who want to
be bros and having a mobile computer
with them and which is not a laptop and
i also agree with the price nine hundred
dollars $1,000 is an ok price from my
perspective here and in romania and i'm
going to say exactly why it's not from
your perspective here in Romania the
Lumia 920 goes for one thousand dollars
just as the iphone five so i would
gladly pay one thousand dollars for the
surface pro but if I I think of it from
a u.s. perspective because I'm a
remaining working at the US company i
have to thank both ways this is a huge
price to pay for a tablet
right it is and that's why I think
they're going to have to make the case
at Microsoft stores and at best buys and
partner dealers whatever like they're
gonna have to position this as very much
the the more portable computer not the
you know not the less portable tablet
does this sucker have vents on it i
forgot does it have like it says yeah
yeah it's also quite think i have to try
to erase my the experience I had with
the surface RT because i was so turned
off by this the surface concept that i
have to remind myself that this is
different and I I feel it's not even
fair for me to give an opinion until I
you know go to local best buy and play
with one for a bit I don't think I could
ever see myself owning one but dad just
gonna say are we gonna get one I I don't
see the need like you know for example
you can get it instead of a laptop for
instance yeah if you're if you're up for
a new laptop and you if you really like
Windows 8 and I Michael have you checked
the app situation in the windows metro
store thing no I haven't you have not
yet I keep looking for excuses to use
the surface again but I still keep I
keep having to do real work oh it's
funny I just asked you that because I've
got tiles now I upgraded to Windows 8
just last week oh yeah so so I'm in the
store now it makes no sense on which is
when you feel nice to have tiles on a 24
inch monitor which is not even touch
screen and just clicking with your mouse
pointer on the tile it's awesome gross
it's it's gross it's just it's it smells
of wasted space and anyway so let me but
you know I keep you know I spend most of
my life on the desktop and what's what's
interesting is that if you want it to
not if you don't want to like deal in
the Metro tile environment you really
don't have to like when i launched an
app i press the start button on my
keyboard and i start typing and then the
app shows up in the tile interface and i
click and then I just pin everything
that I you you can just pin stuff and
out to your taskbar like Windows 7 and
you don't even have to go in there that
much and it's just it's it's comical
when you do because like you click on
the maps app and you get like a 24-inch
depending on that your honor is 24 inch
rendition of a Maps app that you would
have on your smartphone it's just like
what am I supposed to do with this
Brandon and in the metro so called Metro
X Metro interface do you click and drag
or do you scroll with the wheel to
navigate through the tiles oh you scroll
with the wheel which makes sense yeah
yeah um I want to just say something a
little bit positive about about this
which it like I'm from films on the flip
side after about a week of using the
surface what I've started to do is I've
been on my macbook air and I've been
doing stuff typing and if there's a
screen element I want to interact with
about maybe twice for three times a week
I've reached up and touched it like and
and you know what like for all the
arguments about gorillas arm and for you
know it is kind of an awkward move and
whatever but you know what I don't
that's probably one of my favorite parts
about interacting with the surface is
being able to do that when it's in its
you know kickstand deployed in keyboard
out mode I really like that so I think
having a touchscreen on laptops will
despite its awkwardness I think it will
eventually become the normal yeah it's
gotta be yes it's so natural now it
really is yeah and we're so used to
touching the internet directly let's
reach out touch yes well it's looking
forward to at least even if we don't we
don't have an office one here going to
spending some time at the microsoft
store with one and being approached by
somebody in a colorful shirt to
experience the new microsoft will be the
fun winding down on the Windows Phone
news just very briefly I've got a piece
coming on this in like a day or two it's
actually i think the outlines complete i
just have to you know write it which is
always the story sprint is going to get
its first windows phone in a long time
and yeah half the podcast has already
skipped head to the next topic at sprint
is the smallest national carrier besides
t-mobile in the united states it doesn't
have there's not a reason a lot of
people should get excited about it on at
first glance but tune in to pocket now
on friday friday morning and you will
see my arguments for why exact
you should be stoked about this
especially if you're a windows phone
user so this was less a news article and
more of a teaser and opportunity to pimp
my work mm camps and yeah I'll probably
talk i'm probably ruin it all on the
hangout tomorrow and finally now this
was a late late addition to the rundown
because I it didn't get in in time for
last week's podcast and I wish it had
because there's a rumor that a sous is
considering windows phones which okay
cool but also possibly a Microsoft
powered padfone I hear that Ford might
come out with a one-wheel car but
they're just not they just uh thank you
scrapped it because it didn't make sense
right right right yeah you think they
see the same thing is going to happen
with the windows padfone I don't think
anyone cares about the PadFone it's a
thought I do and I love the concept I
just think it's impossible to achieve at
this moment using Microsoft's tools or
Microsoft's platforms I mean is that
because of restrictions Microsoft places
on the the way the way the bad phone
works is that when you dock your phone
into the tablet which is not a table
it's just the screen all the processing
is done still on the phone and the UI
automatically switches to a tablet UI to
accommodate the large screen now with
Windows Phone there are three
resolutions which are supported wvga and
the other two after out well our 1280
you cannot really make it switch to a
tablet and that means the tablet would
had to run some how Windows RT or
Windows wendys be blown up Clive tiles I
don't think is who's gonna get a product
like that on the market no and plus
imagine 1280 by bever 720 or 768 on a
10.1 inch screen now
yeah I mean it will look bad in Metro in
modern UI I mean it would look it would
look bad but wouldn't like that if they
somehow managed to bridge the gap which
is rumored mid-2013 with that project
blue windows blue which will bridge the
gap between Windows RT / 8 and Windows
Phone 8 then yes let windows phone 8 run
the phone let windows RT / 8 run on the
tablet connect the gaps connect the dots
bridge the gaps and then yes this could
be a great concept hmm advice can I say
something one of the problems of the
PadFone concept is that if you've got
your screen which is basically a dumb
screen and it's in your living room and
you know you're like you know you're at
your ad you just woke up you go into
your living room your phone still on the
charger and you want to like use your
tablet oh crap my phones in the other
room you know it doesn't have to be in
the other room because the tablet
actually charges the phone uh but then
you have to charge the tablet too yeah
that's true yeah it's just engineer I I
think ok it was one of the first pieces
i wrote for the site was about the
original issues padfone and I was like
this is a really cool concept if you are
if your vision of the future still comes
from no offense Tony if you if your
vision of the future so comes from like
the 90s when it was like imagine a phone
that turns into a tablet just by
plugging in but you know I don't think
that's where the that's that's where the
new future is I think the new future is
living like having a lot of stuff in the
cloud which I know you I think you hate
Tony right no I live in the cloud but I
use a really loud yeah I disagree with
you because I think that this will be
very helpful helpful for many people but
the sous failed to make people
understand the advantages of the bad
phone concept and the pricing on the
Batphone one in padfone 2 was just
outrageous but imagine I I when I had
become mobile and work from somewhere
else I'm taking my phone and my tablet
or my laptop with me with a bat phone I
take only one device doc your phone into
the tablet have one device with you it
will charge
you have your speaker's and everything
is on the phone so it would be a good
thing for me as a user yeah he's on
crack well I think you know what I would
like I would like this product to come
to fruition just so that we can talk
more about this because I think this is
one of the more I'm usually really
invested in our is the PadFone a good
idea conversation but we do have to move
on because hopefully we'll get the
opportunity to talk about this more
let's jump into iOS and where did the
news has been slow but the rumors have
been hot and Haley yeah and guys we
should make something up Apple's gonna
make a phone out of potato potato chips
yes oh yeah you heard that too good i
just added that yeah entirely
starch-based iphone coming fourth order
that board it's edible you get rid of it
yeah emergency ration phone um yeah like
I see the point where I retitled the
headline on the on the run down like
latest iphone rumors are many comma
confusing because there's so many of
them we have this like rumor of this
four point eight inch iphone math which
is probably a error in translation and
afford four inch low-cost version and
steven makes a good point in his pieces
where he's like apple just it took so
long for apple to get to the 4 inch
screen size why would they immediately
now jump to a four point eight inch
version like it does and they and it not
only doesn't make sense they don't need
to i mean if you guys we are watching
the market and where the trend is and
android is setting the trend with high
resolution and hide this pipe huge
screens about the smallest screen size
you'll get will be the iphone all the
others will be 5 inches plus so there's
a huge market niche for those like me
who prefer smaller screens in a world
dominated by five in smartphones if you
want a smaller phone you either get
inoculum me out or an iphone i I have a
theory if if iOS 7 isn't groundbreaking
and spectacular it it's it's gonna be
tough
to sell the next generation iphone when
there's so much awesome hardware out
there for android so what Apple would do
is say well you know the truth of the
matter is we're losing sales people
aren't buying the iphone the iOS 7 is
not that interesting let's cater to
different types of users if only to
expand the market because they're
through a fair amount of people that
won't buy the iphone because the screen
is not big enough or because it's too
expensive then if they saw both of those
problems much to the dismay of steve
jobs they would sell a lot more phones I
would you know I would I think it would
be cool to have a four point eight inch
iphone to be honest and I think they can
do it let me speculate on this just for
a second Apple has lost the
specifications wore a long time ago the
iphone 5 still still rocks a slower chip
than most of android phones they took
their time to get to dual-core
processors not to mention one gig of ram
so the spec war has been lost wow I
think I think they threw the spec war i
mean i think they were like it looked at
the spec war and they said you guys go
ahead and measure your DS exactly we're
gonna make a good product yeah and
that's that's what I was about to say
that the it's because of the business
model the the iphone works as as it is
so this is why i think that the next
iPhone will not be that much about
hardware improvements though we will see
some but the main selling point will be
software and that's whatever iOS 7 will
bring yeah and if iOS 7 will not come or
it will be as boring as six and there
will be no hardware improvements that's
gonna be the start of the decline for
Apple i would agree and i would further
say that the next iPhone stands a good
chance if there's I if those OS
improvements come if if we see a revised
interface paradigm for iOS the next
iPhone stands a good chance of being the
one that I that I buy and use for a
little while yes oh yeah you guys agree
that the iphone the next iPhone whatever
its name will be is about the most
important phone Apple has ever released
because it's a make-it-or-break-it phone
I would say and I'll just jump right in
I would say that the one after this
coming one I think they've got one more
I think they've got it they could do a
5s that's not terribly impressive you
think they can blow
I think they can pull an SES I think
they have enough time to do that I think
if they pull a 5s and then do another
unimpressive one then they're in some
degree of trouble that's what I think
mm-hmm Brandon yeah I don't know don't
bother me about that why am I getting
all these messages all sudden on skype
you're getting messages on Scott are you
getting skype spam skype has been very
weird lately I just got like a year's
worth of iams in like five seconds and
it stopped god it's this is everyone
everyone get bought by microsoft it'll
make it better yeah yeah we'll make your
appt full screen yeah we've been having
listeners if you haven't been able to
tell we've been having skype problems on
our podcast today and we are going to
look into an alternate means of
delivering the weekly to you so thank
you for bearing with us before we leave
iOS we have weird one more thing from
just today is that right Tony that is
true and the latest numbers from Kantar
Worldpanel RN and we had some previous
numbers in November where Apple was
recording a historical high in terms of
market share in the US and the the
latest numbers are ending just before
Christmas so we don't contain Christmas
gifts and activations and iOS is still
dominating the US market with 51.2
percent followed by Android with 44.2
percent and rim is of course sinking
from 6.1 percent last year to 1.1
percent this year and when those phone
is is well I don't know stagnating maybe
I mean point five point four percent in
one year for from 2.2 to 2.6 I'm not
sure that's a good sign yeah well I
think what does windows phone is a
special case because they like their
their big new revised push didn't come
until later in the year so but it's
interesting that the iphone if from what
I'm hearing of what I'm hearing is
correct the iphone adoption rate in the
u.s. is so very different than it is
worldwide like it's much higher in the
state
than it is globally yes that is true
which is interesting because it's
kicking iOS happened down the Avenue all
over the rest of the world it's like 75
percent is and that's just normal
because Apple is using a different
business model for other countries for
instance if you buy an iphone 5 on logs
from Apple 46 49 99 in the States you
you'll buy it for 6 49 99 pounds in the
UK or six forty nine ninety nine euros
in Europe right so it's the iphone is a
very expensive phone in europe while
well android phones are cheap compared
to the iphone even if you buy the
highest than one is cheap still cheaper
than the iphone except in romania if you
buy a Lumia 920 at the same price as the
iphone 5 which is crazy yeah not to not
to call out another another publication
on the podcast but sam biddle at gizmodo
had a really really really cool piece
called what was it and android is
popular because it's cheap not because
it's good and it was a good example of
an article that actually was really good
despite its clickbait a headline but
it's true to a certain extent well yeah
to a certain extent and and that's where
that kind of nuances is what is the
first thing to die in a comment section
of course so I think last time I checked
gizmodo headquarters being burned to the
ground rabid fan boys that's uh thank
you for thank you for tying tying up the
iOS category 4s Tony I was struggling
getting news for that it's just amazing
how like unless you're butted right up
against WWDC or another apple event the
company for all its if for as far as its
fallen in recent years as far as secrecy
goes it still manages to keep a secret
better than mmm almost any company out
there I think even though that was not
the gate with the ipad mini on the
iphone 5 yeah well that's true ipad mini
was maybe the worst kept secret ever at
a raffle but yeah yeah so it's you know
it's it's tough we kind of the iOS fans
out there kind of s2 have to subsist on
rumors but it's okay because you know
that's what we do we bring your rumors
and speculation in addition to hard news
so before we wrap it up for the show I
wanted to tell our listener
is that we had a we had an email
transition recently and I am very happy
with the results but one of the
unfortunate side effects is that we lost
all of our listener mail so make sure
and send us some new listener mail as
you are very good at doing listeners so
that we can you know field your
questions and comments at the end of
each pocket now weekly that we have time
for but before we wrap it up and before
I give you that email address gentlemen
do you have closing thoughts for today
yep yes completely unrelated tune in
tomorrow to PM eastern for a live
hangout with the pocket now team Brandon
minimun Michael Fisher myself will be
there and on a weekly basis will meet
with you guys come over say hi let's do
some life boot up tests and have some
nice casual debates about everything
mobile and it's going to be awesome do
we have to have anybody else from the
team coming come on so far it's the
three of us but everybody on the team is
welcome to join so I'm gonna send some
emails out to the guys some reminders
because the initial email went out and
the worst case scenario is gonna be the
three of us best-case scenario it's
gonna be more I have an idea for the
pocket I live tomorrow let's talk about
something entirely different let's talk
about not what we talked about today
it'll be fun that is that that's the
entire idea it's gonna be completely
different from the bucket now weekly
podcast we'll just talk about whatever
comes to our minds that's good i'll get
my cigarettes again yeah I'm not allowed
to smoke in this office building but
that far for closing thoughts a few
smaller announcements relating to video
but they are small but there are things
that I think we're all excited about
number one is that we're launching a
YouTube channel redesign with some new
imagery and fun stuff number two is that
we have a new intro coming you know we
have our pocket now video intro I well
done yes but this one this one's gonna
be a lot shorter a little bit a little
bit more punchy and you consider them
Duncan no that's too
out of any more it'll be more
interesting than that it's it'll be you
know be to the point because people
really don't want to sit there and watch
it intro we like having an intro so you
know what kind of video you're watching
and the third bit of news is that in the
in the near future in the next few weeks
you're gonna see a new guy on video
perhaps a couple of new guys on video
still still working that out and so
we're doing some cool stuff in video
McGee land are we going to do hazing are
we gonna do like a crazy pocket on
hazing ritual what do you think we
should do for that I think we should
drops it we should drop some kyocera
echoes and microsoft kins in a big sock
and just wail on the new guys with them
that's what ideas are not playing for
the premaxilla no I I think the worst
possible thing we can do is give them
either a kin a kyocera echo or an
optimist view and make them use it as
their daily driver for a year that is an
awesome awesome idea that will drive
them insane and record the progress
every week yeah yeah yeahs week week 37
I uh I didn't get much sleep I haven't
eaten either i keep getting haunted by
grammatically incorrect dialog boxes and
my fingers ache from from holding this
is this unwieldy POS yeah yeah like it
well we will look forward to the new
faces on the team and i'm really looking
for the new intro the new intro combined
with our YouTube redesign makes us look
like like like like the persons we are
yeah but it but also look at these are
the people we are but yeah if like if
CSI was cool that's what it makes us
look like it makes it look like we know
where we're talking about right which
you know I think at least fifteen
percent of the time is true for me you
guys are probably close to 80 / I'm at
16 someone good oh no it's cuz it's been
doing long right um well good well if
you uh if you listeners want to hear
more from the guys who at least at least
fifteen percent of the time know what
