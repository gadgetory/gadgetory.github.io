it's roundup mobile world congress 2013
if you're seeing this message you
survived an epic week of tech news from
one of the biggest trade shows in the
world and i'm here to bring you our take
on it in five minutes or less i'm
michael fisher here with a recap of the
editorial and feature content from the
dot-com side of the house this is pocket
now roundup love them or hate them it's
samsung that customarily makes the big
splash at events like these and well the
lover hate question is being heatedly
debated in the comments of my editorial
on the galaxy s5 in it i make the point
that the s5 is being unfairly criticized
for being iterative even though it's a
bigger jump over the s4 then the s4 was
over the s3 fortunately for those who
disagree taylor martin is quick to
respond with a counterpoint stating that
the s5 is indeed just more of the same
from samsung while Adam doubt also takes
the opportunity to chime in with the
question of whether or not waterproofing
is indeed a gimmick check out all three
of those pieces and then sound off in
the comments below that wasn't all
Samsung brought to the party though as
expected the company debuted two
successors to its galaxy gear smartwatch
but in a twist it followed those up with
a third option the new gear fit once
again it's me offering an opinion on the
fit and its relationship to Samsung's
wearable strategy which will elaborate
on in the coming weeks as we secure demo
units and try the fit out for ourselves
fighting for spotlight space alongside
Samsung this week in our editorial space
HTC and LG each of whom brought new
devices to mwc this year Joe Levi weighs
in with his take on the new mid-range
HTC Desire calling it a device that for
the first time lives up to its name
while Taylor Martin says that LG's g2
mini is neither g2 nor particularly mini
this irks him he thinks the g2 mini is
more properly situated in LG's F line of
mid Rangers and he's got a pretty good
argument as to
by switching gears to nokia the company
brought not a windows phone to mwc but
three android phones all variations on
the much-talked-about nokia normandy or
x they're all stamped with Nokia's brand
and they're all running a version of
Google's OS but Joe Levi says these are
not real android phones do you agree
with our android guy or are you already
lining up at your local unlocked phone
dealer to snap up an ex of your own well
if you're in the letter group don't
forget to keep a finger on the pulse of
Nokia's soon to be owner microsoft while
you're waiting in that line as usual the
company is well represented in our
editorial features with taylor martin
posting his full review of the Lumia
icon Adam doubt speculating on the
future of the Lumia family under
Microsoft yours truly waxing nostalgic
about the Lumia 1520 and Adam Lane
making a great case for why the
forthcoming Action Center in Windows
Phone 8.1 is wrong all wrong as far as
other OEMs at MW seem like Sony our
Barcelona team was a little too busy
going hands-on with devices like the
Xperia tablet Z and Xperia z2 to pan any
editorials there fortunately though we
covered those and many more products
from ZTE Huawei and others on the pocket
now weekly podcast where you can tune in
to hear Anton and I may fill us in on
their first person experiences with
those OEMs and you'll also get a taste
of what it's like for an outfit like
pocket now to cover a big trade show
like this one it involves chasing taxis
on foot and blowing up surge suppressors
and exotic beverages like palinka and
rounding out the business on the
dot-coms out of the house where joe levi
and taylor martin if your smartphone's
got a big appetite for power and you're
not sure which battery pack to invest in
joe might have found the perfect
solution check out his zag spark 6000
review and then see why Taylor thinks
wireless calling should be standard on
modern smartphones of course there's
