we're going to take a look at two mobile
television entertainment experiences
both on HTC devices running Windows
Mobile on the top we have the HTC imagio
which runs vcast television service from
verizon wireless which operates on media
flow which is a Qualcomm technology so
your television content doesn't stream
over the internet rather there's a
separate terrestrial broadcasting
antenna that picks up service that way
on the bottom we're taking a look at
streaming service from slingplayer
mobile which you actually do have to
purchase a separate set top box which
streams your home television cable or
media content over the internet using
verizon wireless's evdo cdma network
since this is a verizon wireless touch
pro2 so let's go ahead and take a look
and see how smooth the services the
buffer times and if there are any audio
lags or chops i'm going to go ahead and
turn on the volume on the top device
which is the HTC imagio and see how that
performs and we're going to go ahead and
switch through channels so here we
actually have a more finger-friendly
intuitive menu you can actually flick to
scroll and change the channels we're
watching spongebob right now
little audio and video chop right there
in general the surface is pretty clear
sometimes you do experience a little bit
of choppiness and audio and video
performance as you see again right there
after you change the channel and it
looks like we have no TV signal right
now the interface is pretty nice it's
actually very finger friendly you have
large icons so you can tap on it bring
up programming guides where you can
flick through or tap and it does support
gesture so you can swipe to change the
channels which is pretty nice so I'm
going to go ahead and turn the volume
down on the top one and take a look at
the bottom one here where we have
slingplayer mobile running on the touch
pro 2 in landscape mode I'm going to go
ahead and increase the volume as you can
see here the controls are not as finger
friendly you do kind of have to use a
stylus or the hardware keyboard on the
bottom so you actually change the
channel you can go ahead and pull up the
programming guide change its channel 9
it's a little bit of choppiness at the
beginning where it's buffering the
quality isn't as crisp and clean as the
media flow service but it is definitely
watchable and it is actually quite good
a little bit of a delay after you hit
the channel that you want but once the
channel starts loading the quality is
pretty good and you don't really notice
too many audio choppiness or video lags
going to go ahead and turn down the
volume and we're going to take a look
now at the motorola krave which is
another device going to go ahead and
power that on go ahead set that aside
for a minute so you can watch the two
the motorola krave actually has a clear
touchscreen that you can press through
it's a consumer device it definitely has
a smaller screen than the HTC imagio but
still uses the same the cast television
experience that the Amazo uses so i'm
going to go ahead and launch the V CAST
service so on the top here we have the
crave and on the bottom we have the
imagio the crave definitely has a
smaller screen you can go ahead and
expand the screen here but the display
it gets a little bit distorted on the
imagio to fill out the screen on the
crave it's still very finger friendly
you still have the on-screen menus which
you can scroll through unfortunately it
is not a capacitive tour it is not a
resistive touchscreen so I can't use a
stylist you do need to use your fingers
the smaller screen makes a control a
little bit harder but the experience is
still the same you still get all the
programming guide the info button
and it really does replicate a set box
like experience on the V CAST mobile TV
experience so on the top the crave
motorola krave the bottom the HTC imagio
and then here we have the touch pro two
running slingplayer mobile so this is
chun win and that's a look at mobile
television on your mobile device thanks
so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
