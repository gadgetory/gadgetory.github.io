weekly
hello and welcome to the pilot episode
of pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss news and opinion from the world
of mobile technology that's smart phones
tablets phablets and everything in
between I'm your host Michael Fisher
contributing editor at pocket now and
I'm joined by our managing editor whose
name I still butcher even after months
and months Anton de Naude you it's not
nautical everybody and our
editor-in-chief Brandon minimun good day
good day good day gentlemen this is very
very exciting how are you both today
excellente I you know I'd be better if I
didn't miss the new episode of Keeping
Up with the Kardashians last night I oh
man that sucks I just wanted to know
what happened with Courtney you know
she's uh she's pregnant and she's she's
a little bit on edge and you know
Scott's opening as a restaurant you know
I just it's a social so fun to see all
of it come together but I guess I'll
have to catch it on DVR or I think we
should give out your personal email
address and the people should just start
sending you email of what happens start
sending you spoilers about the next step
so they're keeping up with the
kardashians yeah I think that's a good
recurring idea fine i just want open
them then um we uh this is an entirely
new endeavor for us at at pocket now not
for you guys so much you guys were on
the the last iteration of the pocket now
podcast but this is something entirely
new this is in keeping with our new
format with the pot what we're calling
pocket now five-point oh and before we
get started before I kind of talk about
how we're gonna do this going forward
would like to hear from Brandon about
about how this fits in with the new
pocket now so Brandon take it a wish
yeah sure so about a year ago a year ago
in August we decide to press reboot on a
lot of things I think like a lot of
businesses out there we had to sort of
reinvent ourselves to to stay
competitive and and most importantly to
evolve him to change and to do better
really um so we wanted to change and we
wanted to evolve and so we had this I
dia that we were going to relaunch
pocket now in a big way pocket now has
been around for about 12 years and it
just so happens that if we were to
redesign the site and this is last year
it would be the fifth iteration of the
site so we uh we decided to give it kind
of a cute name pocketnow five Five's a
nice round number and we we wanted to
focus on a lot of different areas we
wanted to focus on quality of
presentation of content because the blog
model is nice that is when you go to a
website and there's a huge listing of
content and you kind of read it like a
personal blog that's evolved into
something more professional that's okay
but there's something to be said for big
beautiful images magazine like features
and even custom typography so we wanted
to do that we wanted to focus our
content more so on in-depth editorial
rather than just news and finally we
wanted to really evolve our video
offering with a far higher production
quality more sort of TV show style
videos rather than you know let's fire
up the camera i'm going to show you the
device which is good to this quick and
dirty videos are good but we wanted to
really up the cup the quality um so so
we kind of press to reboot and with that
last year we put off the podcast until
things kind of settle down after we we
sort of fit into this new pocket now
five um you know system and so so here
we are with the new show which is called
pocket now weekly and we've got a lot of
cool things coming up we've got some
special guests plan for the future we're
going to be having different pocket now
editor's come on here on a sort of
rotational basis so you get to hear from
different people since we all have
unique perspectives and and yes we're
excited for the the reboot you very much
so yeah thank you and this is uh it's
very exciting because I just on a
personal note you know I came in to kind
of the tech field and I started
following phones and mobile technology
based on a lot of the podcasts that I
that I used to listen to you know and I
this is one of the things that I really
wanted to do when I came on board the
pocket our team a couple months ago and
I'm really glad we're finally getting it
could sort of restarted here so this is
an exciting day
I get to use my my big blue microphone
thing you know the the snowball yeah I
was telling me you guys are working with
the same microphone right time almost
i'm using the yeti because in here in
Romania Yeti means a person describes a
person who lives in the forest and this
pretty ugly that's why I chosen this
microphone well no actually because it's
it's a top-of-the-line state-of-the-art
microphone but yeah I don't want to make
any commercials or ads but these types
of microphones are perfect that is
awesome I'm using for the record amusing
ass on hyser interview mic in a in a
padded four by six room that will be
familiar to the viewers of some of my
reviews because it's just gray grey egg
crates all over the walls so if you if
you go insane in that room Michael
you're covered because if you smell
you're into the North Sea yeah I'm
completely safe from myself and and
others are safe from me it's great and
you cannot smash a phone right that's
true unless I throw it at the imac in
front of me which you know what probably
do the imac a favor put it out of its
misery at any rate the part of the new
format part of the part of the new kind
of podcast formula is that we're going
to be doing a weekly show with four
segments we cover basically three major
platforms at pocket now we cover Windows
Phone iOS and Android we also have a
miscellaneous section for stuff that
pops up you know occasionally blackberry
will still make news and symbian and
amigos in the news recently actually but
that we put the misc section toward the
end and toward the end of the hour we
have a debate topic we're going to try
this out and see see what we can do with
that we just have kind of a two minute
session where we one of us puts out an
idea that may be stupid oh it's gonna be
longer shall no longer a 25 minute
segment now but ideally we try to get
the show's under an hour we're going to
solicit some feedback from from you
listeners and and stuff like that we'll
talk more about that at the end here but
for now gentleman why don't we when we
get started when we talk about the news
of the week here well first first
actually oh please I was um
was read out loud I wasn't really i was
listening to the last when it was called
the pocket castle last episode and it
was 13 months ago in August and it's
amazing how so much has changed in yet
so much has not changed some of the
headlines then were that everyone is
suing everyone that is still the case uh
that that Google was buying motorola and
you know that went through successfully
but nothing really has happened I'm sure
it's gonna take years for us to yeah to
see anything come out of that um sadly
the around that time Steve Jobs had
stepped down as CEO when we all you know
we're hypothesizing why that might be so
it's it's it's amazing you know 13
months is a long time but um you know
not that much has changed the screen
sizes on phones are far bigger now yeah
i just finished i just mentioned that i
just finished up putting together a
review which should be out by the time
this this episode goes live the huawei
ascend p1 and i mentioned that like it's
got a 4.3 inch display but it feels like
it's three and a half inches because
there's just all the screen size we're
in this age of jumbo phones which is
just ridiculous but i've been spoiled
along with everybody else and I know you
guys have have to I don't think you guys
have any blushes about that though you
like your big phones of the bends it
depends from a person to person for me
the most important thing is one-handed
usability and well I can tell you that
the samsung galaxy s3 which i'm using at
the moment offers me a certain amount of
one-handed usability i totally managed
to kill that by installing the flip
cover the smart cover or how they call
it the one which is similar to the
galaxy note when I have some bags or
something else in my hand and I won't
take out my phone from my pocket or from
my man purse I just cannot use it with
one hand he's talking about the flip
cover that opens up like a book like the
one day exactly that's the one yeah they
manage to I actually I managed to kill
my 100 usability on the galaxy s3 yeah
that thing we got to talk about that
thing at some point cuz I I need to
understand its its utility there's none
thank you
but before then we have we have some
more recent news and we might as well
just just kick it out for this one I I
need to know that I need to just say
this that this is the reality of the
situation a judge actually said is
actually said that the galaxy tab is not
as cool as the iPad this is a story from
from just what is this yesterday it's
really recent and it's from England and
it's from England right and I've been
sort of i just had an opportunity to
gloss over the the the ruling this
preliminary injunction kind of stuff who
has the the real bead on this one
because i need to know more about this
is it you boy I had a notorious all the
suing going on lately and whether the
actual lawsuits are meant to protect or
to attack and it's generated leather
buzz yeah i'm i finished law school I'm
not specialized on intellectual property
so I'm not gonna go into that much
detail but to get back to your point I
have a very interesting question that
popped into my mind when i read that
news post and i can figure out what's
worst for samsung getting an injunction
for a tablet which is almost one and a
half years old and it's no longer
selling or to have somebody on authority
a judge say that your product is not as
cool as the apple ipad what's worse
really what's worse than that I'd you
got me i mean this is this is just the
fascinating like i'm reading the quote
here the judge explains how the androids
do not have the same understated and
extreme simplicity which is possessed
the apple does you know what please mr.
judge do set out that injunction but
take back they're not as cool stuff yeah
no I mean but you know this is exactly
the kind of bait for for fanboys and
enthusiasts alike I'm not gonna you know
call anybody names for having an opinion
about this kind of thing I mean this is
exactly the kind of thing that we do on
the internet constantly right we have
these platform fans just add each
other's throats discussing
the differences between their platforms
and how angry they are that the other
one gets more attention or the other one
is you know more advanced features or
whatever and now you have a judge saying
and I don't know I just don't know what
to really i'm making excused I'm used to
people throwing stuff at me of course
virtually on youtube or in the comments
so I'm gonna set that out straight if
you guys remember back in October when
when this whole lawsuit thing started in
the US and across the world and there
was a certain situation where the judge
held both the samsung galaxy tab and the
ipad up above her head and asked
samsung's lawyers from 10 feet away to
identify their product and Samsung
lawyers were not able to tell apart the
iPad from the galaxy tab really happy
yeah it did wow I didn't hear about that
that's amazing well maybe that's because
the two tablets are that much alike or
maybe because the lawyers were not
actually that much into technical stuff
or design stuff I'm not gonna say my
opinion on this really I don't want
anybody to here's me you set samsung and
their and their marketing material for
their devices is very different than
Apple you know Apple is all about it you
know about the emotional aspect and
things working just well and elegance
and such Samsung is kind of like the
ante Apple like the next big thing is
already here you don't have to wait for
the apple announcement which is sort of
what is implied so i don't i don't think
that what the judge has said is that
will have a negative impact on on
samsung or their marketing efforts even
though this will hit every newspaper
that covers you know business and
technology um it's just it's just kind
of funny right and because it is an
irresistible headline right like I mean
it's I love that I love that this is the
headline like galaxy tab not as cool as
ipad and it's coming from a judge from
our village yeah I know and no you're
right i mean you know people gonna be up
in arms about this and the legal
ramifications of this may be may not be
as far-reaching as it as it seems i
don't know i will not i did not finish
law school Tony so I will not comment on
it either I keep forgetting that that's
true about you so you don't want for
hate mails right well they're nothing
and and I that's something I want to
talk about at some point in the future
in a future podcast like how you know
commenters sometimes like win the day
when we're having a really busy Newsweek
and it's like you know we make a point
that's like you know maybe I seem to
recall making the point at some point
about the Lumia 900 it was like maybe
you know maybe this isn't um the best
phone ever invented and about 120 people
were like how very what are you talking
you know just the whole site exploded
and I was I was too busy to respond to
all the comments I was like wow this is
um this is amazing so we're gonna talk
about that a little bit future but I
know you guys have had that time and
time again which is why you're being
very careful in your words right now I
don't I don't mind saying you know how I
i I've got opinions just like just like
everyone else so sure i don't i don't
mind i think it's it's imperative that
we keep our opinions as unbiased as
possible and keep saying them because
this is what sets us apart from from
others i mean i will tell you that x
product is worse than a wide product
because i think that's the truth because
I as a reviewer feel that experience
that and I think this is exactly that
sets us apart from others that we say
out loud straight whatever we think and
if its fate male material bring it on ya
know it's a good that's a good point
bring it on has as you know some
interesting connotations from an
American perspective as a quote but um
you know we'll talk about it later yeah
you know it's it's increasingly hard to
remain unbiased I think um in in this
space because I guess it's always been
this way in journalism you know you've
got you know some companies that I won't
mention a you know willing journalists
by sending them on retreats with dinners
and um indoor skydiving and stuff and
then they show them the product and of
course they're gonna love it I mean
cheesy took me out to dinner you you
gave me a great afternoon or a great
night you're paying for my flight out
here um it's just it's it's a it's tough
to stay biased when those things happen
but yeah we really try I'm biased yeah
stay I'm bias right yeah no I agree and
yeah I think that's a that's a
interesting line to have to walk for
four people in our field especially
because there are so many companies with
ya with deep pockets but with a strong
incentive to kind of yes sell their
product hard on you I know a one quick
question again for you guys what do you
think it's worth worse having a product
under circum the circumstances which
allow you to be biased and say your
opinion which would be favorable to the
product and probably people will buy
that according to your review and maybe
return it or just say unbiased Lee that
it's a mediocre or a bad product which
which is worse or which is better no I
mean the only choice is is the second
right because in the first scenario if
you say this phone you know has no lag
and someone buys it and then they say
this is the laggies phone i've ever used
what was what was that guy talking about
they're gonna remember that and they're
not gonna come back and exactly got your
future reviews so you have you gotta you
gotta get get it right the the first
time and I I think that and I this is a
huge tension I think that you know
journalists and and you know in this
industry specifically we help to push
the industry forward we hope to nudge it
by saying you know since four-point-oh
is ok but it you know it's not that good
at the end of the day there's a lot
wrong with it still and it you know it
needs to be better go back and fix it
and then we'll say it's great and then
will endorse it but um you know I think
I think we have that role to play to
help the industry get better I think
that's exactly the core of it i mean
it's it's it's you know everyone wants
products to improve everyone wants
things to get better and this is
something i run into in my other the
other parts of my life where you know
I'm an actor and and you come offstage
and all your friends and family are
always very willing to tell you how
great you were because you know it's
very polite and whatever and that's how
but you never ever improve if people are
just always telling you how wonderful
you were even if they don't believe it
and that's true in any field that's true
in any craft in any skill set so yeah
I think it's really really critical to
give honest opinions for the health of
the industry so I agree yeah anyway that
was yeah that was it was a good that was
like we had her first tangent gentlemen
that's very nice I I have this this
strong urge to to do another tangent I I
need have you need you need you need
incentive or disincentive to dig do i
need to any dozens n to go to the next
all right but file that though cuz we're
gonna eat it later okay um I ok so let's
let's move on here I want to talk about
jelly bean because I don't have it I
know that we are running it I know
Brendan you have a you have a nexus 7
you're running it on your Galaxy Nexus I
told tony i made the admission to Tony
then I'm not running with a rooted
galaxy nexus even though i have a galaxy
nexus and he could shook his head in
shame you you should have kept us
between you and me you know you know
what whatever i'll take the heat now it
sound unity it's cool um no but I really
do I want to hear I just read Brandon's
editorial just went up about jelly bean
using jelly bean two weeks later you
know I want to I want to talk about that
time i wanna i want to hear your
condensed impressions Brandon yeah good
well I want to talk that too good um so
in in every Android every Android device
i've ever used with the exception of the
galaxy nexus running jellybean there's a
little hint um uh it's i've found plenty
of places where the UI is laggy that
means when you press the these tasks
which are button it like kind of
flutters open right that's not a that's
not a good work flow if i want to bounce
between apps i don't want to wait for a
stupid flutter to open um not only that
going to the app tray the notification
shade the going into settings there's
just a look there's a delay and the
operating system is almost struggle to
do the most basic things and I don't
care if you've got a quad core phone or
the latest Krait processor from
Snapdragon or two gigs of RAM on the
galaxy s3 it doesn't matter it's it's
Android it is the software and I am so
thankful that Google
finally realize this and in the
incremental update that is jelly bean
the point dot X update I guess you'd say
they've really done something
significant as a to frame this properly
I've got my quad core galaxy s3 running
cyanogenmod 9 and it's fast like it is
really fast it's it's faster than the
previous fastest phone i've ever used
which was the galaxy s the galaxy s2
running running villain rom which is a
great which is a great run I don't name
to it is an awesome rom name and and it
so I've got my galaxy s 3 quad-core
running cyanogenmod 9 stock Ice Cream
Sandwich plus more because it's got some
speed tweaks and whatnot and then I've
got my galaxy nexus which was released
you know in November or whatever of last
year running jellybean and I keep going
back to the Galaxy Nexus running
jellybean even though the screen is
smaller and you know you've got the
on-screen buttons which take up vertical
space and even though it's got a mere
dual-core 1.2 gigahertz processor which
is still pretty brawny it's a
significantly better experience because
it's so smooth and so quick and and so
responsive I think that's the key it's
responsive meaning when you do something
it responds it doesn't think it doesn't
give you checkerboards it's it's a
revelation and it's it's gonna change
android would you say it's it's more it
is more so buttery smooth than then say
iOS then say then Windows Phone 7 on
solid hardware I mean what year oh and
I'm just just asking the tough questions
here Tony yeah you know I think I think
Windows Phone and Iowa's do something
very interesting I don't know the
technical term for it and there's there
have been articles about it how it
prioritizes touch input so it will
actually you know for example stock
loading a web page as you move it around
just so you get the illusion that it's
very responsive and so an Android always
lacked that so I think what Android has
done here is that it's caught up to
Windows Phone and it's caught up to iOS
and it's funny if you take an iphone
4s and you go into the browser and you
flick around a long web page like
engadget very long and you do the same
thing on jelly bean they're equally as
smooth uh it's it's so so I'd say jelly
bean catches up it doesn't necessarily
surpass in terms of the fluidity of the
interface you know what my biggest
concern is regarding Android I mean I
can agree to the fact that jelly bean is
the fastest android to date I can agree
that project butter is an excellent
thing and optimization is also a good
thing but i'm afraid that whenever jelly
bean rom start coming out officially
because they will come to the HTC One X
to the samsung galaxy s3 to other
products that OMS will still bundle
sense TouchWiz and that will probably
hold jelly bean down and I'm afraid that
they will kill this buttery smoothness
at least in and cents or as as deep as
it goes within the operating system I
mean TouchWiz UX nature is fast it's
lightweight but it's still at some bulk
and I'm afraid that these custom ui's
will take away from the smoothness of
jelly bean at least that's my concern at
this moment do we know anything about
about how much Google is gonna allow
OEMs to to change within that was much
as they want this is free reign yeah um
I mean like 'man down to that like isn't
isn't that kind of project butter stuff
is not like like Colonel layer stuff or
am i it's it's deep and I'm thinking
back to when froyo was released and the
the difference between android 2.1 and
2.2 froyo was the inclusion of it's
called dalvik JIT just in time and I
don't know exactly what that means but
it was a it it changed it changed the
experience compiler right it's like a
via to compiles the because its Android
is a what is a compiled environment I
don't know I all I remember is this
stuff from webos so which was not a
compiled environment had to be
interpreted on the fly which is why it
was always lagging no matter what right
so it go on sorry yeah so it yeah it's
so with this with this compiler I think
I think what that
means is that it runs the apps in a
different kind of environment or
something but anyway the point is that
it was faster then we saw all of these
froyo roms come out with sense and with
TouchWiz and they were significantly
faster than the 2.1 version that these
devices originally shipped with because
of the underpinnings 2.2 kind of you
know the the OEMs really couldn't strip
that part out I don't think they would
if they wanted to and they could put
their their interface on top of it and
it remained fast so to answer your
concerned I think that jellybean roms
will still be fast and they will still
have the inter place replacements on top
but they'll still be incrementally
faster and to touch on your question
Michael and a little bit from your
answer Brandon let's take instance the
the 1x for instance with sense for point
oh we've seen it was a huge news back in
the day when when people found out that
HTC was tweaking the multitasking
functionality on the 1x meaning that
they killed background processes because
they optimized the usage of the phone
and the background applications and
tweaked it to the HTC One X so I'm
afraid that OMS will probably tweak some
core elements of Android to deliver what
they think better user experience on
their phones but on the overall general
I think they will probably kill
something else so again let's hope I'm
wrong so what are we doing that happens
we flash a custom rom we flash custom
rom yeah which I I have the feeling that
99% of people still don't do because
they're I guess they're worried about
voiding the warranty they're worried
about breaking their device on their
legitimate concerns it's still not for
the faint of heart but um you know tools
tools have become a lot easier to use to
root your phone to flash a custom boot
loader and you know what once would take
an hour to of you know you know working
in a command prompt now can be done in
15 minutes as long as you know where to
look yeah it is a lot easier nowadays I
mean I'll tell you why I didn't do it on
my on my daily driver
I've rooted so you know I had it ripped
the I didn't stall cm9 on the HP
TouchPad here i think i put android on
the veer in one video like you know I've
done it it's just a pain and I
understand that the average I understand
the average joe's thing like yeah it's
15 minutes if you know what you're doing
if you don't know what you're doing and
gotta hunt around for the information
you don't have the XDA thread you know
bookmarked then it's you know it can
take a long time that's a significant
investment of time and effort and I
understand why why it's still not taken
hold of you know in the average Joe kind
of sector that utilize it plus the that
plus the fact that most of the people
don't really care about milliseconds
left or milliseconds right like us geeks
do so they don't care that if i push the
home button on the galaxy s3 and goes
home in one second so that they look up
the eggsy thread which says that if you
disable s voice it will be instant so
maybe that's the difference between
geeks and the normal user which makes me
feel glad that that we we cater
predominantly to the power user so we
can talk about this stuff yeah we do
right yeah other people don't know why
we're looking at their galaxy s3 their
unmodded galaxy s3 with just just
discussed over the Thanksgiving dinner
to my friend just got um the a blue a
beautiful blue although it looks purple
the pebble to pebble blue galaxy s3 on
eighteen t I look at it I flipped
through the screens and I'm like dude
you should really install cyanogenmod
not on this it's much better nice like
why I just upgraded from the captivate
and I might be you have annoyed you have
no idea what you're missing look how
slow this is and I press a button and
he's like wow that was fast and I'm like
no it wasn't that took like 1.2 seconds
I could've taken point five seconds
we'll see right well and I mentioned
this a second ago but remember I came
from I came from the land of webos so
everything is fast to me oh yeah it's a
matter of perspective it is but we like
speaking of roms I mean the jelly bean
the source code is out now right so I
mean we should be seeing jelly bean rums
and in short order if we don't if we
haven't seen them already is that
correct yeah well yeah we're gonna see
some you know the the the process is
complicated Tony now we're talking about
said today to compile
an actual rom from source but then
you've got to get it to work on your
device gotta get bluetooth or Wi-Fi the
phone and and that stuff takes a lot of
skill and that's where you know the
development communities come into play
and then you've got you know the other
rom products like the villain rom i
mentioned cyanogenmod 9 or 10 i guess in
this case with that will take take a lot
longer as they try to make something
more stable because some of these early
builds that you'll probably see this
week and next week we'll say you know
what's working is you know phone and
Wi-Fi what's not working as the camera
or like bluetooth doesn't flip on I've
seen depending on the drivers right yeah
I've got a good friend here who was
installed who was running a very early
build of ICS or i guess it was cm9 you
know version of ICS on his droid bionic
and though that's an LTE device here in
the states you know that it was such an
early build that he only had one ex you
know capabilities so he's got out
amazing looking skin and it's really
awesome and then I'd try and watch him
like I'd walk him try and load a webpage
over you know a 56k connection and it
was like oh this is hilarious yeah that
guy that guy's a trooper because most
people I think most people would say you
know this isn't even worth it if my
bluetooth or my you know 3g doesn't work
but that's that's that's commendable
she's i should a real a real like top of
the line android gig want to get him on
the show sometime that'll be great um
another thing i should mention i'm such
a huge proponent of you know rooting
your phone and doing all that good stuff
to it the beauty of the process is that
once you do it the first time once you
root your phone install a custom boot
loader installing a third-party rom
becomes as easy as like changing your
underwear literally you lo the you load
the rom excellent analogy ok you load
the rom onto your phone you could do it
through through the clockworkmod or
what's it what's it called the rom
manager you could do it through rom
manager and then it reboots your phone
into recovery and it does it for you and
literally in seconds you can have a
different rom on your phone it's and
then you can backup individual roms I
mean this is probably not new to many
people listening but so let's say you
want you you got
cyanogenmod 9 on your phone you've got
all of your files set up all of your
settings mmm and then you see that uh me
you I miui whatever it's called is is
has been ported to your phoning you want
to try it out you want to see what the
buzz is about so you sew you back up
your entire cm9 rom you try this miui
thing and if it doesn't work out you can
go back to the exact same copy with all
your settings all your files running cm9
so there's a lot of beauty into the
process once you invest the time in the
beginning yeah that's and once you start
doing that you become addicted yes it is
an addiction oh yes I don't do drugs
completely agree with we I want to talk
more about that we have to we do need to
move on because we are already running
over time and I love that because I love
talking but um I I hope people love
listening to us I think they well we
need more of your dulcet tones Tony I
love your accent we were talking about
this off the air I I cannot get enough
of to Tony can just read me a phone book
it doesn't matter what you want me to
these sloppy with mel i would like to
have seen Montana it's just is this what
you guys do when I'm not yeah this is
that worked out yeah yeah ask me but I
only see it in on pop cans and once a
week right yeah no but we're still want
to talk about jelly bean because we have
we have nexus 7's coming to us like a
lot of people in the world and I I need
to know I need to know what what to be
what you guys are excited about I want
to hear you know I know Brandon you
already have one Tony yours is you you
have one coming to you right no and I
would you know I don't tell me why uh
I'll tell you why while I answered a
question why I'm excited about the nexus
7 because I am excited but I'm not
excited about the tablet itself this
might sound complicated let me
uncomplicated and I am NOT excited about
the nexus 7 itself I am NOT excited
about jelly bean I am NOT excited about
the series doing hardware what I am
finally excited about is that Google
finally decided to go with nexus tablets
to have their own tablets for the
developer
community for the power users to have a
standard hardware to which OEMs can
catch up this is I think what's most
important about the nexus 7 not the
hardware not the price point not the OS
the fact that it's a pure Android tablet
and it's a benchmark it's a target for
OEMs and other tablet makers to go
beyond yeah from an industry perspective
it's very very significant yes it's very
significant and it's very it's very very
quiet in the android tablet world right
now and I know IFA is coming up next
month and you guys are gonna be there
you're gonna see the stuff but it's been
a weird year there's been the galaxy tab
up to which is horrible it's it'll mine
that good it's a minor iteration over
the galaxy tab and then HTC has done
absolutely nothing Motorola had some
follow-ups to the zoom which were which
were pretty terrible again incremental
small up updates that really didn't
bring anything amazing to the table my
my hope and my wish is that next month
or as we get into the holiday season
we're gonna see like high-res 7-inch
tablets with quad-core processors great
battery life and finally some some
movement in the tablet world and and and
yeah as you guys implied this this nexus
7 is is a is big because it's going to
drive prices down as much as the OEMs
are gonna hate it but but what's the
what that's going to do is more people
will have android tablets developers are
going to take notice finally this
problem of very few Android tablet apps
is going to be fixed and we're all gonna
live happy ever happily ever after with
like 10 tablets in every room in every
household I've got more berries for that
reality because I you know I wrote a
piece recently about how it is possible
to make beautiful Android tablet apps
and I mean digging for those finding
beautiful android tablet apps was so
incredibly difficult I mean there are
aggregates out there specifically to
find you know android tab android apps
that are optimized for tablet and even
those aggregators are flooded with you
know bad search results whether you know
blowing up phone apps and it's such an
incredible problem and it's amazing that
it's a problem that's gone on for so
long
and yeah you're right it's hard to find
the apps and what's really interesting
is when you're on the iPad and you
search for like Twitter you get to
search results one with ipad apps one
with iphone apps and when you search a
Google tablet you don't get that but
it's kind of by design because they I
think the idea is that the app will live
in either tablet or phone environment if
if code it that way and ninety-nine
percent of them are not coated that way
right yeah I like their their philosophy
behind that you know I think it's a
something wonderful to aspire to or I
forgot whether it was Larry pager or
Sergey Brin who was like you know a
developer should never have to build an
app more than once yeah you know I and I
get that and I you know that's one way
to be friendly their developers but it's
resulted in this this world where you
know I don't you know I have an Android
tablet it's the touchpad it's nothing
amazing but i also have an ipad here and
I don't need to tell you which one I use
more often because it's more much more
pleasurable to use an iPad yep there's
there is a section in the in Google Play
if you're using a tablet that says
tablet staff picks have you ever seen
that Michael oh yeah yeah I once or
twice and and and that's where I sort of
I sort of go sometimes and I'm like oh
well what cool and there's it's just you
know like Baron it's it's barren and
there's nothing like innovative in there
and yeah it's a it's a sad story so so
to circle back to the Nexus 7 this could
very well be be the catalyst that the
changes that and I hope it is and if
it's not you know if if for some reason
the Nexus 7 is not the you know the fire
under the butts of Google and then their
developer efforts then you know maybe
another app story is maybe it's going to
be the new kindle fire you know which we
have seen renters for recently i find it
very difficult to get excited about
Kindles I'm excited about them from an
industry perspective but not personally
I don't the kindle fire was not an
interesting device to me personally so
what what are the renders in our that we
that we reported on into
here well let me start by first because
it's gonna be a short intervention I
haven't used Kindles and ever never
because I'm in Romania and I can't get
those here but I know because I write
about about them I read about them so I
know what what they're all about now
about the new kindle fire let's talk
about the seven because there are two
rumors the 7 inch and the 10 inch and
both of them are placed specifically in
a certain region of the market the
7-inch kindle fire is of course going to
compete with the nexus 7 and the Galaxy
Tab 7.7 so is gonna aim towards those
who want a tablet which is smaller than
the ipad it's larger than the galaxy
note which is a phablet and something
like that and then okay but don't forget
yeah right which isn't available again
in Romania and we have the 10 inch
kindle fire which is rumored which will
specifically target the ipad now i'm not
exactly sure whether they will manage to
do that or or not but to circle back to
your question about the renders these
renders were based off of rumors of what
we've heard from several sources like VG
times like BGR what people quoting
anonymous sources close to the matter
say i think that as usual with leaks
it's it's twofold either their spot on
or either or or they're completely
different from what the real deal would
be would i buy a tablet a kindle if it
was available in romania and it would
have it would look like the one in the
renders probably not because my tablet
usage requires me more power user access
I don't need the new fancy you why
because I don't use a tablet for
consuming content but of course you're a
region of the market which is which is
their target uses that so sure enough to
say well you know use a tablet for
consuming content did you say no I'm
using a tablet more as a mobile office
I'm using a smartphone for consuming
content for pictures for music for for
facebook social networking I'm using my
tablet when I am out I don't want to
take my laptop with me and I
writing either news or or managing stuff
i've been using android tablets for that
because it allows access to upload from
from the file from the file system but
iOS 6 will bring that and then probably
i will switch back to the ipad when
working right yeah it's it's just it's
fascinating cuz we always think of
tablets as exclusively almost content
consumption devices because that's how
they're constantly positioned and
hearing that somebody is able to be like
be productive on one on a regular basis
is always kind of encouraging because
we're constantly told that we're in this
we're entering this post-pc era you know
we're tablets are gonna kind of really
usurp the role of notebooks and I tend
to believe that's true it's just really
really slow from a Productivity
standpoint well let me give you my
personal examples you will never see me
take pictures with my tablet you will
never see me kicking it to Bon Jovi from
my tablet and he will most probably not
see me watching a movie from my tablet
because I have my laptop for that so
what what remains is that I have a small
device which is comparable in size with
my 11 inch notebook which I can take
wherever I want offers me five six seven
eight nine hours of battery life and
allows me to work easily from everywhere
so that's that's my usage of a tablet
nice what about you Brenda I it's it's
interesting because uh I don't I don't
know if we were going to talk about the
surface but I'm going to talk about the
surface now we're gonna talk about the
service um I I kind of use a tablet for
all of the above and I'm uh I'm a big
tablet guy in fact on my Twitter bio
says I'm a tablet lover so it must be
true I I think I love my wife more but
the tablet were coming this close second
it's a felon it it must be true yes um I
use a tablet to consume webpages
newspapers books I've yet to find a
tablet good enough to be an awesome book
reader i mean the nexus 7 comes close
but even that that the screen isn't
amazing i can still see pixels i hate
seeing pixels do um and it um
it's it's a little too thick and
cumbersome I mean it's it's getting
there so I haven't found the ultimate
reading tablet except I guess if you
want to consider the kindle with an e
ink display i think that's my my book
reading device of choice but there are a
lot of times where i'm using say an ipad
which is stomach the favorite tablet my
favorite tablet the new ipad and I think
to myself jeez I can't do X right now
and X could be I can't use adobe
photoshop and edit this image the way i
want with a mouse and keyboard or i
can't type in an extremely long email
and feel confident editing it by tapping
on the screen and seeing that little
magnification come up I can't and I'm
running out of things because it's time
goes on there she were a few things I
can't use my you know my my ftp client
which stores you know the certain file
locations just just the way i want you
cannot upload a picture to post right
unless you're running ios6 yeah yeah
exactly sure which is ridiculous and
then I start thinking like this
Microsoft Surface thing has a can have
some pretty big advantages especially
with that cool cover that doubles is
like a trackpad and am and then the
keyboard um you know if and and this
only applies to the pro version and the
pro version is gonna be like 13
millimeters thick and the screen res
isn't that blubber block I can complain
all day about it but it gets closer to
that reality of like here's a device I
can use it for everything literally um
so I'm kind of I'm kind of curious to
see hopefully they're not too expensive
the surface pro to fill in to fill in
those times when I you know I need to
use photoshop or I need to use my ftp
client or whatever I think based on the
fact that they did not announce prices
at that event and and and based on what
they've done before you know Microsoft I
I hesitate to say that I've tend to
think your hopes will be dashed I think
those are going to be really expensive
tablets I've not basing that on anything
I don't know I mean do you do you guys
what do you think about that we weren't
going to talk about the service today
but i'm curious now because here's a
prediction is what has to pretty you
know is what I
to compete with the ipad but what about
the other one go ahead here's a
prediction for from me the cheaper
versions will be around the same price
tag as Android tablets and the pro
versions will be in the same price tag
as the ipad no no what is bold man
that's not that's not the pro versions
gonna be as much as an as an ultrabook
it's gonna be a grand then nobody's
gonna buy that I'm not gonna bite it I'm
gonna buy a macbook here I think both of
those things are true I think that
pricing is what's gonna happen and I
think nobody's gonna buy the the pro
versions wait a sec Microsoft is going
to use their uh use their massive
amounts of cash to convince you that you
really need to get a surface and you
need to spend you know and unless
yourself put some money in my pockets
which I don't have to spend that much on
its surface then there's no issue really
so Bryce is very important but then
again but then again you guys all have
you know you've got your MacBook Airs
you've got a tablet well the people that
are to buy the surface pro are gonna be
people who are like geez I need a laptop
and I want it to be fin I went in to
have great battery life kind of cool if
it would have a touch screen so it have
that like ipad like thing oh wait
there's this thing it's called the
surface pro it's around the same price
as the samsung series 9 but it seems to
have more utility i'm gonna buy it you
know it's kind of that scenario where
people buy i see that conversation
happening you know in a similar way at
first where it's like oh man yeah I'd
like to have you know I need a laptop I
need something to be portable and it's
like how manner be nice if it at a touch
screen because we had that like ipad
like thing oh well that surface thing is
like whatever it's like 800 bucks hey
why don't I just get an ipad ah yeah
that's like you know what's possible
it's possible that the pro version will
be more targeted towards as HP said
towards the business consumer towards
corporations towards IT departments
towards businessman who are on the go
and probably the RT version will be the
go-to microsoft tablet that could well
be I guess we'll have to wait and see on
that well since since we're already
talking about Windows Phone stuff and
since
um I I really are excuse me not windows
phone stuff we're talking my windows
stuff but I want to ask about what you
guys think is is next for the the Lumia
thing we've been kind of quiet on the
Nokia front we had like two weeks there
were I guess analysts it was really hip
for four analysts to speculate about the
future of Nokia and or excuse me the
lack of a future in nokia like there was
a lot of fun flying around and the pink
nokia lumia is about to come out and
because that's news there there has to
be another Lumia coming up on the
horizon and Richard Karis the he's the
developer relations guy right for nokia
yep yeah he said so that there's that
there's a looming on the horizon with
with PureView technology which we've
kind of all have anticipated coming how
long do you think do you guys think we
have to wait for the next Lumia phone
because I want it um yeah I you know I I
had to talk myself out of buying a Lumia
900 the other day I'm of course I've
carried it before I've got used review
units whatever but I really I I want a
Lumia phone now the only reason go ahead
but the only reason I'm not using a
Lumia 900 Michael's because in episode I
think it was one of after the buzz you
said it gave you a blister and I don't
want gave me AB establecer right in the
middle of my palm and I was ostracized
from my social circles so I I will not
forgive it I think I believe and this is
gonna piss a lot of people off but this
is still what I believe that Microsoft
somehow shut themselves in the leg with
Windows Phone 8 I mean after the
announcement of Windows Phone 8 and the
fact that it's coming summer in q3 q4
regardless do you can you find any
reasons to convince me to buy a windows
phone now knowing that there will be no
upgrade except for of course windows
phone 7.8 which is not the real deal I I
think I think people I ok ok if I were
on a contract and you know i just bought
a Lumia 900 and I learned that I would
only get windows phone 7.8 I'd be I I
would be upset but thinking more broadly
I think people should stop complaining
about it because
the best parts of Windows Phone 8 most
notably the improved Start screen is
coming to legacy devices or the vast
majority of them and I think that's what
people should look at I agree i wrote a
piece on this and I I was so it related
to be able to kind of like dive into
this and look at what the differences
are and so much of this is is just a
messaging problem on Microsoft's end
like yeah yes we have an application
framework change and that's that is a
big deal but it microsoft is not going
to leave those people behind they're not
going to just like leave the windows
phone seven people out in the out of the
wind because they can't afford to
because they're so few of them that they
can't afford to let them go so you you
know and you can't so much of Windows
Phone 8 you know is hardware
improvements which are sorely needed of
course but you can't what are they gonna
do you can't put a higher resolution
screen in an OTA download I know right
you can't put a higher a better camera
in it in a software update you know or
can you go well he's sort of Michael if
you remember Microsoft has pushed the
reset button with Windows Phone 7 back
in the day and what happens your windows
mobile 6.5 it got completely slates
nobody offered support they killed it
right and now Microsoft is pushing the
reset button again for windows phone 8
again a huge difference as it was from
6.5 to seven is gonna be a huge
different from 7 7.5 to eight what do
you think will happen to you 7 7.5
devices when will Microsoft stop
supporting them I think are they gonna
be pushed to legacy status yes
absolutely I think they're Microsoft's
gonna do a much better job supporting
them because I think they were bullish
with Windows Phone 7 I think they were
coming to the market and they said look
we got this new awesome Metro UI you
know we've got it's an entirely new
product that is so much better than
Windows Phone and people are going to
flock to it and then for various reasons
that didn't happen people kind of like
saw Windows Phone launch and then kind
of shrugged and kept buying you know
iphones and android phones but like I
don't think I think Microsoft is more
cautious now I think they they better
realize it at the very least that these
people who are currently on the wp7
platform
are are all they have and if they annoy
them then they better then they better
really impress a lot of people with
Windows Phone air because they're just
gonna I think yeah exactly i think they
are targeting people who might be
willing to convert from other platforms
directly to Windows Phone 8 then they
are targeting current windows from users
I don't know I have this feeling that's
an interesting I mean it I think you
might be right I think if they do that
at the cost of you know ignoring the
windows phone seven years i think that
which is how much it is five six seven
percent of the market yeah what was the
figure on that tuina its sub two digits
yeah it's still under ten percent
remember that I couldn't get a reliable
figure on it the last time i wrote a
Windows Phone article so yeah so I hope
people don't get us wrong we are not
haters we're not saying this because
because we have something we love
windows phone we love whole platforms
and we have the utmost respect for my
what Microsoft tried to do but i think
that Microsoft is like I've read a great
quote and I'm sorry I cannot quote
exactly and I cannot say who said it but
they said Microsoft is like a huge bulky
train which starts moving very slowly
but once they start moving they just go
on and on yeah yeah you know I mean it
takes any company that huge to get the
momentum upward to stop you know bad
momentum and it was interesting to watch
nokia try and kind of overcome that and
will will speculate more about nokia
know in a future episode cuz i do want
to spend a good amount of time talking
about it we can answer the question when
will we see PureView on Windows Phones
mine which is Windows Phone 8 is the
moment for PureView to come to in this
phone so you don't think until until the
winter time yeah interesting well isn't
isn't windows phone 8 uh shipping on
devices in the holiday time yeah you
should oh yeah so oh I guess that's what
you meant by winter time I think we're
gonna see and get ready to uh hopefully
you won't poop yourself I think we're
gonna see a Lumia 900 like device called
the 1001 or whatever it's gonna have a
720p Super AMOLED display it's going to
have dual core cpu it's gonna have a
PureView camera running Windows Phone 8
it's gonna be slightly thicker for that
I'm gonna have to be written one gram a
walking of ram and everyone's gonna
freak out over cuz it's gonna be an
awesome device and I let's measure was
the card support microsd support I think
it's gonna be a platform switcher for
some you know I I think you're probably
right and I think that it's gonna have
to be because I think Nokia is once
again in a position where they have to
save their butts that might be they're
not on a burning platform again but
they're on a sinking platform now that
not the Windows Phone platform but you
know they're one of their own making
yeah um so well that would be nice if
that happens Brandon I will hold you to
that I will I will run out and and
purchase one I'm saying it's right now
I'm saying it on the air yes I will buy
one for myself then very briefly in that
same vein we got a report recently that
Lumia 900 customers the the people who
did go out and buy Lumia 900 s are very
satisfied with ninety-six percent of
owners extremely satisfied or somewhat
satisfied with their Lumia 900 these are
people surveyed between april twenty
seven ma 18 by nielsen so almost a
thousand Nokia Lumia owners 810 owners
surveyed that's you know that's
impressive and which is just normal
Michael because if you look at nokia's
track record not only with the windows
phone or symbian even from the good old
dinosaur days with with the Nokia 1000
1000 and 100 and the good old dumb
phones nokia had excellent build quality
excellent call quality excellent battery
life so they they made phones for life I
even have a friend who has a phone which
is like 15 years old it's a dumb phone
and still working so it's it's nothing
nothing strange for me nakia phones are
extremely well built and that survey
just speaks for it I agree and I miss a
lot about the Lumia 900 and a lot of
that came from Nokia but it's
significant now because you know you
were not talking about a nokia symbian
phone that only a few people bought you
know the Lumia 900 enjoyed a really big
push here in the states and I think a
lot of people bought it you know they
won't release the accurate numbers but
we're talking you know we're talking in
the millions right but possibly may I
don't know George you know
but they broke a million millions all it
needs a lot of phones I mean I think I
do with the AT&amp;amp;T push that they enjoyed
i don't know i mean if you guys remember
the numbers the quarterly numbers nokia
released at the beginning of this year
they said that from the moment they
released the first Lumia phones which
was last year summer in October they
broke around 1 million that was in one
quarters and there was no Lumia 900 back
then was that in this world wide cell
that's global yeah yeah yeah it'd be
interesting I mean you know if the
numbers are good enough they will
release them at some point so we either
have to wait to hear or not to hear and
then if we don't hear then we're gonna
be talking about nokia in any case when
they you know go up for auction or
whatever so i really hope that doesn't
happen i really i think there's they're
one of the only companies doing
interesting stuff on the industrial
design or at least that was a case like
five or six months ago before HTC
decided to wake back up and etc if nokia
goes the auction block you guys want to
you guys want a bid for it known okay
I'm and first first order of business is
to get the Lumia 900 to run um jelly
bean and then we're we're off to the
races oh that would make my heart hurt
be like that be like putting android on
a palm pre okay quick question yes or no
michael brandon do you think Nokia
should have went Android um Brandon you
go first no no no you won't go first or
no they shouldn't have gone a tradition
Wow I'll go first no they shouldn't have
gone android because it's too
competitive and I mean it's I feel like
the CEO explaining this but you know
nokia could differentiate with better
much better hardware yes so does have
sold millions by now zillions they want
us you know I think I I kind of wish
they had done it a two-prong strategy
but then they wouldn't have gotten the
love from Microsoft and the exclusivity
and all this so they had to it's there
between a rock and a hard place it mmhmm
yeah from a business perspective I think
I think the argument could be made
either way from a strictly personal
perspective
no I am we'll always favor the underdog
I always like it when to underdogs get
together to try and push something to
try and kind of pull each other out of
the mud I watched it fail with with
sprint and palm in their kind of death
embrace and that sucked and so I would I
still want to see this happen I think
and I'm not the only one like I'm
obsessive and a nerd for webos yes but
like a lot of us this is what happened
before I wrote for pocket now before all
the stuff like a lot of us hanging out
over at precentral wherever you know
webos died and then we were like well
we're all jumping ship to a platform
that's going to be supported where are
we all going four out of five people
seriously windows phone because there's
something in in the DNA of fanboys of
our particular stripe I guess that that
really likes the underdog platform so no
seeing seeing okie embrace Windows Phone
was a great thing and I still love it
and I still want to see that success
story kind of bloom and I really hope
yeah so anyway we're we're coming up on
an hour gents so we got to kind of wrap
this up real quick and we've talked a
little bit about Android Windows Phone I
want to sort of wrap this up on on an
iPad Mini rumor which I'm getting tired
of do we like the idea of 7 inch iPad
can I just put that out there do we do
we care do it don't do you what how do
you feel about a 7 inch iPad you have a
you have an iPhone tell me it's a it's a
tough question and it's not that do
users need a 7 inch iPad or does Apple
need a 7 inch ipad i think users would
need a 7 inch ipad but Apple does not
Apple always went for the high quality I
don't know premium products and of
course there was steve jobs and his
legacy of never going below nine point
seven inches then I'm would I buy a
seven inch iPad absolutely do I need a
seven inch iPad know okay it succinctly
put about you Brenda uh I'll also be
succinct that the iPads the new iPad is
far too heavy and it is far too bulky
and far too thick to be come
held for a long period of time and that
that's a big shame because the best
content viewing experience on a tablet
is on the ipad I can view the wall
street journal in this beautiful digital
atmosphere but it it's just it's
tiresome tible they need something
lighter and smaller something that you
could take into bed and not feel like
you've brought you know your laptop into
bed with you which is kind of a weird
notion anyway no agreed and more you
know more maybe even more importantly on
the train which is where I find myself a
whole lot of the time and one-handed use
within it with an iPad the size of the
new iPad or not possible it's very yet
it's very cumbersome it's not enjoyable
I the 7-inch form factor you know their
arguments to be made either way i would
find use for one very easily which sort
of catapults into the final two minutes
of the of the podcast in theory which it
will not be but i have this idea and
it's for this editorial which i am
scheduled to write at some point tonight
so it should be it maybe it'll be live
by the time this podcast goes up I was
going to bed the other night and
interesting you mentioned bed and
tablets Brandon I was going to bed the
other night and normally I do have my
iPad in bed and i watch netflix or you
know whatever i read email because i
work from bed which is stupid but i did
i was the ipad has been annoying me
because i'm running iOS 6 beta and i had
a problem and blah blah blah so I was
like whatever I've got the galaxy s3
here and it struck me that I was really
enjoying using the galaxy s3 for all the
things I would be using the ipad for and
I was like but I mean this thing is it's
got a four point eight inch screen it's
nowhere near the size of the tablet but
it's much less cumbersome I can still
see it fine because it's a huge screen
so our big big phones like the galaxy s3
and our phablets like the Galaxy Note
are they a threat to tablets long term
as they get more popular what do you
think two minutes Brennan two minutes
each or in though two-minute age LBJ
I'll be generous because we are all
friends here ok who starts Brandon
starts ok up oh geez
uh our phablets a threat to tablets yes
they are because if I am someone who can
handle a device like the galaxy note
which I'm not and I'll tell you in a
second um I rather have one device and
enjoy a you know the the Galaxy Note
does provide like a mini tablet like
experience it's a bigger screen you can
comfortably view netflix on it
comfortably view the newspaper in some
cases the problem of course with the
note is that when you download apps from
Google Play it reverts the phone UI and
what if you want the tablet UI you might
struggle to see the screen because
things will be so small um but for me I
can't handle a note because it's too big
it's too big in the pocket it I can't
fit my hands around it my hands aren't
that small but i can't i can't type with
it accurately um so i need a phone that
has a reasonably sized screen and then i
need a tablet that is that that is a
larger canvas to view I don't mind
having two things and I have to have two
things because I I can't use a phablet
on a regular basis I like them they're
fun but I just can't personal use them
okay so you'll sacrifice that for for
for day-to-day usability I understood
right Tony a short version no they are
another thread long version I had a
discussion with Brandon and some other
colleagues back in the day and we try to
define that very thin line between the
phone and the tablet and I think we need
to define what a so-called phablet is I
think a phablet is a device which has a
screen size between the smallest ablett
and the largest phone but this when the
phablet the galaxy note came out last
year at IFA all the smartphones had for
4.3 inches in diagonal and there were
seven point seven inches tablets now
tablets become smaller and smaller we
have seven inch tablets now and we have
four point eight inch screens so I think
at one point these two will mold
together and the perception the concept
of the phablet will disappear but
think that they are addressing two
separate segments of the market somebody
who wants to have a decent sized phone
and somebody who has to have a decently
or fairly large or fairly small tablet
so you will never see somebody with both
a smartphone and a tablet carrying them
at the same time that person will have
the need for a phablet so no I think
tablets are not a threat to tablets I'm
not sure if I made sense did that
translate correctly in English it did it
did I wonder if I wonder though is that
true you never see people with with
carrying both a smartphone and a tablet
that's not true well maybe in the US but
here in Europe I have never seen
somebody who had both an Android device
or an Android tablet iOS device iow
established because they both do the
same thing ah which is why maybe the
PadFone will do better over there than a
will over here probably maybe we don't
know we have our fingers crossed we want
we'll talk about that maybe more on the
next episode thank you you guys are good
at being succinct HUD I couldn't be
under two minutes I'm glad I'm the
question poser and not the answer i just
