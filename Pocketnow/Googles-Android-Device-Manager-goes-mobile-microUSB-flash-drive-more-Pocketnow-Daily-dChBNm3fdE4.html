takes a leap into mobile when those
phone ein has already rumored to drop
the metro UI and believe it or not Sony
just made the world's first micro USB
flash drive I'm high memory better I'm
just the thought of getting Windows
Phone 9 then the windows mobile UI
definitely gets me excited this is
PocketNow daily Lester's day off with
some official news as Google has just
launched the native application for the
Android device manager and you'd be
wondering what took them so long this
application is really necessary for all
of you if you didn't know what it is it
will help you track your phone if it's
lost or stolen and make it react if you
can't find it and it's great for you to
finally have a way to do it natively and
actually in a more effective way on your
tablet as well so anyways make sure you
download the application it should be
available to you soon now let's talk
about LG s we've got some rumors of an
LG G X being launched very soon but just
hold it right there I mean this phone
pretty much has the same exact
specifications of the Optimus G pro and
it's even got the same design so we're
assuming that LG is probably planning to
revamp this phone into the GX and
probably I don't know bring some
enhancements or a different market but
in the case of the time when you have a
phone like the g2 which is so much
better in the case of the G flex as well
we don't know what they're planning to
do with that GX and speaking of
interesting devices one phone that a lot
of us are waiting for is the Sony Xperia
z1 many which is the busy one that for
z1 s for some markets and we've got this
phone at the FCC right now even though
we're still not sure if this is gonna be
the z1 many or what name it's gonna have
but it's really interesting let's just
hope that it keeps the same
specifications as the global model as
this is pretty much a z1 only in a
smaller chassis so stay tuned now let's
talk about Microsoft s we've got some
rumors of wouldn't those phone nine
apparently it's gonna be launched in the
second half of 2014 but it's really
interesting to see that apparently the
company is gonna drop the metro UI or
the modern UI whatever you want to call
it finally apparently they're gonna
either ditch it or make it better
hopefully they do make it better not
everything's lost right there but there
are a lot of things that people don't
really like and then an even more
interesting news apparently they are
gonna kill Windows RT which is something
we were expecting for Windows 8.1 so
let's see if that happens
half of 2014 those are six months and
finally for the very very hot news of
the day Sony has just launched the micro
USB flash drive now you know I'm just
wondering what took companies so long
what took them so long to bring this
we've been dealing with non-expandable
phones for the longest time we hate them
all and now we have the option to do
this through micro USB and it pretty
much works on every Android bone after
Android 4.0 point four I believe it is
so you can pretty much just buy this in
heaven work on your phone because you
don't need expansion all the time but
it's always great to have and it's great
to have this option but anyways that
leads me to the question of the day
would you buy a micro USB flash drive is
it something that you'd be interested on
because in my case I mean I love to have
the option I don't really need
expandable storage all the time if my
phone has 32 gigs are higher but anyways
it's always great to have this option so
leave us a comment down below what do
you think about this and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is so
mushy follow us on pocketnow.com and
