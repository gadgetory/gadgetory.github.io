escalated and half Google responding to
them iPhone 10 production is reportedly
getting back to normal over the next few
weeks and more leaks emerge on the HTC u
11 plus now in certification documents
I'm high metal Iveta and my son said
that I should wear today's suit for the
wedding for the video but now you want
to watch that you can watch my Instagram
stories this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with the
obvious we've been hearing rumors of the
1 + 5 t the possibility of it looking
like the Oppo f5 and well now we have
the 1 + 5 selling out in stores in the
United States Australia and the UK it's
only a matter of time before we get some
sort of a revamp just like we saw last
year with the 1 + 3 T the only thing is
I'm not exactly sure we're getting a
design change I don't see anything
credible that would point to that but
hey we'll keep you posted as soon as we
learn more now let's talk about
certification documents and two new HTC
devices at first we thought it was just
the HTC u 11 plus and there are
certification documents already at Tina
the thing about it is we also see that
there is an HTC u 11 play apparently the
whole concept here is to bring some of
the features of the HTC u 11 into a more
affordable category because the U 11
wasn't affordable so yeah you can learn
more about it in the link of the
description let's see what we end up
getting now let's talk about the iPhone
10 as we've got the same analyst that
claimed that there were gonna be
horrible yield issues in the band issues
now claiming that apparently production
of the iPhone 10 is going to normalize
with in November meaning that if you
have a hard time pre-ordering your
iPhone 10 at the beginning apparently
within those weeks of November the
problem is going to be solved then
you'll be able to get your iPhone 10
because apparently the whole face ID
promise has been solved whatever the
case may be let's see who gets it right
this time
now let's talk about the huawei mate 10
pro we are big fans of huawei
photography that whole joint venture
they've done with Leica and we just got
the DxO mark for the huawei mate 10 Pro
apparently it lands just under the
Google pixel at 97 points
now remember these are not 97 points out
of a hundred I mean the whole way that
DxO mark does its ratings is kind of
weird whatever the case may be we do
know that this phone is as good as the
Google pixel - let's see if it does
whenever we get our review units and
finally the very hot news that they have
to do with the Google pixel to pixel to
excel we're still waiting for my
particular review units but as it turns
out we've got consumers complaining
about this place being dull about the
color reproduction and it comes to the
point where Google ended up responding
and claiming that the reason why this is
is intentional Google wanted to provide
accurate colors with the pixel - and
therefore that's the reason why the
display looks the way it does you can
actually fix it through software and add
the vibrance that you wanted apparently
there's a 10% boost in vibrance but
people are still complaining that it's
not great so anyways it leads me to the
question today if you've already
received your pixel to pixel to excel
let us know in the comments do you think
that it's bad I mean do you think it's
not livable because in my case I mean
we've been dealing with OLED displays
from you know pixel devices and Nexus
devices for years they've never been you
know amazing they've been good enough
not amazing so I'm just used to it but
