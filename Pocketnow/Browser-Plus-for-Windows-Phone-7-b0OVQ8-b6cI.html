now calm Windows Phone 7 is a very much
locked down operating system you can't
change the keyboard it can't add a task
manager there's a lot you can't do and
one of the things we thought you
couldn't do is add a third-party browser
well it turns out that you can because
one has just entered the marketplace
it's krod browser plus and in this video
we're going to tell you about it let's
get to it so before talking about
browser plus just want to review really
quick Internet Explorer on Windows Phone
7 and how it looks so it's a very basic
browser but it performs very well the
pinch-to-zoom is SuperDuper fast tab
management is easy with a button down
here although as you're going to see
browser plus improves upon tab
management and some other things down
here we also have the ability to
favorite to to look at the bookmarks and
so on and so forth so a very simple
browser let's look at browser plus it's
a $0.99 application which brings a lot
of new features that I think a lot of
people are going to appreciate right off
the bat you can see that it has tabs
that are visual instead of in the
previous internet explorer of the
internet explorer that comes on the
device you have to go into a submenu to
access your tabs but here you can
actually flip between them through this
visual interface and by the way it
remembers what tabs you had open just
like Internet Explorer so I've had these
tabs opened a few minutes ago I jumped
back in here they are again so here we
are on a web page will go to Engadget it
feels the same as the internet explorer
browser so it's probably built on the
same sort of technology there it just
adds some interface changes that makes
browsing a little bit more easy so again
we have the tabs let's add another and
see what it's like to add lots of
different tabs so we can looks like it
exited it is a little bit buggy here and
so it looks like it actually yeah there
it goes it's going to resume so I'm
going to press the plus button open up a
new tab and we're gonna go into Gizmodo
here
okay here it's coming by the way this
does not support landscape functionality
at that time which is a huge bond room
the landscape is very good to use when
you're looking at web pages so here we
are in Gizmodo let's open up another tab
let's see how many tabs we can get here
so we'll go to scene it looks like we're
running out of space here the X button
is missing add one more and actually you
can swipe to the side so it looks like
you can keep adding tabs which is great
if you want to close the tab you tap on
it hit the X button over here you have
to have small fingers in order to do
this we can also use a search right from
the upper right corner which is
something that the browser in Internet
Explorer does not let you do so we can
search for you know you know HTC search
and it pulls up Google search results
which is quite nice and then we can flip
between the tabs like so now there's a
few things we can do down here if we
open up the settings there's a reader
view and in order to show you that I've
got to get into a page where the ads and
the pictures can be stripped out so that
you can get sort of the reader view
similar to what you get in Safari so
here we go it's loaded let's go to
reader view see if it works sometimes it
works sometimes it doesn't looks like in
this case it's not going to work but it
does actually work quite well on pocket
now so let's jump into that real quick
okay so here we are we're gonna jump
into reader view and this should work
there we go reader view so it just pulls
out all of the ads and all the graphical
stuff to just give you some text and
some images now we can go to what looks
to be a print view see if it'll do
anything it won't or we can revert back
to the previous view so some of these
buttons actually don't work it's a early
browser that it doesn't work as well as
the standard browser built into Windows
Phone 7 down here we have some other
options we can search on the page we can
open up a page in IE if something's not
working we can mail a link we can go
into private mode so it will not keep a
history of what you're doing if you're
looking at certain things that you don't
want other people to see but overall
it's a pretty cool browser really
enhancing on the functionality already
built
into Windows Phone 7 Internet Explorer
again it's $0.99 in the marketplace and
it's a great browser if you want to have
a better tabbed browsing experience for
