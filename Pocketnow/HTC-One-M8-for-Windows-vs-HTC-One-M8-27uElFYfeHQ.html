on the slick aluminum of the HTC One m8
you had to commit yourself to an Android
phone and if you were a Windows Phone
lover with a predilection for the
metallic you were out of luck well times
as they say are a-changin as they say
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is HTC One m8 versus HTC One m8 for
Windows the hardware portion of this
comparison is going to be brief so I'll
use some of it to remind you to
subscribe to pocket now here on YouTube
if you like this kind of video go and
follow us on social media too as we
covered in our various unboxing and
first impressions pieces the One m8 for
Windows is physically identical to its
Android counterpart outside and M that's
at the windows Edition at least for now
only comes in gunmetal gray so if you
like the gold or silver trims you're out
of luck here carrier availability is
also a factor here in the States the
windows Edition is for now exclusive to
Verizon Wireless and while AT&amp;amp;T has
announced its intention to carry the
device as well timing on that release is
not yet known some good news identical
hardware means accessories like HTC's
dot view case fit just as well on the
windows device as they do on the Android
one the software experience is almost
the same - when it comes to the case a
down swipe on the cover of the windows
phone activates Cortana which is
actually more useful than the HTC voice
Tyler on the Android edition but the
Windows Phone doesn't support the dot
view wallpapers under the covers the
core of this comparison is Windows Phone
versus Android now we've had this
discussion quite a bit before but every
time we do a flagship comparison in my
mind the choice between these platforms
gets harder that's because each one is
getting more capable every single day
tick Windows Phone for example with
version 8.1 1 the new one m8 brings
Action Center for unified notifications
a much smarter and faster Cortana than
we saw in earlier versions and a home
screen that's more customizable than
ever before with folders and changeable
backgrounds
now if that sounds an awful lot like a
feature list from Android circa 2009
that's valid you could say that Windows
Phone has been playing feature catch-up
with Android for a while and you
wouldn't be wrong Microsoft has recently
put Windows Phone through a needed but
distracting philosophical shift giving
Google the chance to polish an already
robust set of capabilities in Android
the result is a better experience than
before on Windows Phone but one which
feels a little rougher next to the more
complete Android experience some of
these differences are in the details
lack of a notification LED on windows or
lack of support for it anyway the
inability to swipe away individual
notifications or preview messages in the
action center stuff like that other
contrasts are more stark the Windows
Store is more populated than ever before
but we're still talking about a sizeable
Gulf in apps and major titles that do
exist on Windows Phone like Instagram
and Twitter are often buggier less
complete or slower to receive major
updates then there's the hardware
ecosystem if you care about wearables
and other accessories Android is still
the place to be these trends are
changing but slowly so it's still an
important consideration and as always
buying a Windows Phone versus buying an
Android phone is contingent on whether
you spend more time on Microsoft
services or Google's it's definitely
possible to run Microsoft apps and
services on Android or to sync a Google
account with Windows Phone but obviously
you're going to have a much better time
of it if you don't go against the grain
like that and in the States at least we
still find some of Google's native
offerings such as Maps
superior to the Windows Phone
counterparts but here too that gap is
closing and your mileage will obviously
vary depending on region okay that's
platform stuff now what about specifics
well to its credit HTC has tried to
bring as much of the One m8 experience
to Windows Phone as possible so if you
love the social and news streaming app
blinkfeed on android it's here for you
on Windows Phone to complete with its
own live tile
boomsound software support still stands
ready to blow your ears out on speakers
and headphones HTC's Sense TV has been
redesigned in the modern Microsoft
design language so you can still channel
surf and you still don't need to stretch
your hand all the way up to the power
button to unlock the phone a quick
double tap on the screen will wake
either one up the Android m8 supports a
few more fancy gestures for specific
functions but the windows m8 doesn't
require you to move the phone first to
enable those gestures so we'll call it a
draw probably HTC's biggest software
customization comes in the form of the
camera viewfinder which it basically
ported wholesale from the Android app if
you know how to take a picture on the
old one m8 you know how to do it here
too most of the depth of focus tricks
made possible by the phones duo camera
are included in the HTC photo edit app
and they work about as well as they do
on Android to take that statement for
what it's worth video highlights
probably our favorite feature from the
One m8 photography suite are also
available through a separate app sadly
you won't find any Zoey support here and
dual capture is gone too but all in all
this is an almost perfect port of
functionality and the photo evidence
bears that out whether that's a good or
a bad thing depends on how much shooting
you do in low-light vs. daylight and how
much mileage you can get out of just
four megapixels our Android review
device may be on AT&amp;amp;T
but it's confined to 3G because it's the
global unlocked version speed
comparisons against the 4G LTE Verizon
Windows Phone are therefore completely
useless and voice quality differences
are almost totally network dependent for
what it's worth callers said we sounded
identical on each device though we
noticed a slightly brighter crisper
sound on the unlocked unit disparities
that don't depend on the network are few
there aren't as many gaming titles
available on Windows Phone to really
stretch its capabilities but it handled
asphalt 8 just as well as its Android
sibling even in max resolution mode with
all the trimmings web surfing is equally
matched to at least from a pure power
perspective but I tend to prefer
browsing on Google
crow map to the less consistent less
compatible Internet Explorer
what about endurance well if you listen
to HTC's spec sheet estimates it seems
the Windows Phone version should last
quite a bit longer on a single charge
than the Android one
despite the identical power packs while
initial impressions are quite positive
we'll need to gather more data before
weighing in on this it's not often you
get to see direct hardware ports across
platforms like HTC has done here and
it's equally uncommon to see so many
software features ported over as well
the Android powered when I made still
strikes me as the more powerful version
overall thanks to Google's ecosystem
edge and the more polished Android OS
but whether you agree with that judgment
will depend on whose services you use
more and how much customization you
really need or want as for what the new
One m8 means for Windows Phone and the
smartphone landscape in general you'll
have to wait for pocket now full review
coming soon for now we'll just say that
buying either of these devices means
you're buying one of the best devices in
its class regardless of which platform
you prefer for more on the HTC One m8 in
all of its flavours check out the videos

time this has been michael fisher with

thanks for watching stay smooth and
we'll see you real soon
