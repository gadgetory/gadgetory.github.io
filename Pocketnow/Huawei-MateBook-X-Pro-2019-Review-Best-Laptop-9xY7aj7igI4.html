laptop of 2019 let's just begin this
video by telling you that I call last
year's huawei mate book X Pro as one of
my favorite products of early 2018 not
just laptops
I meant products it was beautiful thin
and lights and hard to compete with on a
spec for price comparison in 2019 the
new variant is all about taking that
success and matching it with a couple of
great new things in addition to some
controversial old ones I'm hey metal be
better with PocketNow and let me tell
you what these are in our full review
many publications crown the 2018 variant
as the best laptop money could buy to
give you a clearer perspective as to why
let me show you one of its direct
competitors this is the latest 13-inch
MacBook Pro fully maxed out it's just as
beautiful just this thin and light and
when I say maxed out I mean all the
highest options I'm talking about the
more powerful eighth generation
quad-core Intel Core i7
16 gigabytes of RAM and one terabyte of
storage the problem is when I tell you
that this computer cost me $2,800 so
just keep that price in mind to
understand my point going forward let me
begin this video by telling you what I
like about this computer and it begins
with the looks this 2019 variant looks
nearly identical to its predecessor say
metallic unibody design with CNC
machined chamfers and a sand blasted
finish what changed this really just the
Huawei logo which is now in text and
that I actually prefer this way having
it nearly identical to its predecessor
also brings other benefits we have the
same great LTPS touchscreen at the 3k
resolution and 3x2 aspect ratio and with
a crazy 91% screen to body ratio the
screen supports the standard Microsoft
screen gestures like a three finger
swipe for screenshots at four hundred
and fifty minutes this has got to be one
of my favorite parts of this computer it
is such a jaw-dropping display to assist
with content consumption that quad
speakers make a return tuned by Dolby
Atmos Huawei hasn't really claimed any
improvements in audio quality but I do
notice them to be far deeper sounding
than its predecessor
see last year's model was loud but that
was it and we also see the return of
quad microphones with far-field
communication supports allowing for pay
Cortana and Microsoft translator
controls from up to four meters away we
have the return of a full-size keyboard
that's also splash proof I seriously
don't know of any other laptop that's
this thin and bringing that feature and
we also have the power button that still
doubles as a fingerprint scanner now
with a dedicated chip for more secure
biometrics and just as fast as before
for those of you that complain about the
odd way that the trackpad would work
last year that got fixed with this
generation so I really have no more
complaints here where you will find the
key differences between this and last
year's model is in the internals we have
10% more power in its eighth generation
Core i7 16 gigs of ram up to one
terabyte on the solid-state drive vastra
Wi-Fi bluetooth five and a 57.4 watt our
battery that you power with huawei 65
watt USB C power adapter which has
become very popular because it serves
from pretty much everything best of all
we have the same iOS last year with two
USB C connectors on one side and a USB a
port on the other and with the added
advantage of this Thunderbolt 3 port now
supports full speeds of up to 40
gigabits per second right about now
you'd say that's all cool I mean this
maxed out version of the mate book X Pro
is pretty much like a maxed out 13-inch
MacBook Pro when it comes to specs but
the answer is no not at all see while
Apple is still reluctant to move the
discrete graphics on its 13-inch model
the main book X Pro includes an nvidia
geforce MX 250 for discrete graphics and
if you still remember that 2800 price
tag on the macbook pro ok the maxed out
make book expo retails for up to $600
less yes you heard that right but wait
there's more Huawei has been taking
steps into cultivating an ecosystem with
its other products this computer has NFC
and Huawei's one-hop technology to
transfer files between Huawei phones and
laptops and it is just awesome last but
not least this computer is powered by
Windows 10 Pro signature edition meaning
very little bloat my overall experience
using this computer has seriously been
great
from the fluidness of the user interface
and how it embraces dark mode on windows
so the fact that it's very easy to
handle for everyday use this is
seriously a great computer
it's literally like having the power of
a 13-inch MacBook Pro in one of Apple's
new MacBook Airs
but fine I do have to agree this is not
the notebook pun intended so let's leave
the love-story here and let me jump into
the things that I don't like about this
computer and it's actually two things
first
q'n the nose cam like sure Huawei I can
applaud the genius idea of having a
camera that can be easily hidden for
security purposes the problem is that
the angle is just atrocious and at
nearly one megapixel of resolution it's
not like if it's a great camera either I
seriously don't even use it at all and
to answer your question from last year's
review a great alternative would be the
Logitech Brio we've got a sleek design
that attaches well to the laptop works
through USB a and best of all is 4k
resolution and you address security by
simply removing the webcam when you
don't need it or it does bring a nifty
cover for those of you looking and
second I have a really hard time
understanding the logic of partitioning
the hard drive and leaving the windows
partition to just 100 gigabytes and
worst of all the partition now includes
additional protection if it wasn't for
my buddy David Cogan aka the unlocker
I wouldn't have solved this so I'll link
to his article on how to solve this in a
few easy but detailed steps you need to
follow one by one to conclude I think
that I listed at least 10 pros before I
reach the first con like every product
this device is not perfect but the
things that it gets you right are really
hard to resist we have a gorgeous design
a thin and light footprint and some of
the most powerful specs on a laptop
Windows 10 Signature Edition and all
priced in a way that makes anyone debate
if it's worth it to make any design
comparison with the product that makes
look really bad the main book X Pro is
not just the top-of-the-line laptop that
Huawei is offering right now but
seriously one of the best laptops money
can buy
I doubt you'll find something better
than this definitely my top pick for
laptops in early 2019 and also one of my
favorite products hands
