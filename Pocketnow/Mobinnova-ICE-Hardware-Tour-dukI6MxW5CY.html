pocket now calm and this is the hardware
tour of the mobi nova ice this device
has a 3 inch touchscreen of resolution
400 down and 240 across that is wqvga
it's actually the same resolution as the
samsung omnia but as we'll discover
later when we do the software tour you
really only get a QV g a screen because
you have an unchangeable row of icons
down here that you cannot move or take
off the screen or at least I haven't
found out a way to do that yet so really
think of it like a qvga screen so we'll
go back to that part later now if we go
in on the device we have the speaker
here we have a light sensor kind of
hidden off behind or to the left of the
front facing video camera and then we
have a very flush looking metallic shiny
screen and then we go down to a very
minimal offering of hardware button so
we've calls start and call end but we
also have this old LED screen here it's
96 x 96 pixels in its touch screen and
the idea is that this takes on certain
functions depending on which screen
urine so if you're just in you know on
the today screen you'll get a d-pad if
you are in a media player you'll get
certain media controls this
functionality is pretty limited and
again we'll cover this in the software
tour now it does do some other things if
i press on the camera button i will get
some notifications here so it tells me
the time it tells me if i have an email
it tells me battery life and signal
strength which is pretty convenient so
that you don't have to turn on the
device to check out all of these system
indicators also you may have seen this
about 30 seconds ago you will get a
glowing envelope that will imply that
you have a new message I don't know when
this happens I think it's after you turn
off your device let's see if it'll do it
yep there it goes right after you turn
off your device which is kind of a weird
time to notify you you'll get that
glowing envelope and you really can't do
anything with it so let's continue
around the device
if we go over to the side we have a port
which uses mini USB which is great
because you don't have to use a
proprietary connector that said this
device doesn't have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so you'll have to get a
converter for that just like some HTC
devices going to the bottom we have
nothing there but the microphone on this
side of the device we have the microSD
expansion slot which is fortunately
located on the outside of the device so
you don't have to turn off the phone to
get to it then we have a camera button
volume rocker and on the top we have the
standby button here and here's a really
nice feature to have its the silent
button so with one tap it goes into
silent mode and with another tap the
speaker comes back on kind of like some
palm devices that are out there now you
may have seen the stylus over here which
is a unfortunately a collapsible stylus
and it's got an extremely fine point I
don't know if you can see that okay
going over to the back we have a 3
megapixel camera and we have what
appears to be dual speakers although
it's kind of deceiving watch I'll take
off the back there's no speaker there
it's just there for show there's only
one speaker and here is the hard reset
or the software set whole I should say
and we have a batter here that is of
size 1080 milliamp hours which is kind
of small actually and we'll have 20 on
do some battery test to see how long the
battery will last so overall the
hardware of the mobi nova ice is quite
good-looking it's a stunning design I
think and a lot of people that have seen
you on boxing say wow that phone looks
really really cool and yeah it does look
really really cool it looks kind of
futuristic that said at the end of the
day it's the software that makes the
phone and we're going to have to take a
look at how this optical or how this
oled d-pad works and these static
buttons on the bottom of the screen to
see if they lend to a better device
experience or whether they just impede
usability so we'll be back soon with the
software tour of the mobi Nova ice
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
