can bet that we've been playing with it
for a while the Samsung Galaxy S nine
benchmarks bring some more concern to
the table and it seems that the iPhone
10 inventories are normalizing more and
more I'm Jaime Rivera and it is tough
covering rumors of a phone that I've
been using for the past week but that's
the name of the game this is Parkin out
daily the official news today have to do
with deals t-mobile BOGO deals are back
and this time they're hot we're talking
about the iPhone 8 and a plus in
addition to high tier Android phones
like the Samsung Galaxy s8 si plus and
pretty much every single LG high-end
smartphone and in the case of metro pcs
you even get a year of Amazon Prime you
can learn more about everything and like
in the description sorry about the
iPhone 10 for those of you that have
been trying to get the phone lately
inventories have been normalizing we
hear that people are already being
notified that their device is not going
to take four weeks anymore instead just
two and we've actually come across a
couple of stores here in New York that
have inventory available in the store
but yeah so things are normalizing it
seems that you'll be able to get your
phone soon now one company that has
finally figured out is Google for those
of you that have been wanting to get
every single variant of the Google pixel
2 or pixel 2 X L it is now pretty much
available online at the Google store
we've been trying to get devices like
the Panda variant and others and yeah
these are now available to everybody
which is great hopefully that'll count
arrests the whole you know complaints of
the display on the Google pixel 2 XL
we'll see now about the samsung galaxy s
and 9 if you remember yesterday we
talked about benchmarks of the s9 plus
where we were concerned of 4 gigabytes
of RAM and the spec sheet doesn't make
sense when you get six inga bytes on the
Galaxy Note 8 as it turns out we've got
more benchmarks today and these also
point to four gigabytes of RAM so unless
something is going to go on here with
processing or software we really want to
know what Samsung is thinking if this is
true we're just getting four gigabytes
barely some of that is available
currently on the galaxy s 8 we'll see
and finally the very hot news that
they have to do with the 1 plus 5t our
hands-on video is already live we just
came back from the event and that's the
reason why this video is going up so
late it's awesome I have a lot of great
first impressions of the 1+5 team mainly
with everything that's been refined
I love the display I love what I've seen
from the camera I've posted some of
these pictures on my Instagram today I
feel that oneplus is going in the right
direction with the smartphone but
obviously this is my opinion and you
already saw my first impressions we
would love to know what you think in the
comments down below what do you think
about the 1 + 5 t do you think that it's
worth it or not
in my case oh my god have you smashed an
iPhone 10 right now what it'll cost you
to fix that iPhone 10 it's pretty much
the price of the 1 + 5 t and you're
getting an awesome smartphone so I would
give the 1 + 5 t a try leave us a
