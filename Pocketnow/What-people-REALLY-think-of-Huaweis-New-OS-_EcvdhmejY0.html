hope wait for hand liberate it you
deserve those 263 life stays I think a
man was slightly hungover dude I wish
when you see hi miss t-shirt appeared
twice you know you watch pocket now to
an unhealthy degree or you caught me
making mistakes when picking them either
one hi man Huawei Lavetta fine the one
and only that's right it's that time of
the week I am home Italy but now this is
PocketNow and this is the part now daily
recap your comments for this week
so Monday the topic was rather hot as
Google pretty much prepared an open
statement for the United States
explaining the reasons why banning
Huawei is not in anyone's convenience
particularly Google's and if national
security is a threat then truly even
more of a problem I asked you what do
you think do you think that a huawei
should be banned or not we had 824
comments Facebook removing themselves
from Huawei phones is hilarious the
phone's just got more secure 1,000 likes
on that common dude dude you deserve it
and I agree with you I despise Facebook
I hate how it targets me for ads and
there are so many reasons why I just
don't want to use it and obviously the
security issues are the main problem van
are not while we should launch an
alternative OS to Android and iOS yes I
do believe that it's time I do believe
that Huawei has the scale I'm not saying
that I have any problems with the
Android or iOS I'm just saying that
competition always makes things better
Google is scared I'm glad Google is
being punished in a way that really
hurts them considering all the political
shenanigans they've been playing lately
I wish Huawei all the success really I I
don't have that impression of Google I
actually like what they're doing and I
love their focus there are companies
that I feel are not following that way
of doing business in the United States
but I wouldn't consider Google to be one
of them I could truly name Facebook just
as one lmao there OS isn't out yet and
they're claiming it a security risk
already know it wasn't about the OS but
they were claiming is that if Google had
to drop support for Huawei phones we're
talking about around 270 million units
that will not be getting security
updates and therefore you know what's
gonna happen after that so that's the
main issue I totally understand Google's
perspective and truly I do consider that
a competing OS that could become more
popular than Android and that is not
being controlled by a US company which
the u.s. considers secure is also a
security threat and then on Tuesday the
topic was Huawei already summoning
developers and telling them hey we
already have our app gallery submit your
applications
and they were explaining we have 350
million users out of which 270 million
are active right this moment meaning
there is a market you're not gonna lose
anything I ask you would you trust an
app store from Huawei even if we already
have it on huawei phones we had 856
comments yes I trust Apple Amazon Google
Facebook etc there is nothing left to
hide anyway lucky you I well I don't
know I just I do value my privacy a lot
and therefore I don't trust many
companies with my stuff why not most of
the companies are spying if not all of
them dude true that you own your
comments your likes 297 and it's mainly
because my god Amazon is the first
company to spy on you and whether that's
the target ads or not it is still spying
to a certain degree how do we know that
our information is not being used for
something else I feel that this has only
made everyone more aware of what
companies are doing and therefore I wish
to see what the United States is gonna
do about the other US companies and
their practices do I trust play store
but I use it anyways I would definitely
trust Huawei more than play store I
wouldn't trust any company more than the
other I just feel that if you want to
use a phone that sadly the price you
have to pay and I wish that things
weren't that way in general but that's
the way it goes and then on Wednesday
the topic got really hot we had reports
that huawei's oke OS or hung mango s is
60% faster than Android that it's
already being tested by competitors like
Oppo I asked you I mean what do you
think do you want this to happen or not
we had a crazy eighteen hundred and
eighty comments guys thanks a lot more
competition equals more innovation the
Zoomers will definitely benefit from
this and that is how it should be agreed
I don't think that we should have all
our eggs in one basket and I feel that
even if I know that this Huawei
operating system is probably not gonna
be on par with the Android at the
beginning you have to start at some
point I mean Android was terrible when
it started if it's more power-efficient
weather faster or not that will be a
killer OS guys have you've tried the
Huawei watch GT I didn't
Sherly uses that is its basis or not but
that watch can last a lot and I think
that's a good way to just give us a
glimpse of what to expect I do think
that's gonna be one of the things we
should expect
I mean if while we was able to figure
that out with Android I I mean if they
control the OS why not
yes competition is a good thing I
personally wouldn't install it on my
phone but it would force Android and iOS
to pick up their game true that I feel
that companies are becoming stagnant and
innovation when it comes to operating
systems or capabilities I feel that we
should get more of an experience and we
need a company that's bold enough to go
to try and so again I'm not saying that
hongmen OS is gonna be the solution
we've seen failed attempts from Windows
Phone from selfish OS but again this
company has the scale so I feel that
they could pull it off we should thank
trump for enabling innovation in the
tech world q and the sarcastic face then
on Thursday the topic was the Samsung
Galaxy Note 10 we had some leaked images
of what to expect from its display the
fact that it almost doesn't have bezels
it looked fantastic I asked you I mean
what do you think about this we had 489
comments Samsung must remove the edges
which is more inconvenient to use the
s-pen um you know I feel that borderless
phones are not necessarily the best
approach but then again they do look
cool I will tell you that much and true
that I mean I love the s-pen regardless
so we'll see I'd rather get a working
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
slimmer bezels do true that I wish that
Samsung didn't push that bar I those are
the rumors the rumours is that we're
losing them we kind of got a hint
because the Galaxy fold was the anti
Samsung Galaxy phone it didn't have a
headphone jack it had a notch so oh my
god probably I'd rather have a slim
bezel than a cutout that blocks content
and draws attention dude if the leaks
are true that cutout that they have for
the camera looks really small I don't
think that it's gonna be intrusive at
all note as always a good powerful
productive trusted machine
I can't wait to order the pro one and
this man loves the adjective section of
the dictionary commas are always good to
separate them but I get your point I
really can't wait to get mine as well I
am a huge fan of the note I just I wish
it didn't launched so late because then
by the time it does we're already close
to the galaxy s 11 or whatever the case
may be enough to move towards it but
yeah and then finally Friday the topic
was Huawei one more time particularly
because of two things the first one
being that they pretty much confirmed
hongmen OS that it's coming that they
wish they didn't make this move that
they would love to continue working with
Google but sadly they're being forced to
and then the second one is the fact that
the huawei mate X is being delayed up
until September because of everything
that happened with the fold I asked you
of those two things I mean what do you
think and we had 371 comments they
should do both Huawei needs a back-up
plan but they still need Android to
succeed in Western markets I hope they
figure things out I hope they don't
leave Android but I do feel that after
this happening they will most likely be
they will have to they're forced to try
something else
we want more competition in the OS
category not just apple and oranges but
some more fruits as well name somebody
but guys I really wish that Windows
Phone would have succeeded again it
didn't have the scale Huawei does if
you've imagined a revival of Windows
Phone behave run on Android it's not
gonna happen but I do get your point
I do want competition as well any smart
non-us company should look for
alternatives and backups for their
business even if they think their
country is a friend of the United States
this is proof of it and I wonder exactly
what this is going to mean for business
going forward because if you can't trust
the United States with your investments
then what are you gonna do you're gonna
continue investing I don't think that's
gonna work that way what we made X is
being delayed specifically because they
need a new operating system I think it's
gonna take more than that I particularly
because of the way the fold works I
don't think that Huawei was ready for
that so I do agree with you it could be
a possibility but I don't think that's
necessarily gonna be the case I feel
that it will launch with Andrew
but true that we are gonna be beyond the
period where Google was going to allow
you know Wally to continue using Android
it could be that you're right we'll see
that's it for the pocket not daily recap
