software details we get more details on
the possible pricing of the oneplus 2
and don't panic but it seems that
blackberry might be going Android I'm
hina Ravenna looking forward to this
Friday more than you can know this is
pocket out daily if none of you are fans
of the Microsoft band we don't blame you
that is a terrible wearable but it
doesn't mean that the company wasn't
apparently working on a SmartWatch we've
got some leaked images of the Microsoft
Moonraker which is apparently a project
from Nokia that the company ditched now
we're still trying to debate a bezoar
concept images but given the fact that
they come from F leaks it seems that
this is a product that was going to
happen and it didn't or it could just be
that Microsoft put the leaks out there
for us to tell the company all through
the comments if it was worth it or not
for them to build it as will this
fallout over to Samsung as a we've got
more credible sources claiming that
there is a galaxy s6 plus and that it
pretty much brings everything that we
get on the note at least when it comes
to sheer size 5.7 inch quad HD display
in addition to Android 511 lollipop
which means that this product may not be
too far off as it would make sense for
the Galaxy Note line of to launch with
Android M so don't know exactly when
we're getting this product but stay
tuned now let's talk about the oneplus
two one of the most anticipated phones
of the year we were hearing reports that
the the price was going to raise itself
a little as 1 plus was going to bring us
a more budget-friendly model but as it
turns out it seizes the product will
retail for the same three hundred dollar
equivalent that it was launched in China
the case of the one plus one so it could
be that the price points will remain the
same and that would be great given the
fact that this product was really hot
last year let's see when that happens
some of the most interesting rumors that
have been going on this and last week
have been the possibility of a buyout or
a merger between a sous and HTC but
given the fact that a sous is actually
making money when it comes to its mobile
division reports claim that it will be a
sous that might absorb HTC our sous has
been a fan of growing organically and
not because of mergers and acquisitions
so it's true
the hearts of predictive this will ever
happen but given the fact that there are
two Taiwanese companies why not and
finally for the very interesting rumors
of the day don't panic but yes it seems
that blackberry might be working on an
Android smartphone and hey company's
prototype all the time and nothing the
prides black area of giving it a try
building a prototype and seeing if
that's really a feasible ideas
blackberry 10 is terrible and the
reports claim that blackberry plant
seeds in Ferengi ate this product by
adding a cutie keyboard in this day and
age and I guess that leads me to the
major question up today which would be
do you want acuity keyboard on your
Android smartphone uh in my case here
these are dead I like them in the past I
don't anymore software keywords have
gotten really cool but hey tell us what
you think in the comments down below
