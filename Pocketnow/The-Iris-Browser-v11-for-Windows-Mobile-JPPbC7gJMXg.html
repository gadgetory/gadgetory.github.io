pocketnow.com you know Windows Mobile
more than any other mobile phone
operating system offers a variety of
browser choices which is great so we
have Opera Mobile Opera Mini sky fire
among others of course and now we have a
new version of the iris browser from
torch mobile it's a webkit-based browser
that promises to bring very true desktop
like PC browsing experience to another
mobile phone so let's test it out and
see how it looks and I've already loaded
it up here with a few tabs and that sort
of thing so that we could get started so
here we are on a Wikipedia page and the
way that I got here I went to navigate
show address what you'll notice about
the iris web browser it's a lot more
crude than Opera Mobile so the address
bar isn't as pretty there it's not very
graphical the Go button is actually the
word go up in the in the upper left
corner so it's kind of minimal what I
really like about this browser is that
when you start navigating the page you
get a slider on the right side of the
page that shows you the progress along
where you are and this really helps if
you're on a long webpage and you don't
know how far you are from the bottom now
something you may be noticing is that
iris has a really is really slow a tree
rendering the page when you get to a new
section I think this is a place where
Opera Mobile is much better than iris
mobile so let's go to the tabs and by
the way these menus that you are seeing
this not Pyatt part of iris browser this
is part of this ROM that I'm running we
showed a video on this this is the same
ROM or a similar ROM that we'll be
shipping on the touch diamond2 in the
touch pro2
so let's go to tabs and see off and so
you get this kind of interesting
interface for the tabs it's sort of 3d
although I don't think it was really
made for such a tall screen although the
iris web browser does work well on this
WVGA screen and so we can find the site
that we want we can tap on it again and
it will pop up and we get a really cool
animation actually in the process
unfortunately I haven't been able to get
flash of video to play in the iris web
browser I'm going to go to page
neutab sure you have that works alright
so then we can go and type let's see how
long it takes
msn.com pretty simple webpage running
over Wi-Fi right now
okay okay so I had to cut out for a
minute it actually took a while to load
so here we are we start in the zoomed
out view which is great and we can
double tap to zoom in on a column and
although it worked well here by resizing
the text to the column or resizing the
column based on the text there are some
instances like if I go to Wikipedia that
tab I had open it it did not do a good
job at kind of fitting the text to the
screen as opera mobile does so if I
double tap on a column it kind of cuts
off some of the left text there and if I
scroll down the page it kind of it
doesn't really lock me into the center
as you'll find on the iPhone browser or
on Opera Mobile and let's take a look at
the settings we have so if we go to a
page and we go to options preferences so
we can turn on JavaScript and plugins
and pop-ups and cookies things like that
we can adjust the web cache in other
particulars so overall it's a decent
browser it's free and I'll put the link
on pocketnow.com on how to get it so you
really don't have any reason not to
download it and try it it has some it
features that Opera Mobile does not have
having to do with the options and
settings that you can choose from the
the soft key menus but for me I'm going
to stick with Opera Mobile 9.5 because I
think it renders pages faster and in
most cases it renders pages better and
it fits better to the column when you
double tap to zoom in but it's good that
we have another browser choice for
Windows Mobile so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
