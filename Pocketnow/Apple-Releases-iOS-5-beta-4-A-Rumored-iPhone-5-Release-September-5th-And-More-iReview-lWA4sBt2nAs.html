developers and this time it's over the
air the iPhone 5 is rumored to launch on
September fifth and have a siri-like
voice control and can anybody explain
why t-mobile's offering micro sims
already all the sim more coming up right
now hello everybody I'm hi emitter
yvette and welcome to the pocket now I
review the show we go through all this
week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's talk this week off with the cool
that's right iOS 5 beta 4 was now
release the developers and the changes
were significant first of all there's
the first over-the-air update that apple
offers iOS devices and it worked
flawlessly on all iOS devices we tested
it on aside from that we do get Wi-Fi
sync for Windows users who have access
to the iTunes beta for windows and you
also get reminder notifications whenever
you leave somewhere so now its location
based as Apple offered but wasn't
working before and aside from that
documents and data is now sinking for
those that have access to e I works
productivity suite really good changes
again iOS is evolving to the things that
Apple offered but some really neat
things are also coming and we'll talk
about that later a rumor that's been
making a lot of noise lately is that a
Swiss carrier sources confirm that the
iphone 5 will be released in the united
states on September fifth and in Europe
and the rest of the world probably on
October fifth now we're not really sure
on you know what these sources are these
are confirmed but a lot of people are
talking about this being really probable
and we are expecting the itunes music
event to happen within that same day
where it will be released then well
we'll see what happens in the end aside
from that well it seems that Apple is
cashing in on their recent purchase of
Siri and new ones because there are
screenshots of iOS 5 having a sort of
Sri like in combination with new ones
dictation text to speech and wish
prediction technology but the
interesting part is that we're not
getting in on the iOS 5 betas that work
on the iphone four and 3gs rumors have
it that it will probably make it to the
next generation iphone 5 as a new
feature that will not be released on the
older models just like the iphone 3gs
got boys can
control and not the rest of the devices
but again just rumors we'll see what
happens I wouldn't hold my breath on
that just yet the rumors of the next
generation ipod touch getting cellular
data are getting larger and larger this
time if you go into the documents sync
option in iCloud you'll notice that you
get an option for cellular data on the
ipod touch 4th generation now call this
probably just a mistake of when the
build was made but again it seems that
apple's preparing to offer the cellular
data option for iOS 5 on the next
generation ipod touch again we'll see
what happens we could probably get that
or probably get it just the cheaper
iPhone and they're using the
infrastructure of the ipod touch for
that to happen then again other rumors
have it that we will get a white ipod
touch for the next generation it'll look
nice and look cool you know for those
people that wanted really good rumors
we'll see what happens on the itunes
music event at some temper probably okay
so why in the world with tmobile begin
offering micro sim cards to their
customers if they don't sell ipads or
iphone fours the only reason would be
yes that they are probably preparing for
a next-generation iphone to work on
their services and probably that'll be
the case because that AT&amp;amp;T merger seems
to be slow not really sure what to
expect we do remember images of a
tmobile iphone working you know months
ago and it did have 3g so it does seem
that apple's prepping for the
next-generation device to support the
t-mobile you know services not really
sure what to make of it just yet again
these are just micro sins being offered
could it be that they're embracing
unlocked iphone customers you know for
the 12 bucks that will cut you too
they'll cost you to get a micro sim
cutter not really sure i don't think
that'll be the case i do see that Apple
is working on getting the iphone on
tmobile soon Apple squatter results are
in and numbers are big it's interesting
to see that Apple has now become a 100
billion dollar-a-year company but the
most interesting part is that they make
more money out of the iphone and they
make out of anything else now what's
even more interesting that that is the
fact that apple sold twenty point three
million iphones in the period which is
more than no
he is 16.7 million smartphones sold so
this make apple the largest smartphone
manufacturer by volume probably in the
world now what's interesting obviously
is yes before you tell me about Android
superiority remember that this is just
how many phones were sold by one company
obviously there are more android phones
out there but obviously from motorola
HTC and other you know carriers and
manufacturers and not just one
manufacturer so it's really interesting
to see that Apple is you know making a
lot of progress on the iPhone being just
one device competing to you know lots of
Android devices out there well that is
it for the coolest continue on with the
not so cool what's not cool about iOS 5
beta 4 well the fact that the
over-the-air updates don't work on
jailbroken devices and obviously you
know it has a purpose it does seem that
Apple brought this whole over-the-air
update option not only for you not to
need a computer for owning an iOS device
but also to make things a lot more
difficult for the dev team to be able to
jailbreak devices obviously you could
always just restore to a previous iOS
version of you know iOS and jailbreak
your device through that but again
Apple's working on that and it's just
not cool to see that it becomes more
difficult to jailbreak your device as
time goes on and well Lots this is
beginning to get on everybody's nerves
because now it's suing rovio you know
the makers of Angry Birds EA Atari and
other big shots on the developer can't
because of the in-app purchase services
that are offered on the iOS App Store
interesting though is the fact that
Apple said that they were going to help
out weeks ago but we still see the
service working on the App Store so you
know not really sure if you know lots of
this hold water with these patent you
know issues but it's still you know a
problem to see that it's happening and
that Apple's really not solving these
problems obviously those making lots of
developers not sell applications within
the u.s. app store because they're
worried about getting sued and I
see they do rely on in-app purchases so
Apple you know get your game up now
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm high middle
you better remember to give us a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw that's it
for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
