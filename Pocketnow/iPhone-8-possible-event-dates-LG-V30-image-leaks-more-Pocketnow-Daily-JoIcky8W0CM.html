products that we'll get from Apple on an
early September event but but finally
launches a new SmartWatch and well let's
just say it looks interesting and we
have more leaks that show was a very
attractive LGB 30 to come I'm Jaime
Rivera and this t-shirt describes
exactly how I feel before I get on a
plane to Berlin on a Monday
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with product
announcements this Fitbit has finally
announced its SmartWatch it's called the
ionic it runs a new ionic OS which we
assume is the result from its
acquisition of pebble and well it's not
pretty at all but it's got a ton of
really cool features like for example
finally it's elite has a GPS in addition
to the fact that you can now have a
personal trainer on your watch it'll
obviously have other features like being
able to pay for things so yeah it brings
a lot of convenience I just don't know
how convenient price tag is but you can
learn more in the description
and speaking of Fitness well iOS 11 beta
has just spilled the beans on a couple
of new Fitness profiles that are
probably coming to the Apple watch
apparently we're getting new dancing
modes for example in addition to sports
that can be tracked like skiing and
other details that are coming we just
don't necessarily get more information
on the Apple watch Series 3 or if it
will bring LTE or not or if it will be
that no holds bar fitness product that
many people are assuming it'll be stay
tuned
and speaking of leaks let's talk about
the LGB 30 again this is one of the
products I anticipate the most and we've
got some very interesting images that
show us a very sleek very slimmed down
g6 pretty much it looks a lot like the
g6 but this foam looks extremely thin at
least that's what we see from leaked
photos hopefully that is going to be the
case and by this time right now we're
probably just a couple of days from it
being announced so this is probably just
set in stone and yeah we'll keep you
posted as soon as we learn more defo as
will the spotlight over to LG's largest
competitor Samsung as the company has
just come clear over its ambitions of
how many products it plans to sell when
it comes to the Galaxy Note 8 apparently
Samsung is planning to sell up to 11
million unit
and you might say that 11 million is not
much but it is extremely aggressive
compared to the plans of last year and
obviously the serious results of the
company ended up having so yeah 11
million units let's see if that is going
to happen and finally the very
interesting rumors today have to do with
trusted sources claiming that Apple's
event is going to happen on September
12th
set your calendars apparently it's going
to happen on Apple's new Steve Jobs
theater and we have a couple of products
that will probably be announced
obviously iOS 11 will become fully
official in addition to a 4k Apple TV
then we also have rumors of the LTE
Apple watch Series 3 and also the iPhone
eights in addition to the iPhone 7 s
iphone 7 s plus all these are very
anticipated products but you know at
least me to the question today which one
are you waiting for most of any in my
case obviously the iPhone 8 just to see
if it actually pulls off the whole
essential phone design but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
