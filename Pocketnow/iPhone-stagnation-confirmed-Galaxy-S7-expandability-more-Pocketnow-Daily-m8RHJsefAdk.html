that still breaks records just barely LG
rumors point to another flagship instead
of the GFR mwc and Spotify it gets ready
to branch out to other media I'm hi meri
behna and if you got drunk yesterday
with the whole tequila thing shame on
you this is parking out daily the
official news today aside from my shiny
face have everything to do with Spotify
the company has made it official that
they're branching out from music now you
can also watch video and listen to
podcasts though we wonder exactly how
this is going to be when compared to
everything you could already get on
YouTube stay tuned as it will launch on
Android in certain countries starting
this week and then next week on iOS and
given the amount of links we've been
covering up the galaxy s7 those of you
that are panicking that there won't be
any expandable storage because
apparently nobody's seen any slots on
the renders well we've got trusted
sources claiming that this will be a
hybrid centrate just like we've seen in
some samsung galaxy mid rangers and the
other phones that we've seen launched
this year this is a pretty much the
trend to happen apparently yes
expandable storage will happen on the
Galaxy s7 and now we've got some us
sources already claiming that the HTC
One m10 will make it to AT&amp;amp;T we haven't
seen the phone yet but yeah apparently
that's going to be the case we're just
worried that this will be an AT&amp;amp;T
exclusive which we know has never worked
well for any you know the companies that
have gone for exclusives but then again
it could be the option still probably
the other thing that's made headlines is
the fact that the m10 will apparently
look a lot like the a9 meaning it'll
look a lot like the iphone and we've
kept a close eye on the successor to the
LG g4 and we've dubbed it the g5 because
it's been the case for years but LG
poulan was in a recent conversation over
twitter i believe it is and it seems
that even though they did not confirm
that it's not going to be called the g5
apparently they left it as part of the
mystery it seems that LG will be
launching a flagship we're not
necessarily sure if it'll be called a g5
but apparently
there could be a number change we wonder
it has anything to do with the be 10 or
whatever and finally the very hot news
today have to do with apples quarter
results the company has broken records
again particularly in profitability and
revenue in corporate America history
which is good but then again not
necessarily great for Apple the company
pretty much only grew point four percent
when it came to iphone sales when pretty
much to just seventy four point eight
million units and then when it comes to
iPads they were down twenty five percent
which I believe is an all-time low the
max were also down and pretty much
everything else meaning that even though
Apple did break records again the
company did not do so in a staggering
way and the Cupertino was clear it seems
that they've come to the end of an era
they've spent the last 13 years growing
in quarters year over a year and it will
happen anymore which is a rather
interesting I did feel that there had to
be a point where Apple had to stop the
growth but hey it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
Apple should do in 2016 to change this
the company obviously can change their
revenue plans and their product
portfolio what do you think the company
should do and please do not say launch a
phone running android leave us a comment
