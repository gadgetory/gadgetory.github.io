still breaks records just barely LG
rumors point to another flagship instead
of the g5 MWC and Spotify it gets ready
to branch out to other media
I'm Hema Ravenna and if you got drunk
yesterday with the whole tequila thing
shame on you
this is parking out daily the official
news today aside from my shiny face have
everything to do with Spotify the
company has made it official that
they're branching out from music now you
can also watch video and listen to
podcasts though we wonder exactly how
this is going to be when compared to
everything you could already get on
YouTube stay tuned as it'll launch on
android in certain countries starting
this week and then next week on iOS and
given the amount of leaks we've been
covering up the galaxy s7 those of you
that are panicking that there won't be
any expandable storage because
apparently nobody's seen any slots on
the renders well we've got trusted
sources claiming that this will be a
hybrid sim trade just like we've seen in
some Samsung Galaxy mid Rangers and the
other phones that we've seen launched
this year this is a pretty much the
trend to happen apparently yes
expandable storage will happen on the
galaxy s7 and now we've got some u.s.
sources already claiming that the HTC
One em 10 will make it to AT&amp;amp;T we
haven't seen the phone yet but yeah
apparently that's gonna be the case
we're just worried that this will be an
AT&amp;amp;T exclusive which we know has never
worked well for any you know the
companies that have gone for exclusives
but then again it could be the option
still probably the other thing that's
made headlines is the fact that the m10
will apparently look a lot like the a9
meaning it'll look a lot like the iPhone
and we've kept a close eye on the
successor to the LG g4 and we've dubbed
it the g5 because it's been the case for
years but LG Pollin was in a recent
conversation over twitter I believe it
is and it seems that even though they
did not confirm that it's not going to
be called the g5 apparently they left it
as part of the mystery it seems that LG
will be launching a flagship we're not
necessarily sure if it'll be called a g5
but parent
there could be a number change we wonder
it has anything to do with the be 10 or
whatever and finally the very hot news
today have to do with apples quarter
results the company has broken records
again particularly in profitability and
revenue in corporate America history
which is good but then again not
necessarily great for Apple the company
pretty much only grew point four percent
when it came to iPhone sales when pretty
much to just seventy four point eight
million units and then when it comes to
iPads they were down twenty five percent
which I believe is an all-time low the
Mac's were also down and pretty much
everything else meaning that even though
Apple did break records again the
company did not do so in a staggering
way and the Cupertino was clear it seems
that they've come to the end of an era
they've spent the last thirteen years
growing in quarters year over a year and
it won't happen anymore
which is a rather interesting I did feel
that there had to be a point where Apple
had to stop the growth but hey it leads
me to the question of the day what do
you think Apple should do in 2016 to
change this the company obviously can
change their revenue plans and their
product portfolio what do you think the
company should do and please do not say
launch a phone running Android leave us
a comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion
