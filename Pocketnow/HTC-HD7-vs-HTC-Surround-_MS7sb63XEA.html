going to do a quick comparison between
the HTC surround on ATT its speakers
there and the HTC hd7 on t-mobile so
let's check them out okay so here we are
we got the hd7 and the HTC surround now
there's a lot of similarities between
these two both have a LCD screen with
the nice silver rims around them okay
the hd7 has a slightly dimmer screen
even with the same settings just
interesting and of course the HTC 7 has
a much larger screen at 4.3 inches and
we see the hd7 has fake stereo speakers
you got like a speaker grill there on
both sides so that when you set it on
the kickstand it looks like it could be
a nice little movie watching experience
if those were stereo speakers but in
reality we only have the speaker on the
back however the HTC surround does have
real speakers here and there are pretty
nice quality so we're going to try to
show you how those work and compare them
so let me get some music up
oops I want
so we're going to hear that
there are no countries so that's volume
all the way not much distortion that
just it's pretty loud now let's see how
that compares on the hd7 hopefully you
can hear the difference there now
there's nothing coming out of these so
you can tell admission is coming out of
that back everything that's coming out
of that back speaker so that's how that
works let's see what a movie looks like
let's see if we got the same one over
here volume all the way up and clearly
the surround is a lot better so there we
go in terms of software it's pretty much
the same we're very quick here let's
just get our same color here
both are very quick
on the back we both have 5 megapixel
cameras but the hd2 has a dual LED flash
where's the HTC surround only has a
single LED flash but the hd7 seems to
have trouble with the white balance and
often gives you a pink tint to some of
the pictures where the HTC surround is a
little better but it also has its own
issues it's not not great cameras anyway
that's our comparison between the HTC
surround and the HTC hd7 hope you liked
this video that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
