good evening everybody again hopefully
this time nobody will kill the broadcast
this is season 2 episode 12 and a half
from the bucket alive in the same
formation and we'll just pick it up
where we left it off and i'm here with
the steven camera on him and i'm also
here with Taylor camera on him let's
leave the camera on him and let's have
him take this away for now all right i'm
gonna choose someone I haven't spoken to
in a very long time mr. dominicano if
you could unmute yourself it's been
months a very very long time how are you
sir incredibly tired I got up for work
at 6am this morning so right there with
you I'm very tired myself after it was
after calling it a night at like 3am why
I have no idea I know why I didn't get
to bed until 2am it's because i have a
kitten who doesn't like me sleeping so
and at the moment i'm also puppy sitting
a staffordshire bull terrier somewhere
nice so what device are you using these
days I still got the nexus 4 which is
being retired like next week when i get
a moto G because I get my first paycheck
next week and and I also i still have
this review loner that i never actually
got around to giving back to a company
and its i actually posted in the forum
just a Chinese phone with a quad-core
mediatek chip a 1080p 5-inch screen
actually not bad but yeah the
performance it was had so much better
with a 720p display i think the GPU is
just really struggling with a 1080p
display do i will say is an absolutely
gorgeous display yeah well i think
you're going to enjoy the Moto G it's
it's very quaint but it's a very nice
home and I didn't want to send mine back
so so there's that but you have any
questions for myself or Steven or Tony
regularly about mobile Congress what to
expect or anything like that I
yeah personally for me I've got
ridiculously tiny hands so I'm actually
really interested in the Xperia z1
compact really hard not to experience
that one mini but I wondered if if Sony
is going to be there and if they'll
bring the z1 compact because they
announced it yes yeah I know that'll be
there the usually motorola Sony and all
the others whatever they are now to CES
they have that phone on display with
their booth at mwc now I'm guessing
there will be no other announcements or
minor announcements at mwc but the
phones from CES namely the compact
because the z1s is basically does he
want it will be there what about these
as e to rumors you've been hearing about
as well kind of you see if you like for
that to be announced at mwc but sony if
my memory serves well has never launched
something big at mwc Casillas is their
turf so I'm guessing that it will be
somewhere in within the year either
during summer or towards I don't know q3
minus Z Xperia S launched I genuine I'm
struggling to member as they see som de
Leon was CES and it's basically one
front for tmobile with the the loop
removed and replaced by a plastic rim
and that will see yes yes but I'd like
to believe they do like her a fresh said
one or maybe even the side to now but
it's just too early I mean we got the
said one in like september-october
didn't we maybe yeah yeah the rumors
about the the z two are weird because
they're so very very similar to the z1
gasping it's slightly larger display but
the processor apparently looks like it's
going to be unchanged it's unclear why
people would be drawn to this device
rather than there's not even sure I
think at all Steven you're the one who
brought up the spell is point either
last week or or on the bot guest I'm
sure it came out from your mouth that
we're might not be looking at the sea
too but the world might be looking at a
specific carrier version of the z1 yeah
not like a z1 see again the money go not
another carrier version probably a for
either another US carrier or from for
before what if I don't
Hey look that ray so it's like Sony is
taking on samsung from three years ago
Oh God so we can expect about eight more
versions of it before it's over with but
to answer your initial question I was
never this amped about the mini phone
like I am about the z1 compact because
I've reviewed the s4 mini I've reviewed
the one mini and they're all nice phones
i mean i'm still using the one mini
every now and then but the z1 compact
finally brings the flagship to the
smaller form factor than four point
something inch screen which is which is
something you're not seeing every day
nowadays and thank God that someone's
doing this this is long overdue this is
the way it should be done I mean it's
very much chicken and sorry Taylor and
it's very much a chicken and egg problem
it's we loads of people say they want
smaller phones with high-end specs but
like the trade-off for that is it's
usually going to be a thicker phone
because of thermal constraints or the
battery and then the price is very high
and then it doesn't matter if it's in
the US or even here in the UK bigoted
equates to bet I mean the amount of them
galaxy Mega's I've seen around here is a
phenomenal it's like why would you buy
the mega like I want to know it's not a
super know and but bigger equates to
better yeah it's like I least in every
wish for you yeah um do you think Sony
went with the compact name or moniker to
try to avoid any stigma related to many
phones because the ipad mini was
originally much more toned down from the
the ipad for the HTC one mini its
specifications aren't as great as the
HTC One the s4 mini same thing and they
has three mini same thing it's been
going on for years so do you think that
might be why they what was compact I
that's what they said I think they just
wanted to be a little bit awkward as
well but I think I genuinely also had
something to do with it I mean like you
said the s4 mini especially was not very
well received it almost anywhere I think
because it it
wasn't an s4 straight up it's yeah well
I wanted he's not a one either yeah yeah
that no mini phone has been it's been
many to at least mobile manufacturers
means um toned down yeah so one of my
good friends just came back to the
United States after being abroad for
several years so he needed to get a new
phone and I've been pushing
recommendations at him left and right
and then while he was on vacation unable
to be get my scholarly advice went ahead
and bought himself a galaxy s4 mini oh
seems to like it but I just can't help
shake my head oh the things that could
have been if you just got yourself a
moto x well listen the s4 mini is not
the bat phone no it's got a nice display
just a little low res and yeah but it
performs well I mean it's you know which
you can easily bug down it's just that I
think that it's more in our minds that
we are expecting more and we don't
really under or maybe we understand the
difference between a flagship and its
mini sibling but we fail to see the
actual difference and the different
target audience for everyone to be
something it's not perhaps I I
understand that I mean but again it's
just that didn't is it the s4 mini that
has a really weird one and a half gigs
of RAM yeah like why not but why not
we've got a couple of extra like chip
said this just just solder them down I
mean we're gonna sell a couple one a
half gags get for it and how much more
would it possibly cost to use two
gigabytes instead of the one and a half
I mean it's like another one and a half
of some hands of components it's yeah
it's not normal anyway so you think it
would be more expensive to implement
just by nature of being a little odd
yeah this dis is so damn song we're
talking about these guys like I don't
think money is a concern to them in any
of their departments like what what's
their flex will display technological is
that you why are you emmerson like that
yeah yeah like I I don't know if it was
at CES or if it was a special Samsung
conference they had like flexible
display demos of people hitting the
displays with like hammers just to show
how durable they were it's just like
that must have been terrifying in the
lab well however
many millions of dollars you've made to
make this tiny screen which is flexible
and you're whacking it with a hammer I I
don't think I could do it no this to me
the robots whack the phones with the
Hammers come on oh oh is it like oh gee
with the wire brush on the g flex yeah
dude really Michael anyone to scrub it
it's fun yeah Michael would enjoy it
each that's what he should do for a
living actually I think I think Michael
look for one he should be the one
responsible for actually starting the
entire process of robots just hammering
should one big red button he'd be like
this ah what a creep that Michael let
Michael yeah yeah many go any any final
thoughts or any questions or anything
you would like to wrap this intervention
with I'd like to say congratulations on
your promotion Tony well I haven't been
here for a while thank you around it's
just a general keep up the good work for
all of you guys and especially to Steven
because I was speaking to Hayatou about
this after he was on the weekly you need
to do a video man we we've been talking
about this we think it was so cool you
know what I need to get this a legit
camera cuz I am rocking I don't know how
I looked you guys I'm probably in like
hvga coming through here oh no dude you
look 8-bit it's fine love it lovely
lovely 8 bits in man you could you could
make an 8-bit video dude you could be on
the eighth day is all in on the Ouya
it's fine hey we got a new year going
we'll see what happens and I guys I have
one last question for you just just very
quick question which Moto G are you
getting the original moto g or the
google play edition Google's when I if
anyone's right as I pressed it I'm like
wait he can't nevermind just ignore that
question but it's essentially the same
phone it's got the same bands as the
google GOOG I mean I'm kind of the most
exciting thing about it is they is it
the motorola sister that has all the the
special modem for driving and sleeping
and stuff like that that's the X the
driving doesn't work on the Moto G yea
though the exists app is there but it's
only like half implemented tria I mean
that's great for me because I'm quite on
my new job
on call so if I just have like my office
number i like there and it's like oh
these guys can come through and call me
at three in the morning to come in for a
shift but no one else can like as either
like at the moment I had to put cm on my
phone for quiet hours like straight-up
cyanogenmod for quiet hours does it like
yeah I totally understand it's a great
thing but if you want to tell everyone
where they can follow you on Google+
Twitter Facebook whatever see ya fancy
you can get me on twitter at mobile
underscored Dom you can circle me on
google+ at g + t 04 / domenico lamberti

have no idea how you hear him because I
cannot hear him it looked quiet but I
can make you that's much better yeah um
so uh yeah i'm in florida tampa bay see
like the one place in united states is
not completely freezing right now this
is yeah lucky for you know it's it's
well it the Floridians would disagree
with you but i'm trying to hurt altered
45 min to user degree yeah so i took on
um on facebook i think it was two days
ago and it said 50 degrees in florida
and had these guys and ski jackets and
toboggans and gloves they were like
skiing like this was like 50 degrees
yeah at the end of the world over here
so it's 16 here right now so yeah it's
freezing and it's normally he like 30
here at the very least so it's very cold
for everybody here I could let that it
was still 30 out we're pushing my limits
long they supply everyone's in the
hoodies is why work mmm but enough of
the weather oh what's going on what do
you that octave is about today anything
on your mind or well the only one real
device I'm super excited for but that
seems like the dates keep disappearing
reappearing and it's nakia so it's the
it's the icon because I starting with
that I could have guessed like any
number of maybe five or six devices
we're really looking forward to them we
know that's actually when their
government is he talking about the gs5
you're talking about the iphone 6 but
Diana that milky has been hanging around
in the corners for a while now yeah I
share the same probably feelings as most
people have especially in your guys
industry with the Galaxy devices as I'm
not a itouch with fan and we'll see what
the the new you magazine UX brings if it
does come to the new Galaxy devices it
looks better on the tablet
so on tablet yet but I'm zone yeah yeah
I don't know how they're gonna do that
but but I mean it seems like this icon
is ready to burst practically I I don't
know what is taking verizon so long here
they're not giving themselves any favors
by dragging this thing out yeah did the
928 do something very similar the
billboards were an out like you had
leaked billboards uh like officially
showing this thing it was in magazines
before either nokia or verizon would
either accept that this knew existed it
works best i don't recall it does not
sound too surprising yeah what was that
back in May that that guy arrived mmhmm
yeah um I can't figure it out what's
what they gain from putting this off any
longer than I have and we were looking
forward to this guy back in November in
early December i mean i could and mwc
launch i mean we have this nokia event
coming up here that would be a weird
thing to be announced at a networking
event I'm very late to the game with
this device I mean especially on the
cusp of Nokia bringing other devices
probably maybe international devices I
don't think we'll be seeing too many new
major devices here on 80 the 1520 is
still a very new phone and it's a great
phone so i don't know i don't think
anything news going to be coming maybe
verizon just thinking this the following
way we'll just bring the phone whatever
nobody wants anymore that's pretty much
what they do with every phone ever met
so I look at the galaxy note 2 how long
did that take to come to verizon mm-hmm
forever forever almost right it came out
on verizon like two months before the
the note 3 came out so whatever yeah so
I'm waiting for that device still I'm
really want that device and I yeah
everybody likes the Moto X 0 seems
that's the general consensus is a lot of
people like the Moto X i love the Moto X
and I think I've shared that with you
guys before um I think the other if you
guys saw but somebody accidentally
dropped before dot for dot to update for
that thing did you not did anybody see
yet no I missed that yeah it's somebody
accidentally got I don't know if it was
pushed accidentally from google servers
or how it came out but I have a feeling
even though verizon doesn't have a Nexus
device the Moto X is going to be the
closest darn thing they have to it and
probably any carrier has because it's it
seems like it's a very well supported
device software wise by motorola they're
standing by what they said they were
going to do and not support the devices
to get broken Motorola's really turned
itself around a bit I mean maybe not so
much well with the droids on on verizon
I mean they're getting a lot of who is
with the sound effects board there we're
getting a lot of a good software support
with apps especially with the XM AG
those speed these updates are coming out
is ridiculous and I think one of those
guys wrote about this last week had this
is really going to force other
manufacturers hands hopefully to step up
their own games mm-hmm and I think we
need that because people are I mean for
as much that Google's done to make
fragmentation less of an issue than it's
been in years past new focus on
everything's a service you don't
necessarily need the latest Android to
enjoy all the latest Android features
there's still this I mean it beats a
societal pressure you know the fanboys
he wants to have the latest software but
you want it and but if other companies
can do it Motorola's doing people will
respond i think yeah I think that what's
helping them a lot is um i'm gonna i'm
not going to say that it has something
to do with google owning them but i
think it has a lot to do with they have
a very vanilla ish version of android
and i think that is what's helping them
the most I think yesterday or this
morning I heard that uh the HTC one's
are in their certification process right
now all the carriers so we should be
seeing that very soon I know the g2
supposed to be getting it any month now
so I think that's becoming huge focus
for OEMs is software support software
updates but while we're on normal
rolla still what do you think about
these rumors that rumors but that the
company's been saying it would love to
make a fifty-dollar smartphone that's a
lot of people are saying that this is
you know they can only get away with
that because of the Google connection
but like you're saying with the updates
I I want to believe them that they're
not getting they don't have this
pipeline to Google a special connection
and other manufacturers aren't enjoying
so that would mean that they would want
to sell this 50 telephone for themselves
without some heavy heavy subsidies
coming from google it sounds crazy but I
mean if it wasn't completely awful would
you be interested in something like that
I mean because has a backup phone I'm
very interest i've been interested in
the Moto X and the Moto G on the price
that it came out with and I know that
there were some corners they cut in
comparison to what features they took
out from the X yeah but it still didn't
lose that much do you know what else
could that boy you just hear us as what
else they're going to cut again yeah
that fifty dollar price point I mean the
camera was already dropped the screen
still a 720 but i don't know maybe they
go to 960 x 540 or i mean i think that
the Moto G still is a great phone for
emerging markets or and for someone who
is on a price or just someone who
doesn't want a contract so you guys are
not seeing this like I said they're
gonna invent a new product on the market
is gonna be the burner smartphone oh I
mean more power to them if they can but
I gotta wonder what is this component i
think the display is the big thing that
a lot of people are thinking I was going
to take the hit to bring the price down
now in the radios resolution Oh a little
much lower can they go just be GPRS or
something I have another 3g well they
aren't the Moto G that the Moto G is 3
g.r yeah there's no LTE there no no but
you can get hspa+ so I mean it I don't
know I don't know I just know that they
they could they could cut a lot of
corners every time I know if it's gonna
be worth it but I go ahead go ahead
sorry every time I wonder like well how
could you know either so this industry
change in any aspect and I think about
the iWatch and all these other things
that are happy
right now and then something changes and
I'm like oh that's how they did it so I
don't know how they're going to be able
to produce this fifty dollar price point
phone but if they are going to do it I'm
sure they have an angle and it will seem
obvious in once they do it like oh you
have Morris that was that was how they
were always going to do it we knew that
um circling back to the software things
are sort of part of the argument where
some people are saying that because
Motorola is part of Google that it has
an advantage and part of it is not that
it's part of it is the vanilla
experience that you get on motorola's
phones but the other is what they
released I don't remember when it was
but it's called the PDK and it is not
the the transmission on the Porsche 20
so calm down yeah for a second my heart
was racing no it's the the platform
developer kit where any partner
manufacturer that agrees to Google
standards can get in on android update
before their official or before they
have they pushed the full software
update so back when fragmentation was a
huge huge issue with the problem was
that Google would release the source
code and when when it released the
source code that's when manufacturer
started working towards getting the
update out with the PDK it releases
versions so betas and Alpha's of the new
software updates to manufacturers so
they get started on updates before
anybody else sees it so so anybody who
says that Motorola has an unfair
advantage over the other manufacturers
if they do it's probably days why I
didn't know that existed but that's
that's correct that does sound familiar
PD that does sound of that that makes a
lot of sense and i'm sure that's that
google wants to encourage this because
they want they will android wants to
encourage us because they want they
don't want fragmentation yet they can
reduce it in any way possible without
giving an unfair advantage and that's
that's definitely a way of doing it if i
remember correctly pdk was announced
shortly after google bought motorola so
it was kind of a it was kind of obvious
move so to say hey we're not going to
give motorola an unfair advantage this
is what we're going to do
thinking that if if Motorola has a
certain advantage which I do believe
they do it is similar to the advantage
which a nexus phone OEM has meaning that
in this particular case LG and Motorola
have access to that enormous amount of
bank money which Google can sacrifice in
order to keep the price down for the
Nexus 5 and to keep the price down for
phones like the Moto X and the Moto G
that's I think the major advantage which
I see according to my beliefs yeah
Motorola has the advantage of Google's
bankroll and there are deep deep deep
pockets that's what I'm saying okra
motorola itself is on the upswing i
forgot the actual figures but some
recently quarterly report Motorola's
turning a I don't they're losing money
or just or losing less money or making
money but their profits are turning
around so maybe they will be
self-supporting yeah I think what the MU
X launched q3 was it and that put a lot
of momentum to order for Motorola and I
think you know this is going to be I
think this is going to be the big
turnaround year for motorola okay let's
wrap it up slowly rich I'm locking my
camera on you because I see that you
have your twitter handle right there yep
is there any social media which you use
and which you would like to pimp out um
I did Instagram is the same it's a be us
I XB b and that's it cool well thank you
very much really yeah thanks for having
on always a pleasure come back whenever
you have time and you feel like it
alright thanks guys take care take care
ok see you i wonder when we're gonna get
someone who's pimping their social media
thing for one of these not bizarre but
the Liza well what's the one that's big
in brazil that google has orchid or
something mmm i'm not sure but i'm still
waiting for thats person who's waited
for the way bill and Weibo yeah i'll
have been waiting for someone to tell me
to add them on Friendster
myspace look me up I pick somebody I
maybe you're lucky maybe they'll add you
on Yandex on what you'll even know what
it is it's the Russian Yahoo oh oh of
course of course and I'm gonna go with
rod because he held up his phone when we
were talking about the weather and it
said negative 20 degrees Celsius in that
is cold what's that sound cold it's not
real no is real cool regular 26 years
very light it's negative 4 degrees
Fahrenheit 20 degrees o- good friend
Ellen Google now Google doesn't
understand negatives so how are you run
a burning guy other thought what was it
yeah also everything guys I'm great it's
it's cold here and looking at its it's
great I'd be obviously tired but other
than that I have no complaints okay look
except for my except for my jacked-up
Moto X thanks brandon google minus 21
but it's wrong down there one is minus
90 degrees that's rough that is very
rough do you have any questions for the
team here first yeah probably these are
little old news but i want to ask you
guys you know something about the black
phone what kind of specific issues
coming in that bomb no I cover that
press release and at the moment of the
press release there were no information
regarding the internals of the black
phone but we are waiting to meet up with
the guys in Spain in Barcelona for the
mwc and hopefully we'll be able to tell
you more but I do also think that there
was on their site as well as on the
press release a link where you could
just sign up for future details
regarding the phone okay okay that's
good and I think suggested a you guys
post a picture of supposed to be the new
Galaxy find the background the faculty
phone
yellow-crowned ah personally when I
don't like I don't know what you guys
think about that back size of the palm
uh I talked about it earlier I think
it's fake okay yeah ramiz ugly yes
Steven I think agrees with me on that it
I'd took a screenshot of the screenshot
and kind of circled some areas that look
fake like all the jagged edges around
the sides and the camera cut out and
everything like that it's really jagged
and just doesn't look real good what
does it mean that the whole thing is
fake that doesn't mean that there aren't
colored Nexus 5's but those renders were
not real at least the the celluloid I
took away from one of the complaints was
there's a video of it and the guys
clicking through the various color
options and the URLs not taking to
reflect the color options like it should
be yeah okay that's good to know yeah so
I'd love to see a red nexus 5 I mean I
love red all the things but I don't
think that will I don't know prefer the
Goblin yeah I went red and black on my
Moto X I I'm right there with you how
come you still got the imei sticker on
there oh I don't know I still talk with
that I'd like keeping the finish fresh
underneath this fair no I don't miss
budget just have to take it off I don't
know thank you now when i got mine I was
worried that that wasn't something you
could take off because it's really
really flush and there wasn't like an
obvious way to pull it up like should I
be pulling this off am I gonna ruin this
thing is to be nice keeping the qualcomm
4g stickers on my samsung phone do you
remember the the HTC One X it's imei
sticker on the back seam a picture of
that it was bad like it was this giant
ugly not even square picture urgh or
sticker that came on the back of it I
don't see it anywhere
but it said inside the box that said
peel the sticker off ins and keep it and
nobody feel it I peeled it off
immediately it was ugly it was hideous
but I don't see it anywhere yeah well
okay gentlemen let us slowly move on
okay guys hmm thank you don't you say
the next week is the last one will have
the season finale yes and then we're
gonna go on a hiatus I yeah I got that
word right finally and we'll be back
after mwc sometime around midnight okay
cool thank you you have more nouncement
sand blings on pocket now and all the
social media channel so you even miss it
okay so guys thank you see you after
thank you for being here thanks for
joining us thank you I'm really quickly
I found a picture of that imei sticker
let me know that is a biggie yeah it
wasn't even square it was just they like
close yeah so the first thing I did was
rip that off but you got to in the box
so all they will never eat again you can
put one back yeah Steven please back to
you hey how about the role here I love
those gigantic hands on your ears their
total noise isolation how's it going
good good can you turn up your mic a
little bit you're a tad quiet on our end
here yeah yep I don't know what to do
that actually no it's good algonquin
yeah okay make its meaning and closer
did uh so what's going on where are you
Colin Colin chatting with us from what
device are you raucous all the t's well
I'm from I am from Belgium and currently
i use a Lumia 920 nice nice what's up
Belgium so that's where we saw those uh
those leaks of crap was it I totally
blanking what phone just had those leaks
from the retailer and Belgium like two
days ago Oh wasn't that the so-called
golden algae no no no no it was three
orders for a looza dip my tongue
I've got nothing helicopter it'll come
to me anyway uh what's going on well as
i understand that nokia has a issued
Mobile World Congress invitations but
what do we do 3 neo by the way note 3
neo is it was on pre-order okay sorry
continue but wouldn't it be Microsoft by
then already I mean mobile in February
that's a very good question we were kind
of hoping that that announcement of the
finalization of the deal would have
happened by now because both companies
released their quarterly earnings
statements yesterday and the way that
Nokia talked about it devices and
services division was going to be
formally label has discontinued from as
of now so it's kind of in this up in the
air state I mean we're expecting like
herself to say this is a done deal
Nokia's part of us we're going to be
making the phones going forward listen
this is still possible in this scenario
which I'm going to tell you now is
completely idiotic but but possible
maybe Microsoft will have a booth at mwc
showing off the new Microsoft Lumia
phones and nakia will show off the Asha
phones and whatever is left the left of
Nokia that is possible it will never
happen but it could work out like this
Microsoft gets a Shinto yes I thought so
too and there's that wouldn't what is
still able to use the Nokia branding on
HS but not on Lumias yeah yeah that is
true it's correct it's a complete mess
at the moment so I'm not sure they know
what what what's going on probably not
Steve Ballmer's just jumping around
screaming nokia and and that's really
all that's happening at Microsoft right
now yeah maybe they're holding off on
the end of deal no females but to do
kind of like a simultaneous with the new
CEO supposedly that means is coming as
well hmm it's true I just wonder what
meet us under the tree means yeah trying
to find some hidden meaning in that but
it wasn't clicking you don't unique
their booth have no idea what it means
it is nigga theme of mwc this year it's
like this
there is the tree of innovation or
something maybe their entire booth will
be like an inside like inside a tree a
giant fake tree memories are
reminiscences from vegas casinos Taylor
they had fries you can walk through in
the casinos no oh but giant everything
and uh events trees fake trees like
everything is a yes yep even the people
are fake there but I have a question for
uh I think it's real rule pronounced
like in English is just picture my name
like this are you le then you're like
you you rule Annette okay so a question
for you are you looking forward to
seeing any specific phones from Nokia
being a windows phone user and asking
about nokia would there be a phone which
you would love to see on the mwc show
floor well what I really would like to
see but that's never going to happen
it's my perfect combination of
everything nokia windows phone and it is
a well a Lumia 925 design with a 5.3
inch screen and 42 41 megapixel camera
on the back that's no no I'm gonna drop
the camera you gotta drop the camera
yeah but I would be awesome what about
those 15 20 v AK 1520 mini rumors i imed
i mixed the had mixed feelings about
those but what do you think about those
uh well like I read the article and like
like you said I'd really don't think
it's real as well but I don't know it
would be a nice device although I
wouldn't really see the logic you know
in releasing such a fundament we'll have
to wait and see under the tree yeah I'm
most curious about the tablet rumors
because it seemed like for a while we
were following a possible smaller like
an 8 inch air tablet from Nokia and then
the end of the year it started sounding
like that fell apart for one reason or
another would be Microsoft didn't want
to see this device or some reason to
felt like it was being shelved and now
it's back
in the rumors for a possible reveal at
mwc I mean what do you think with an
eight incher be a nice complement to the
2520 or really need a proper phablet I
mean besides the 1520 but something
maybe in the six things like a mega type
of Nokia what do you think hmm well I'm
not sure it probably it would be an RT
tablet so Marie not interested that's
kind I mean Artie's gotten better this
year but you're right it's still not the
flexibility yep all windows that's also
the reason why I didn't buy a 25-20
because I really wanted a Windows Device
I win a regular windows no windows phone
mm and I was looking forward for a
Nokia's hardware because over you had a
Lumia phone but I went with the surface
pro 2 which i'm using now right by the
way because it's going to buy 20 is RT
yeah really um I was just reading some
speculation on what under the tree might
mean and I think it's a long shot but
somebody was saying that it would have
the next film would have photovoltaic
cells on the screen oh yeah yeah i saw
that pop up multiple one photo charging
solar solar panels on this gonna happen
mark my words january 24th never gonna
happen it's one of these things it's
like never you can you say never listen
dealer here's all the demo technology
for the solar charging on phones is is
there technically it's possible it
wouldn't be a huge phone it wouldn't be
there's there are no speed bumps and
still nobody has thought of it why
because most of the times our phones are
in our pockets that's true not nay
wanted that I mean most of mine if I sit
down my phones are on the table yeah
they're seeing seeing light but I think
for me like it or if not for me for for
the sake of the technology I think it's
kind of a thing where instead of it your
battery dying and draining when you're
not using it if you just sit it on the
table or somewhere said it somewhere
where it's seeing sunlight it doesn't
necessarily charge but it doesn't die so
it kind of this little kind of
levitation of battery
our status like like they had a solar
phone back I don't know what it was but
it was a the Puma phone I can't remember
who made it was a manufacturer that I
don't ever like I've never heard of him
before that or after that but they made
the Puma phone and you could turn it up
side down lay it on the table face down
when you were using it and or like if
you're like listening music and it would
slowly slowly charge yeah guys it down
for that let me down for that right and
you're repeating my words I'm marking it
no I think it's one of these things like
flexible displays where it's been
popping up in these expose for a while
now it doesn't seem very practical we're
looking at a technology and we're
thinking okay that's cool I don't really
understand how it's going to make my
phone that much better it seems like a
pain in the ass to implement so it's
probably never going to happen in the
commercial device and then boom last
year we get the g flex and the galaxy
round so maybe this is a year when the
solar charging actually happens in a way
that makes us take notice and say maybe
this isn't such a a weird niche feature
here and it's something that could
actually see success I think the key is
going to be how how the actual cells are
implemented because no one likes just
the look of solar panel on a phone it's
on the back it's going to be weird
looking and if this rumored integration
with the the screen somehow how would
the charge transparently you wouldn't
even notice there was a solar panel
embedded in the screen that would be
awesome I don't think we've seen a demo
of that yet I don't think I've seen a
transparent solar panel ever know and
that's sort of I mean just from a
physics standpoint you wonder how a
transparent panel could possibly be
absorbing the photons needed to convert
into electricity so sure a lot of
proving needs to be done but I don't
think we should dismiss this just yet
Tony woods benefit for for the state in
which the technology is right now oh
yeah yeah yeah I'm saying never know
it'll happen if middle is it not it
never like not not in the next 25 years
yeah not this year and most definitely
not next year not by my world congress
no not at this good
so under the tree it's probably not
photovoltaic cells in a poem but okay
rule we will have to slowly wrap it up
as we're getting close to the one-hour
mark and we'll getting away the last
call so in case you have any final
thoughts or questions please by all
means no but really it was a pleasure to
be here thanks for coming by can people
say hi on the social media they want to
get in touch with you uh well I hope
they can spell it but my my username on
twitter is are like the first letter of
my first name and then my last name
behind it directly behind it fan i can
written v.v a n.e why kan perfect Oh
aren't great thank you very much for
being here and you come back I will take
care thanks for joining us see you see
I'll take I'll take the last call
because I'm a jerk like that so let's
talk to uh Patrick I haven't seen you
around please unmute and talk to us and
and he left yeah oh yeah away just here
to watch if today is not my day ok let
us talk to you David we have to first
unmute your microphone I can try to do
that for you oh yeah hello yes we can
yet can you hear us yeah cool where are
you from I'm from google this is C again
bosnia-hercegovina from Bosnia Rosanna
close to me how are you today and what
do you want to talk about Oh talk about
David hold on just one second because
your audio is breaking up I'm suggesting
that you should probably kill your video
too
bandwidth so that your audio comes
through oh let's try to look if you
hover your mouse pointer over your look
you got now let's try to go I won't talk
about the new Nexus than that and the
awesome the new Nexus 10 acclaim one we
then DF for and yes four and five and
yes five okay that all I don't be moved
three we're here okay so well while you
I got the thing phone or your thoughts I
will tell you this I'm not sure whether
L dartmoor dozen is is I don't know
playing us or considers us fools I'd
like to think so we've seen so this
elder guy has accurately predicted the
galaxy s4 launch last year in February
for March 14 in New York and now he
claims that the galaxy s5 will be
launched on februari 23rd in Barcelona
which by itself is an information which
I do not believe because Samsung left
the show floor like to galaxy s's before
and chances are that they won't come
back because the unpacked event can
really back any venue around the world
so he tweets that and the next day he
says that you know what because of the
leak samsung reconsidered now I don't
tend to believe it what do you guys
think oh I haven't even been following
it to be honest like if I'm gonna be
completely honest I haven't um I'm not
even gonna try to comment on that I
think little are shown as overseas I
you know launch it in WC I'm with Tony
on this one I can't see this happening
not this soon not with so many other
things going on I think it will be a
premiere at nwc s and then really like
in April well why did why do you think
it will come back to mwc because the
first galaxy s but didn't really matter
galaxy s2 was launched as and at mwc
then the S free went to London and the
s4 went to New York why do you think the
s5 will come back to mwc because of the
sales of the s4 and they want to hype it
no they're having those rumors that
Samsung matter to me who put it in April
oh this might be a perception issue but
in my mind having a new phone at a show
will expose it to less buzz than having
a special event between shows yep I
agree we've seen Samsung HTC Apple
corolla apple I mean everybody has moved
away from this trade show announcement
thing at least in the mobile space it
works remember to 925 event from London
well even the 920 event or the 901 yeah
they they get a lot more exposure
because you don't have 50 announcements
in one day you have one or two or three
and they're all from one company and
just you get a lot more exposure from
the press from anybody who's interested
and everything it's easier to keep up
with I think it's weird that Google's
the one company has taken this to the
mean DV times a logical conclusion but
once that asked removing yourself from
the expo then removing yourself from the
individual show Google's just releasing
devices and not even caring to make a
big stink about it what it happens yeah
that's that's some serious ego moves
right there yeah they don't they don't
even put the money into into having an
event they're just like oh oh yeah we
did launch that yesterday we forgot to
tell you yeah but you know you want your
buy it anyway so yeah just because we
don't agree with you it doesn't mean
we're trying to be jerks it's just that
we really don't think that the industry
is is moving in a or Samsung within the
industry is moving towards mwc I would
be happy because I would not have to
travel to London again sometime during
summer for the event what I London is
lovely in summer come on Michael
wouldn't have to put up with tap dance
and Tommy again in New York yeah will be
much much better than the note 3 or
somewhere there it will definitely be a
better phone than the s4 it will also be
incrementally better than the note 3 the
rumors are speculating on a Snapdragon
800 the new Exynos processor whether if
it will be 64 bit or not we can only
speculate on it'll be a kick-ass phone
it will also have most of it specs
present in the note for you guys left
the way Samsung operate after after CES
when we did recounts of the stories that
you know we cover of the things that we
saw we didn't really get a chance to
talk about the rumors that didn't happen
though and I was expecting a lot more XO
knows news at CES they put this big
teaser and we never got an announcement
a major shift of this hmp be activated
in the existing Exynos 5 so maybe we
aren't looking forward to you know this
crazy hot new X and O's for 2014 being
in the s5 or maybe that's where he give
the X dose announcement alongside the
gs5 but I thought that was weird maybe
Samsung isn't moving quite as quickly as
they would like to so I have a little
experience with Samsung Exynos so not
just Samsung Exynos is a company within
samsung called samsung exynos and they
invited me to this private event two
years ago my first year at CES they
invited me to this little exclusive in
da I had to sign NDA's I had I couldn't
say a word about it and they invited us
into this room they were like we're
going to show you the new Exynos and I
was there with maybe five other other
writers from other sites and they
invited us into this room they said we
need you to sign this in da hold on
don't sign that we're going to print out
another one we have a difference in da
for you design and we signed it there
were like oh we also need you to sign
this in da and it was supposed to be
like a 20-minute event it ended up being
like an hour and a half and we finally
walked in the room we got in the room
and everything was under wraps and they
were like yeah we decided we can't show
you any of the stuff all of this is
under wraps so you can look at our
existing products did you needn't wait
here are you like instantly like hey
this is the NDI side yeah this is like
what am i doing like oh my gosh you
invited me I waited an hour and a half
for you to change your mind and show me
stuff that already exists you know this
actually was this was a prank Qualcomm
playing on you guys yeah it had been
like it was awful like two miles off the
strip it was just the most annoying
thing and and and finally like they
admitted there like we're not ready to
release this product debt and I figure
that's probably what's happening right
now or at least happened at CES why we
didn't see anything from X and O's but
we were expecting stuff from Qualcomm
Tegra which earned nvidia which we got a
new Tegra and then yeah and then uh
Exynos and we got in video so i don't
know but i dunno i wrote a piece on the
galaxy s5 a few days ago i think it
might have been one last week I don't
know all my days when she did all my
days run together I don't know these
things but uh I wrote it and it was what
we're hoping for what we're wishing for
and rumored is four gigabytes of RAM um
I knew a new design language which 4
gigabytes of RAM is insane but a new
design language so they're saying that
it'll probably still be plastic but
samsung said that they're trying to get
away from the hyper glaze and make it a
higher quality cover they said it's all
about the cover and the user experience
and software so that's what we'll
probably see in my mind there is
absolutely no doubt that the foe
stitched leather thing from the note 3
and from the new 2014 tablet lineup will
be there on the s5 I wouldn't like that
I wouldn't mind it the evidence i love
the lower
we'll see yeah the black one that feels
so much better than the white one though
yeah like what it's really like real
leather yeah and this one doesn't feel
like it's it's like plastic well yeah
I'm I'm really surprised how good our
sponsees are getting cuz they look just
she as hell I think they must be whole
hot better than they look fun oh Jesus
it feels better than hyper glaze yes but
this day if hyper glaze looked good if
you didn't touch it this looks a little
bit bad even if you did does that make
sense yeah so so hyper blaze is it feels
slimy so if you're hain't like in the
summer if your hands are a little ball
me or anything and you pick up the
galaxy s4 it feels absolutely nasty
imagine using some hand cream with it
like that's why i don't use lotion
because i used to so many cell phones
but I'm solution because I'm a man yeah
true we're yeah all right whatever you
tell me that next year when you're in
Las Vegas if you come too much and you
will arm down my chapstick again I will
not do that that's why you guys all got
the same disease perhaps yes again
tomorrow we didn't share chapstick but
the Tony refused to use it because as
greatly should as right he shot his lips
were the color of my coat and he was
like don't make me laugh don't make me
laugh unless you wanted a bloody hands
on experience yeah um ok let's let's
slowly wrap it up before getting back to
David if you think didn't you go to get
through lunch oh yes fine yeah that's a
strong possibility yes I'm expecting the
galaxy gear to to be at mwc or if not
that mwc shortly after but with in q1 or
Cuba ginn of Q tube it has people didn't
didn't an executive go on record and say
the galaxy s5 will launched with the new
Galaxy gear I don't remember that but I
do remember them saying that they are
already working on it because yeah Alexa
gear is not ripe yet or
it's like green vegetables hurry
executive said the galaxy gear sucks
sure yeah but the vegetable thing is
that i can get quotes great so we know
pretty strongly that this galaxy gear 2
is coming we haven't heard though a lot
about what might change what sounds was
thinking of doing differently and that's
gonna have an improved camera wait was
there a placement I like that wrist
melted like a wart yeah exactly it's an
abscess it's not natural okay David any
other questions oh let it be Nexus then
we'll be away yet oh that's Stephen sir
he's excited about the nexus 10 he wrote
I don't know like I know I effort I mean
last fall I was saying Google doesn't
need a new Nexus 10 the nexus 10 still
has decent specs it's not tell her what
are you manipulating there oh very
distracting I'm just holding a speaker
it was the same here after fitting a
speaker like this one then yeah it's a
is it not is it not a good speaker oh
yeah it's pretty driver sorry room yep I
don't believe any of these renders we
saw the nexus 10 recently um no back in
the fall there was this debate is
Samsung doing this is a sous doing this
I'm leaning towards if there is going to
be what it's going to be a samsung but
there's been no strong indication that
this is coming I mean at all if even
soon it's just up in the air at this
point until we see something new I can't
make any prediction either it's going to
happen though probably by summer or I
wouldn't count on it happening until end
of the year what about the asuste nexus
8 work about the Intel David if you can
repeat that last sentence do you think
it will replace the nexus 7 you
necessary oh absolutely if whenever the
nexus 8 comes out it will be a natural
evolution of the nexus 7 2013 maybe they
might be available in parallel for for
some time but it will definitely
place it really i could see google
keeping both around we see companies
like Samsung brias 7-inch and 8.3 inch
tablets I'm gonna be a big Nexus lineup
Steven like yeah or nexus 5 nexus 7
Nexus eight Nexus 10 yeah sometimes it
feels like Google's really trying to
build up the Nexus lineup it you know it
m's and flows it feels like it's getting
big and then we don't get this new Nexus
10 like we were expecting and now we're
thinking maybe they're ruining things a
little bit what if I don't have a good
sense of how big it should be what was
that what if if they were if what if the
nexus 8 will replace the nexus 10 yeah I
could believe that but you they need
they need a nexus 5 through 10 I've said
they're getting line is they're getting
close yeah I don't know what happens in
two years to their smartphones after we
get the nexus 6 you're on this year what
are they gonna do in the fall of 2015
maybe iteration like Android 6.1 6.2
there yeah the nexus 7 becomes a foam
and yeah oh gosh I I hate like number
steamed like numbered naming schemes
like Nexus 5 like it's such a there's no
foresight to it like them bad like this
is a great name and then like next year
