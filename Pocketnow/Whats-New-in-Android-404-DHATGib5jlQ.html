go take a look at what's in Android
version 4.0.4
the latest release from Google and let's
also take a look at a happy surprise for
one particular device so Android version
4 is Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 is the
latest version and it is now available
in the Android open source project that
AOSP
which means you can get an insight
antigen in some of your other favorite
custom mods if you don't have an update
for your phone from the manufacturer so
what does it do well honestly not enough
a lot but an awful lot does that make
any sense let me show you a lot of stuff
has been reworked for example the camera
there have been some marginal
improvements there that just make things
faster a little bit quicker a little bit
well smoother like Ice Cream Sandwich is
supposed to be something else that's
happened is screen rotation so take a
look at this first time you rotate a
screen it takes a minute but then screen
rotation is pretty fast ok now one thing
to note about Android is unlike some
other operating systems screen rotation
does have a pre-programmed hesitation
built into it to make sure that you
really do want to rotate the screen and
not just you know I'm holding it at a
slight angle oh the screen rotates
I didn't mean to rotate the screen so it
tries to make sure that you're being
deliberate with your screen rotation so
you'll notice that little bit of
hesitation upfront but then the rotation
is very smooth and very fluid the next
thing that some people have complained
about is the animation and the time that
it takes to get into the multitask
feature so let's go ahead and do that
turn the phone back on here this is my
Galaxy Nexus and quick tap so really
quick it does fade in so it still has
some of that nice smoothness and
animation but the lag that was
associated with it is is seemingly gone
there's still a little bit of room for
improvement so here's the fun thing that
I wanted to show you that
is the Nexus S and if you remember
there's been some problems with the
Nexus S getting Ice Cream Sandwich it's
a Google device so you'd expect that it
would get Ice Cream Sandwich right away
and in fact it was one of the first
devices to get Ice Cream Sandwich and
then probably the first device to have
Ice Cream Sandwich polt they stopped
doing updates for it and kind of stopped
there because there was so much lag
there were so many problems that had
brought up Google thought it would just
be better to let's just turn that off
for now well now it's back with Android
version 4.0.4 but the only OTA update
for it updates people who already had
4.0.3 so if you're still way back on
Gingerbread it may be a little bit of
time before you get the 4.0.4 update or
you may have to do a manual flash a
little bit of complication there because
no one seems to have the 4.0.3 update at
least not for every phone this one in
particular so let's go ahead and take a
look and see how this does unlock the
phone there so here is the pocket now
website and we'll go ahead and rotate
that and you'll see the hesitation and
then the rotate is just very smooth very
fluid really nice let's look at the
multitask to do that you press and hold
the home button and there you go pretty
quick not too bad so there it is on the
Nexus S now there's one other device I'd
like to show it to you and well that's
the Motorola Xoom unfortunately my zoom
has not gotten the 4.0.4 update just yet
so we'll have to make do with this
overall if your phone can get 4.0.4 get
it now it's awesome
it makes things smoother a lot more
fluid these are just some of the ways
that you can show off that smoothness
that fluidity better than others a lot
of people out there are saying that this
is the way that Ice Cream Sandwich was
really meant to be experienced now there
have been some rumors that CDMA devices
are not getting 4.0.4 and there's been a
lot of people saying well that's because
Google doesn't love CDMA bla bla bla not
in fact they're going straight to four
point zero point five which includes all
of these improvements and enhancements
it just has to do things differently
because it's on a CDMA device rather
than a GSM device so really nice if you
can get it and go get it even if it's on
a custom ROM I highly recommend it if
you've got any questions or comments
please leave those down below if you
like seeing this kind of information in
video format give the video a big thumbs
up and go ahead and head on over to
pocketnow.com so you can keep up to date
on all the news tricks and tips that are
up coming out not only for Android but
for other smartphones and tablets as
well for pocket now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
