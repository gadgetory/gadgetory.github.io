press invitations for a September 9
event leaked iphone 6s camera features
point2 major improvements in video
options in samsung unwraps samsung pay
in the u.s. sort of i'm high memory that
I and after three hours of sleep or
probably for I am ready to get rid of
this day this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with Apple
after much anticipation rumors and
reports we finally get a press
invitation from Cupertino confirming a
septum burn ein event so yeah pretty
much the timeframe that we've talked
about is as is September 9 for the
announcement and then a probable
pre-order September 11th and a launch on
September 18th of the future iphones
because this is most likely the event
for iphones and apple is even hinting to
something major happening to siri by
calling it in the press invitation
saying hey Siri give us a hint so
there's a lot of speculation here let's
see what we end up getting I'll talk
about its archrival samsung as the
company has made its Samsung pay service
official to a certain degree it is
currently in beta in the United States
you can sign up for free but you
obviously know that there are
limitations for the service like the
fact that it does not work on Verizon
Galaxy devices for reasons we still
don't understand so yeah links in the
description and the source link would
lead you to where you can sign up for
this a smooth the spotlight over to
rumors we have been following the
possibility of Lumia flagships for
months I can even say a year now we've
been waiting for Microsoft to do this
for the longest time we've talked about
the talk men and City man code names for
devices but we finally get renders of
these devices and they look like Lumias
in every way box design hums and cameras
and hopefully we get that same Lumia
love that we did with the camera
technology in addition to a much better
Windows 10 but we will keep you posted
as to what we get very soon hopefully
and for those of you that were left
curious about that smaller variance of
the Moto 360 that was recently leaked
we've got some high quality photos
showing the device compared to the
current generation moto 360 so yeah
this is a smaller variant there is still
a flat tire here even though we're still
doubting if there is some added
functionality and this seemed just like
a smaller moto 360 which is a great idea
that the vice looks extremely elegant
but hopefully we could get the better
photos of the larger and newer moto 360
soon and finally for the very hot rumors
of the day Tristan sources give us more
hints on the iphone success particularly
its camera technology we've heard rumors
of a front-facing selfie flash and yeah
apparently this is leaked by the trusted
source but the question is where is it
going to be placed as we've seen the
faceplates of the iphone success and we
see no changes but in addition to that
we also get confirmation there will be
4k video support with the primary camera
and it's 12 megapixels which is great
porque video is something that should be
supported particularly with apple's
laptop lineup and even the 5k imac but
it does lead me to the question of the
day are these two features 4k video and
the selfie flash important to you
because in my case I hate flashes on
photos anyways but 4k video is something
great leave us a comment down below
which one would you consider important
or either and friends you know the drill
