complain about touch ID google nexus 5
camera fixes with android 4.4 point one
should arrive to your device today and
glue keeps trying to make you love
google+ even though you don't want to
I'm hi Mary meta and please raise your
hand who wants to make thursday as part
of the weekend this is parking out daily
let's watch the outputs of official news
as google keeps trying to make you love
google plus and i am serious they're
trying very hard this time they have
this new service that you can use for
your mobile device where you can
actually upload a photo you just took
and actually animate it as a gift or a
jiff or whatever you want to call that
expression or word or whatever it is i'm
still the problem is that obviously this
is just really a new imaging feature
where you're getting snow on your folder
or glare on your photo because of the
holiday so well that actually make you
use google plus because it won't make me
use it and speaking of google we all
know the legal debacle that they have
with oracle or they had for years
because obviously to build android
applications you need to use Java which
is built by oracle and as it turns out
it seems that even though oracle decided
to drop those charges a couple of years
ago apparently they want to pull them
back again or so reports safe obviously
we don't know how that will affect
android but it's just surprising the
google hasn't really wanted to move away
from that now let's talk about apolis
customers have begun to complain about
such ID according to a lot of complaints
customers are having trouble getting
their fingerprint read after a couple of
months of usage and in my particular
case even though i haven't really had
problems with touch ID yet constantly i
do have the problem that after a couple
of unlocks the phone will actually
obligate you to add your password even
though you enable touch ID so it's kind
of weird we're expecting for a software
update to fix this but i don't know what
to expect from Apple now now let's talk
about AT&amp;amp;T as the company has made some
substantial changes to their contract
policies that are actually good for you
first of all links in the description
for the full list of benefits that you
get but probably one of the most
important is that if your phone ends its
contract subsidy or if you bring your
unlocked phone into a plan with AT&amp;amp;T
they'll give you fifteen dollars back
for that and that's pretty much a $300
saving after a couple of months so make
sure
you again follow the procedure in the
description because they're not going to
call you they're not going to do it for
you you have to actually call them to
get it done which is so 80 and finally
for the hot news of the day those of you
that have been waiting for android 4.4
point 1 on your Nexus spy well
apparently the update will reach your
phone today and the enhancements are
kind of significant first of all because
we've seen some comparison photos with
better color saturation on the Nexus 5's
photos after this update aside from the
fact that you now get a persistent menu
for HDR and the fact that obviously
it'll be a faster loading application
and we'll take photos faster but that
leads you to the question of the day has
the terrible camera performance of the
Nexus 5 kept you from buying the phone
because in my particular case it has
aside from the fact that I haven't been
able to actually buy it because I
haven't been able to find it but leave
us a comment down below has it kept you
away from the phone and friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video with spill
make sure you follow us on parking
outcome and start our youtube channel as
well you'll also follow me on twitter
Jaime underscore d theta please give
this video thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I am high never better thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
