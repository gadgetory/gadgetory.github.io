the note can 9p review even its price
tag numbers are out and it looks like
the battery replacement program of Apple
did hurt its sales last year
it looks like Cupertino is actually
working on another ipod touch now with
the USBC I'm Jaime Rivera and I
apologize for the gloom and the audio
issues I actually figured out what the
problem was this is rocking out daily
sponsored by swapper the official news
today begin with the complete opposite
to what a deal is as Netflix has pretty
much just made it official if prices are
going up by around two dollars depending
on whatever plan you have and the reason
why is because the company wants to get
out of debt and they want to compete
with other services I love this
corporate jargon where they tell you why
something's gonna get more expensive and
it only makes sense to them don't you
think now let's talk about Opel as a the
company is sending out invitations for
an event to happen tomorrow and the
slogan of the invite is tend to see if
you remember we covered this sort of a
periscopic 'l zoom lens camera that the
company had shown off about what two
years ago but that was all a concept we
never saw final products so maybe we're
finally getting that now let's talk
about Apple as a there are reports that
the company is working on a new iPod
touch believe it or not I didn't know
that these products are still being sold
there's an iPod touch and apparently
there's also works on an iPhone that
will support USB see I'm not saying that
lightning is going away but the move
from iPads makes all the sense in the
world I just don't know why there's
still a market for iPods let's keep the
topic on Apple as we now have
information on how many battery
replacements the company did for 30
bucks it totaled 11 million and the sure
the company wasn't doing it for free
that we're doing it for 30 bucks but in
the same period of time that the company
usually does one to two million battery
replacements 11 million means 11 million
iPhones that weren't sold and according
to the metrics this actually spiked at
the time when Apple was launching new
iPhones which means people were like you
know what why am I
to buy a new iphone this is know what
you think about how this affected the
company sales because the company is
blaming the replacements on their drop
and finally the hot news they have to do
with the Nokia 9 PureView s trusted
sources claimed that there will be a
launch prior to MW so you don't have any
dates or invites but what we do here is
specifications like the five point nine
inch display all the cameras that we've
talked about a forty one fifty milliamp
hour battery a price tag between eight
hundred and fifty and nine hundred
dollars probably the most interesting
part is that it'll launch with a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 for this variant
and if you want to get better photos and
a Snapdragon 855 you will have to wait
for the 5g variants later this year so
let us know in the comments down below I
mean if you know that there will be a
better variant later would you be
willing to buy this one now in my case
it would have to have something really
awesome for me to be willing to buy it
now but leave us a comment down below we
looked into your opinion and folks
