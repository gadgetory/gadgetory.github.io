no pandemonium this time Apple working
on an iPhone nano or many if they can
ever figure that one out an AT&amp;amp;T is
offering tons of three minutes to iPhone
users all this and more coming up right
now hello everybody I'm Hyneman iveta
and welcome to the pocket now I review
the show we go through all this week
school and they're not so cool inside
the world of Apple's iOS devices let's
start this week off with the cool we're
going to leave this one in the cool
section because it finally happened but
apple and verizon finally launched their
iphone 4 to the masses but wait no
masses ever got there the lines barely
got to 20 people in Apple even had
barricades outside flagship Apple stores
waiting for pandemonium to be out there
now what happened well could it be the
rough temperatures it could be that the
pre-order strategy worked this time man
well Apple had a more ordered way to
sell their device whether you like it or
not having mass pandemonium of people
outside your stores is really not a
successful way to sell the device it's
terrible customer service but our
biggest bet is that Verizon customers
really didn't go crazy over the device
because while the iPhone 5 is right
around the corner what I really don't
know that all Verizon customers know is
that well Apple has a yearly cycle so
most probably well we're going to have
in June as the refresh for the AT&amp;amp;T gsm
iphone 4 and not really the verizon
iphone 4 so we'll see what happens well
rumors have apple hiring iOS developer a
premix to work on revamping their
notification system you know those
really intrusive blue screens that
always pop up when you least want them
to and that many of us end up disabling
because they're just ugly well it seems
that Apple is hiring this guy but we
don't understand this why hire somebody
else to do it when they've sort of
already hired the webos guru that really
made things work for palm to do the same
thing on iOS really don't know what's
going on but at least hey it's something
really cool we are expecting this to be
part of iOS 5 somewhere sometime this
year other rumors have apple working on
an iPhone nano many or whatever you want
to call it to compete with the
two-hundred-dollar and be
low price point with android nokia and
other manufacturers now we don't really
see Apple trying to compete with a
cheaper level device we do see apples
employees bored of using the same device
for the past four years you know they
always say that they always build
devices that they would like to use so I
do see them being bored after four years
of holding the same iphone you I and the
Vice and look so good to see some
variety guys and well out with the
verizon iphone 4s ios four point two
point six which is exclusively for the
verizon iphone to bring a couple of buck
fixes now aside from all the official
stuff let's focus on the fact that green
poison has already released an update
that will allow you to jailbreak the
verizon iphone 4 and even this update so
yeah cydia buddies is out there and well
as competition gets fierce AT&amp;amp;T is
giving verizon a run for their money why
well if you're a happy AT&amp;amp;T iphone
customer you most probably already got
that text message that tells you get a
thousand free rollover minutes just
because you're an AT&amp;amp;T customer and
you're staying now our advice to you is
if you want to switch well take upon
those 1000 minutes and then switch or
stay it's really up to you but then
again really good competition strategies
let's hope verizon comes up with
something similar and gives us more free
minutes or more unlimited data plans on
AT&amp;amp;T for everybody
and while that doesn't for the cool
let's continue on with the not so cool
as you guessed that the cats that I fix
it already got their paws on the verizon
iphone 4 torn apart and aside from
finding terrible screws and some lighter
hardware one of the interesting notes is
that they found that the device has
support for both gsm and cdma networks
now the question is Apple if you release
a device in the past that already has
that SIM card slot and now you choose to
release the verizon iphone 4 would
support for gsm why don't you release a
world phone you know a verizon cdma
device that can also roam in gsm
countries really don't know what you're
doing Apple but this is the real reason
why people hate it your verizon iphone 4
release people are waiting for the
verizon iphone 5 or 4s or whatever just
because of the fact that the currency am
a device doesn't support world roaming
really bad strategy guys well I don't
speak German so bear with me here the
Fran hofer Institute famous for bringing
you mp3 technology just figured out how
to crack the iOS password systems in
under six minutes now don't be scared
this doesn't actually work over the
network you actually have to have the
device connected to the software to be
able to crack the iOS password so unless
you give somebody the device or they
share the software you're pretty much in
good hands still now call this a very
cool service for your mom when she
forgets her password aside from that
well you know it's something that's out
there they already figured out a crack
it so not really cool to see that they
could cracked other things eventually
and well Consumer Reports has added
again this time on TV I call these guys
and ironic team because if you remember
for the release of the AT&amp;amp;T iphone 4
they first said it was the best
smartphone of the year and then
eventually they came up with a duct tape
video telling you the antenna gate
issues were bad now they come up on TV
and tell everybody that the verizon
iphone 4 is a good device but they
didn't have a device yet to test now you
have people outside telling everybody
that they're already having antenna
issues we ruin
confirm this yet but again consumer
reports wait till you have a device
bring it up to your labs make a video
showing us that the device is good and
then come on TV and say hey it's a good
device again anyways that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
