Galaxy s8 from adopting viv Amazon Prime
video goes global and fights hard with
an aggressive price tag and instagram
has finally decided to play nice with
those of us that want to remember posts
I'm Jaime Rivera and there is barking
involved in this video it's the
beautiful basset hound that wants to go
for a walk which I'll do after the video
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with product launches I
am a big fan of Instagram but I don't
like that new algorithm that Facebook
implemented if you want to look for
photos that you already saw it's kind of
hard to find them eventually but there's
this new feature called bookmarks and
all you have to do is simply select that
for every photo that you end up liking
and it creates a separate feed for you
in your profile area something that
Instagram should have probably done from
day one but let's just bring the old
algorithm back as well other official
news have to do with product launches as
Amazon goes directly to compete against
Netflix now big time with prime video
now going global for three dollars a
month for the first six months and
afterwards it goes for six dollars the
whole idea is to compete net with
Netflix in a large-scale Netflix
currently charges between six and eight
dollars depending on which country
you're at right now Amazon Prime video
supports 200 countries bringing their
exclusive content in addition to
whatever videos and movies they have
available and yeah three bucks and you
can cancel anytime I think it's a good
deal you should probably consider giving
a try another company that seriously
wants you to switch from iOS to Android
as Google and as we saw Apple launching
its first Android application to help
Android switchers back to the iPhone
this one is pretty much another way to
do it backwards android.com slash switch
and the options that you get here are
different ways for you to backup stuff
on your iPhone to be able to switch to
Android Google photos for photos Google
Drive for everything else you also get
50,000 songs available for you if you
switch from iTunes to Google music
though you'll have to add your credit
card to that regardless it's a way to
make it easy and I think you should
definitely consider it as well as well
the spotlight over to the Samsung Galaxy
s7 we are still waiting for the features
that we loved on the note 7 to reach the
s7 rumors have it that we will get
nougat probably the biggest one is
secure folder yes people love the s-pen
on the note for me it was really secure
folder the fact that you could have two
separate Facebook's with two different
accounts the fact you could have two
separate whatsapp's etc it just makes
everything more convenient particularly
if you want to keep company account
secure so apparently that is coming we
just think it's gonna happen after the
s8 and finally the very hotness they
actually have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy s8 mainly because we hear that
that whole deal that Google and Samsung
made back in 2014 in order for Samsung
to not fork Android so much well
apparently that's going to vac fire
against viv we hear that the Samsung
Galaxy s8 is going to launch with nougat
Android 7.1.1 meaning the assistant
could be in tow but apparently Google
doesn't want Samsung to implement viv
and this is making us rather skeptical
because merrily viv is actually very
cool there's only one way to find out
but apparently we won't let's just wait
to see what happens but it leads me to
the question of the day if you had to
choose would you rather try Samsung's
vivir will you prefer more holistic
Google assistant in my case I prefer for
us to just stick to one Google assistant
and that'd be it but leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
