people interested in buying one we get
launched details for the samsung galaxy
s6 and if you're interested in HTC One
m9 you better buy a pair of gloves along
with it I'm hi Mary vera and no I'm
usually not this ugly but jet lag does
some crazy things to you this is parking
out daily brought to you by Squarespace
and its new seven-point oh you I let's
begin today with what's official as
Microsoft has just made their office
2016 and striper business preview
official to everyone make sure the
description for full details and how you
can apply and download it for yourself
there are some new changes a lot of
visually appealing updates for office
particularly though a lot of things are
still not ready remember this is just
the preview the final product is not out
yet but it should be out sometime later
this year now in other official news
that aren't so positive let's talk about
the HTC One m9 as the company has pulled
back from launching it at its homeland
in Taiwan because apparently there are
some software issues and they're waiting
for a patch in the next couple of days
weeks for the 64 gig variant and even
more interesting would give reports that
there are some heat tests on the 109
already and we're talking about 131
degrees fahrenheit in the heat so yeah
there are a lot of things to be ironed
here wait for our full review and we'll
keep you posted on that one now another
highly anticipated product for 2015 is
the samsung galaxy s6 and galaxy s6 edge
and even though we know exactly when it
launched globally except the United
States which is April 10th but if you're
wondering what ever launched in the US
apparently it'll launch on april
eleventh just one day later and even
though we're not sure what carriers are
going to be launching the product here
we assume that everyone will as that's
the way samsung likes to do things will
keep you posted on that one and remember
the rumors of samson working on its own
circular SmartWatch because um yeah i
got bored of the gear live hello moto
360 it seems that the company is getting
ready to launch his product sometime
later this year and the most interesting
part of this league is that apparently
it'll be running some sort of variants
if not the same processor that we
already see
on the Galaxy s6 and galaxy s6 edge and
wow that is something crazy we know that
this new processor is extremely power
efficient but we don't know how well
it'll handle such a small battery though
obviously the display is much smaller so
there probably isn't as much compromise
as we think and probably this processor
is as great as Samsung touts it to be we
will keep you posted as we learn more
and finally for the very hot news of the
day if you are skeptical about buying
the Apple watch just like I am it seems
that we are very few as there's this
very interesting survey conducted by
Reuters in addition to another company
and they sampled 1,200 people and
there's 1,200 people apparently there is
an error margin of three-point-two
percent plus/minus but they are
surveying these people considering the
whole US population and according to
them fifty percent of these people knew
what the Apple watch was and twenty-five
percent of these people said they were
willing to buy it forty-six percent
consider that was cool but yeah going
back to that twenty-five percent we're
talking about 16 million people in the
United States alone that is a crazy
amount of people and some of these
people even claimed that even though
they don't own an iPhone hence the
parently not all of these people
surveyed were fanboys it seems that they
were willing to buy an iPhone just to
get the Apple watch as well and it leads
me to the question of the day after
everything you've seen with the Apple
watch of are you buying one in my case
there's a reason why i just bought the
Moto 360 I am skeptical but then again I
