build a wall to block YouTube will
Twitter double your tweet size and why
did Bill Gates switch to an Android plus
we've got a terrific guest lined up
Thomas visito joins the show this week
to share his thoughts on Apple's iPhone
8 and 8 plus we've got a lot to talk
about so make sure you're charged and
ready for episode 272 of the pocket now
weekly recorded September 28th at noon
pacific this weekly podcast is where we
dissect and discuss those gadgets and
make our lives mobile smartphones
tablets and wearables it's all the stuff
you wished existed when you were a kid
and naming technology products was even
more screwed up than it is today
I'm hon Carlos back now senior editor at
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. Jules Wong out on
the East Coast how's it going buddy boy
so I didn't know that ZTE could spell
multi with the Y things that we saw
earlier this month you know like we just
recently published our iPhone a camera
review and a lot of people are really
flipping out about the name this is
really just an iPhone 7s like well yeah
that doesn't really change anything you
know it's like going from a note 5 to a
note 7 it's like going from windows 8 to
Windows 10 I just like it doesn't really
mean anything these days you kind of
just have to get on with your life that
you know the the iPhone number letter
combination isn't sacrosanct it's not
you know carved in stone tablets I mean
I'm kind of pissed off that 9 might or
might not get the shaft here but I mean
maybe it's gonna turn up and I can't see
us now and I'll be really excited we're
gonna be bringing dom on a little bit
later in the show and that's actually
one of the things i want to ask him is
like where do we go from here you know
an iphone 9 is gonna feel like a
consolation prize but it'll end up
having probably better hardware than the
iPhone I mean like where Apple needs to
lead the industry like it kind of hurts
my brain when we do talk about the
naming common clay Chur we hear a lot of
fill us
philosophy philosophical points that we
have to get to and we also want to hear
our philosophy that's exactly where I
wanted to go next to your Romani your
your music your comments because as
we're taping this live that whenever
we're taping this is you can actually
react respond and ask us questions using
Twitter and that PN weekly hash tag and
that's well you'll see other people ask
questions and we'll be responding as we
can over the course of the next 60
minutes or so and if you can't make it
then obviously you have the emails that
you can do podcast at pocketnow.com is
where you should send those along to so
hashtag be and weekly pocket pocket now
podcast at pocketnow.com is there are
all places that you can reach us reach
out and touch faith yeah that's totally
a saying that people use your own
personal pocket come from a land in your
pocket no that's that doesn't that
doesn't work I can't I can't
I'm not stronger be good like switch up
a song lyrics in the moment kind of a
thing so I unfortunately can't yes and
you right there but what we can do is
jump into some really fun tech topics we
had some some of the hot new headlines
on pocketnow.com some of the top stories
of the week and I think they're they
make for some interesting discussion on
just sort of the nature of where
industry and services are going right
now they're just burning hot so for the
week of September 24th this is all the
news that is fit to podcast and we begin
with Amazon and YouTube at it again
we're fighting each other they've been
holding hands in terms of being able to
supply media to us with chromecast's and
echoes but now there's a little shift
because with the echo show the first
Alexis speaker with a screen artist from
Amazon
whole out of it Google decide to pull
that away apparently and that's
according to Amazon at least and they
haven't been told why Google did say
that there was a Terms of Use violation
but and there was some sort of broken
hue high elements that was not really
optimal for them but there hasn't been
really any clarification on that so we
hope to see that cleared up by the way
you can't find a chromecast on Amazon
still that's still an issue that has
been long been running we also have
Twitter edit button so um it's a good
luck to you if you try to write
something very very long and end up
immersing yourself in the first place
but at least you can write more than you
have starting soon two hundred eighty
characters is double the current 140
limits that we have right now and we
shall see that swelling am a CEO Jack
Dorsey and also a co-founder Biz Stone
provided first a couple of ceremonial
tweets so um people there have been hot
takes all across the internet about
different character lengths and not
being able to finish tweets which is
interesting I think I think I think we
should just limit it to 45 interesting
is a good word I actually will talk
about that just when we're through the
news block because I've got some time
yeah so Bill Gates is using Android
these days the former Microsoft CEO says
that he actually has you know well part
of it is what we'll get into with this
topic and that is current CEO Satya
Nadella 'he's new book hit refresh and
it goes into his what nearly three
decades at Microsoft's talking about how
empathy and culture really changed like
it was hard for you not trained like
some snarkiness on empathy from
Microsoft
you know credit to you know where
credit's do because you know it's
actually a good read that I suggest that
you all should take a look at at the
very least but some interesting excerpts
from it goes through the time when they
kind of dropped the ball on mobile and
with that Nokia thing that Nokia
acquisition that turned into a write-off
Nadella was never really for it in the
first place and when the transition from
Steve Ballmer to Nadella took place
after that deal went down
I mean it's we didn't see them do
anything that is meaningfully like
excellent they had flag ships were being
dropped left and right and there was all
this some you know just mid-range
riddling served the base market the
low-end market and I I mean the fans
were disappointed I think Oh would it be
weird for me to say that a fanbase drove
that kind of market you know those of
that no I don't think I don't think it's
crude at all because I think so many
companies initially get their kick off
or get their start by trying to court
some type of user base that will be
advocates for that platform and I I
think a terrific example of that is a
company like oneplus you know they built
so much of their brand credibility on a
marketing message which appealed to a
very specific demographic and now
they're trying to pivot and they're
trying to grow and become more of a
mainstream or a broader product it's
it's interesting hearing I'm you know
getting that kind of insight or that
confirmation from from Nadella that he
wasn't on board because what we saw were
actions from Microsoft that didn't
really seem to be promoting or or
aggressively building in the mobile
space I think if if we could learn
anything from the launch of the iPhone
is that you can be late to the game if
you bring something of substance and ten
Adela's point he didn't feel like
Microsoft was really rewriting the rules
on mobile I can't remember exactly what
his quote is but it's something along
those lines but it also didn't seem like
they were really investing the resources
to rewrite the rules on mobile so it was
it was kind of a doomed position he
walked into a situation that he
obviously didn't support and then once
you know that that acquisition was
finalized Hebe still wasn't really
supporting that move
we know that Nadella is really a
services and server guy and that's where
I mean to Microsoft credit we've seen
some terrific improvements to services
like office and onedrive making them far
more accessible a lot more classic
cross-platform you know it's it's not
you know a terrible situation when I'm
on a Chromebook or an iPad or an Android
tablet or you know a desktop and I can
kind of get all of the same writing and
spreadsheets and presentations work done
it doesn't really matter what I'm on I I
wrote I wrote this really in-depth
letter to a senator the other day and my
wife took a look at it on onedrive we
were editing editing it together and
then I finished it on a phone that used
to be something that I would only rely
on on Google Docs for and now office is
finally like caught up in a really
meaningful way so when when we're
looking at Windows Phone it's really a
shame because they took some of the most
talented Hardware designers and
engineers in the world the old Nokia
team they took a ton of goodwill and
they built up rapidly a user base that
was actually pretty formidable as a
distant third place competitor and then
just kind of threw it all away and I
think that I'm sort of like just lifting
a rock and then putting it on your feet
there was no there's no purpose to it
but I do think well let me move it and
let me move it by crushing my ankle
exactly but you know I think you know
Nadella was a software servers guy I
mean Microsoft was a software and
service company you know didn't really
start you know you really give an eye
towards hardware and tell the surface
initiative which what you know they've
been barely kind of juggling together
they had the whole you know he was still
trying to figure out Artie and all that
it's one of the interesting things about
Microsoft is that we do kind of forget
that this company actually doesn't suck
a
where we've got multiple generations of
the Xbox
we've got living room computing that was
way ahead of its time I mean you think
about all of the security doom and gloom
Microsoft spying on you with the Kinect
and now we're all rushing to throw
Amazon and Google and Apple talking
listening always on microphones into our
living room that's always that mobile
computing component that they all seem
to get right yeah absolutely and and
that to me I think is one of the most
upsetting because Windows 8 especially
Windows 8.1 once we started getting some
of the the Nokia firmwares like denim
for Windows 8 Windows Windows Phone 8.1
they were so they were so close they
were so close I think to something
really truly disruptive and then they
kind of backed off and walked away and I
think all of our listeners and
subscribers kind of remember just how
crestfallen a lot of his were I was I
was I was in I was sold I was ready to
be a Windows Phone kid and they just
couldn't make that final push into again
pivoting into a more mass-market
direction um that that actually kind of
like just that little bit of speculation
that I want to throw out there I think
it is kind of interesting that Bill
Gates made a point out of saying that he
was using an Android phone that's like
the final nail in the coffin for any
kind of discrete mobile solution for
Microsoft in the foreseeable futures
when you've got the most recognizable
Microsoft name publicly talking about
using a competitor's product I mean I
mean it's a shame but where else does
the actual company lead them to we
haven't knew they had they just suddenly
shifted everything from this the main
trunk development to a side branch
that's gonna get an end-of-life and it
might be liking on something but we've
there's always been the you know that's
something in the background but don't
you think it's interesting Jules that he
made such a point out of saying Android
and that he was not using an iPhone
because right now I think Google is the
bigger threat to Microsoft than Apple is
like increasingly Apple and Microsoft
the overlap on potential consumers I
think is getting smaller and smaller but
Google is taking this big move
words software and services again kind
of like Microsoft's bread and butter you
know I like I said I tend to prefer
working in word but you know Google Docs
could easily replace what I'm doing if I
wanted it to and I wouldn't have to pay
for my yearly Office subscription it's a
boot you know so those kinds of things
that I thought it was really interesting
that I I think the more dangerous
competitor for Microsoft is the one that
he talked about for picking up a new
phone I mean I think he's pretty savvy
enough to know that they are both sides
to you the whole open-source thing which
she's always been a fan of that's you
know being part of you know it's not
just Google it's the individual OMS that
play a part in making that ecosystem
happen so in terms of doing more or less
damage to Microsoft if he's still if he
you know he's always got that in the
back of his mind
I think Android would have been the
optimal solution now we don't know which
device exactly he chose go wild on the
spot you're Bill Gates
you're probably like one of the if not
the richest man on the planet you are
using which Android phone go sleep I
would say a moto a moto XIV interesting
no X I would say an X a little more
style but it's not current I know that
but if I were just to be just Bill Gates
and not with all this withstanding just
about it works I think it's just so I I
think if he doesn't have a custom-built
phone made out of unobtainium
I'm gonna go see I think a galaxy is
just too obvious I think you're right
he'd probably want something business
grade he probably wouldn't excuse me he
probably wouldn't opt for the BlackBerry
uh you know I'm torn I want to say he'd
probably go with something like a note
because it's got the stylus really yeah
he's he does have a lot of foundational
work with a malenda his wife and
but I don't know because he has pure
hope I can do like all of the the the
piddly you know secretarial work for him
maybe instead maybe he's just done
something totally goofy like he's got an
honor 6x and that's huh he checked his
email and and open up Word documents or
something like that
mmm interesting well I think I can agree
with that's but personally I think he's
just more of a rich he's always had that
rebel boy I didn't him and he wants to
express himself a certain way so I mean
maker I don't know what currently he
would choose though I don't know I'm
really torn because like you know III
think it would be something sensible and
practical I don't think it would be
something outlandish I would love to see
Bill Gates roll up in like an old virtu
just because it's covered in fires or
something using the P n weekly hashtag
from Peter hatin does using an Android
suggests Microsoft has a clear vision to
where they want to go providing stronger
software cross-platform I think that's a
that's a pretty clear indication of what
Microsoft is focused on what do you
think Jules I the question because I'm
trying to talk with padam BTS that's
probably smart thinkin it hello hangouts
but yeah what was the question
eldress is having using an Android
suggests Microsoft has a clear vision of
where they want to go providing stronger
software cross-platform I they've always
done that with office and making sure
that they're you know or Skype or
whatever their services aren't that in
the past couple of years they've had it
on Android first not necessarily iOS I
feel I feel like you know it's always
been that much of a of a lean towards
that market advantage but um internals
of just it's just not yeah I don't think
Bill Gates is like totally
representative of the moving and
breathing well but organism that is
Microsoft I think what is what is kind
of interesting is the notion like I
really think he would be on something
maybe not custom hardware but like
working with Microsoft engineers on what
can we do to Android to make it a
Microsoft platform you could replace
Gmail without look you could replace
Google assistant with Cortana in a way
that's reminiscent of using Amazon Alexa
or Bixby on a phone you know because
instead of Google Docs I mean I think
that there is the potential to say you
know platform doesn't matter what
matters is do we have your services do
we have your eyeballs do we have your
data whatever glowing rectangle you want
to use them from that's fine but we want
you on a Microsoft launcher with
Microsoft document support with
Microsoft video calling through Skype
you know all of those things I think
could go hand-in-hand I mean in a really
well polished package I mean is about
what they were trying to do with
CyanogenMod I mean yeah but I'm just
where there would be it'd have to be a
commercial pursuit and that would mean
more you know we'd have to include Bing
and that would take the Google that
everyone loves Android the equation my
admission to design is I actually do use
Bing because I like getting gift
certificates to Amazon still bribing you
so I mean like it's hilarious that I
would say probably three out of ten I
have to go to Google after the primary
search results on being because like
beans not getting my boolean as well I
mean hey yeah but the third of the
market share just this month I racked up
like another $5 credit to Amazon if
Microsoft wants to bribe me to keep
their search up I'm fine with that all
all hoping it's fine all right fine I
mean DuckDuckGo
have you been using that duck out I have
not actually I have no I I don't care
for anyone tracking is like yeah I I
live in this world you can probably
track me down if you wanted to he worked
hard enough at it
your motivation yeah but that's true and
it's not like you know you don't see
kind of you know information that you
could use if you were so inclined on
that on that point I want to spend just
a couple minutes here before we we have
to leave the news block Twitter doubling
the character count does this change
anything I don't understand a Twitter
that's trying to become more of an
in-the-moment microblogging service as
opposed to what they do really well
which is a streamline I sort of up to
the second so they do that not the user
base like is that that's that that's the
thing right well you know anything to do
concerns and saying like okay I mean
yeah you wanted to put more information
into one tweet we can increase the
character count but that's sort of I
feel like that's a never-ending problem
you know you know it becomes something
of like a Google+ kind of a situation do
I really want instant and disposable
content creation that's then gonna allow
me to write multiple paragraphs you know
like that doesn't really provide me any
benefit over like a Facebook well if
we're talking about revenue generation
for Twitter because they're all about
the revenue generation at Twitter you
have more cart than the squeeze without
having to be repetitive or you know
having to extend you know little
tendrils of of threads going on there so
you know making most of that whatever if
it's just an extra point two seconds of
interaction that you know you have to
scroll through on your feed it is you
know they kind of cop out and put out a
little ellipses you know it gets
truncated it's like that's okay what's
the point then well Twitter I mean the
they're looking for that much of an
extra squeeze where they can and I mean
if it's nice I get the hit the feeling
that the edit button I think has been
maligned rightly mind that the
decision to not do so but I still I
still don't I would say save the edit
button well it's a matter of do we want
do we want Twitter to stand as a
platform of public record
ie I am very much a guy doesn't want it
to well that's that's it is I'm very
much against Twitter introducing tools
to change history or change discourse
for that reason the Twitter has become
even even though it's not a profitable
venture for for Twitter and Twitter
shareholders Twitter has kind of become
something that we rely on as public
record and I think that's dangerous to
allow people to change even if there's
an asterisk oh this tweet was edited you
don't necessarily know to what degree or
how or you can't easily always backtrack
or find like if someone didn't archive
the original then you have no
information as to what what transpired
and and we're moving into a future where
that kind of public record is going to
become increasingly fluid so I
understand why people want an edit
button button and it's always
embarrassing I do this on the regular
where I tweet something and go oh oh
that's not really what I meant like
scramble and delete the tweet or just
let it stand and sort of own my shame if
I don't catch it right away but that
that's to me one of the things that I
hope they hold off on for a while but
that still doesn't change to this notion
though that do I really need or do I
really want more information per tweet
when the the joy of a service like
Twitter is that I don't really get
bogged down into it like I do with
Facebook or even with like YouTube
comments I mean I spent they had a chart
that you know had a distribution of how
many tweets were there they had this
many character is a lot more English
tweets because of the syntax that we
have to deal with if the character is
it's you know they come close to that
140 line whereas Japanese or Chinese or
whatever you know because of the
symbolism and there
characters they drop down to more like
1520 ish that's true well and that's me
and that's only until we finally come
full circle and only communicate through
emoji as a return to hieroglyphics and
then a good idea we could kick it down
in 25 characters that'd be yeah if you
can't get your point across in 25 emojis
then you're not internetting right right
indeed and I'm gonna have to call an
audible on that one there literally
because before we bring on our amazing
awesome guest Dom to talk about the
iPhone we probably should take just a
quick minute to talk about our sponsor

problem and I've been bouncing back and
forth this is actually really helped me
kind of keep on top of a really in-depth
really cerebral science fiction novel
and I can jump into the audiobook when
I'm in the car I kind of have to
page through my paper book when I get
back home to kind of catch up to where I
left off and that's all because of
audible get a free audiobook with a
30-day trial at www.sceeto.com and we
thank them for supporting the pocket net
weekly and I see we've got a super cool
dude in a super cool hat in a super cool
location with some super cool headphones
I don't know I can't see over my camera
here Dom is your mic still muted you now
I'm with you all right excellent man
thank you so much for joining us this
week we caught when have you got your
videos on the iPhone I was like I got it
we got to have them on the show this is
exactly what we need to talk everybody
think gonna think I'm the bad guy or
something well no I think that's one of
the things that's been interesting for
Apple or I mean there's a lot of talk
about business about strategy about
philosophy Apple is a very philosophical
company and this launched this year the
10th anniversary of the iPhone just
brings up a ton of questions as to what
should we expect from a premium premier
manufacturer where does this company go
from here so I mean I want to kick
things off just to start like what do
you think of the phones you know I think
you've made your thoughts kind of clear
in your videos but just as a nice like
TLDR okay so well let's let's let's put
this out there first so that I don't get
too much hate my channel my youtube
channel started because of Apple
products like I I started I only covered
Apple products like that was the only
thing I ever covered originally where
Apple products or accessories or
whatever related Apple products so I'm
you know I'm a hardcore fan like for
sure but I came in late I came in late
in the game I think my my first iPhone
was the 4s I was actually an Android
user before it's weird I know it's weird
I I was using Android and then I I
started YouTube and stuff and I got a 4s
and then I you
kept doing that and then I diversified
into Android again so I'm a huge Apple
fan like that's it's just in in the
nature of my my business and YouTube and
whatever and this like I've always been
like super excited about iPhones and
this was the first year that I just I
just wasn't I'm not very excited you
know and and that's not a bad thing okay
so like it's not like a like get out the
pitchforks and start you know burning
things kind of way it's just like that
there's only a certain level of
innovation that you can do nowadays
we've reached a pinnacle of smartphone
technology like quite literally now
personally in my opinion the iPhone 8 an
A+ were a total waste of time they just
they just should have done an act a 10
and a 10 plus like realistically or call
that the 8 and 8 plus you know I mean
then just enjoy on that and and that
that would have been for I think for a
lot of people more more exciting just a
lot of general consumers that I've
spoken with don't understand the 8 vs 10
launch strategy like they just don't get
it they're confused by it like normal
people you know like right I'm just I'm
just not excited I don't know like I
mean I I have them obviously like I have
the phones and you know and I'm using
I'm using the iPhone 8 I've never been a
fan of the of the plus size even though
I'm missing out on the port remote
that's never been a big deal to me but I
just feel like I'm you know once I got
my backup restore I just feel like I'm
holding an iPhone 7 yeah just right and
willing but well it's it's like you've
got to play the Seinfeld game every time
you talk about it's like not that
there's anything wrong with that but I
yeah an interesting things has just been
the psychology of people who are getting
upset about the name that it's called
the iPhone 8 and I can't tell you the
number of angry comments we've had in
our videos like like people legitimately
getting fired up that it should be
called the iPhone 7s that's what it
really is and would that have made any
difference in the perception
this product do you think I so the thing
is I think that I think the perception
has a lot to do with all the leaks and
rumors that came out before now which
were all about the ten essentially like
everything we've seen up to you know for
the most part the bulk of the rumors
were about like the full display you
know like there were weird ones with the
fingerprint sensor on the back then
there are weird ones with it being in
under the display which is possible
because of that call that with the
Qualcomm tech right yeah welcome to be
yeah yeah yeah with vivo I believe they
had some some phones that they were
demoing at an event in New York at one
point but so there were all these rumors
and there are all these facts that lined
up with the rumors and and then we saw
at the last minute I mean relatively
speaking at the last minute we saw leaks
of what was the eight and eight plus or
whatever and so up to that point though
everybody was hyped about the ten and
everybody up up to that point before we
saw the eight and eight plus everybody
was thinking that the ten was going to
be called the e right that was like how
the rumors went and so I think when it
was revealed that oh you're getting the
eight here you go but then you know it's
that but again but the but the ten is
coming out in a month so it's just I
think that would have made a difference
if they had la launched directly with
the ten maybe if they called it the 7s I
guess I mean I don't I don't know what
they're doing anymore I a usually have
such a solid roadmap you know it's tough
to explain and it's also one of the
first times that we've ever seen Apple
because I don't want it I don't want to
use a word like fragmentation but it's
one of the only times we I've ever seen
Apple have such a diverse spread of
products under one label like you've got
MacBook MacBook Pro used to have iPhone
and then used to have iPhone Plus last
year's iPhone and then you had iPhone
and iPhone plus and now you've got
iPhone and iPhone plus for the 8 the 7
the 6s you have the iPhone se and then
you're gonna have the iPhone 10 and I
don't
that's just so uncharacteristic of this
company my backgrounds a little
like yours I used to be an animal
product specialist for a Department of
Energy facility and I came into iPhone
really late I came in on the three s at
the same time as I started playing with
some Android handsets and I kind of just
dismayed my decision that I was gonna I
was gonna veer over into Android for
most of my daily drivers but one of the
things that I could always count on was
a simplicity of consumer dialogue Apple
used to just get to the point in a way
that was really easy to understand and
they were really good at driving the
market this is what you want yeah this
is what you want and now it's like oh
well you want a big phone we've got that
you want a little phone we've got that
do you want an all screen phone we've
got that do you want a tiny little phone
we've got the SE it feels a little like
an iPhone flea market right now yeah not
like really I think this is a weird
transitional year for them and to be
honest I guess it's kind of a necessary
thing if they want to I guess I don't
want to say catch up with the times
because they're really advanced as far
as like internal technology goes but
like smartphone design has evolved past
what Apple's doing obviously like
there's no you know there's no there's
no denying that does smart phone design
and and everything has evolved past them
their internals kill it like a crush
every single phone on the market with
with their processor set up and stuff
which is amazing like like this is
faster than a MacBook you could buy like
three four years ago I mean I know like
we're not really supposed to put too
much stock in benchmarks but when
they're pulling numbers that are
reminiscent of core i5s yeah like I mean
doing something right here let's just
put it this way then if you don't want
to put put any any like any faith or
trust in benchmarks this can edit 4k 60
video a MacBook for five years ago
couldn't can't right exactly
you don't need benchmarks the proof is
in inside of the phone and like I said I
just think that it's a weird
transitional year for them I wonder if
part of it was just like maybe a
corporate fear obviously a majority of
their money is coming from iOS like
Apple is really you know making their
nut on iOS yeah other product lines do
you I wonder if maybe the fear was they
couldn't survive
a thousand dollar iPhone 10 and last
year's iPhone seven that it was just too
big a leap to not have something in
between those two even if it did mean
really kind of fracturing their user
base to a degree yeah I mean that's got
to be concerned numbers and investors
are always like they're like primary
like concerns basically I mean they
start every keynote with numbers pretty
much so yeah that's always a big
earnings always a big thing for them the
interesting part is though that and this
is kind of semi unrelated is that I
believe it was what when they announced
the iPhone 10 that the stock dropped
like four percent or something like that
because it was so so much further out
than the regular phones and doesn't that
it pushes into their next quarter or
something like that yeah it means that
they're their next earning cycle is not
going to be reflective of their créme
yeah yeah yeah and so like that's
interesting itself and and the other
interesting thing is I was talking to
and now who knows how much they actually
know but I was talking to one of the
business reps that I work with at the
Apple Store and he was like oh you know
this launch
of the eight and A+ it was it was by
design right like so they they obviously
want people to buy the iPhone 10 but
then there's that segment of people
which is probably a lot of people that
don't care like the normal people you
know like maybe they don't care about
about that maybe they just want to get a
good phone maybe they're coming from an
iPhone 6 which in that case this is an
excellent upgrade if you're coming from
a 6s this is an excellent upgrade still
have family members on five s's they've
been waiting out I mean coming anything
below a seven the iPhone eight is is
awesome like I mean it's awesome by
itself I just I wasn't excited about it
that's a whole different story but I
think that I think that the numbers play
a lot in doing like that guy was saying
it's like oh it's it's kind of by design
but it just was a weird feeling to me to
to wake up Sunday morning and still have
iPhones available for launch day right
you know you mean like to get up two
days later and it's like I could still
order it and it'd be fine like
well III in years past I usually do like
a morning news circuit like with like
Fox LA and Casey said KCRW KTLA and ABC
and no one I I felt bad there was a tech
reporter from KTLA out in one of the
Apple stores and he was like there's no
one here there's literally nobody here
like you know every other iPhone lunch
we've had lines around the block so no
one's that is hilarious that you say
that - because I the same thing happened
to me I got to the store and there was
literally nobody in line like oh I got
to the store like not too long before
before it opened - is it and I was just
shocked like I had never seen that then
again in other areas I saw photos where
there are a ton of people in line so you
know it depends on like that was the
photo outside of the Apple store like
one of the flagship Apple stores out
here that or town squares whatever you
want to call it and there was no people
in line and it was just it it blew my
mind because I'm so not used to seeing
that and I and you want to go up to the
manager and say hey hey brah there's no
line take down the little line dividers
it's really bad look like it seriously
like it was like I stepped into the
twilight zone and it was like Apple in
30 years you know I mean like not to say
anything bad about them because people
buy their stuff I buy their stuff like
I'm I'm a big Apple fan but it just it
was so eerie and it was even more eerie
when by the time the store had opened
they were like maybe 10 people in line
and they opened the doors and 30 staff
members are clapping as these ten people
walked in and I was like this is weird
cuz like so do you think that there's
gonna be that sling I mean what because
especially from the business perspective
if I were talking to someone from Forbes
what we'd be talking about is like the
slingshot effect if for one the iPhone
10 is finally available do you think
that we're gonna see that excitement
rekindle or do you think that this is
kind of letting some of the the air out
of the
do you think that this is letting some
of the pressure off of pressure cooker
as far as like pre-orders and sales for
the 10 yeah I mean because we we have
that notion of waiting in line I mean
Apple builds that community really well
or they have in the past yeah now with
this split launch you don't have that
same kind of build up that same kind of
urged you've got a lot of videos out
there that are a little lukewarm on
Apple just you know because they're
starting the year off talking about the
iPhone 8 the iPhone 8 plus you know
apples apples strategy doesn't really
rely on the rational purchase it's it's
that emotional side of the the lifestyle
brand you know that that's really I
think what gets consumers really excited
is that one product launch you can't get
it on the first day and we've got some
killer advertisements that go
hand-in-hand with creating a sense of
what this phone's gonna offer and it
seems like that's getting a little
deflated this year I think it's I think
it started last year to be honest cuz
even last year it wasn't nearly as
difficult to get what I wanted to get
that's true at pre-order like I think I
think that was the year that it more so
started and yeah I think I think it is
deflating but I think they're they're
always gonna have that I I personally I
get tired of the whole oh we couldn't
make enough phones or we couldn't meet
demand come on you guys like actually I
mean to be fair I I kind of want to
believe them on the iPhone 10
I don't think Apple has ever bit off as
significant a number of design changes
for new phone generations Darin what the
number two smartphone maker number three
in the world they bounce back and forth
between two and three I think right now
they're sort of in a statistical dead
heat with Huawei yeah so like you can't
tell me that they can't manufacture
phones fast enough like there's no way
that I cannot you know it's on you on
that I I think they can assemble phones
like no one else I think when they have
the parts there's nothing up that that
can't stop Apple from assembling
what I what I actually do wonder is do
they do they actually have all the
components coming in do they have those
supply chains actually fulfilling for
what the numbers on this phone might be
and that for the first time in a while
we were talking about you know 750 P
LCDs there's no reason why Apple
couldn't source you know parts for the
iPhone 6 the sick the the iPhone 6 the
6s the 7 all of that should be taken
care of but for the iPhone 10 they've
never worked with an OLED before they've
they've never worked with this kind of
frame or chassis yeah but they're but
they're using they're using components
manufactured by Samsung which is
probably one of the largest OLED
manufacturers in the world Tommy I'd
imagine like every but also in being the
largest they've got to fulfil for
themselves they've got to fulfil for
everyone else on the market and Apple's
OLED is a very non-standard screen you
know it's not that's not the same there
are so many so I think they'll think we
can agree that the things that would
possibly delay the 10 is the depth
sensor and the in the display well I'm
in a new camera housing that this is new
camera yeah and I mean that's still
designed and built in-house but it is
something different than what's on the
the iPhone 8 yeah okay well I just I
don't know I mean then then you should
have started earlier
no that I agree with especially with the
ramp on this somebody just said they
started like a week ago or whatever they
they have two million done they have 10
million more on order before launch my
friend Cody his channel called I tweaks
he made a video about this whole thing
the other day and he said yeah he said
so they have two million on order 10
million or 2 million made 10 million on
order that's 12 million they're expected
to sell 50 million yes
come on you knew this from the get-go
you know they knew they knew in August
or they knew in January that that's
that's that that I completely agree with
that they could have been scaling up but
again I think this definitely speaks to
a
mahler design and development team you
know Apple keeps those numbers actually
a little leaner than some other
companies do and I just want to give
Apple the credit that this isn't just a
different color option you know it's not
like a piano black iPhone and that's
reason why numbers are constrained that
to me was really silly this one for
whatever reason I want to give Apple the
benefit of the doubt that this iPhone
has been harder for them to manufacture
and launch than what we've seen over the
last three years yeah I can say and real
quick though one other thing I would
have loved to see on the iPhone 10 is a
ceramic back that's true like that
wouldn't have been that difficult look
at essential they did it for 69 you know
what's funny is like prices and quality
and the first and this objectiveness
that comes between those things so a lot
of people gave a central crap for being
too expensive right for what it is and
while that's true and it's missing some
things now you look at phones like the
note the note eight and more
specifically the the iPhone 10 now and I
would say that the iPhone 10 is probably
close to as premium as a device as the
essential phone but without the ceramic
back like yeah I don't know I don't know
I'm going with some tangent dang off and
yeah but this is what has made the
conversation so difficult is that price
is not an indication of the rational
component aspects performance things
that you're apt to find it's can a
company make that broad consumer pivot
where they can be enough of a lifestyle
brand that they can command a premium
you do get some really cool stuff on a
note do you get enough really cool stuff
on a note for you to justify a nearly
thousand dollar purchase well then you
look at something like the iPhone 10 and
I you know I don't have it next to me
right now but it's so close to something
like an LG V 30 you know here's here's
the answer to your question is if there
are enough of a lifestyle brand to
demand a premium remember when they
released saw a gold Apple watch the
Edition
that right there that was the that was a
big thing at the time for them because I
go yeah it's crazy like up to like 50
grand for a SmartWatch that's completely
outdated now yeah it's it's you know
it's crazy
even $1,300 for a watch is crazy and I
say that as I wear the the ceramic one
speaking of which they should have made
an iPhone in this color if you've seen
the great ceramic in person it looks
awesome I love that gray ceramic color
but anyway yeah I mean they are a
lifestyle brand but at the same time if
you ask any normal person on the street
what's the first word that pops in your
head when I say Apple they're probably
gonna say iPhone oh yeah you know they
make their there their brand their main
catches iPhone and iPhone has it it's
not always been like budget-friendly or
for a consumer like for everybody type
of thing because obviously there aren't
there are more Android phones in the
world than there are I phones but well
it's something that I try and balance
because I don't want it I don't want
this to sound like I'm belittling the
brand but you know they're there there
are other we can point to other aspects
of consumerism you know like a $20 purse
from Target can hold all your stuff but
why do we see people Walker with LV
logos plat all over a bag you know that
is that is the million dollar question
literally and figuratively depending on
how much that costs right exactly
yeah it's status I mean obviously like
it's an obvious and it's you know it's
an obvious thing of like yeah you if you
didn't care you would have the twenty
dollar Target bag because they both do
the same thing now there are there are
other things where you can say like $20
back from Target that's manufactured on
a line there's no qa/qc or whatever but
I'll totally totally versus a 500 you
know to a thousand dollar bag that is
hand-stitched and everything is
completely checked from top to bottom
that will actually last you know very
expensive handbags and stuff people pass
those down generations now I'm not
making an argument for expense
Pam makes copies I don't I don't use but
I mean we can flip week the conversation
to a number of things and again that's
why I always want to say like I'm gonna
be careful not to belittle Apple and I
think their lifestyle success but there
is something fed for you know like I I
have a that closet behind me is packed
full because I'm a bag whore I really am
backpacks messenger bags shoulder slings
and in like all of them are premium bags
like I've spent a lot of money on
different types of bags but also same
thing if you want a good pair of jeans
you know like I love me a good pair of
like Levi's 501 it doesn't mean I'm
gonna go out and spend like two thousand
dollars on a pair of designer jeans
because I kind of have that mental block
as to what value I might yeah or a pair
of boots you know I'll spend $200 on a
really good pair of work boots because I
expect they're gonna last me a lot
longer than the gut-rot $40 boots that
you get from like a Walmart you know
yeah yeah it's all it's all subjective
you know what people whenever if I put
out something that I'm like oh this is a
budget PC build right well it might be
budget to me and the next guy but maybe
to the guy over there it's too expensive
you know yeah so so and isn't it funny
when you do that and then like a year
later someone drops you the comment like
oh this pcs way too expensive you should
have used these parts instead you're
like well yeah that was a year ago and
it's it's it just leaves me with no
words because I don't know what to say
to justify or to argue a fight any price
for any smart phones right now because
let's be real here
most if like if you're on an upgrade
program with a carrier or with Apple
directly you're not gonna ever pay that
full amount probable no you know you'll
be on your upgrade plan for a year for
two years and then you'll trade it in
and get a new one so if you're doing
those things which I think a lot of you
know normal people out there are doing
consumers general consumers are doing
that who cares about the price you it's
gonna cost you at twenty-five
thirty-five bucks a month maybe and well
I mean and it's the lobster pot effect
you
it's it's spending $1,000 seems
outlandish but you know what I made the
jump from 35 bucks a month to 40 bucks a
month that didn't feel too bad the $5 a
month jump is where those the carrier's
really get you you know because it is
not that much what's $5 okay don't get a
start don't get a Frappuccino one day
out of the month and you're good right I
can tell you like apparently I was
drinking frappuccinos every day because
the number of Frappuccino I don't buy
now - getting intense
yeah and so I don't know I mean I can
say as far as like my excitement level
goes I'm a little more excited about the
10 only because I think it looks really
fresh I don't like the notch at the top
that's just something we're gonna have
to deal with I believe it's called the
unibrow we've been trying to call it the
unibrow yeah yeah I think that's the
official term for it now I read that in
a book somewhere I mean I think they
could have done better than that I don't
know how I mean I'm not a design expert
or yeah you know but but it's been
because we've been pointing to like the
iPhone 8 the iPhone 7 the iPhone 6 you
know there's a lot of forehead and chin
right yeah but I also wonder what does
this mean for a company that in the past
has done such an amazing job I mean
really I mean you can always point to
Apple in the past as being one of the
the top offerings for a company that
could blend the function around the form
right and here we have literally a
cutout in the screen to include function
no one's going to question the function
I think the function from that looks
really cool but Apple under the Steve
Jobs era I feel would have worked harder
to make that disappear into not call
attention to it yeah well I think a lot
of people are even saying that an easier
way to do that would be to just to make
the status bar black or whatever and
inhabit blend in its OLED it'll be
invisible you know that's true that's
why I'm just wondering like if someone's
gonna jailbreak and that's gonna be one
of the first things they do is get rid
of the ears yeah no I also
like you were talking about with their
design and they're always setting things
up
I wonder personally if getting rid of
when they got rid of the headphone jack
they did it because they knew eventually
they would release this ten and they
needed the space for everything I do I
wonder if they were thinking that far
out you know I don't know if you saw the
do you watch this channel called strange
strange parts I think this guy he mode I
know what videos you got though they put
a headphone jack inside of the iPhone 7
and it fit yeah did you like cut some
plastic parts inside of there to make it
you know but he actually made a working
headphone jack he installed one and put
it in an iPhone 7 and there was enough
space and so there was enough space on
the iPhone 6 it didn't really change
much yeah yeah that made me think if it
was set up for this 10 because obviously
the 10 I'm pretty sure next year we
won't have this tired design totally
we'll just have something that looks
like the 10 and probably something else
that's better without the notch that'll
come out of months later yeah
we'll have something like that or
whatever that was yeah but we'll have
something like that right and so maybe
it was all a setup to get to this point
and I'm fine I don't care about you know
at first it was kind of weird missing
the headphone jack what annoys me is
that and this is totally off topic but
what annoys me is that I can't use the
same pair of headphones for my macbook
in my iPhone yeah that kills me because
I you that really does bother ear pods
all the time for everything
I had my ear pods in plugged into my
phone and then when I was working on the
computer I plugged in a laptop like
theirs
I just can't use the same ones anymore
so that bothers me well in that the
situation hasn't been fixed by going to
USB see that HTC and Motorola
simplemente shion's are all proprietary
too so I've got my Thunderbolt ports on
my razor if I pull the headphone adapter
from a moto Z it doesn't talk to my
laptop so that's like just as bad if not
worse yes it's not like you've got a
lightning connector on your macbook yeah
no I could understand if you had a
lightning connector and you plugged in
your ear pods and they didn't work
that's that's
legit broken but to say that you've got
USB audio and Android and then it
doesn't work with anything but that
phone is is way worse yeah and a part of
me I was hoping I was wishing that the
ten would have had a USB C port now I
know there's a lot about that because
Apple makes so much money off of MF MFI
programs totally made for iPhone stuff
they make a ton of money and it would be
stupid of them a business stupid
business decision to get rid of that on
on their devices so I get I get from
business strategy why they're not using
the USB type-c but if everything that
they sell aside from the iPhone and the
iPad is gonna have USB type-c there's a
bit of a disconnect there like you said
I don't want to say fragmentation but
it's getting close to that it's kind of
like it we well I mean we had a we had a
tweet um
come in using our hashtag asking if
Apple's main strength is their ecosystem
and right now I think is one of the most
delicate times oh yeah for Apple and
that they don't quite have the same kind
of cohesion that they used to but their
ecosystem is the reason why I keep
coming back let's put it this way I feel
like if I feel like if they had iMessage
on Android a lot of people would switch
seriously III don't think it well I mean
again because we I've talked about this
on the podcast before it's it's been one
of my biggest frustrations and why I've
been so apt to recommend Apple products
though I don't use them myself that's a
family and friends is because like my
grandmother has no problems yeah I think
going from her iPhone or an iPad or a
Mac yeah like she understands FaceTime
play hey that's that's fine there's no
way I'm gonna try and convince her like
oh no a low-end duo or great I already
lost that fight with hangouts I'm not
going back it's a cluster of
communication on Android for sure it's a
lot of different there are a lot of
different I mean you can you know on on
iOS everything you need is built-in
right there I mean it comes it comes in
on Android tree like hangouts as Behance
is confusing for people that don't know
well in that I don't have any any faith
in it you know I have every faith that
Apple is going to continuously improve
iMessage and FaceTime like when you
launch an anti roller when you try
Android phone for first time and you
launch hangouts if you're just checking
it out and then it's all do you want to
use this for your text messages and
you're like uh like yeah I'm thinking
like you know like do I I have a message
here why do I want to put my messages
here or they click test and they don't
understand like yeah I totally agree
with you there that's that's what they
have going for them is they've built
this very solid structure of of software
integration yeah well in a it shows when
you've got things like airdrop you know
yeah I can I can I can talk to and blue
and race different like strategies that
I've used for file management but no one
cares I mean there's something to be
said for a streamlined process that
doesn't cover all of my needs but does
an amazing job of covering the basics in
a way that I think general consumers can
gravitate towards yeah that but one
thing that does frustrate me about the
difference between every iPhone until
now and the ten or even the eight
between the ten is that the software
user experience is I don't know if it's
horrible but it's not horrible but it's
not it's not conventional to everything
they've trained their customers on up to
this point yeah they're having to break
things I think Apple has been a victim
of their own success since the success
that they have done such an amazing job
of bringing consumers into mobile
computing that any significant change
actually works against their audience
and that's not to say that I think
people are dumb it's that I think they
have things that they need to work on
during the day and so Apple created a
platform that was really good at getting
out of the way of the user but now
you've got to break some of that now
you've got to retrain people on a few
things now you need to move things
around getting rid of a button
introducing gestures I know techies are
gonna say NBD but it only takes a few
times for a gesture to fail
or people get kind of annoyed like a
button works 99.99% of the time if I
don't swipe perfectly from the bottom of
my no bezel phone yeah I don't get
exactly what I wanted
I will understand those early teething
pains because we don't change things
like that on iPhones consumers don't
have to relearn things on the iPhone and
now they will you know you know it's
frustrating though speaking to that is
so my friend Quinn from snazzy labs made
a video about the user experience on it
on the iPhone 10 and you know that
little bar that's gonna be at the bottom
right and it's kind of like you swipe up
on that bar to go home and and you do
everything else like that they should
have done just some kind of virtual home
button like they have on the note series
and stuff total that just works anywhere
you know well and if you're gonna
introduce a gesture we have a squeeze
gesture with a button that's what a
button is you squeeze this place and it
does something if we're gonna have a
forced pressure-sensitive screen you
know 3d touch and 3d actions because
this has been one of my biggest issues
with Apple is I think they've done a
terrible job of conveyance for these new
features you pick up an iPhone you don't
really have a clear indication of what
apps are really going to interact with a
forced press like there's no dot there's
no circle there's no frame around the
app there's there's nothing to suggest
that other functionality is there and
again I think this is really
uncharacteristic of Apple that's
conveyence used to be their thing this
is ya know this this works and this is
what you can expect is going to happen
when you use it I'll be really curious
to see what the general user experience
is I think like the headphone jack a lot
of people are gonna grumble and then do
it exactly hey because here's the thing
is is from what I understand they're
conveying this as the new normal this is
how it's going to be from this point
forward you know because they said this
is the future of our smartphones like
this is here's what we're doing this is
what we're doing moving forward you know
the H is what we're doing now the 10 is
what we're doing the rest of your life
yeah
or whatever until they change it well I
was gonna ask you though do you use 3d
touch at all no on the icons I ever use
it the only time I've ever used it is to
turn up and down the brightness on the -
I so the other thing is I I got into
that a habit when I was reviewing the
iPhone 7 I got into a habit of peeking
and popping on emails and then I just
stopped well yeah well keep me using it
I don't use the mail app on iOS so I
don't get a lot of the cool features you
know I wish I could reply in line to an
email with the Gmail app or whatever
using 3d touch I'd use it all the time I
do use it to archive stuff that is my
friend ever archiving great from a 3d
touch but then I've also found it like
the same thing on the watch you know if
I get an email I can just archive it
right there that is decluttered my inbox
a million times over again since that
came out so yeah because I'm definitely
terrible like people complaining about
my iPhone reviews because yeah doesn't
track email like I organize it in and so
you'll see like I've got 30,000 unread
emails I guess yeah right um I wanted to
cuz I don't want to keep you too much
longer here I know you've got to get
going you've got stuff to do today too
but um on things that I think the iPhone
8 has done right especially like
introducing wireless charging as an as
an approved standard using the Qi yeah I
can tell you that I was shocked that it
was a standard standard exactly I was I
was quite that was that was the most
surprising thing to me of the keynote is
that it was Qi because let's be honest
they're you know they like to keep
things in their closed circle you know
and right and have control over every
aspect of it and that and that strategy
of thinking is part of what makes their
products so amazing is that they have
control of every little thing they
micromanage everything that comes out
you want to make a product with a
lightning connector you're gonna have to
buy 10,000 of those connectors from
Apple so they know the quality that's
being put into know
but that's what makes their stuff so
great but yeah to see them use the Qi
standard that was amazing I have to say
that also what they don't they've done
right
the cameras are are great as always you
know they didn't really do the camera
stuff good I don't think that most
people would have a noticeable
difference between you know this and the
predecessor I we did a we did our I mean
it there is and well no that's just it
we did our camera review and I may ended
up making it more of a comparison
against the 7 8 + + 7 + outside of some
changes to white balance and color
processing I can't see any horrible
differences but to that same token one
of the things that I think I'll be I'm
most excited about and I'm really
excited to see it on the iPhone 8 plus
is AR is young al leverage developer
support for AR kid yeah yeah a couple of
the gimmicky like the IKEA app and stuff
like that well I've actually been
practically using that because I'm I'm
moving and so I've actually literally
been so I'm not using it with awesome
like I I'm using it for dimensions of
all kinds of Frederick's I'll find a
couch at IKEA that's roughly the same
dimensions as when I wanted to get from
somewhere else and I'll use it to place
it in the room and then they have this
other app that's really cool that I was
playing with called magic plan and it
makes a blueprint of your spaces and you
literally take the camera and you go
around the edges of each room and then
it'll spit out a bird's eye blueprint of
cool what's it called magic spaces magic
plan magic plan I'm at yr that up as
soon as we're off of those I've been
using things like that practically and
it's it's quite enjoyable
now let's be honest nothing like that is
incredibly new like we've been able to
do similar things like that before but
Apple definitely has the advantage on a
our tech it's the best implementation so
far and well in that they had the face
to put it in just a regular it's not an
iPhone AR it's not a standalone phone
it's just this is the iPhone or also
that that behemoth
Lenovo that they put out to yeah and and
you know what I have to say to iOS 11
and back to software had not much to do
with hardware but iOS 11 is pretty solid
I mean it's buggy but like what they're
doing is like it's I mean I hate to say
this because it's such a stupid comment
to make but it's the best it's the best
iteration of iOS ever like nobody's
they're gonna johnny is gonna walk on
the stage and say this is the worst
iphone we've ever made you know it's
always the best we've ever made but what
I want that I want that press conference
words this is a lateral move from what
we put out last year right but they
think they've done stuff right it's just
there's not you know ip66 a it would
have been great it's not the end of the
world I guess it to be honest a lot of
people always like waterproofing is a
necessity on phones and I'm like I can't
think of a moment where waterproofing
has ever really saved me outside of
being me being intentional and going in
the rain to take a picture or something
or like I mean cuz even most phones
being mildly splash resistant even if
it's not submergible it's I I want to go
swimming with the phone yeah like the
the 1+5 right I was I was talking to one
plus and they were like hey you know we
just want to let you know that while we
don't have an official rating you can
get this thing wet and I was like okay
let me try it so I tried dude I I put it
in the shower I submit in a bucket of
water for a good amount I made a video
about this and it was fine it's still
completely fine so right a lot of phones
have the ability to be submerged even on
or you know and as whether or not
they've gone through the process to get
that actual and then at the same time
you know Apple's warranty isn't going to
cover water damage no phones warranty
not just Apple any manufacturer they're
not gonna cover water damage because
it's it's a resistance rating not a
proof rating but then also it's it's
it's why I get so excited about that
Apple commercial with the dude on the
bicycle and the thunderstorm with ac/dc
playing in the background that's just a
baller commercial so with with things
like AR
we're saying like iOS 11 cuz I just to
circle back to one other point that you
made earlier in our Congress in this
conversation was that notion of
smartphone design having Pete because
it's something I'm talking about for a
while is we don't really have much left
for a glowing rectangle push squared get
out well that's pretty well baked at
this point yeah um do you think that
some of these changes we've been seeing
you know they're improvements to Siri
trying to build their own living room
speaker putting AR into a phone and then
also some of the new services in iOS 11
like HEV see video recording like really
trying to get after bandwidth what do
you think Apple will do next I mean this
is such a loaded question but what do
you think where do you think Apple goes
next like an iPhone 9 seems like it's
out of the question we're probably going
to move forward with an iPhone 10
revision next year yeah
do you think apples gonna revive plans
for smart glasses do you think heads-up
displays with I think that I think that
homekit is one of the best well thought
out ecosystems out it works the best
it's one of the most flawless smart home
ecosystems that I've used and there's
ton of compatibility with it and I think
that they're gonna hit the ground
running with that because they've played
all the basis for things like that home
pod is one next one of those next big
things that's gonna that's gonna
solidify their movement into the home
and I think that they're gonna go after
more of that kind of stuff because
that's you know like the iPhone makes
things more convenient as a luxury for
you right right but I think like helping
people around the house yeah it's a
luxury like but it some of these things
literally make you safer and make your
life easier as all those to just having
a luxury item like an iPhone some of
these home kit things and just smart
home space in general I think that's
where the I think that's where they're
headed
they're you know you want to be a
lifestyle brand you you have to have me
waking up looking at your
some are home along that have the echo
spot right like Amazon is crushing it in
that everybody has an echo yeah
basically
I mean calling them echoes like that's
hilarious is like in one generation of
products it became like Kleenex yeah
yeah everybody has an echo it's it's
crazy like I think that they're gonna
they're gonna go after smart home market
and and also I have to say that while
the iPhone eight was the least exciting
thing that they launched for some reason
the Apple watch I'm pretty happy about
now that I got the LTE working finally I
was the that was a whole big mess
with the launch of that yeah well I mean
it hasn't worked on any of my Samsung's
like literally every part of like my my
gear reviews with the gear s2 LTE has
been like hey this doesn't work like I
can't get work I can't complete
smartwatches are always botched
initially for some reason I don't know
why but but but it but it is pretty yes
I would like to see I think it would be
great if the new normal was just to have
an earpiece and a SmartWatch no big
screen to distract you just these two
things simple form of communication you
know if I needed to look anything up or
to know any information that Siri was
somehow smart enough to actually
retrieve that from the internet and read
it back to me like right would be cool
like I would love to not have to focus
all my time on this thing and to be and
also let me just say one other thing
real quick is I don't know about you but
I have not had the greatest battery life
on the iPhone age or whoever on your
guys team is testing that I mean it's
117 and I'm at 28% oh maybe I use my I
do have 4 hours and 53 minutes of usage
on here which I guess is pretty solid
but I but I mean anymore it's even
difficult to say people have been saying
like I should be testing more screaming
on time and to your point I've been
trying to move more things off of the
phone screen so if I can if I can work
something over audio I'm in the car a
lot so I'm trying to do a lot of screen
off usage yes
tracking mileage wallet streaming a
podcast and you know like giving me
audio alerts on turn-by-turn navigation
that's so funny because a lot of things
that we have nowadays are trying to move
you off of the screen right we have
Android auto car play we have the
smartwatches we have glasses we have
smart earbuds etc everything is trying
to get you away from looking at this
yeah every phone manufacturer is making
this look better it's like the last gasp
right it's like this is this is the last
the the last push on glowing rectangle
touch squared get and then I'm like if
Siri could just look thing like I never
want to open up Yelp ever again I want
to say hey Siri you know I love a big
old fatty burrito
what's five miles away from me let Siri
go and scour Yelp and Zagat and find me
something that it's gonna it's gonna
it's gonna know I'm gonna like that's
what I want yeah yeah I just want
everything to make decisions for me I
don't want to have to make any real
decisions in life anymore
it's sad but that is actually kind of
true hey we've got one more oh no go
ahead go ahead
I was just gonna say one other thing
that that is kind of weird about this
whole off-screen thing is so I paid you
know whatever X hundred dollars for the
phone right and then I pay another sixty
to eighty dollars for the service and
that's all great and then I paid ten
dollars a month for the watch plus the
cost of the watch just to leave this at
home yeah I'm paying monthly to leave
this thing that I paid more for III
think there's always gonna be some need
for that brain of our personal area
network but I would be fine if it
eventually just became like like a small
square lump that sat in a pocket that
had a battery maybe it doesn't even have
a screen it's just got connections to
all of my other yeah various peripherals
I've got two quick questions here from
Twitter before we wrap up the show
actually three if you don't mind do you
think we'll need new cases for wireless
charging no I I don't and I think that
Android has a proven track record of of
pretty much any case working with
wireless charger
I know there are some exceptions always
to the rule but I've tested quite a good
amount of cases with the iPhone Aiden 8
plus and I haven't had any issues yeah
and I've just to put it out there so
everybody knows what I'm using I'm using
the Samsung convertible wireless charger
the Belkin up charge or something I
camera what's called the Belkin one that
just released you know at the Apple
stores and I've been using one from
ravpower
and all three of those have had zero
problems with probably about 15 to 20
random cases that I have here so Apple
has called out like more of the rugged
cases so like thin and bumper style
cases should be fine I had an I had
added in the in the chat that apparently
Apple says there might be some
compatibility with thicker cases yeah
okay I mean it depends on the separation
like I wish I had the wireless charger
but I can hold the phone about a quarter
inch away from the charger and it
charges and it starts yeah it picks up
that connection right so yeah it's gonna
depend obviously if your case has any
form of metal across the back or
anything that's gonna interfere with the
induction then yeah you're gonna have a
problem there like I would even think
that it's possible that you could have a
wallet case with cards on the back that
could block oh that is essentially
disrupt maybe you've got from from
Thomas Byers do you think not having a
fast charger is going to deflate
enthusiasm more for these new iPhones
wow that's that is something that bugs
the crap out of me let me tell you you
give us fast charging abilities finally
and which mind you we've always been
able to fast early charge our phones by
using an iPad wall adapter okay I don't
know if anybody knows that trick yeah
you you you take an iPad wall adapter
you plug in your iPhone to it and it
charge your phone a little bit faster
that's been proven but now we actually
have like realistic quick charge quote
quick charge in a USB power delivery USB
C power delivery is what we have in the
iPhone and yes it's what $79 for the
access to accessories you need
from Apple to get that working well let
me tell you this there are third-party
USB type-c to lightning cables and wall
adapter 29 watt wall adapters that will
do the fast charging and you can pick
them up for less than that but the fact
that it's not included in the Box annoys
me then again my mom don't care about
fast charging plugs our phone in at
night you know probably doesn't care no
she definitely doesn't especially for
what you're saying leaving it overnight
but if you like for me I'm at 28% and
I'm gonna pop this on the fast charging
setup before I head back to my house and
I'll be good to go for the rest of the
day it's nice it's a convenience thing
and it should have been included because
it's included with every other thing and
I think it would have cost them a nickel
more per phone probably look that's the
margin though you can't cut into the
party yes I don't know I mean I don't
even remember the question was any more
but right it was just does it does it
does it don't you know it'll like
deflate any additional enthusiasm III
don't I don't think that's really gonna
make a huge act I think a lot of people
are gonna grumble about it it's the
thing you know people grumble about
battery life and then they'll go out and
buy an even thinner phone the next year
they're gonna grumble about losing the
headphone jack but they're still gonna
go out and buy the next phone over the
next year I've got one more here for you
from Peter hatin using the P n weekly
hashtag do you think there will be any
improvement in the iPhone 10 camera
apart from better low-light zoom no I
mean it's a different it's a different
sensor so we don't know okay it's the
same megapixel count better aperture and
and oh is on both lenses which is
awesome be nice yeah it's good I mean oh
it's been nice on mine no I was just
gonna say it's been nice on my note but
I don't know it depends on the how that
I'm I'm certain that it won't be worse
[Laughter]
here's what I can't tell because Apple
has played fast and loose with this
terminology like so I think it was for
the iPhone 6s I can't remember but they
said in the press conference
bigger sensor which when they meant was
higher resolution sensor and so for the
iPhone 10 they kept saying this has a
bigger sensor and if that's true and
it's the same resolution that would be
like what we got with the galaxy s7
right have unity and a bigger sensor
what's that the sensor on the V 30 yeah
it's the same size as the one on the
iPhone it's huge
it's the one on the iPhone 10 or the
eight no it's it's a it's a 1 it's a 1/3
inch sensor it's actually smaller than
what's in the like what's in a galaxy it
looked pretty big when I saw it saw it
like just a sensor in person but I'm
crazy anyway but I don't I don't think
it's gonna be worse right I don't think
that it's gonna be worse I think that it
it'll be just as better as the 7
compared to the 8 right like it's better
under a magnifying glass to a trained
eye but you're my mom and your grandma
are not gonna notice no that's what I'm
gonna I'm gonna say is that it's you
know I mean well because we have a clear
clear sense of what Apple's going to be
doing for image processing yeah you know
it's it's taking the raw file applying
color contrast you know we kind of have
a feeling of what that's gonna look like
I don't think the iPhone 10 is gonna be
drastically different there so yeah a
lot of that I think is already answered
with the main sensor on the ID know what
sensor is going to be on the 10 have I
mean they haven't announced it but I'm
sure Sony has the mobile sensors that
they've made they're probably using a
Sony sensor and if they are then there's
probably out there somewhere what
sensors they've released and we could
narrow down which specific one they're
probably using in the 10 since it's out
already
Apple's notorious for using sensors that
have or things parts that have been out
for a little while you know definitely
and just making them better because
their software and the processing is on
point and I don't know I think it's
gonna be better but I don't think it's
gonna be like
jaw-dropping like better yeah I don't I
agree I don't think it's gonna be
rocking our worlds we do have one
question here for about Samsung if you
want to take that too
this is also from Peter Hayden if
Samsung doesn't change next year do you
think we'll have the same conversation
about their designs being too
conservative I think that's exactly
what's gonna happen next year actually
you think it's gonna be kind of a
tick-tock strategy i I think it company
goes it all circles back to the the the
point I made of that we're at a pinnacle
of smartphone design and and internal is
as well you can make a snapdragon 80 you
know whatever you want to put in a phone
yeah sure it'll be faster but what more
can you offer on a glass slab with the
screen on it you know like what can you
do and that's not a bad thing that's
just how it is that's a great thing look
at how far we've come in 10 years like
it's crazy like it is crazy how how much
things have developed I think that it's
probably gonna be iterative just like it
was this year everybody this the big
thing this year was everybody was like
oh it's an si plus with a pen what a lot
of people are saying and while that
might not be true I know a lot of people
who know people will argue with that and
and it's not I mean it's you buy the
note for one thing and one thing only
the a pen that is it because you can get
a big display maybe not quite this big
but you can get a big display in any
other phone any other Samsung phone
certainly the SI plus but you buy it for
the experience pen offers and I don't
know I mean I don't know what else they
could do next year to be yeah sure they
could drastically change the design
maybe maybe we'll see a flop but maybe
Samsung got a glass and aluminum on the
back next year I would love to see any
manufacturer work with something other
than glass I've been saying like yeah
well I wanted a leather back phone like
the old moto makers oh my god Laura or
carbon why was it maybe and the the g4
right
the a beauty yeah yeah the g4 had a
leather back to that I really enjoyed
but yes the Moto maker stuff was awesome
I really liked the the the leather backs
on those as well like it was all that
stuff is really cool and like I think
what it's like six months later the Moto
looks so cool cuz it was all worn Brown
went there like it looked like an adult
like an old cowboy belt or something
like it was freakin awesome yeah I don't
know it just were just kind of at this
point where you know like where do we go
from here we've all kind of agreed it
you know it's it's a taller rectangle
and it's shiny on the back and that's
how you sell a phone and and people buy
them and and it's really just us type of
people that complain about these things
you know the normal people I hate the
reason the word normal people but I I
feel like the best example was your
grandma and my mom there are not looking
at any of these phones saying you know
like they're not really complaining
about it they're just like either I'm
gonna get it or I'm not gonna get it and
that's the only thing they say you know
to us if we tear these things apart and
we're like well it doesn't have I P 68
there's no headphone jack there's no
this there there's no that Baba lol but
I don't know you know I I think it's I
may not be excited but they're they're
good phones yeah you know they did it
they they did it right as much as they
could do because we're at this point I
still think that the 10 should have been
the priority the primary yeah I think I
think the 10 should have been the
primary and a 7 with the new chip maybe
could have been like the cheaper model
and and that and that's how it could
have you could read they just they just
could have rebranded it as you know
iPhone and iPhone X you have iPhone
which is a model you have iPhone se
which is the bottom line you have iPhone
which is basically a 7 with 8 internals
and you have the 8 which is the full
front display and then the 8 plus which
is a bigger full front display and that
that's that's the lineup yeah III really
think because I think that would have
helped clean up a lot of this room
yeah market there's a lot of stuff
market one more damn phone well and
again it cuz
and I were talking about this earlier in
the show it's like an iPhone 9 doesn't
make any sense an iPhone x2 x3 what what
squared that's an Apple X cubed yeah but
but that's what I mean like for me the
main takeaway from the iPhone launches
this year has been how excited I am for
Apple services yeah and and how the
hardware is increasingly becoming almost
irrelevant like the phone itself doesn't
matter to me as much as you know what
what access I get what services I get
and what I can do with it and I think
Apple is definitely sort of leading the
charge on devaluing a sense of the
rectangle and getting through to
developers and to consumers that the
next phases are gonna be all software
driven oh well I mean they're they do
that in every every market right like
like let's just be honest wireless
charging is gonna be everywhere now
totally everywhere you'll go to a target
and on the register button this is a
stretch but and the register there will
be a wireless charging pad while you
check out you know I'm just looking at
airports like how easy it's gonna be to
like that like retrofit Airport so that
we don't have people sit stant you know
sitting on the floor in hallways trying
to charge gadgets know exactly it'll be
it'll be every Starbucks table will have
one let's just be real about every
single that'll probably the first thing
to convert you know totally they already
have it in some stores they changed the
game like that in software and in
hardware even though wireless charging
has been around forever on Android and
it's been proven and which reliable it
works it might be slower than regular
charging but it's fine like it's been
around forever
and now that Apple did it it's gonna be
a thing it's totally gonna be a thing
you know well take the headphone jack
away and it became a thing on other
phones surprisingly much to my chagrin
because I really do like all my old like
mixing headphones and monitors and stuff
um but Dom I really want to thank you
for jumping in on this conversation you
were exactly the guy that I wanted to to
have this chat with again I really
enjoyed your videos first where can
people get in touch with you on the
Twitter's on the socials and what do you
have coming up
YouTube what are you gonna be working on
next Twitter's and socials it's a
everything.com forward slash mac mixing
and my ma c mi Xin Jie or youtube.com
slash Dom you can find all my stuff
there as far as videos next go I'm
hoping its pixel stuff I'm actually
doing a pretty a pretty intense PC build
pretty soon here too which is gonna be
alright
crazy 16 core I'm doing thread Ripper
you're gonna do I'm doing a thread
Ripper build with hopefully to Titan XPS
and 128 gigabytes of RAM and
everything's gonna be water cool so
awesome that's that's when all my water
cooling components just showed up well
while we were on the podcast so I'm like
that's now getting going on that because
I need to do something like that for
video editing are you also gonna be like
twitch streaming or anything with that
rig no just it's just for production
stuff I mean it's I have another one
like down down that under my desk behind
me that it's replacing basically so yeah
it's just mainly production stuff you
know it's it's what we do we edit videos
and stuff so it's like it's a lot of
money to put into a PC but at the same
time it's it's like it's like trying to
sell coffee without a coffee shop you
know right exactly
yeah and my old six core Intel is
definitely starting to show its age it
was such a monster when I put it
together
what 4k 60 frame per second video ow
yeah this this machine will we'll
definitely be able to edit 8k footage
like butter not that I'm gonna start
shooting an 8k but well I'm dying to get
my hands on like a 360 camera in 8k yeah
I want to see because I think that will
be that will be when we can start seeing
an HD field of view where you look
because you have to have all of those
dots wrapped around your head I think
well I think that too will see it a 360
camera from the Apple next year I hope
so again if they can move the needle on
stuff like that cuz right now 360 is fun
but it's such a pain in the ass to work
with yeah and if any company can
actually polish up that experience I
would expect it would be someone like
Apple
uh yeah well um we're gonna do our
wrap-up spiel you can you can stick
around for that if you like but again I
want to thank you for joining definitely
check out Dom's channel I definitely
checked out his because the videos have
brought us to him where his videos sort
of as editorials on the iPhone
definitely want to watch those - some
really great insights on products that I
think we're all using especially away
from my more Android centric there you
have it folks
