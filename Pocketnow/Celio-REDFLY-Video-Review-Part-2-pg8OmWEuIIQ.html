pocketnow.com in part two of my Celia
red fly mobile companion video review
we're going to take a look at how well
the red fly displays several
applications first we'll take a look at
some of the applications on the 2.8 inch
screen of my verizon samsung i760 excel
has always been a tough application on a
small screen here i have downloaded an
olympic schedule spreadsheet and you can
see that it's not to user friendly
next we will take a look at using the
PowerPoint Viewer I downloaded the same
Olympic schedule in PowerPoint format
this is quite a large file but windows
mobile does a great job at rendering
the page action is smooth and the
graphics are accurate will exit out a
PowerPoint and now take a look at adobe
reader I downloaded the red fly faq PDF
to view I personally use Adobe Reader
quite often and it can be a struggle to
move and zoom around a document but it's
definitely doable
now let's plug in the USB cable and see
how well the red fly renders these
applications so the right flied to text
the device and brings up the today
screen we'll start off with Excel and
bring up that same Olympic schedule
spreadsheet
this is one application where the red
fly really shines this is the PC viewing
experience using your windows mobile
device next we'll bring up PowerPoint
and display the Olympic schedule ppt the
load time is a little slow but as you
can see that the rendering is accurate
will page through couple slides and you
can see that the paging is a little slow
compared to the native windows mobile
display although all the graphics are
accurately displayed will exit out a
PowerPoint and now try the adobe reader
we'll select the red fly faq PDF as you
can see red fly is extremely slow at
rendering the entire page it's actually
quite excruciating
but the completed page is rendered
accurately now we'll try to zoom in to
make the columns readable as you can see
the rendering of the text is also very
slow
this is clearly not an application that
shines on the red fly
will exit out of the reader and now
we'll bring up an application which is
in my list of never leave home without
which is Windows Live search will select
the map view and display the Washington
DC area as you can see it's great to
view the map on an 8-inch screen we will
move on to pocket Internet Explorer and
see how well the desktop version of the
National Weather Service website renders
as you can see the red flag does a
superb job of rendering desktop web
sites i'll go ahead and input the
washington DC zip code and look at the
local weather
the formatting graphics are displayed
accurately and we should also give
credit to the accurate rendering of
pocket Internet Explorer that does it
for part 2 as you can see the red flag
does a very good job at rendering with
most applications I'll be back with a
look at the keyboard and USB
functionality and my next installment of
the red fly mobile companion video
