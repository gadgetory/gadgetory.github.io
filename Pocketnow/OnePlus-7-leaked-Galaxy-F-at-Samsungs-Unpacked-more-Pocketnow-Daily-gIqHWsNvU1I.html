oneplus 7 could look like and they yes I
said they are different
Samsung pretty much just confirmed that
we will be getting a Samsung Galaxy F
and unpack next month and it looks like
the infamous air power will finally
begin production but well will believe
it when we see it I'm Jaime Rivera and I
should be taking some time off because I
need it after CES it was a great show
but the news always continues this is
bargained out daily the official news
today begin with deals if you're in the
market for the new MacBook Amazons food
is probably your best option reefer many
days of warranty $550 in discount which
is crazy you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about Apple's
air power I mean we've been waiting for
it for more than a year those of you
that care I'm not one of them but it
seems that production will begin as soon
as the 21st and remember men'she quo
predicted that it was going to be ready
by q1 2019 so for those of you to care
stay tuned now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy M as a the company has
just the pretty much dedicated the whole
microsite to this product and we should
be expecting it soon we see a minor
notch the company is teasing fast
charging and good processor we just have
to get a product so we'll see when that
happens and speaking of Samsung this is
rather interesting the company has a
just launched a couple of teasers in
France and these are in Korean and if
you translate them they say that the
future will unfold very soon and
apparently this means that ad unpacked
we could be seeing the Galaxy f we heard
teasers from trusted sources that that
would happen and now the company is
doing it on its own so yeah
Galaxy F let's see if this one is
actually one that we could hold and
finally the hottest news that I have to
do with the oneplus 7 because of they
seem to be two phones or at least so we
see there's a leaked image of two
different displays one with the current
display that we currently see how the
oneplus 60 so it could just be that it's
one phone but then the other doesn't
show a notch the display is curved and
can somebody tell me where the selfie
camera is which is rather interesting
we are already curious as to what the
company is going to bring it looks
nothing like what we saw in the leaks
recently but listen in the comments I
mean what do you think do you like this
design do you think that the company
should what do a flip camera like we saw
from vivo where we have a secondary
skeeter screen at the back for selfies
in my case I think that would be a cool
idea but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion friends
again if you want to get the news
earlier if all was I'm talking out our
common script to both of our channels
English and Spanish for more videos like
this one and follow me on Twitter hi
managers quarter leave it on Instagram
at high metal data please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I'm home every other thing so much
for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
