this is our review of the ZTE Nubia 5zt
may not be well known in America as it
is in Asia but they're trying to make a
big splash in the United States and
their Nubia 5 is their flagship after of
every positive experience unboxing this
phone and actually using it for a full
week we feel they're off to a decent
start the Nubia v is an elegant phone
with soft touch plastic on the back and
metallic orders that actually do feel
metal it's very light and leads to a
very pleasant feel in the hand the only
annoying part of the design is the
placement of the speakers which get
muffled easily on a table and the
capacitive buttons that don't really
tell you what they are it's got a very
nice 5-inch 1080p IPS display that does
a decent job with color reproduction
even though a little under saturated for
my taste the specs don't spill flagship
for us standards though it lacks LTE
sports last year's Snapdragon s4 pro
processor and runs last year's Android
4.1 jelly bean aside from the fact that
it's only got 16 gigs of non expandable
storage the rest of those stuff is here
though 2 gigs of ram and FC so some
parts are good that software is unique
though I'm not a fan of Android skins
but I'd call this one one of the better
ones that I've used it removes the app
tray and loads everything onto endless
home screens it's like an iPhone just
better because you can mix them with
widgets with folders and applications in
the same UI and saves you the extra step
of having to go out of the homescreen to
get something I also like that the UI
elements are polished and minimalistic
not too much bloat not too little
attention to detail I guess the only
complaint that I have with the UI is
that it does bark down the phone at
times the phone is frequently having to
redraw the homescreen whenever you load
it with a lot of tasks which let me saw
with a newer version of Android but we
don't know how ZT performs in this
department other than that we have other
features like for example motion
features like we see on Samsung Galaxy
phones which are nice additions and
actually ZT does a good job with these
all the said using the Nubia v was
mostly positive it performs decently
when it comes to day to day use and even
though we weren't able to test it with
high-end games like asphalt 8 because
oddly they're not compatible with the
phone it can't play games well and with
no considerable lag we've got some good
audio quality for calls through the
earpiece and the speakerphone quality is
actually good from you
again for calls as long as you don't
place the phone flat on the table now
the biggest win with this phone is
battery life and only 2300 milliamp
hours I don't know how ZTE does it but
I've landed two solid days of use with
this phone for the first time ever it's
a non replaceable power pack and I guess
you won't really need that it performs
well no matter what you do with the
phone my only major disappointment with
the experience was through the camera
ZTE boats that this phone offer is a
great user experience through its Konica
Minolta lens and it's Sony seamless
processor but it clearly needs a
software tweak photos appear overexposed
in pretty much every scenario and
setting you use the front-facing photos
are just unusable and the same can be
said about photos taken with a flash
again due to excessive overexposure
video is also good but not great since
the software lacks controls it
continuously focuses and it doesn't
allow you to selectively focus even
though you see the camera responding
when you touch the display it actually
doesn't focus to what you're looking for
which is odd overall the ZTE novia 5 is
a good phone it's a battery trooper it
offers a decent user experience and it's
actually a good phone for just about
every average user it's just hard to
recommend this phone due to its price
tag at $450 a touch we can get a moto X
for the same unlock price for a nexus 5
for $100 less with LTE plus the latest
version of Android or even a Moto G
which is $250 less expensive it offers a
similar experience it's really hard for
this device to compete even though we
want it to we do praise easy for a good
start with this phone and that's the
reason why we give it a 7 out of 10 we
can't wait to Z the ZTE Nubia 6 that's a
