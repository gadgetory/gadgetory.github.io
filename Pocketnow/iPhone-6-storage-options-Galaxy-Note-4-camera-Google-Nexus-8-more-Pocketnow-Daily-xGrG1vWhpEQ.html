options and a launch date reports also
claimed that the Samsung Galaxy Note 4
will have some camera enhancements
Google might have just teased the google
nexus 8 or nexus 9 i'm high meddling
that I and then you order an Android
wear product yesterday or are you like
me waiting for the Moto 360 this is
parking out daily now that we have some
official news that is really not that
official as razor has just announced
their first TV box that will support
Android TV that was the biggest question
that we had yesterday are there going to
be boxes or to get to buy a TV to use
Android TV and no there will be a box
there is no price tag there is no
release date but we do know that it will
run Android TV at some point and even
though razor is trying to use this more
as a gaming box yeah obviously the idea
is that as well you will also be able to
watch a movie interesting stay tuned for
more details now one of the most
anticipated products running Android L
is the Moto 360 which should be launched
some time the summer sadly summer just
begun so we don't know exactly when in
the next three months now the point
being is that if you remember the
company had this contest and the the
contest consisted of people trying to
submit watch phases and for Motorola to
select a winner the winner is ivy
buswell links is nutrition for full
details on the image and the watch phase
which is extremely cool everything that
we saw from this moto 360 at Google i/o
is just amazing this could be probably
the best product Motorola's and launched
after the Moto X hopefully this one does
sell now another very anticipated
product this year is the samsung galaxy
note 4 we're expecting a tad Aoife in
berlin and we've got two innovations
that are apparently coming number one is
a sort of display technology we shot on
the lumia 1520 what it does is it
applies different contrast for whenever
you're shifting display or whatever
ambient light changes it is very very
cool but even more interesting
apparently we won't be getting the 16
megapixel ISO self-censor we're getting
optical image stabilization with a 12
megapixel camera we don't care about the
pixels optical image stabilization would
be great on this product hopefully we
will be getting it
even though we didn't get any nexus
products yesterday and we are
disappointed about that and it seems
that google is still working on products
starting with a yellow Nexus 5 and licks
in the description and Google please you
to go into the description that yellow
is terrible you should Lumia yellow
which looks a lot better but aside from
that if you look at the material design
mockups in the presentation of Android L
notice that tablet that tablet is not in
the market yet it's got front firing
speakers and it is small so apparently
google ended up teasing the nexus 8 or
Nexus 9 whatever the number will be and
you know it makes sense that we don't
have any nexus products just yet because
Android L is not ready stay tuned for
that and finally for the very hot is of
the day credible sources talk about the
iphone 6 starting with the possible
launch date September 19th is apparently
going to be the day but apparently this
is a Friday Apple usually has events on
Tuesdays or monday so probably the event
will happen before this will just be the
launch date but even more interesting
apparently there are new storage options
Apple will ditch 16 gigs finally and
apparently it'll start at 32 and 64 gigs
for the 4.7 inch model and then the 5.5
inch model will include options for
optical image stabilization in the
camera and 128 gigs so interesting
hopefully these rumors are true but that
leaves you the question of the day just
on size comparisons and matters which
one would you pick the 5.5 inch iPhone
or the 4.7 inch model in my case
honestly even though i do like babbitt's
i do use my iphone a lot for fitness so
for me i would much rather go with the
4.7 inch model but leave us a comment
down below what do you think and friends
yes you know the drill if you want to
get the news earlier before this video
is phone achieve followers on parking
our common strep changing channel as
well it also follow me on Twitter Jaime
underscored any better please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am high metal be better thank you
very much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
