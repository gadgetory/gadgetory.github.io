synonymous with premium design but while
my plans to change that with a little
something they introduced at their
keynote earlier today for Pocket now I'm
high on to Houston and this is a quick
look at the huawei media pad m2 at CES
2016 the design of the media pad m2 is
one of chamfered edges and speckled
aluminum and it feels a lot sturdier
than its 349 starting prices suggests
with that 349 you get a Wi-Fi only model
with two gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigs of
internal storage that you can up it the
three gigs of ram in 64 gigabytes for
419 then add LTE connectivity it's just
a $50 premium the media pad m2 takes
some cues from Wally's recent phone
lineup most notably the gesture
sensitive finger print sensor beneath
the display and the software experience
is driven by qual ways in motion UI
while Huawei didn't spend much time on
stage talking about their new tablet
they did put a big focus on providing a
high-end audio experience for the best
media consumption possible and the media
pad m2 has four loudspeakers powered by
Harman Kardon flanking the beveled edges
for fans of Samsung's Galaxy Note series
in the S Pen always throwing in stylus
support of their own in the form of
their new M pen with the same 2048
levels of pressure sensitivity
performance seems to be on par and the M
fan has the same floating cursor though
a full comparison against the S Pen will
have to wait until we have a media pad
m2 of our own to test if you're the
protective type there's also
split-screen mode available albeit with
a limited number of apps we've got
plenty more CES to cover on the road
ahead so be sure you stick around and
stay in the loop follow packing out with
