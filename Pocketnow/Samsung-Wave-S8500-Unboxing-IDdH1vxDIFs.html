pocketnow.com and you know if there's
one thing that's really started to heat
up lately in these smart phone wars it's
gonna be the screens devices like the
HTC Incredible in the Google Nexus One
are offering the AMOLED type screen
which some manufacturers have really
jumped on however Samsung has taken it a
step further by creating what's called a
Super AMOLED screen so it's gonna offer
you the same benefits however what these
supposed added benefit of being able to
see this in the daylight which is one
thing that the Nexus One incredible are
lacking somewhat so today we're going to
unbox was called the Samsung Wave it's a
new Samsung device that offers their new
and very own operating system called
bada so we're going to show you how bada
works the apps that it comes with the
phone itself the hardware itself and
then we're also going to take it a step
further and see if their claim of
daytime viewing with their new Super
AMOLED screen is really true let's go
ahead and get to the unboxing
all right everyone we're back and we're
gonna take go ahead and take the phone
out of the package now I've already got
it started on both evil envelopes that
are there to kind of help me out on the
video so that's a little bit easier if
you little bit more seamless so I'm
gonna go ahead and pull this out of this
package right here we have another while
I here is the phone itself yes for my
SIM card to follow now as you can see
this is the Samsung Wave phone itself
right here oh go ahead and bring this up
so you can see the Box a little bit
better now basically what we're gonna do
is we're gonna cut this guy open now
Samsung does something that's actually
very nice I don't if you can tell but by
seeing right here it says do not accept
if this seal is broken many many many
many many times I've been to carrier
stores third party stores and bought in
the phone purchase the phone I know it's
been played with the screen guard that's
on if I defaults been taken off there's
been people are just kind of messing
around with the phone well this really
stops that from happening by putting
this sticker so I'm now assure that this
phone has never been touched never been
opened so this phone literally is
brand-new now I believe I'm enough to
cut this open so I'm gonna go ahead and
pull this off real quick and cut this
phone open all right and that seal has
been cut so now we are ready to go we're
gonna go ahead and pull this guy open
here now this box just kind of by
looking at the box to kind of show you
how this is you can see it's Samsung
wait a minutes actually if you can tell
it's a holographic writing which is very
cool kind of shows you the image of the
phone itself just kind of get it has
that seal over here in the back the back
of the box here is gonna have some
information about the phone you know
basically it's saying oh you know it's a
it's a bold new adventure it's basically
kind of giving you some of the the
history of this phone it is a Super
AMOLED screen it is the first Super
AMOLED screen so something I'm very
excited to actually test out finally as
you can see it's HSDPA dual-band 900
2100 which we will find out if that's
going to be the u.s. compatible or not
I know however if you look at the edge
down here it does say that it's
compatible with the 850 to 900 and 1800
and 1900 megahertz bands now reading on
the Samsung website they do note that it
is
compatible with the Australian 3G ban
which is 850 which is also what 18 T is
so this may work with our bands we're
gonna have to find out also as you can
see it's a 3.3 Super AMOLED screen uses
the Samsung intuitive TouchWiz UI and it
has you know the HD video playback and
recording which I'll make sure I take a
a demo video for that it's also a 5
megapixel autofocus camera with the LED
which is very big and that it has the
geo-tagging for the actual pictures
itself now as you can see right here it
has the bottle logo this is the first
one that I've personally used that has
bada built right in it's Samsung's own
custom operating system they built it
right from the ground up which is pretty
daring and I will kind of let you know
how I feel about it as time goes this
phone is also Bluetooth 3.0 which is
very very nice and it's going to do the
Wi-Fi be G and n so let's go ahead and
get to the the bulk here now on top of
the actual phone itself it's kind of
gonna have a little guide that's tiled
getting to know your wave so it's gonna
give you some some basically quick steps
10 things actually to be exact that you
need to know about the wave and they
range from setting up accounts to
putting all the contacts together
whatever it may be
right beneath that we have the phone
which again is the 3.3 Super AMOLED
display as you can see right here I'm
gonna go ahead and tilt this so I can
just get the phone out now as you can
see it's the gray I will put this aside
it's gonna be a cliff here I want to put
this aside real quick we're going to
keep going with the unboxing as you can
see right here if I pull this tab up
we're gonna have inside here it's like
some more documentation so we're gonna
have the actual user manual for the wave
which as you can see here the model
number is also the GTS 8 500 or 8500 for
that matter which nice and thick kind of
get going to give you some instructions
about the phone some settings just like
a camera or another phone for that
matter it's going to give you everything
you need to know about in the user
manual right here we have the battery
which is a 1500 milliamp-hour battery
know if you can see that from right
there
good size the same size as the Evo's
batter however this phone is a smaller
screen it's also the LED screen instead
of that LCD screen so I do think this
would give me better battery life than
the Evo which we all know isn't the
greatest there's also gonna be a set of
headphones in the box to pull these out
real quick as we can get a better idea
of the quality on these headphones it's
gonna be a metal middle casing as you
just heard and there they seem to be
pretty good quality I would definitely
use these test these out and I am
singing a microphone in line as well so
you can talk with these there's also the
phone switch right here next up we're
gonna have the adapter which is gonna be
just the European adapter this is a
uk-based phone however once again it is
compatible with the band's so this is
gonna fit the European outlets or the UK
outlets however that shouldn't be an
issue
because should be able to charge with
this cable right here which is gonna be
the USB cable to the microUSB just does
use the micro USB like a lot of the
phones do now a lot of the HTC handsets
and that sort of thing so compatible in
that sense making sure I didn't miss
anything here and there are a little bit
more documentation things on the box
itself kind of gonna go over some of the
Samsung Apps which I will definitely
touch on when do a software software
overview to actual software overview
videos to kind of give you an intro to
the phone and the bada operating system
itself so let's go ahead and pop the
battery in this guy and power it up go
ahead and pull this down here you can
see there's the Samsung logo with the
camera itself which is the five
megapixel camera with the LED flash
which is not bad we're gonna flip this
guy right over again it has a little
sticker on here that kind of gives us
some of the information about the phone
it is a 1 gigahertz CPU it's actually if
you've kind of been keeping track after
the the latest iPhone announcement it's
actually rumored to be the same exact
core as the new iPhone it's the a8 a4
chip now it's the same core as that
that's what the all these rumors are
saying Samsung actually helped develop
that chip so that's pretty impressive
going to the top here we're gonna have
the USB port so you can actually plug
the phone into your computer or to
charge it sort of in the middle will be
the actual headphone input and then you
can have a speaker on the side now there
are two free buttons actually down here
at the bottom we're gonna have the phone
send in the phone end is also a middle
button for selecting microphone down
here at the bottom I know it's kind of
hard to tell with the angle the volume
rockers are gonna be on the left side of
this phone so as you see you have the
volume up and the volume down and then
the right side it looks like it's a
dedicated camera button on the right
side itself I will definitely
investigate that further that's nice a
lot of phones are kind of lacking that
now which that really goes a long way so
let's go ahead and pop this battery in
now it has a little pry right here which
will actually lift the battery
compartment which is a metal compartment
as you just heard up so I'm gonna go
ahead and pop in the SIM card separately
so I can make sure that it's it's gonna
work off the bat for you guys and then
we'll go from there
I'll be right back in just one second
alright now we're back and I've gone
ahead and popped the SIM card engine you
can see right here which is an 18 T SIM
card I'm gonna slide the battery into
its place also going to go ahead here
and put the battery cover itself back on
which just pops right into place and now
we wait there we go let's go ahead and
pull this screen protector itself off
these are never very fun to actually
take off there are some subjective
covers along the edges here as well for
shipping and that sort of thing make
sure the phone is in pristine condition
when you get it which is great
all right now when the foam boots right
up we have the language selection here
we're on English automatically so I'm
gonna go ahead and leave it there and
I'm gonna go ahead and press the next
button keyboard language same idea I'm
gonna go ahead and press the next button
timezone I'm gonna stay on the New York
Times own I live close to Boston that's
the same exact time zone as New York
once again the next button
dete and Thomas at today's time today's
date that whole sort of thing so the
time is currently 339 which this is
already good to go so we're gonna save
this I starting right up but I can tell
you right off the bat this screen is
amazing I've used the Nexus 1 I've used
the Evo the Nexus One is better than the
Evo this is better than the Nexus One
from what I can tell you right now
though I don't have a widget profile so
just kind of going into the phone yep
the screen absolutely looks amazing it
looks gorgeous we kind of flick back and
forth here we have some sang some apps
Calendar itself this gives me basically
an agreement about the use of these
widgets so we do have the the Android
like screens where I can swipe looks
like I have three screens and I'll
investigate further to see if I can add
more to that
now there's a pulldown bar up here which
this is extremely smart you're gonna
have the ability to turn your Wi-Fi on
or off right here you see you see that
screen now we've just found my home
networks Wi-Fi you also have the ability
to turn the Bluetooth on and off right
from here or put the phone into silent
mode which is your vibrate you can
probably hear that this is very good
these are very good shortcuts I wish
Andrew and I wish other phones will
implement that into their system so we
also have a Google search Google Maps in
the Google Mail icons here there's a
quick manual right on the screen which I
will use that first and I will obviously
move this I believe you just hold and
drag which is exactly what it looks like
we have a keypad for your phone you
actually call a number so there's also a
texting button right here yep the
keyboard itself pops right up
I'm gonna tell you right now the
keyboard is great quality just from
first glance I'm gonna go ahead and go
back when I'm going all the way back to
the home screen I don't want to save
this message we have a contacts tab
which this is will be this where my
contacts will be once I add them to the
phone itself there's also going to be
the messages tab which again is for the
SMS or the text messages now it looks
like I can add widgets to this screen
here by pressing the widget button and
that's exactly what it is I can add a
dual clock it's like you just tap let's
pick a different time zone here let's do
Ottawa and now we have two time zones
exact same time but two time zones going
back into the other widgets we have
anything from wallpapers I can change
the wallpaper directly in this menu from
two birthdays two days to network info
email yell comm which are just
yellowpages.com
they're just an abbreviation the BBC The
Music Store you name it there is there
are some apps again once again this is
running bada which is Samsung's custom
operating system I can tell you right
now this looks very impressive at first
I will definitely put it through its
paces and make sure that you stay tuned
because I'm actually going to be doing a
hardware review an in-depth review of
the hardware itself talking about the
screen the main thing with the screen is
it's once again it's a Super AMOLED
screen but we've never seen it outside
so I'm gonna go ahead and use this
outside and give it some you know in
direct sunlight tests Samsung I said
that they've actually eliminated the
glare and the the loss of the ability to
see your screen when you're outside
however I'm gonna put that to its true
test and let you know how it is I'm also
going to test the battery life pretty
much everything with this phone you name
it and I will make sure that I keep you
updated on it so if you like this video
go and give us a thumbs up and subscribe
if you want to see more because there
are more videos for this phone coming
down the plane this is the Samsung Wave
it's currently a UK phone whatever it is
compatible with bands across the world
you can get this phone at clove Co UK
for about $400 and so far I can tell you
this screen is gorgeous so thanks for
watching everyone and we'll talk to you
