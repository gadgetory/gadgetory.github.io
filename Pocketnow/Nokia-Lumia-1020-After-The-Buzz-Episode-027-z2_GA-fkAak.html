our new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all on to the next
big thing already so let's do something
about it let's kick off the first
smartphone re review of 2014 by taking
another look at the best camera phone of
2013
i'm michael fisher with pocket now this
is the Nokia Lumia 1020 and this is
episode 27 of after the buzz
even before Nokia's acquisition by
Microsoft
the two companies fates were
inextricably intertwined so it's
impossible to talk about how well the
Lumia 1020 is aged without talking about
how well Windows Phone has aged this
part of the story has its ups and downs
and some of which we covered in our
after the buzz for the Lumia 925 on the
downside some features like the social
hubs don't work nearly as well as they
used to thanks to the networks they rely
on having evolved more quickly than
Windows Phone and while the platform's
flat minimalistic interface was still
reasonably fresh when the 1020 launched
back in the summertime it's starting to
feel a little stagnant next to iOS and
Android both of which have seen
significant look-and-feel upgrades in
the time since thankfully Nokia and
Microsoft used that time to improve
other more important aspects of the
software experience the Windows Store
featured 100,000 apps at the time the
Lumia 1020 launched a number which has
since doubled and the revised count
isn't just filler long-awaited titles
like Instagram vine and snapchat have
given Windows Phone more legitimacy
while Nokia's excellent suite of custom
apps have also seen regular updates and
the new Lumia black and GB are three
enhancements have made everything from
multitasking to notifications to the
glance screen just
little more useful well we'd have liked
a few more aesthetic tweaks these
improvements are welcome and they run
very well on the 10 20 updates like
these have also arrived often enough to
make us confident that Nokia isn't just
going to abandon 10 20 users now that
it's no longer the newest to Windows
Phone on the block it says to us that
this flagship was built to last the
hardware says the same thing Taylor
Martin goes into detail on this and his
durability report for the 1020 but it's
enough to say that you should feel quite
comfortable carrying the device without
a case tailors Gorilla Glass 3 shows
some scratches on its top level coating
after six months but our Boston test
device is in near pristine condition
despite never having been given any
protection and despite having been
locked into an out of Nokia's camera
grip more than a few times a case that's
none too gentle on the polycarbonate we
still wish a cyan option was available
in the States but the phone's yellow
color should you opt for it still catch
his eyes on the street and it still
prompts people to ask if it's that Nokia
with the insane camera of which of
course it is
we called the Lumia 1020 s 41 megapixel
camera the best smartphone shooter of
2013 and despite the fact that
competitors have continued upping their
game with enhanced low-light performance
and optical stabilization it's probably
a safe bet that the 1020 s camera will
remain untouchable through much of this
coming year nokia has continued to
enhance its software bringing the smart
cam and pro cam together under one app
and bundling in some automatic shooting
modes to make it a little easier to use
for amateur photographers we've also
seen the addition of RAW format support
for the pros out there and also the fun
Nokia refocus app for those sitting
somewhere in-between the camera isn't
perfect its output is still a little
noisier than it should be it can still
fall victim to a too shaky hand and even
PureView technology has trouble with
very dark situations the camera app
itself is also still slow to open and
slow to save but used with care its
performance in most situations is just
out Stan
and the manual controls are more
intuitive than any other smartphone
camera here's some of the best of what
we've been able to capture with the 1020
over the past few months with the
possible exception of the 808 PureView
it's still the best camera we've ever
used on a mobile phone performance
elsewhere is just what you'd expect from
a well made product just like it was
back in the summer voice quality is
excellent speaker phone is loud the
display vibrant beautiful and almost no
lag has crept into the day-to-day
software experience also in the u.s. the
1020 s exclusive carrier AT&amp;amp;T has given
us nothing but excellent data speeds
over LTE in the Northeast in fact the
only way this phone hasn't aged well
maybe in terms of battery life we've had
inconsistent luck with Windows Phone in
this area and the 1020 is no exception
it's unclear if a particular app is at
fault or if we're just taking too many
photos every day but it's been tough to
get through a full day without the
camera grip and it's additional battery
juice your mileage as always may vary
with the arrival of the monstrous Lumia
1520 which we reviewed not long ago the
1020 is no longer the king of the
Windows Phone Mountain at least in terms
of specs and assuming it's not delayed
by the Microsoft Nokia deal the ten
twenties replacement might arrive
sometime next summer but does that mean
you should hold off on buying the Lumia
1020 if you want a best-in-class camera
experience on your modern smart phone
from what we can see not at all despite
a few hiccups the Windows Phone platform
is as healthy as it's ever been
pure view camera technology is in no
danger of being eclipsed and despite its
legacy internals the 1020 still handles
the day-to-day job of being a mobile
phone with a plum at the price the phone
is going for with a contract we think
smart phone shutter bugs will be very
well served by the Lumia 1020 and we're
happy to continue to recommend it to
Windows Phone buyers everywhere
