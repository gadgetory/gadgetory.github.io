hi everyone this is jenna from pocket
now and today we are going to be doing
the unboxing video for the sprint HTC
touch diamond all right we got our
scissors and I'm going to try and open
this package up takes a little bit bear
with me a little bit and we go oh I'm
excited all right to see this nice all
right let's see let's look at the box
hmm okay does not look like the original
Diamond obviously forgot the the fall
nice pretty okay and we also have the
battery okay
take that out see what else is in here
carrot here is an extra stylus okay and
we have the power adapter and that's
also part of the adapter that plugs into
the outlet and this is the little USB
computer and we got the standard headset
wired then we have a case and then let's
see what else is in the box product
manual okay now we're going to try and
put the battery in for this one let's
see it's a little dark you know I'm kind
of using a mediocre people okay we're
going to put this battery in it's a 1350
milliamp hour battery it's supposed to
list I guess he said it's going to last
about four hours of talk time but we'll
see on our tests there you go we're
going to turn okay and while that's
turning on we're going to look at the
rest of the other stuff okay but see
this is the product manual pretty
standard stuff here folks just there you
go getting started set up all sorts of
stuff okay I don't see you need discs
those are disk somewhere yes we do have
a disc great perfect okay we're going to
put that away look there goes our phones
turned on okay we're going to put that
away and then obviously we have the
case for it let's see if it's made out
of leather nope this one's actually made
out of some neoprene fiber which is
weird because usually you see leather
but um as you can see if it's pretty
well great okay now we're just going to
quickly open everything else standard
wired headset nothing special same thing
came with my HTC mogul okay and earbuds
okay now we have the USB adapter okay
that's cool all right and we got the
main outlet adapter okay also and of
course like all the other windows mobile
pcs this is going to come with an extra
stylus just in case you ever lose the
style is that you have this one's
actually nice because it is a magnetic
stylist so you won't really lose it and
finally we have the wire that goes into
the charger and let that got ourselves
the unboxing stay tuned for the rest of
the review
