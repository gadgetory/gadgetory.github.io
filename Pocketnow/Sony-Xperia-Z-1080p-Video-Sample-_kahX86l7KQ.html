pocketnow.com and we are here with the
Xperia Z testing the 1080p video quality
we hear over a little stream which is
actually from flowing much quicker than
it usually does so hopefully you can
hear the water and you might be able to
hear some birds we here at a part and
I'm just testing how well this pans and
how well it stabilizes there's some
stabilization software that should keep
the video pretty still but from what
I've been seeing in some of the video
quality you probably see some jittery
jumping around when you span and the
other thing I want to test let's come
out here to where where where it's a
little bit brighter we're going to test
pointing up at the sky and seeing how
well it can readjust for the exposure
back down to something a little dark so
we'll try that a couple times come back
down over here to where it start let's
try it over here actually so it's
brighter up in here darker in here it
seems to adjust pretty quickly maybe a
little lag time they're not too much
latency so it's nothing to worry about
but so far so good on the 1080p
everything seems crisp and sharp maybe a
little under exposed or maybe a little
under saturated excuse me so there you
have it this has been a 1080p sample
with the Sony Xperia Z stay tuned for
more xperia z coverage of pocketnow.com
and subscribe to the channel I'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
