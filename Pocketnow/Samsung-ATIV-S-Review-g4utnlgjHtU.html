the aluminum silver Samsung ativ s is
all business but is it too button-down
to have a little fun let's find out I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is the Samsung ativ s full review
the atif s shares some commonalities
with many of its Windows Phone
competitors it's powered by a dual-core
1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm s4 backed up by a
gig of ram and it packs an 8 megapixel
camera and either 16 or 32 gigs of
on-board storage but the similarities
stop there and then some fairly major
ways unlike the HTC Windows Phone 8x and
the Nokia Lumia 920 the atif s features
expandable memory via micro SDXC and a
user-accessible 2300 milliamp hour
battery and it's bright four-point eight
inch 306 PPI Super AMOLED display
familiar to anyone who's seen a Galaxy
s3 is the biggest available in the
Windows Phone 8 space the screens not
the only thing that's familiar about the
atif s the chassis bears a visual
signature that is vintage Samsung
looking like an updated Galaxy s2 or
maybe a squared off galaxy s3 love it or
hate it the home button is back again
the phone is light and 135 grams and
it's slim at eight point seven
millimeters it feels nice in the hand if
a little slippery
Samsung has really mastered the art of
faux aluminium with the hairline
metallic finish on the back which looks
incredible in person this isn't a phone
that'll turn a lot of heads at the club
but it'll definitely earn you some
points in the boardroom the atif s runs
Windows Phone 8 and our unit packs a
newer version of the OS that allows
Wi-Fi to remain on when the device is
locked and also allows for text replies
to rejected voice calls both welcome
improvements the achieve s Hardware runs
the OS as smoothly as you'd expect and
it really pops on this big display
especially with the inclusion of more
accent color in Windows Phone 8
in our testing the large screen has led
to pure typos on the commensurately
larger keyboard and visually the
platform scales nicely to this larger
scale especially with the new smaller
tile sizes we only encountered one real
bug auto-brightness
on this device is awful always setting
the wrong levels and always lagging
behind changing conditions but that's
easily fixable with an update samsung
has its own version of the Windows Phone
8 store where its own section called
Samsung's own where you can download
Samsung exclusive apps much like on a
Nokia device most of them come
pre-installed on the ateam s Samsung's
apps aren't as numerous or useful as
Nokia's but we like them but without a
larger more robust assortment of apps
ideally with some enhanced camera
features and some navigation options
Samsung's collection continues to lag
behind
Nokia's we tested the ax T of s on
t-mobile USA in the Greater Boston area
colors said we sounded fine in normal
mode with a slight but manageable reverb
when switching to speakerphone and
that's pretty normal
unfortunately as on most smartphones
though the speakerphone is capable of
delivering ear-splitting ringtones and
media volume it's limited to perhaps
half intensity on voice calls that's
annoying data speeds over t-mobile's
network were fairly good when we were in
an HSPA coverage area averaging about 7
megabits per second down and about 3 up
we're still conducting battery life
testing see those results on our full
written review at pocketnow.com but as
of the recording of this video
performance looks promising it took
approximately nine hours of moderate use
to reach the 25% mark which is pretty
good the 8 megapixel camera seems to
cope adequately with most lighting
situations and there's a fair amount of
tweaking you can do in the software to
either get a great shot or just have
some fun with filters shots came out
sharp and richly colored for the most
part and they look great on the achieves
Super AMOLED display video is acceptable
though autofocus is a little slow
compared to other devices the atif S
delivers a very good Windows Phone 8
experience in all while its physical
design is
conservative and not as flashy as the
Nokia's and HTC's it packs the huge
advantage of both a removable battery
and expandable memory something you have
to go into the mid-range for to find on
the other brands in addition there's
that huge display a solid camera and a
good feel in the hand and it's light and
thin enough to disappear in a pocket
we wish Samsung had more custom software
available but we also think fires will
be quite satisfied with this device the
unique features of the achieve s
combined with its many pluses to earn
this device an 8.5 out of 10 everyone
