thanks to some friends overseas we've
managed to get our hands on the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus let's open this thing up
and see what's inside alright so here we
go with a box that the Galaxy Nexus
comes in this is the hspa+ version not
the US LTE version so we had to get this
sent over from one of our friends in the
United Kingdom big thumbs up for having
friends overseas so looking at the box
we first have the device with the very
simple branding down at the bottom that
says Galaxy Nexus looking on the side we
see a side view of the box a little bit
of a postal service handling proof right
there a seal we've got some bar codes
and looks like a serial number side of
the box shows the side of the phone
which is very very elegant up at the top
nothing over on the back just simple
branding that says google samsung and
then has some information let's go ahead
and crack the seal and see what we've
got this is a liftoff box the whole top
just lifts off there's the phone with a
nice temporary screen protector on the
front and the back we're going to set
that aside just for a moment you'll
notice inside the box you've got some
very nice padding in here with Andy to
Android saying google.com / Nexus we
lift out the middle part nothing inside
that just the phone holder it's l will
also set that aside we have the Quick
Start Guide and the model number GT dash
I believe that's i9250 a warranty
information card the battery and let's
check this there has been some some
debate over what this is this is in fact
a 1750 milliamp hour battery there was
some discrepancy on the initial specs
page the LTE version is supposed to be a
1850
the gsm version a little bit less than
that next we've got some like very
elegant-looking headphones and headsets
Samsung branded with squishies no
magnetic attachment like we've seen on
some of the htc's very nice very elegant
set that aside we also have the micro
USB cable which we get the ends free for
you here one is just a regular one and
then this other one is a little bit
bigger than what we've come to expect
from Samsung but still just standard has
some Flair two edges so that's really
cool down in the bottom we have our wall
wart now this is kind of interesting or
maybe it's not it looked like those were
some us prongs that could fold out but
this adapter is definitely the UK
version with the UK prongs that you can
simply slide in there on it just has the
USB port so any USB port is going to be
able to charge this if you have one in
the US and need to to charge up anything
else that you already have will be able
to handle that and it looks like that is
the entire contents of the box nothing
hiding down there so there you go the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus unboxed in our next
video we're going to show you a little
bit more about the hardware alright so
we just unbox the Galaxy Nexus before
it's even available in the United States
if you like that kind of stuff make sure
you give the video a big thumbs up but
we've got lots more to show you so make
sure you subscribe to the video channel
so you can see the video that's up next
which is the hardware walk around and
after that we're going to do a first
boot so you can see everything that's in
there will even show you if it works on
t-mobile's hspa+ network you don't want
to miss that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
