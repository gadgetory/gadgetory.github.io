lineup has set the bar over the last
couple of years when it comes to android
and one of the most expected bones of
the year is the nexus 5 that we still
don't see except for leaks so I'm hi
Mary Vera this is pocket now and these
are a top 5 predictions what to expect
for the nexus line up hopefully this
week of there is an event or not number
five is a nexus 4 with LTE and no you're
not in the wrong video sadly there's one
of the biggest reports out there
apparently the device will remain with
us for another year with a couple of
enhancements like an LTE radio being
enabled this time we're in the past you
had to hack it though we still don't
know what to expect of this phone mainly
because if this phone is still out there
and this phone will be the budget Nexus
device then can we get a guarantee that
the nexus 5 will retain that amazing
price tag with the amazing
specifications that we're all dreaming
about so yeah the nexus 4 might remain
for another year but hey if you don't
hear this announced will be happy to be
wrong with this one number four is a new
Nexus 10 but take this one with a grain
of salt as this probably one of the
worst leaked tablets ever all we have is
one render of an assume a tablet that
pass through so many hands with
Photoshop that we really can't tell what
it was originally so we're not really
sure if this is ever gonna happen
probably the Nexus 10 could stay around
with another year because it still works
fine and it's got great resolution
pretty much not every other tablet out
there has it so we do see this current
Nexus tend to be kind of future proof to
stay for another year so again hopefully
we will be getting a portrait type
assume a nexus 10 that we're not sure if
it will happen this year at least number
three is Android 4.4 KitKat and yes this
is a minor point upgrade we're not
really expecting many features or
enhancements but these are kind of
significant specially in the Google
Wallet sector and aside from meerkat
support but probably one of the biggest
deals is that apparently the Android
launcher will now be available to
everybody meaning you don't have to buy
a Nexus device to get the google nexus
experience you don't have to buy a Nexus
device to get stock Android though
you'll probably have to do so to get
Android updates in the future but still
makes you wonder what will happen to
these google edition phones but if you
could get android 4.4 s launcher to be
working on you
galaxynote3 and still get S Pen features
to work because this is just a launcher
this is going to really be awesome so
stay tuned for that one number two is
the google nexus 5 and this is probably
one of the biggest most expected phones
of the year and obviously the most
leaked this well the reason why is
because this phone is based on the LG g2
those of us that have used this phone
know exactly how powerful and efficient
the phone is I mean pretty much
everything about the g2 is awesome from
the optical image stabilization to the
Snapdragon 800 processor to the amazing
battery life so the great display and
we're expecting most of these features
to make it to the Nexus 5 4 350 bucks
apiece 16 gigs or 32 gigs is going to be
the option hopefully and we are just
expecting for this phone to come out so
please google just release the phone
silently i don't care just take our
money and finally the top number one
prediction for what will happen to the
google nexus lineup is one more thing
and yes one more thing does fit into
this google nexus lineup and the reason
why is because Siddhartha has been kind
of famous for surprising us we were not
expecting the chromecast in their Nexus
event in the past and we got the
chromecast and it's a 35 buck awesome
feature it works beautifully with just
about any device that you have out there
so we are expecting something something
new that will make these Google devices
work or play better together as we
currently see with Apple devices that we
can really see on Android we are hoping
for android 4.4 bring some enhancements
and hopefully there is some hardware out
there that will take advantage of this
so that leave you to the question of the
day what are your predictions for this
top 5 what are your predictions for the
nexus lineup what do you think will be
that one more thing in my particular
case I do expect enhancements to the
chromecast are probably a new chromecast
something even bigger and better and
hopefully focus on gaming but leave us a
comment down below were you expecting
thats it for our top 5 Nexus line of
prediction hopefully we will be getting
something announced this week and you
can bet we will have an editorial round
table whenever that happens so stay
