expect the future pixel devices iphone
something customers have begun to
complain about wireless connectivity
make TNT seems to be on spot to make 5g
a thing of the near future I'm high
metal iveta and for those of you that
don't like my obsession with Voltron you
better catch up on Netflix this is par
get out daily the official news today
begin with deals those of you in the
market for either the galaxy s7 or
galaxy s7 edge you might want to hit
best buy as a the galaxy s7 is currently
for three hundred and seventy dollars
galaxy s7 edge for 430 what's the catch
they're both refurbished but i think the
refurbished warranty provided by best
buy is actually quite compelling i would
highly suggest you give a try other
official news come from AT&amp;amp;T and
actually we're not going to rant about a
carrier this time AT&amp;amp;T has just tease
their new project air giga the whole
concept here is that they're using some
very interesting plastic antennas on the
current power lines to be able to deploy
5g connectivity and this is something
completely new it goes beyond the simple
idea of using cell phone towers we
cannot wait to see it in action though
we're not exactly sure how long it'll
take fine let's begin ranting not
necessarily about AT&amp;amp;T let's talk about
the iphone 7 and the fact that there is
a video and there are some complaints
already of iphone sevens on AT&amp;amp;T having
trouble connecting and by trouble
connecting i'm not saying retain
connectivity i mean log on to the
network from the start restart the phone
or go from airplane mode to switching it
off and people have trouble connecting
on the iphone 7 particularly on AT&amp;amp;T now
this could just be a sporadic case we
will follow up as soon as we learn more
now as will to spotlight over to google
just this expected set your calendars
for october for as the company has
already begun teasing an event where we
should expect the next pixel smartphones
or nexus smartphones whatever they're
going to be called and the most
interesting part is not just a teaser
but the fact that google is actually
marketing this google marketing those
things just never happened together but
google has begun doing so it seems the
company finally wants to end it stays
where people just don't care about its
phones
and finally the very interesting news
today actually have to do with these
pixel smartphones we get the first leaks
of both devices the pixel and the pixel
XL in white and even though these phones
are unapologetically blah from
everything from the white screen to the
white back probably the most interesting
part about these leaks is that we see
those camera holes at the back being
very small that could just mean that
these are dummies and these are just
probably pre-production you know
startups it's not necessarily the fact
that these are the final phones and we
cannot wait to see what we get but it
does lead me to the question of the day
I find these phones to be ugly but what
do you think do you consider these pixel
phones to look compelling to you because
uh hey again taste may matter we've seen
the comments so far not very many people
are liking them we would love to know
