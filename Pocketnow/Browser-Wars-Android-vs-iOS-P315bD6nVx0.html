since the last time we looked at web
browsers specifically so how do they
compare now I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and these are the browser Wars Android
versus iOS for many of us web browsing
is the heart and soul of our mobile
usage browsing web pages from a coffee
shop on your phone or buying something
from Amazon while waiting in line these
things to find what makes modern smart
phones so different from their ancestors
mobile browsing today is not all that
bad enjoyable and efficient but how does
mobile browsing compare between two
opposing platforms Android and iOS third
party web browsers are available by the
dozens and many of the same browsers are
available on both platforms Opera
Dolphin and Chrome just to name a few
rather than getting caught up on the
third party discussion we'll stick to
stock browsers and technically Android
phones often come with multiple stock
browsers the LG g3 for example comes
with two browsers out of the box
LG's custom browser and chrome but since
chrome is now the default Android
browser used on virtually every Android
phone who use it for the basis of our
comparison in other words this is Safari
versus Chrome let's see how they compare
we could compare page load times and
benchmarks like the SunSpider javascript
test but those things are more dependent
upon hardware meaning the results will
vary from phone to phone and those
results are inconclusive and useless
anyway since Safari and Chrome used
different JavaScript engines so a simple
feature comparison makes the most since
Safari appears rather feature light the
address bar has only four functions Omni
search web address input refresh and
toggle reader mode when applicable and
the bottom navigation bar has only five
buttons back forward share bookmarks and
tab immediately it's easy to see chrome
on Android has a considerable amount of
additional features unlike Safari there
is no bottom navigation bar
it only has a slim address bar at the
top with a button for refresh tabs and a
Settings button which reveals a long
list of options new tab new incognito
tab bookmarks other devices so you can
see which tabs are currently open on
your other devices running Chrome
history share and morph
there is also a request
subtitle which will try to override
mobile websites to provide a desktop
like browsing experience something which
can't currently be done using Safari and
other features like the print button
incognito mode or even find in page are
actually available in Safari though not
so out in the open to print from Safari
simply hit the share button and select
the print button and to enter private
browsing mode tap the tabs button and
select the discreet private button in
the bottom left corner searching a given
page for a word is far less intuitive
once the page has loaded tap the address
bar and start typing the word or phrase
you're searching for below the suggested
searches bookmarks and previously
visited pages the on this page section
appears tapping that will give you the
on page results between Chrome and
Safari tab switching is almost identical
tap the tabs button lint scroll
vertically through all open tabs and
slide left to right to close any tab the
only difference is how easy chrome makes
it to close all tabs in the press of a
button
this requires sliding each tab away in
Safari the other major difference is the
ability to share a web page to almost
any installed application using Chrome
on Android this is a core function of
Android not Chrome specifically simply
hit the Settings button and select share
you're immediately met with all
compatible applications which you can
share to this makes it extra easy to
save a webpage to pocket or Evernote to
share to your third-party Twitter client
or even Google+ in Safari the share
function is limited to services
handpicked by Apple airdrop messages
mail Twitter or Facebook all through
official clients only you can also
bookmark add to a reading list add to
homescreen copy or print for instance to
share a page to pocket you'll have to
copy the link close out of Safari open
pocket and paste the link to save it or
you could create a bookmarklet a short
script that works like a bookmark but
bookmarklets are very limited in
functionality the upshot is that
third-party sharing support will be
coming in iOS 8 and thusly will be
available in Safari the ability to
request desktop mode is coming as well
still we actually enjoy browsing from
Safari almost as much as Chrome in
Safari the address bar and bottom
navigation bar hide away as soon as you
begin scrolling and they reappear if you
scroll upwards rotating to landscape
also reveals a completely full screen
mode and Chrome doesn't come with a
reader mode either
safari gives you a text-only view for
more efficient reading frankly both
browsers are great
of course they both have advantages and
disadvantages Chrome's tab sync for
instance is more reliable and cross
platform and you can seamlessly jump
between regular and incognito browsing
and Chrome a feature Safari users won't
get until iOS 8
but Safari is a more lightweight
experience with less clutter and a built
in read later mode if we had to choose
one over the other it would certainly be
chrome on Android simply for its
extensive sharing options desktop mode
and more intuitive navigation but Safari
on iOS isn't far behind at all we feel
iOS 8 will put the 2 on fairly even
ground folks thanks for watching if you

the channel stay tuned for more browser
Wars in the future and of course follow
us around the web Twitter Facebook and
Google+ at pocket now I'm Taylor Martin
