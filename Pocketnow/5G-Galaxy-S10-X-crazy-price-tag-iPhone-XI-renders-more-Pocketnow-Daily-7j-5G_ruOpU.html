specifications for the 5g galaxy s 10x
and a very hefty price tag we get more
credible renders of the triple cameras
of the iPhone 11 could we call and if
you have a galaxy s 9 or galaxy s 9 +
finally believe it or not Android Pi is
rolling out I'm high memory vana and you
know for as much as the Oh makes fun of
me for not having great jokes on the
daily guess how many jokes he's had in
the past week none this is PocketNow
daily sponsored by swap ah the official
news today begin with deals both on
Amazon and on bnh you guys know how much
I love the 11 inch iPad pro and if
you're in the market for either model
they're currently $100 off and there are
some tax credit benefits also available
in cases like bnh or free shipping for
example you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about the
Motorola RAZR lineup yes I know that's
one of the most iconic cell phones ever
but we hear that there is something
coming back to Verizon that it's going
to be a limited edition that could cost
up to $1500 and we're just trying to
understand when they rumor a foldable
device what we're getting here is it
truly a clamshell cell phone from back
in the day or what the plans are stay
tuned and for those of you that are
rocking a samsung galaxy s 9 RS 9 + yes
Android Pi and the one UI has finally
rolled out officially in the United
States I actually can't wait to fly back
and just try it out on my own
cuz I I owe you and after the Buzz
episode wait for it but it definitely
has everything to do with the software
update as a Samsung finally pushes it
out before they're unpacked and before
we talk more galaxy how about if we talk
of iPhone 11 we've got some renders from
the typical sources that have proven to
be quite credible but I think we're kind
of too early for this I'm gonna call
them a concept that you can let me know
in the comments what you think but we
see the camera hump in the middle with
the triple cameras think about it as
Apple has never done a camera in the
middle so that's the reason why I don't
believe these renders are true and yet
to Cupertino has a price that's in the
past so let us know what you think about
them I
man it looks like an iPhone 10 with a
hump in the middle that's pretty much it
for me
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10
X and don't quote me on that X they used
it
Samsung has shown as ugly names in the
past but their rumor that the X has to
do with the 10th anniversary of the
galaxy s 10 I believe it's just probably
a codename but anyways 1,400 to 1,500
dollars Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 all the
RAM storage and the rest of the
specifications you want and we here 5g
capabilities it's just you know the
price tag is kind of crazy let us know
in the comments down below I mean what
do you think the rumors are that it
could be a Kerela exclusive initially
but would you be willing to pay that
amount for a limited edition phone I
mean I love the way oneplus does it 700
bucks and you get a lot of bells and
whistles why charge more than that and
folks before we end this video we would
love to thank our sponsor swap before
making today's content possible we are
getting close to the launch of the
Galaxy S ten we're expecting it to be a
huge upgrade so repair your wallet by
selling your old Samsung phone for the
most money possible on swap off follow
