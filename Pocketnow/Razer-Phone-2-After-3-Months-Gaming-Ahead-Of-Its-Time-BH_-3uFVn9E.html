months on and off with the razor phone -
and in that time I've learned that this
phone is actually one of the coolest
products I've used the only reason why I
held off on the full review is because
if this is marketed as a gaming phone
I need the accessory that would turn
this into the ideal gaming phone for me
and it's finally here
I'm hey I'm gonna leave it up with
pocket now when this is my long-term
review of the razor phone - along with
the rise of mobile controller I was most
probably a gamer before many of you
starting with the 8-bit Nintendo and
then the Super Nintendo and then I had a
brief time as a PC gamer but once I
became an adult and travel became part
of my life it was really pointless for
me to invest in a gaming console up
until the Nintendo switch changed that I
wish I would have said until smartphones
changed everything because even if
mobile games have existed for years I've
always found these lacking way behind
even portable consoles and also are I
despise playing games with a touchscreen
this is one of the reasons why the razor
phone - and the rise you mobile
controller were so important to me
controllers have existed for Android for
the longest time and they've never been
great and Razer is famous for their
controllers we'll get to that soon let
me begin this video by telling you what
I like about this phone the hardware on
this device is just epic this is like a
muscle car that uses its imposing size
and looks to steer heads it's large and
it's in charge from the black finish to
its boxy design - its aluminium trim -
its chroma based Razer logo at the back
this phone is stunning and sure the
sharp corners aren't pense friendly or
even ergonomic in the hand but the great
weight distribution has just made me not
care there are key essentials to make
this phone easier to game with like the
volley
buttons placed in the center to avoid
accidental presses and I know that some
people complain about the placement of
the fingerprint scanner I'm right-handed
so I like where it is I have nothing to
complain about but I don't speak for
everyone another thing that's great
about this device is its display this is
probably one of the most advanced LCDs
in the market at five point seven inches
quad HD resolution and a hundred and
twenty Hertz and refresh rate it is a
true sight to see it is no longer the
dim panel of its predecessor now at 645
nits and regardless of it being an LCD
colors are vibrant this is one of the
displays that I've enjoyed using most
and don't even get me started about
these speakers they are now I be 67
water and dust resistance as the rest of
the chassis and the loudest and riches
that I've heard on a phone and yes there
is also Dolby Atmos support supposed to
have the only complaint that I have what
the speakers is that they can be dust
magnets and my unit came with some
crackling noises whenever you maxed
volume out but that's gone away after
some software updates and sure content
consumption would be perfect if there
was a headphone jack and there is all
the real estate here for that still I
highly recommend that you listen in to
these Razer hammerhead active
noise-cancelling headphones they're
powered through USB C and they're
actually really good also in gaming
fashion these internals are solid thanks
to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 8 gigs of
ram 64 gigs of expandable storage a 4000
milliamp hour battery quick charge for
plus supports Qi wireless charging and
one of the coolest wireless charger
accessories in the market though I
highly recommend you buy this one
instead of others as this phone has
issues connecting with other wireless
chargers given the placement of where
the coil is that being said this phone
nails 2 essentials that I care about
there are performance and battery life I
have yet to see this phone bogged down
it never heats up and this battery lasts
all day and then some if I were ever in
the need to be with a phone for more
than one
day without a charger this would be the
phone that I'd bring but as with
everything there is no such thing as a
perfect product let me begin telling you
where I'm mixed about when it comes to
this phone and it starts with the
software sure I love that there's Nova
prime installed by the fault and that
you have so much customization options
and that this user interface feels
buttery smooth and looks futuristic
given razor skin I just can't understand
why it's still running Android Oreo nor
than three months later and second let's
talk about the state of gaming phones
and Android razor goes as far as to
include a cortex app to boost
performance whenever you're playing
games that is great it is fantastic the
problem is when I thought that I would
be playing fortnight and pub G with my
Ryu mobile controller and just
completely leaving my Nintendo switch
behind that didn't necessarily happen
and this is not razors fault let me be
clear this is an Android and also a
games problem as the controller doesn't
work with all games and sometimes it
doesn't even work well with certain
games because these weren't designed to
be used with a mobile controller they
were designed to be used with the screen
and sure I could also stop complaining
and play fortnight on the screen but
anybody that knows how to play fortnight
knows that the only way to take that
game seriously is with either a
controller or a keyboard and mouse
there's a full list of games that are
supported by the Ryder mobile controller
and I do hope that the Bliss grows
because in Razer fashion this controller
feels fantastic the tactility of the
buttons and the arrangement is just
great
unless but not least let's talk about
the camera I'm sure that most of you
were expecting for me to bash it because
most people complained about it but I'm
happy to report that the reason why I
mixed this because this has been a work
in progress since launch I've received
two software updates that have been
proved the experience dramatically as
such photography during the day is
vibrant with good color saturation and
detail all par for the course with most
devices today low-light has seemed some
significant improvements and I mean
major what was before a mess full of
grain and previous builds as well
sharpened and decent if you can keep
your hands
as for portrait mode I will say that I
am impressed some of the photos come
softer than I'd like and the crop is
aggressive but regardless the results
are really good they're very natural I
just wish that I could say the same
about selfie portraits but I have to
admit the regular selfies are good now
video recording is interesting it's good
and there is some stabilization here but
at a time when most companies play with
both oh is an EIS this phone feels like
if it lags behind on the primary shooter
something that I find completely ironic
as the selfie shooter does offer
noticeable stabilization without the
hardware I do hope that the
stabilization issues on the primary
shooter are a problem with my unit
because there is OIS in the hardware to
conclude I'm not sure if you've noticed
but there is no third segment I'm not
including things that I don't like about
this phone and this is actually a first
I have nothing major to complain about
what the razor phone - and the things
that I have are things that are fixable
with software and if you noticed the
company has proven that it can improve
camera performance over time and then
once it gets Android Pi my complaints
about it lagging behind and updates are
gone and then the last premise left is
the state of android for gamers the
razor phone one created the category and
the razor phone - is taking it a step
ahead but it still feels like if it's
ahead of its time I do feel that Android
needs to grow up to embrace gamers and
that we need better ways to control
these games that is not just the display
that is the only way that I feel that
people will take a phone seriously for
this task and not rely on a more robust
player like the Nintendo switch which
has taken the world by storm
the original razor phone created a
market that's now followed by a shoes
Nubia and others this razor phone - only
solidifies the belief in the concept and
now we just need for Google and
developers to step it up while that
happens I will tell you this much this
phone doesn't need to be a gaming phone
to be a great device if you want to
slash that I will admit that I have
enjoyed my experience with the razor
phone too
and I do highly recommend it but what
about you let us know what you think
about the razor phone - and also the
state of gamers and Android gaming and
