iphone 6 launch date more Galaxy alpha
League show us just how much this device
looks like the iPhone and what is going
to happen with the google play edition
phones I'm high netting that I and
please tell your lady friend that not
all men were created equal some of us
are worse actually this is parking out
daily the official news today are about
smartwatches especially the original
pebble those of you that were wondering
if this product was dead that's actually
far from true the company has just
launched it a new limited edition
colours that are almost gender specific
but the colors are there they're
available they'll cost you the same
hundred fifty dollars and even though
it's a hard sell for plastic pebble
whenever you have the android wear
offerings plus you know the pebble steel
hey you know that makes a good gift for
kid else how about some motor role of
rumors we've got to today number one
let's talk about the future Moto G we
already know that the phone is
apparently going to be very similar to
the previous model but it turns out that
apparently it's going to grow in size
it's going to be a 5-inch display
compared to the previous one but even
more interesting is that we have new
listings for a motorola varieties and
device and the interesting news here is
that when you start looking into the
details of what phone this is this is
the moto x plus one so hopefully this is
not going to be a verizon exclusive now
let's talk about apple and specifically
the iphone 6 if you're wondering when
the event is happening some credible
sources are already shining in
apparently it'll happen on September 9th
as it historically has on early
September and then you'll be getting a
ten days later as it historically has
happened with the iphone 5s iPhone 5c
and the iphone 5 as well this source
does have a really good track record so
we can assume that this will be true but
it's really hard to predict that we are
getting both iphones at the same time
now how about the Samsung Galaxy alpha
you're wondering if the stone is coming
to the United States it will we've got
some leaked code names of everything we
can't expect from the codes and what
carriers are being supported link to the
description but even more interesting is
that my God look at the league photos of
this phone if you look at it from the
side it is extremely hard to tell it
apart from an iphone 5s
yes Samsung is probably looking for
another lawsuit though we can't deny
that even though the phone is probably
going to be more mid-ranger it's really
not badly designed it looks really good
reminds me of the Lumia 925 and finally
for the interesting and the sort of the
supporting news of the day if you were
interested in getting the galaxy s4
Google Play edition which we doubt it's
no longer on the list and no the galaxy
s5 did not switch for it it's not
available all options you have right now
are the Moto G and the HTC One m8 both
great options but we keep losing phones
and tablets that are Google Play edition
products that are no longer there we
don't get any replacements and it seems
that google is killing everything in
order to prepare for whatever android
silver is going to be or whatever the
nexus 6 is going to be but that leads me
to the question of the day what do you
think happened to these google play
edition products do you think that
Google is just ditching them and you
know they're just selling whatever stock
they have left because in my particular
case I do feel that the google play
edition concept failed not because it
was bad but because it was crazy
expensive it just didn't make sense for
you to pay so much money for a product
you could pretty much get on the Nexus 5
for half the price but leave us a
comment down below what do you think
frenzy us you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is filming she follow was on
 out comments a sharp change of
channel as well he'll also follow me on
twitter hind underscored iveta please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am high in that way
better thank you very much for watching
we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
