pocket now come and this is our full
review of the iPad Mini let's get to it
Apple doesn't want you to think of the
iPad Mini as a 7-inch tablet they want
you to think of it as a smaller lighter
iPad it's a subtle nuance but helps to
explain the price tag of the iPad Mini
which is far above its closest
competitor the Nexus 7 we'll talk more
about pricing later let's take a closer
look at the iPad minis Hardware the
build quality on the iPad Mini is very
very high like the full sized iPad the
iPad Mini is made from glass and metal
but on the Mini the use of these
materials is much more striking because
of its impossibly light weight an
incredibly thin profile we're so used to
the to heavy weight on the nine point
seven inch iPad that the iPad Mini feels
like the opposite extreme our review
unit was black which takes a lot of cues
from the black iphone 5 in terms of the
gunmetal backing and shiny beveled edge
the white model like the white iPhone 5
has silver metal on the back and a
chrome beveled edge if you want to hide
fingerprints you should definitely go
with the white in hand the iPad Mini is
effortless to hold it just 308 grams and
seven point two millimeters in depth
which is thinner than any smartphone
we've ever tested when you pick up the
mini after not using it for a while it's
cool to the touch like the iPhone 5 it's
wider than the Nexus 7 making it a
little bit difficult to hold if you're
wrapping your fingers around the edge
with one hand the extra width also means
that unlike the Nexus 7 the iPad Mini
doesn't really fit into a pant pocket or
a jacket pocket but that extra width
provides a lot more screen than on the
Nexus 7 but it also means that the
bezels are super thin and a little bit
too thin to hold unless you have really
small fingers fortunately Apple has
employed finger rejection software to
ignore presses occurring along the side
bezels it worked quite well we recently
did a nexus 7 vs. iPad Mini comparison
and we recommend that you go back and
watch that video if you're comparing
both let's talk more about the screen at
7.9 inches in 1024 by 768 resolution
the iPad Mini has the same resolution as
the iPad 2 but because the display is
smaller the pixels are slightly smaller
as well lending to a higher PPI of 162
versus 131 on the iPad 2 comparatively
the Nexus 7
with its 1280 by 800 7-inch screen has a
ppi of 215 again if you're staying below
that 300 PPI range you're going to be
able to see pixels no matter what if
you're coming from the iPad 3 or 4 which
has the Retina display you'll absolutely
notice the difference as up-close
text and graphics appear pixelated but
if you hold the Mini at a bit less than
arm's length away from your eyes you
really don't notice the lower resolution
this is the compromise you'll have to
make if you're sensitive about low
resolution screens it's not a
deal-breaker but definitely something to
consider we should also note that
because the iPad Mini has a 4 by 3
aspect ratio display you get black bars
whenever watching video filmed in 16 by
9 this is something that I pet owners
have probably gotten used to by now save
for the resolution the iPad minis
displays terrific providing fantastic
color saturation and contrast that Apple
mobile device displays are known for
viewing angles are also quite good now
let's talk about specs the iPad Mini
essentially is the same internals as the
iPad 2 and it has a dual core a5 chip
with 512 megabytes of RAM this is a bit
of a downgrade from the latest iPad 4
which has double the RAM and the new a6
X CPU however with far fewer pixels to
push the iPad Mini doesn't need such
brawny hardware which can also
compromise battery life
we found performance to be spirited with
snappy app load times and smooth web
browsing performance gaming too looked
great on the iPad Mini except when
pushed to the edge with some high FPS
titles that would cause the game to drop
some frames and experience lag but for
most games the iPad Mini can keep up
just fine and in fact we found that the
gaming experience on the Mini to be
better and more natural than the nine
point seven inch iPad thanks to the
minis lighter weight the cameras have
been upgraded on the iPad Mini and more
quite impressed the camera on the rear
is a similar camera to what is found on
the eye
four and the resulting five megapixel
pictures are actually quite good with
great low-light and macro performance
the camera on the front is capable of
recording 720p video which made FaceTime
calls look better it's also great in the
light now let's talk about software
perhaps the most compelling reason to
get the iPad Mini is not because of its
hardware but because of its app
selection while we continue to be bored
of iOS we're not bored of the endless
selection of high quality tablet apps
that let just look just fine on the
iPads smaller display Android fans might
be tired of hearing about this app
selection thing but it makes a huge
difference in the user experience
there's an iPad app for just about
everything the Android tablet app story
is still a mess now on to some test
notes Wi-Fi performance on the iPad Mini
was slightly above average in terms of
signal strength providing an extra bar
of coverage when in the outer limit of a
Wi-Fi connection typing on the iPad Mini
in portrait is very usable we've been
waiting for better portrait typing on
the iPad Mini for quite some time
and while the split keyboard option on
the 9.7 inch model makes it easier
typing on the iPad Mini in portrait is
like using a big smart phone it's much
more natural and typing in landscape is
also quite comfortable
the new smart coverage is still too
expensive 39 bucks lacks the metal edge
of the nine point seven inch Smart Cover
it also has two folds instead of three
surely doesn't make a difference it
works quite well and provides a good
viewing angle when watching video and is
sturdy enough to stay in place when
using it to browse the web on a table
top battery life on the iPad Mini is
impressive in our testing it lasted
around 10 hours of mixed usage and since
most people will use their iPad Mini for
just a couple of hours per day you might
not need to charge the mini but once
every week or so as far as charging goes
we found the iPad 3 to take entirely too
long to charge requiring a full 7 hours
to go from 0 to 100%
the iPad Mini obviously has a smaller
battery and interestingly comes with the
iPhones 5 watt charger using that the
mini powers up in about 3.5 hours what
happens if you use the 10 watt charger
from the iPad 3 or even in the 12 watt
charger from the iPad 4 it does indeed
charge faster about 25% faster to be
act of course he shouldn't make a habit
of charging the iPad Mini with a charger
not intended for it
finally the pricing of the iPad Mini is
suspect it starts at three hundred and
twenty nine dollars booking cost as much
as six hundred and fifty nine dollars
with 64 gigabytes of storage and the
cellular data option with $129 premium
over the base Nexus 7 Apple is making a
statement that the iPad Mini is in
another league and they are kind of
right the iPad is the most mature tablet
you can buy in terms of app selection
and that really matters so with the
hundred and $29 premium you're paying
for that so here's what we like and
don't like about the iPad Mini
we like that the build quality is the
best of any tablet we've ever used
we like that iOS still has the best
selection of tablet apps and that they
all run great on the iPad Mini save for
some really intense games and we like
that the iPad minis performance is
plenty fast in day-to-day use we don't
like that the iPad Mini is awkwardly
wide for a 7-inch class tablet making it
strange to hold at times and nearly
impossible to fit into a pocket we don't
like that the price is significantly
higher than the Nexus 7 and finally we
don't like that iOS has become boring
and unchanged after all this time so in
conclusion we give the iPad Mini an 8.5
out of 10 it's like a smaller iPad and
that's a really good thing but it's
thinner and lighter which is something
we've been waiting for for a very long
time we just wish it was a little bit
less expensive and it had a higher
resolution display but of course these
things will work themselves out over
time if you liked this video please give
it a thumbs up and let us know what you
think about the iPad Mini and of course
be sure to watch pocketnow.com where
we're gonna have the full review with
lots more detail than we gave in this
video thanks for watching that's it for
