notch according to some new sources we
get confirmations of the Samsung Galaxy
S tens in display fingerprint scanner
and Apple just rolled out I owe s11 dot
for bringing new features for the home
pod
I'm hi may I met cumbersome gaveta and
using the word cumbersome is cumbersome
the word I use is apparently vehicle
this is a pocket out daily the official
news today began with deals the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 continues to be that phone
gets discounted and it is one of those
devices that we still recommend even
this year if you're in the market it's
currently 270 bucks off on t-mobile and
then if you go to the Samsung store
there are additional discounts or should
I say different discounts depending on
what model you pick and stuff now let's
talk about AT&amp;amp;T and LG for those of you
wondering why there wasn't a g7 think
you on AT&amp;amp;T that was because there was a
V 35 in the works it is now official as
of today yes we were there covering the
event and there are some hands-on photos
in the description most important it
pretty much is the V 30 upgraded it's
the same design pretty much things that
we actually wanted on the g7 are here
and pre-orders begin on June 1st though
the price tag is kind of crazy now let's
move the spotlight over to iOS 11.4 that
went official today and you know I
usually don't cover these updates but
for those of you that spent a ton of
money on the home pod and are scratching
your head over why airplay to is now
official with this update your home pod
needs a software update and this will
allow it to interact with other home
pods because that's what Apple wants
they want you to spend a ton of money on
speakers that don't really work well
with Siri and can just really pull music
from iPhones and you know that you can
learn more in the description as this
update doesn't bring airplane to just
airplane airplay to just to the home pod
and iOS devices there's actually a list
now let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 we've been covering rumors those of
you wanting that in-display fingerprint
scanner on the galaxy note 9 you won't
be getting it rumors are that we're
getting the S 10 early at CES and that
it will include an ultrasonic and
display fingerprint sensor
it'll work pretty much just like the one
that works on vevo phones which we're
still waiting to arrive in the United
States
vivo yes so yeah this is apparently
going to be one of the features of the
s10 CES will be actually quite early but
great and finally the most interesting
news today have to do with LG Google and
the pixel three excel those of you
wondering who's gonna make this phone
yes it's going to be LG again there was
a lot of controversy over the OLED
panels from LG LG is going to be making
the panels and we're not exactly sure if
they're also going to be making the rest
of the phone pointies yes this is
happening we hear that the knotch
is coming it's non-negotiable why we
still don't know but in today's question
I think the most important part is how
do you feel about LG making the pixel 3
Excel again do you feel that this is a
good idea I mean I feel that LG pretty
much fixed it with updates that came
later but it was in second batch phones
that software updates so I get your
concerns let us know what you think in
the comments
I hope LG figures it out friends again
