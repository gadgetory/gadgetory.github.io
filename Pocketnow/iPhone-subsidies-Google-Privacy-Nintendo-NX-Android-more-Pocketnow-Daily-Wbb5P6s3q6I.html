subsidies in the u.s. very soon
Microsoft goes official on launch date
for Windows 10 a nintendo plans to shake
things up a bit but with android of the
process I'm hi meri beta and I apologize
for the sand this is a temporary studio
while I pick some things up this is
clocking out daily the official lucid
after with Microsoft as the company has
just confirmed that we can expect
Windows 10 as soon as July 29th so yeah
we're pretty much two months away but
but also interesting part is that even
though the company said that there was a
free upgrade it seems that you have to
reserve your option for that upgrade so
Biggs of the description move fast as it
seems that if they need business because
they have limited quantities other
official news talk about Google as the
company has just launched a new privacy
hub and the reason why this is cool is
because this controls every Google
service in 10 up so you can control what
devices are using your account in
addition to where it's logged in and you
can even control the way you're seeing
on YouTube etc etc etc there are three
pivots for this service mix of the trip
should have a look as a yeah it is worth
it thank you google let's move the
spotlight over to Nintendo but not of
mobile games this time the company is
apparently working on an NX console to
be launched in 2016 and even though
they've been reluctant to share news on
what to expect it seems that it will be
powered by Android and we're not
necessarily sure what they mean by
something powered by Android couldn't be
little run android games or would it be
just the fourth version of android
running on a nintendo console this is
really cool let's just see what they
pull off in the end another company
that's desperate and I get come back
when it comes to its music services is
Apple we hear that the company is going
to rebrand beats music to Apple music
but for the launch of the new itunes
radio reports thing that Apple is hiring
they would get a Drake and even for a
Williams in a way to you know tease
people to try iTunes radio because these
are going to be the DJs in addition to
that apparently you will be getting
three months off for a trial and then
you can you know give the service okay
for ten dollars a month which is crazy
at a time when Spotify makes things even
easier with the premium model but
anyways it seems that this
we'll be watching WWDC we will be
covering it live and finally for the
skeptical news of the day it seems that
Apple had a meeting with its apple store
employees today to announce that it will
be killing carrier subsidies from a TNT
ass of this month where if you want to
get an iphone on AT&amp;amp;T you will be
getting the next program which is a you
know it still requires you to pay up for
the phone every month in installments
but it's not as a subsidy which is
completely different and if you think
that this is time to jump ship think
again seems that verizon is coming up
next with its edge service so it's
really interesting to see what Apple is
trying here we're not really sure if
this is just an apple store thing or if
it's a full AT&amp;amp;T thing but it leads me
to the question of the day whenever you
buy a smartphone does the lack of a
carrier subsidy affect you because i
know this is bailey united states but
other countries doesn't really imply we
don't really get very good carrier
subsidies anyways leave us a comment
down below what is your case are you
affected friends you know the drill if
we want to get the news earlier before
this video is filming sure you follow us
up backing out comment subscribe to our
channel as well you'd follow me on
twitter Jaime underscore a better please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am hi Mary that thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
