to its significant presence in mobile
networks smartphone offerings can be
just this bold with products like the
Exxon 7 as 2017 begins we get a chance
to see some of the new products that the
company is offering I'm hi- a tie with
pawn back now from pocket now and let's
go hands-on
the start ZTE gave us a quick update on
its promise to bring daydream VR to the
Exxon 7 many tried to debunk the
company's claims that the Exxon 7 was
capable by telling us that it needed
more technology but we were able to
prove that it actually does work just
fine and should be reaching the axon 7
along with the nougat update very soon
we also had a chance to briefly play
with Z T's new blade v8 Pro which marks
the expansion of the blade brand outside
of China this phone is launching for
just $230 unlocked in the United States
and boy you're getting a lot of phone
here we're talking about an aluminium
trim match with a very nicely textured
back the front is then complemented by
2.5 D glass and a 5.5 inch 1080p display
something very hard to find at this
price range there's a snapdragon 6 to 5
processor powering it in addition to
three gigs of ram and 32 gigs of
expandable storage and then the list
goes on $230 buys you a dual 13
megapixel rear camera to assist with
effects like enhanced ok and then there
are 8 megapixels in the front-facing
camera in addition to a fingerprint
scanner at the back after that we also
had the opportunity to have a look at
the company's new crowd source project
CSX we now have a final name as et is
dubbing it Hawkeye and confirming that
its crowd source approach is a living
program that's planned to evolve the
phone's further and what pertains to the
hardware that we saw and also software
at the moment the units on display we're
non-working markups but I'll tell you
this much these designs are really cool
we should learn further information on
pricing and availability over the next
few months and we will be following up
with more data as it emerges right now
