design and expensive speakers Samsung
Galaxy Notes have been just exploded and
not in demand and it seems that Sammy
wants to play nice with iOS now I'm hi
Mary vera and what isn't it that phones
explode when you need them to and there
are cases this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
how do you know that there is a new gear
s coming to the market well because the
current one is hundred dollars on sale
on ebay now we're talking about a refurb
here but this is pretty much a third of
the cost for the original watch it's
crazy you could buy three for the price
of one right now but let's just see what
we get a diva and now they're apparently
more compelling reasons to consider the
gear s2 as a samsung has just decided to
play it nice with Apple by launching a
beta for its gear s software to work on
iOS and what took them so long the gear
s2 is not necessarily my favorite watch
but it's not a bad watch at all it makes
all the sense in the world for it to
expand to other platforms we're not
exactly sure how long it will take for
this beta to reach everyone but it's a
good step in the right direction now
let's move the spotlight over to the
samsung galaxy note 7 the most
interesting headlines today had to do
with a phone that exploded and it
exploded while charging and apparently
what caught fire was the battery and if
you look at photos carefully it seems
that there is a non-approved USB type-c
cable be used there and you know that
there was a lot of drama over that in
particular when the 1+2 launched it's
very easy for you to get aftermarket
very bad USBC wires out there so beware
and speaking of Samsung the company has
just come on record to apologize over
how bad it's handled pre-orders for the
galaxy note 7 there are backlogs people
are waiting and according to sammy it
was just not expecting such staggering
demand and that's rather interesting as
this is probably the best smartphone of
the year not necessarily but probably i
know that many of you might defer
obviously we have an end of the year but
we were expecting this we cannot wait
for samsung to figure that one out and
finally a very hot news today don't have
to do with samsung but the company's
closes competitor in korea LG as there
are some leaked renders of the LGV 20
wearing a case because case makers are
great about this the most interesting
takeaways are that we've got bang and
olufsen speakers here in
included two there wasn't a module for
that because apparently there aren't any
modules even though this phone pretty
much retains the same design of the LG
g5 it seems that that's probably not
going to make the credit we don't blame
the company that was extremely
polarizing so much so that we are also
polarized over the fact that the LG v10
design wasn't brought to this phone but
it leads me to the question of the day
what do you prefer do you prefer the
design of the b20 that we see in the
links or would you prefer something
closer to the v10 in my case I don't
care as long as it works honestly
because the v20 is all about specs and
for me the g5 design was great it was
just badly implemented leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get the news earlier
