Park calm and today I'm going to show
you my dude allure which is actually a
sort of paint program for windows mobile
one thing that I wish Microsoft had
added to Windows Mobile is actually
paint because it's pretty nice to be
able to draw when you're bored or
whatnot without having to waste some
paper so I'm just going to go into this
program and as you can see the
background is black you can also change
the color of the background so if we
want to change the screen teller i can
go here pick any one of these colors
unfortunately can't specify our own
color so we have different shades of
gray and then of course different other
colors so if i wanted to change it to
read I can do that I'm just going to
leave it black for now because I like
the color now cool thing about this
program is you can actually open up your
own images and if I wanted to open up an
image let's see here I don't have to me
on this phone so let's see a what's this
okay so it's just a picture of my house
and if I want to change the screen color
again I can do that and it'll keep the
image the same a neat feature about this
is allows you to draw on your picture so
if I wanted to add something funny to my
picture I can do that you can change the
size of your pen so I've wanted to make
it larger I could do that you can also
change the color of my pen so let's say
I wanted to make it green and I don't
know something silly you can also rotate
the screen so that's another great
feature to have is actually landscape
viewable screen when you're in the
drawing program go back
you
and if I don't like that little green
mark over here I can just click file and
undo of course they'll delete that so if
i wanted to save this pretty elementary
picture i can just click save image and
it will actually save into my doodle or
image and then it will assign its own
little number into my pictures folder so
i click ok go into file we can clear
this there's also a couple games in here
that automatically draw so they have
take tac toe and hangman sup on to play
tic-tac-toe it can do that of course i'm
just playing by myself so it's not too
much fun or where i can also play a
hangman so this is my dude learning you
can find it on windows mobile
marketplace and the program does cost
two dollars and ninety-nine cents and
this is another marketplace pick where
you pick some of the best and most
useful programs on windows mobile
marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
