already been noticed in the galaxy s
seven variants Huawei pretty much
confirms its next move in the smartphone
game and Google takes a stand for
interesting app deals in the Google Play
Store I'm hi Mary better and after many
years of using this trusty camera for
this video it's time for an upgrade
coming very soon this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
Google as the company has just decided
to bring some deals in its google play
store for example if you're interested
in photography there are a ton of really
good applications that are now available
for just the one dollar and then others
with other major discounts as well but i
would highly suggest you hit the link in
the description for more details and
speaking of Google if you thought that
the google chromecast Audio would sell
like hotcakes we didn't think so at a
time when Bluetooth speakers are
ubiquitous and as it turns out the
company has just brought some deals as
well at bestbuy where you can buy to
chromecast audios for 55 bucks you
pretty much get a fifteen dollar
discount it's a really good deal if
you're out on the market and have a few
speakers at home and just want to use
them and not get rid of them but then
again hey speakers have gone really
cheap lately and since we're talking
about deals let's move the spotlight to
HTC and the one a nine there is no
better way to know that the m10 or
tennis coming than to see discounts on
its current lineup right now you can
pick up the 189 for a hundred dollars
off which is four dollars this phone was
sold at a very steep price tag it
continues to be one of our favorite
android phones of last year and for 400
bucks it's a really good deal even
though you have to consider other
competitors cost a little less and give
you a lot more bang for your buck though
one of those companies that focuses on
giving you a lot of bang for your buck
asst huawei the huawei p9 has been
teased over the last few weeks and today
we finally notice that we might be
getting an event for april six in london
let's just say it's pretty much
confirmed and we will definitely be
covering it live the pline is promising
to bring improvements to camera design
and quality we can't wait to give it a
try and finally the very hot news they
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy s7
you know that there are two variants
Snapdragon 820 and the Exynos 88-90 we
were not expecting performance
differences given the collaboration
between Samsung and Qualcomm but it
seems that there are CBO performance
seems similar but then when it comes to
GPU the Snapdragon 820 is apparently
almost twice as fast I have to remember
this is probably not what you experience
when playing a game and we will
definitely be testing these things out
in our review period but then again it
leads me to the question of the day
would this be a deal-breaker for you
with the exodus 88-90 would you want
maximum cpu performance even though you
could probably get a more efficient
phone even though I doubt it leave us a
comment down below in my case I would
say it would be a deal breaker but i
would love to test them out first and we
will very soon friends you know the way
it goes if you want to get these news
