there's a good reason for that but you
probably don't care you just want to see
pocket now's review of the LG g2 well
first step in the process is to take it
out of its box so let's get to it I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is the unboxing of the LG g2 okay
so this is the global edition of the LG
g2 the company informs us that software
on this device is not final and we
should expect some carrier variants in
the future and those will come pretty
much as soon as they're as soon as
they're available so we'll be following
up with this but this is the box you can
see this little kind of overbite here an
interesting little design touch that
doesn't look like much but it's it's
subtle and it's nice there's nothing
else in the outside of the box will
pluck the top off to find the expected
device front and center as I like to say
we pull the tab instead of manipulating
the edges with our non-existent
fingernails I'm going to put the device
aside for a second pluck out the top
here see what we've got in the way of
documentation quad beat two premium
earphones those are going to be fun to
try out you guys want to see what's
inside this couch I bet you do but don't
open this there will be a comment asking
why I didn't open this so here's what
they look like when it's kind of funky
the LG brands even get a little zoom on
there the LG branding on the sides with
that radial machined pattern there and
soir√©e almost as in kind of buds were
used to extra buds in the bag probably
some kind of throat control here yeah at
least a microphone there buttons on that
sucker doesn't look like it oh here's
the buttons okay so we'll check those
out in the full review let's get back to
a wide shot here and of course the USB
cable we've come to expect nothing else
in the box and here is the g2 itself now
we were at the New York City launch
event for this device we've already had
some hands-on time with it this one is
covered in plastic which means we get to
do the fun stuff and that means getting
the mic right up close to the screen
protector while we peel it right off for
the first time
looks like we are going to be the first
ones on this demo device that's good
here we go beautiful thing and one more
time on the back and we got some other
films there and things that we will we
will go ahead and take off on our own
time but here's the device it is
familiar to us we spend a lot of time
with the white ones on the demo floor in
New York this is the darker version
obviously first things that you notice
the volume up and volume down keys and
their unique positioning on the back
cover rather than on the sides which
allows LG to get some very nice minimal
bezel action on the front and no buttons
on the front whatsoever from a hardware
perspective and above those special
volume and navigation keys the camera 13
megapixels with flash and optical image
stabilization and it is bulge lists no
crater or warts needed to house the
machinery for that optical image
stabilization we come back around to the
front I'm go ahead and power on the unit
while we're talking here if we can do
that there's also a ring light around
the cell idea around this power standby
key and I wonder if it will light up
maybe it won't on this power up
there's the LG boot screen this display
and notification light cycling through a
test pattern up there
hello LG when I move the mic back so
that you guys can hear me a little bit
better sorry I do often forget to do
that there's our first boot here's our
screen this screen is yeah that's creepy
this screen is really amazing it is an
IPS display is 5.2 inches 1080p and
we're giving a pixel resolution of pixel
density of 423 PPI which is pretty
incredible in person we said that at the
launch event we said we weren't
necessarily in love with the build
quality the feel in hand it's not bad
it's just you know what we're used to
from generations of Samsung products and
some LG ones but we'll go into some more
detail on that in the full review and
then the comparison so good power the
screen back on and tell you about the
processor powering all that again I'm
going to go ahead and show that again
because I will need those reminders when
manipulating LG's Android UI here and
the last thing we'll cover in this
unboxing will be
tell you about the processor a
Snapdragon 800 processor that is uh
obviously quad-core and running at 2.2 6
gigahertz we'll see how that performs in
our series of features coming up but for
now that is the LG g2 that we are about
to give the full treatment to folks one
of the big reasons we were late unboxing
and reviewing the g2 is because of Aoife
2013 so check out the link in the
description below to see all of our
videos and features from that trade show
a lot of smartphones and tablets some of
them from LG so check that out also like
this video if you did enjoy it and
follow us on social media of course
leave a comment down below if you have
some feedback meantime stay tuned for a
lot more coverage on the g2 and every
other smartphone out there as usual this
has been Michael with PocketNow thank
you for watching and we'll see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
