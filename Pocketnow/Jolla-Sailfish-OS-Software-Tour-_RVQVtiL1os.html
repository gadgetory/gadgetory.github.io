tony behind the camera and I'm here with
Stefano Moscone a CIO of Yola Direct and
he's gonna take us through a quick
walkthrough of the Yola sailfish OS
let's check it out so this development
device of course is not yet our own
device is the trio's the 950 is the end
and $50 game and fifty and it's a three
years old our door so you know you can
do the math right so these are vertical
UI so the concept is vertical and as you
can see here the there is the lockscreen
the home view and then degreed with all
the applications okay and this is these
on the home screen in the center those
are actively running applications right
now those are actually there an
application now I will go there later
okay
let's focus now on the lock screen you
see here some modifications so these are
of course implications of the Audis here
our notification notifications as
notifications like messages missed calls
or emails shots or something like that
so - so I can double top and wake up a
screen yes and I can push from the right
and reveal the events view this is one
of the latest addition that we have made
so this is an aggregated Notification
Center so we have these events view all
the events that are important for the
user will be displayed here as I said
messages email miss cold shots with
space for ads for inner space or greater
space and will third-party apps be able
to plug into that solutely okay so yes
everything is is really available for
for third-party apps so then we have the
feeds like social media Twitter arrow
says whatever you want there it is push
from the side and it disappears so here
one thing I want to show you is the not
status bar or the status bar which is
something which is hidden so it will be
going away so we are trying to save as
much real estate on the screen as
possible because we think that the user
does have to see the status bar every
time he looks at the phone so if you
won't see we'll just just don't fall
down and see it and that's always
available is that available when a
third-party app is running as well can
you profoundly see the status these
this part of the this part of the of the
home screen so just the home screen
okay part of the on-screen I will show
you how you can pick it from an
application crammed in a minute so let's
open the media player let's select a
song here so now it's playing I don't
know if you can hear but yeah and for
instance if I wanted a the next song I
just apply this gesture so we are trying
to break out of this deep topping in
there and this is still playing the song
so we have this active force and the
active covers are something that you can
apply actions on though the thing I was
trying to strain you right and at the
for each of these is an active cover so
they have actions I can pause the music
just by applying isolation so I just
apply the simple gesture on top and it
just plays musical instruments in play
and pause and resume and the next one I
see and once again any any app has the
potential to use gestures in that manner
of so this is a integral part of our
component of our fish silica components
so the SDK has this capability great so
yeah now it's playing the music
I will pause it off for the sake of not
hearing it and I go to the to the timer
here so this is a simple clock
application okay I will show you the the
fully menu so the coulee menu is kind of
a shortcut menu so the there are actions
or like the most used things of the
application so my instance if I want to
set a new timer I can set a new timer
and this sir this is designed in-house
by Biola this is your design everything
he's our stuff no no I understand I just
wanted to make sure it wasn't a
third-party app that you know then if we
want to go back to a home view mmm we
can do this but here you see now the
status bar so I'm I'm seeing notice it
but this is bar but if I go disappears
then you come back okay but if you don't
if you don't complete that gesture then
you can come right back in there yeah
you just take glance and then you're
back in how I see you see it's like the
reverse of the peak yeah goodbye yeah
interesting and we go back here so what
else can I show you the ambience that we
have we have talked about already yes
when you change the mood of the device
exactly you can change the mood of the
device you select on you and when you
select announcer I complete it and when
you select it does it have to be a stock
image on the phone or can it be a photo
that you've taken I can take a picture
of you now and it will apply a michael
fisher ambience to the self not only the
wallpaper has changed but also you see
the font the color of the font has
changed and this of course can lead to
other changes if we want if you
determine them if they want to expect
that yeah there is a lot of
possibilities here so it takes the the
color which is in the image which is the
color in majority and applies that it
says there is an algorithm the samples
the image the the hue and everything and
it applies wonders to have some kind of
contrast otherwise you will just be non
green for instance yes and when you are
in an app and you pull down that that
context-sensitive menu you're getting
haptic feedback at each stage of that
right yeah you get our haptics and and
audible feedback so you can hear and
feel that you are that you're actually
selecting different items nice thing
again the pulley menu yes you see the
date there is and there are few things
that you usually do so a few
applications that you can run for
instance the camera the phone or you
just want to put it in silent or file so
what I will do I will put now in silent
okay
and that's done that's it it's silent as
you can see it's final and are those
options up top user customizable like
say I always go to Twitter could I
conceive ibly plug that in uptown it's
something that we can do if we want it's
pretty simple to do it so nice I don't
have a policy on that it's extremely
simple there it is
so that's
oh yeah I'm looking great and that one
on the picture-in-picture thing and then
it was oh it's here and now it's in the
gallery and you could you could build an
ambiance out of that or presumably you
could edit and you built-in share
functionality so if I just on that we
can share it to any in some third party
yeah what you're trying to do is to
integrate all these social media sharing
functions and not really in the in the
in the platform so right now for first I
create your ambience okay and then so I
can share via share or we can add a
different account we can share okay so
here is Facebook friends we have a
default account you know test account on
Facebook sure and we can share the thing
did you know and this interface would
look basically the same you know in
another application I get like Twitter
or yes whereas many accounts as you have
sure as many accounts you'll see here
you can go you cannot select now because
we only have one account right Wow
that's basically it so these are made
basically the new developments since the
last round of hands-on so that we have
seen unselfish and of course no
announcement here at the at the show we
have released yes the SDK
that's right congratulations by the way
that's a very big thing a third-party
developer SDK so the the SDK it was very
nice the feedback we got from from
developers after 20 minutes we have a
publish we got the first application
imported 20 minutes for the first
application where was it Gypo do a
podcast kind oh no a podcast application
yes and then we have received a lot of
love for the for the way how we have
designed the
the UI design the guidelines and the
components and stuff so because it's
really geeky to say this component is
beautiful but that's what we have
received the passion is is contagious
and it's pretty simple right now we
support Linux the SDK support Enochs is
based on QT creator we have plugged in
our own components there and and we have
a virtual machine so you can basically
run the safety OS on your Linux desktop
and as I recall you're gonna use this
one my last question I know you have to
go you're gonna use Web Apps to kind of
plug fill the gaps in between as we go
so we have we are going to support first
of all Android applications so that's
the way how we are trying to fill the
gap okay to answer if that's your head
but of course the native development
it's what matters the most to us and you
will get something more if you develop
the application Natalie of course you
can access this these features that we
have seen now with Android you cannot
access the fully menu you cannot have
great if covered because running in a
sandbox I mean in the Android
environments and html5 but that's the
other part of the story and do you
expect to have a some Android apps
ported at launch there is no need to
force anything they just run on modify
okay so you'll have access only to port
I mean they are there that's very
exciting
I don't want to I really thank you for
your time Stefano very nice to meet you
in person after our interview last week
once again michael fisher with pocket
now tony behind the camera and Stefano
Moscone CIO of Yola once again thank you
very very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
