later game design well first of all we
need to consider your mobile customer
this is somebody who wants to consume
entertainment on their tempo at their
scene in bite-sized chunks that can be
either large depending on consumers this
is people looking for casual
entertainment on the bus on the subway
or presentation to start you need to be
designing your games for high latency
asynchronous play in the most case in
most cases the notifications will arrive
at the speed of your cellular network
but it can take up to 30 minutes for a
push notification to arrive so if your
game a lot of long delays like this so
in a casual gaming frame of mind you
might think of something like risk or
settlers of catan or go around but have
a long-term cycles rather than some food
fast tastes like slap jack or Hungry
Hungry Hippos you may find it can get
higher performance with HTTP polling
requests but the trade-off there is that
human reduce your battery by keeping
these connections over so do what's best
your game don't necessarily expect
experience another thing to point out is
regarded in game session management
unlike with the xbox 360 it's up to you
to provide the game state and multiple
and so if you're going to write
multiplayer game means that you also
would loss right if their party
Webster's handle this game state and to
hook up your friends with your game so
I'll be straight those do presents
challenges but this is not for you
change the game to play question there's
my phone upfront so please use that
certain
yeah so questions that one slide show
maybe state there's no ad hoc Wi-Fi
multiplayer so what you need to do when
you design your games you in this month
seven series is consider that a
synchronous high latency game stuff for
this release we're not going to have the
ability to pick up
through personal regret something the
XNA framework does not expose any way to
open up a law socket for example make a
Wi-Fi connection if that's a feature
that you're interested in for inking and
I would strongly encourage you to give
us that feedback so that we can
prioritize features like that and see
where they might fit home so the phone
itself can use Wi-Fi can use your shell
so your network one of the in terms of
multiplayer games it doesn't things that
much Charlie so I'm not cheating TV for
a gaming situation yes so games will not
be able to use Wi-Fi for multiplayer but
they would they could receive push
notifications that way or make HTTP
requests using my friend sure so I mean
you said early on that your game would
have to go through services covered
everything
with most seminar just games in five
services so everything will have to go
through some form certification there
are additional steps that games will
have to submit two for xbox live in
table features so in marketplace will
have to go for some kind of sir yes
that's correct and we will have more
information about that so if you're
using this new framework well does the
does the windows phone sdk allow
purchased using the Wi-Fi it's our cell
provider if you don't want to have to go
through XNA do HTTP and I just grabbed
the Wi-Fi start something that's all so
no that would be possible additionally
platforms to target rather than be so
polite with except a framework right
okay so if you can have to look reserved
and you kind of get what I mean you
actually
we're just making any binding and
engaging with another marketers you have
so if you want see so you don't want to
admit a foot apart but so there there
will be some certification requirements
that are still being determined okay
pull that bed replication but what about
this dream of my Christian Microsoft
think know if you just want to download
the tools then you'll we're going to
have a developer portal where you can go
and allow your enable your device to be
deployed to for development purposes and
that to do that but if they're going to
be some kind of green light also
spreading depends up on the market
right sir
you want to avoid regularly
Paul paga office yes yes oh there will
be we're still working on some of those
details about how things get out into
the market and we will also have 20
questions we introduce weather container
apps facebook you want to use the trap
yes mess the cops because one of the
people wrong psychic others the job one
in this week shakes a java city run at
play a serious game she lose the closest
achievements my facebook twitter and
when polls in an actual RSS feed Jilly
location matters is there was actually
nice though we pointed out on a table so
if you're making if you're doing that's
our nation to request your game that's
good job and we want properly balanced
chief about 10 minutes or so if you're
thinking like you want to host I just
started checking your game and you want
to post it to Facebook and Twitter okay
so that's that's going to be more of a
policy question so you need to have a
discussion with your account manager
okay it's no problem at do it I'm saying
exactly isn't technology you guys want
even a question
thank you very much for coming I
appreciate stick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
