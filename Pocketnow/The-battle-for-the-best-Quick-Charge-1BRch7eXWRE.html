a thing specifications have been on the
continual march up word processors have
gotten faster from megahertz in the
hundreds two gigahertz in the plural
they've also added cores with quad and
even octa cores being somewhat
commonplace ran is increased from a few
dozen megabytes do a few gigabytes
storage is increased to and data speeds
are through the roof one area that
hasn't seen much improvement over the
years is battery capacity though battery
capacities may still be lagging OEMs are
giving us the next best thing by
decreasing our charge times I'm Joe Levi
with pocket now let's take a look at
some quick charging technologies that
promise to deliver the charge that we
need right when we need it I got my
first taste of quick charging with
Google's Motorola made next 26 and it's
turbo charger prior to that experience I
was firmly entrenched in the Qi wireless
charging camp though relatively slow the
convenience of Qi let me charge my phone
whenever I set it down using this
downtime to top off my phone's battery
quick charging changed all that Qualcomm
began cooking quick charge into its
chips back in 2012 the intent
standardized a method to charge devices
faster quick charge 1.0 was devised and
enabled phones to charge using two amp
chargers much faster than the 500
milliamp half an amp that USB one and
USB two provided even usb3 only formally
supports up to 900 ml amps that's point
9 amps Qualcomm quick charge one point 0
seem to be more an afterthought than a
selling point though many phones over 70
included the feature if you included on
their spec sheets Qualcomm's first
iteration attempted to be backwards
compatible and succeeded but this
limited its upward capabilities and
ultimately gave birth to version 2 point
0 to achieve full charging speeds a
quick charge 2.0 enabled device must be
paired with a quick charge 2.0 defied
adapter back when samsung released its
note 3 phablet it included a micro USB
3.0 port this
doublewide port and relatively rigid
cable helps decrease charge times but
required a special cable and compatible
charger or compatible USB port needless
to say it didn't stick around very long
subsequently Samsung has gotten into the
quick charging game using its adaptive
fast charge technology and chargers
designed for that standard in Pacific
Qualcomm's it's impressive to the galaxy
s6 edge can be charged with up to 4
hours of use with only 10 minutes on the
proprietary charger the most recent
entrance into the quick charging race is
OBO with its loop or V ooc flash charge
technology like other charging
technologies Luke is based on 5 volt DC
power however like other quick Chargers
the ways opal reduced charge time is by
boosting the amperage and voltage
through a special charger challenge OEM
space when boosting voltage and amperage
with resistance heat and managing the
two in a manner that will enable quick
charging without making your battery
explode OBO accomplishes this by
increasing the number of pins delivering
power to the battery in its latest
devices 28 most batteries only have four
pins and the number of the pins in the
cable has been increased to seven this
means you'll need special cables elbow
has colored the inside of its boot
compatible chargers and it's cables to
green to help you identify them oboes
also move the charging controller out of
the phone into the adapter there by
moving the heat generated by that
circuit into the adapter itself rather
than keeping it all pent up inside the
phone which results in a much cooler
phone while charging and helps
accelerate the charging cycle to prevent
users from damaging devices that are not
equipped with boop technology i'll post
chargers able to recognize compatible
devices and use standard charging in
those cases where vu isn't present how
do these three standard stack up well
after 30 minutes of charging the results
are obvious bow pose the clear winner
unlike other devices opal can flash
charged with the screen on too after 60
minutes well it's
pretty much game over for battery life
woes looking at this table we can see
that with the screen on opal charges up
to 71 percent in half an hour whereas
the galaxy s6 only makes it to 25 the
Nexus 6 is a little better at
thirty-five percent and the iphone 6
plus only makes it up to twelve percent
but it's really at that one our time
with the screen off the oppo n3 gets
ninety-six percent that's impressive
opos boc or buch is the latest player in
the quick charging game as you'd
probably expect it's in the lead for now
what's more important here is that we
have players from three different camps
that have all recognized the need for a
better way to charge our phones they've
come up with three very similar yet
significantly different methods to solve
that problem so although our battery
capacities still haven't caught up with
the other specs on the spec sheets of
our modern handhelds our chargers
certainly have one thing we noticed in
our testing is that the percentages and
the times of our devices varied but
quite a bit environmental conditions but
tributed to differences in times and
also different devices that had
different things installed on them and
hence running in the background also
affected charge time so your charge
times regardless of if you're using one
of these technologies or not is going to
vary somewhat from our test cases if you
like quick charging make sure you give
the video a thumbs up and if you haven't
subscribed yet you'll want to make sure
that you do that so you don't miss out
on any new cool stuff coming down line
if you want to see more information
about the samsung galaxy s6 or the oppo
n3 or other devices we've got videos for
you over at pocketnow.com you won't want
to miss those either 4-pocket now
comparing ways that we can make our
phones last longer right when we need
them I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching
and we will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
