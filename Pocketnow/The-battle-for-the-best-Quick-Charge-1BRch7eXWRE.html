a thing specifications have been on the
continual march upward processors have
gotten faster from megahertz in the
hundreds to gigahertz in the plural
they've also added cores with quad and
even octa-core as being somewhat
commonplace ran is increased from a few
dozen megabytes to a few gigabytes
storage is increased too and data speeds
are through the roof one area that
hasn't seen much improvement over the
years is battery capacity though battery
capacities may still be lagging OMS are
giving us the next best thing by
decreasing our charge times I'm Joe Levi
with pocket now let's take a look at
some quick charging technologies that
promise to deliver the charge that we
need right when we need it I got my
first taste of quick charging with
Google's Motorola made Nexus 6 and it's
turbo charger prior to that experience I
was firmly entrenched in the Qi wireless
charging camp though relatively slow the
convenience of Qi let me charge my phone
whenever I set it down using this
downtime to top off my phone's battery
quick charging changed all that Qualcomm
began cooking quick charge into its
chips back in 2012 the intent
standardized a method to charge devices
faster quick charge 1.0 was devised and
enabled phones to charge using 2 amp
chargers much faster than the 500
milliamp half an amp that USB 1 and USB
2 provided even USB 3 only formerly
supports up to nine hundred milliamps
that's point 9 amps Qualcomm quick
charge 1.0 seemed to be more an
afterthought than a selling point though
many phones over 70 included the feature
if you included it on their spec sheets
Qualcomm's first iteration attempted to
be backwards compatible and succeeded
but this limited its upward capabilities
and ultimately gave birth to version 2.0
to achieve full charging speeds a quick
charge 2.0 enable device must be paired
with a quick charge 2.0 certified
adapter back when Samsung released its
Note 3 phablet it included a micro USB
3.0 port this
double-wide port and relatively rigid
cable helps decrease charge times but
required a special cable and compatible
charger or compatible USB port needless
to say it didn't stick around very long
subsequently Samsung has gotten into the
quick charging game using its adaptive
fast charge technology and chargers
designed for that standard in Pacific
Qualcomm's it's impressive to the Galaxy
s6 edge can be charged with up to four
hours of use with only 10 minutes on the
proprietary charger the most recent
entrant into the quick charging race is
Opel with its loop or vio OC flash
charge technology like other charging
technologies luke is based on 5 volt DC
power however like other quick Chargers
the ways Opel reduced charge time is by
boosting the amperage and voltage
through a special charger the challenge
Oleum space when boosting voltage and
amperage is with resistance heat and
managing the two in a manner that will
enable quick charging without making
your battery explode Lopo accomplishes
this by increasing the number of pins
delivering power to the battery in its
latest devices to eighth most batteries
only have four pins and the number of
the pins in the cable has been increased
to 7 obviously this means you'll need
special cables elbow has colored the
inside of its boot compatible chargers
and it's cables to green to help you
identify them elbows also move the
charging the controller out of the phone
into the adapter thereby moving the heat
generated by that circuit into the
adapter itself rather than keeping it
all pent up inside the phone which
results in a much cooler phone while
charging and helps accelerate the
charging cycle to prevent users from
damaging devices that are not equipped
with loop technology outpost chargers
are able to recognize compatible devices
and use standard charging in those cases
where vu isn't present how do these
three standards stack up well after 30
minutes of charging the results are
obvious
popo's the clear winner unlike other
devices Opel can flash charge with the
screen on to after 60 minutes well it's
pretty much game over for our battery
life woes looking at this table we can
see that with the screen on all Poe
charges up to 71% in half an hour
whereas the galaxy s6 only makes it to
25 the Nexus 6 is a little better at 35%
and the iPhone 6 plus only makes it up
to 12% but it's really at that one hour
time
with the screen off the oppo n3 gets 96%
that's impressive
opus v OC or vu is the latest player in
the quick charging game as you'd
probably expect it's in the lead for now
what's more important here is that we
have players from three different camps
that have all recognized the need for a
better way to charge our phones they've
come up with three very similar yet
significantly different methods to solve
that problem so although our battery
capacities still haven't caught up with
the other specs on the spec sheets of
our modern handhelds our chargers
certainly have one thing we noticed in
our testing is that the percentages and
the times of our devices varied but
quite a bit environmental conditions but
tributed to differences in times and
also different devices that had
different things installed on them and
hence running in the background also
affected charge time so your charge
times regardless of if you're using one
of these technologies or not is going to
vary somewhat from our test cases if you
like quick charging make sure you give
the video a thumbs up and if you haven't
subscribed yet you'll want to make sure
that you do that so you don't miss out
on any new cool stuff coming down the
line if you want to see more information
about the Samsung Galaxy s6 or the oppo
n3 or other devices we've got videos for
you over at pocketnow.com you won't want
to miss those either for pocket now
comparing ways that we can make our
phones last longer right when we need
them I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching
and we will catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
