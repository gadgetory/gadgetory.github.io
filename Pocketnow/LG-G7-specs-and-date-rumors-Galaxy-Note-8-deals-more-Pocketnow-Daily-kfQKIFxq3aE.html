sooner than expected and with monster
specifications we get launch dates for
the Oppo f7 that claims to be the selfie
King at least in megapixels and if you
have brought an Amazon battery pack
recently you might want to try to get a
refund I'm Jaime Rivera and even though
ahright decided not to buy the FC busted
I'm not sure this year because I found
it ugly may the odds be with the team
today even if by the time you watch this
video the game will be over this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals of you saw our recent
comparison of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
and the samsung galaxy has 9 plus both
great phones and I still recommend the
note 8 I still consider it awesome if
you're in the market it's currently on
eBay as a new other listed for 580 bucks
which is pretty much half off I mean
that phone is worth that amount of money
I'd recommend you go for it now let's
talk about Amazon as the company has
just started recalling 260,000 battery
packs that were sold between 2014 and
2017 over at least 50 cases of these
either exploding or leaking or whatever
which is definitely a safety issue you
can learn more about this in the
description this is one of those things
where we highly suggest you don't think
about it don't wait it out just get a
replacement but we're not exactly sure
what you're getting as a replacement
again the description will teach you
more now let's talk about the essential
phone that device that we love holding
so much and we love using so much up
until the moment we have to take a photo
but one of the coolest parts is we're
still waiting for the essential tube
mainly because the essential room was
gorgeous but it just gets Android Oreo
and I'm talking Android 8.1 as of today
would I recommend the essential phone
for the price tag right now sure why not
Oh but again I'm waiting five essential
to this well the spotlight over to Oppo
as a well the company didn't wait they
just pretty much announced their new
Oppo f7 which is the selfie King
according to them and the reason why is
a well we've got a notch but that much
actually serves a purpose there's a
twenty five megapixel selfie camera
there as the
company has definitely given more
importance to the fact that people like
to take selfies and obviously there's a
19 point 5 by 9 aspect ratio display
resolution is actually great
we can't wait to tell you more about
this phone are actually getting one soon
and will tell you if it's really the
selfie King or not and finally the very
interesting news today I have to do with
rumors on the lg g7 and bear with me
here as there for you first of all
apparently the name is going to remain
LG g7 we should expect the possible
launch happening in May it seems that
we're getting a knotch
and monster specs like the snapdragon
845 in addition we didn't hear much
about Ram but storage will start at 64
gigabytes apparently as dual 16
megapixel cameras are coming here and
yeah that I mentioned a notch
I did mention an odd that's part of
the design that seems and it's rather
interesting and all but the question
today is do you even care about that LG
G 7 after all the delays that have
happened recently in my case I do I feel
that LG has done an amazing job I just
can't wait for them to fix the software
and I feel that the LGP 30 didn't
provide the cameras that we were
expecting and by the way the v40
apparently will happen in November leave
