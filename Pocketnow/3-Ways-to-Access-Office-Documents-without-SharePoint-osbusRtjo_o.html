i'm going to show you a few different
ways to get office documents into the
office hub on Windows Phone 7 so let's
check it out now first off you see
here's the office have you got three
defaults that comes with and really the
best way to work with Office documents
is to have a sharepoint 2010 server but
a lot of people don't have that so how
do we get Office documents in here
there's no file sync and zune doesn't
access guy drive directly so what do we
do well the silliest way is to email
them to yourself so here's the email
message
and we can download word documents
PowerPoint files excel and if I tap it
it'll open PowerPoint and then right
here I can choose save as and that will
put it into the office hub same with
word you have to do say it as you can't
just save it because it's not going to
go back into an email and there's an
excel file again you gotta choose save
as now that's one method you can also
visit your SkyDrive on the Internet
Explorer you have to be in the mobile
view in order to get these but when we
go to that specific folder that we left
our word documents well our office
documents in we can just open them right
here and when it loads here's a
PowerPoint you can see a little preview
of it and right there is a download
button and here i can tap to open it and
there it is in the office up i can
choose save as again it's read-only so i
can't save it back I can't save it back
to the SkyDrive which is annoying
and of course we can do that with the
word and excel documents in SkyDrive as
well so there you go there's some other
backups the third way is kind of
interesting I made a one-note page that
syncs with SkyDrive and on the desktop
in OneNote 2010 I can attach documents
to a 10 page which then sinks to
SkyDrive and subsequently sinks to
Windows 17 so here I have a bunch of
document icons I can tap on that and it
will say open and that's going to open
it right in word again it's read-only so
I can't save it back to the OneNote
notebook which does sync with SkyDrive I
have to do is say that and the only way
I can get it off is to send it in an
email but this is kind of cool if you
want a you know sinking document library
you can attach documents to OneNote and
it works for pdfs too if i can press it
correctly
there's a PDF they opened an acrobat all
right so that's three ways you can get
office documents into the office hub on
windows phone 7 without using sharepoint
server 2010 hope you enjoyed this video
give us a thumbs up if you liked it
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
