pocketnow.com in this video we're going
to talk about the hardware on the HTC
Titan which has a 4.7 inch screen is
that too big to fit in your pocket we're
going to find out right now so do you
actually want to see how it fits inside
of a pocket what let's take a look kind
of an interesting little test here so
here it is not that big of a device
actually it's it's obviously pretty big
in there but it's definitely not too big
to cause your pants to fall down if
you're not wearing about so pretty
pocketable it's still quite big compared
to some other devices so the HTC Titan
is the fastest windows phone 7.5 mango
device you can buy right now if you look
at clock speed alone it has a 1.5
gigahertz qualcomm snapdragon cpu if you
want a full rundown of specs check the
link in the description in this video
we're going to talk more about fit and
finish how it feels in the hand how
large it actually is and other things
like that so let's get to it 4.7 inch
screen as as we mentioned here 800 down
by 480 across so what HTC has done is
there stretching the same resolution
found on smaller screen devices to this
larger display which means pixels are
actually visible on this phone if you
have good eyesight it has a ppi pixel
density of 198 pixels per inch when you
get below 220 230 you start to see
pixels so let me show you some pixels if
the camera will pick it up so here we
are on the start screen we're going to
zoom in on some of these tiles if the
camera stays in focus you should be able
to see some pixels especially in this
Twitter icon if you have very good
eyesight you'll notice the pixels it's
not that big a video it's still a very
crisp and clear super LCD display HTC
always makes a good display but just be
aware that's not sharp and not not as
sharp and not as crisp as some of the Q
HD screens out there and we're about to
see a wave of 720p screens on Android
handsets so just something to be aware
so the screen is dominated the front is
dominated by the screen i should say
very thin bezel along the side which is
quite nice you might be wondering how it
compares to devices that have
a 4.3 inch screen for example so let's
bring out the galaxy s2 and if we rest
it and kind of match things up you'll
notice that it's about the Titans about
two millimeters wide wide wider and two
millimeters taller so not that big of a
difference again HTC did a good job
keeping the bezel razor sharp if we look
at the desire HD very popular device of
last year now we've got about one
millimeter maybe two on the side maybe
three or four millimeters here on the
bottom so it's not that big of a
difference in terms of size when
compared to devices with 4.3 inch
displays I've got a front-facing camera
up here first round of devices now is
coming out with front facing cameras for
windows phone 7 mango got the capacitive
buttons down here really interesting
design cue here HTC has protruded the
screen let's see if we can capture this
on video about a millimeter beyond the
case it's really kind of cool actually
and it feels nice in the hand so if you
can notice this the screen pops out a
little bit across the entire device then
it kind of sinks back down where the
screen ends so sort of a cool design
element there and while we're on the
side got the charging Jack their micro
USB of course we flip over to the back
nothing but microphone and the little
button to pop off the battery cover
we've got a camera shutter button all
windows phone 7 devices have it which is
a great idea it's always nice to have it
feels kind of awkward on the Titan for
some reason and we have to use this
device for for some more time to really
understand why that is it just seems
difficult to capture a picture it might
be the software it might be the larger
form factor of the device volume rocker
here 3.5 millimeter up the top and a
power standby button now the back is
really sharp it's it's actually real
metal and you know it's real metal
because when you pick it up after you
haven't used the phone for a while the
back feels cool to the touch which is
really nice we saw the same kind of
design Q on the HTC Desire HD or this is
actually the inspire 4G really nice to
have some real materials and the device
does feel kind of heavy but again it's
using real materials real metal real
glass but so you have to expect that
kind of thing speaker grill on the back
the Titan hasn't
loud speaker which is great 8 megapixel
camera can do 720p video not 1080p
unfortunately and dual flash on the
Titan now to take off the back battery
cover the phone kind of separates into
two pieces which is something HTC has
been doing recently with their phones so
this comes off you get the battery in
the sim card slot and no microSD slot
back here this Windows Phone 7 device
does not have expandable memory but it
does have 16 gigabytes of on-board
storage which is really plenty for most
people it will pop this back in and wrap
things up so the HTC Titan of course
coming from HTC it's a high quality
device it feels good in the hand it
looks like a lot of their other devices
to be honest you get a screen and some
buttons you probably are wondering well
how many different ways can you design a
phone who knows the HTC Titan looks like
the desire HD it looks like a lot of
previous devices to come from HTC which
isn't a bad thing it's a high quality
device the screen is beautiful its large
a little bit low in terms of pixel
density but that shouldn't bother most
people so coming up soon we are going to
have a full software tour of Windows
Phone 7 mango as it runs on the HTC
Titan you're probably curious to see how
this thing performs with a faster
processor if you like this video please
give us a thumbs up and of course thank
you for watching that's it for now
