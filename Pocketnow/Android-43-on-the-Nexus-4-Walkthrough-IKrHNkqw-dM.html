quite some time now I'm Joe Levi this is
pocket now and we're going to go
hands-on with Android 4.3 on the nexus 4
this is my nexus 4 it is rooted to run
the leaked version of the ROM you have
to flash it be a custom rom manager
there isn't an OTA available just yet
that may be coming in the next couple
days so let's show you what we got on
the surface it looks just like any other
version of Android not a lot of changes
that you're going to see on the surface
to show you that this is indeed running
Android 4.3 let's go into the settings
all the way down to the bottom and about
phone this is android version 4.3 and
you can see all of the other fun stuff
in here this is build number JW r 66 n
as in Nancy there have been a few other
leaks this one was the most recent that
I could find so hopefully what you're
about to see here is going to be pretty
true to what we see when 4.3 actually
hits the airwaves and is delivered
directly to your phone the first place
to look since this is a smart phone is
in the dialer app a phone as a phone
after all right so what you can see here
is I've already started pre dialing or
or Auto completing my friend Benito
papen Dorf over here I've typed in the
numbers that correspond with the letters
in his name you can see I got 236 blah
blah blah so that's B and di t 0 and it
went through gave me a list of various
different names I'm not going to show
you that because this has my personal
address book on it and it came up with a
whole bunch of other people's phone
numbers that I bet they don't want you
to know and call them in the middle of
the night so just trust me on this one
it shows up right in here and it
autocompletes a lot of you may be saying
hey this is something that we've already
seen in android and yes you may have a
different device from Samsung from HTC
from whomever that has autocomplete in
the dialer already stock Android hasn't
not until this build so that's the first
thing that we're seeing new in Android
4.3 the next change is an update to the
messaging app so if we go ahead and
launch that because you have already
started writing a
text message to my friend bendito and
this looks just completely normal you
can go ahead and write anything like you
normally would where it changes is
there's a new keyboard to access it you
press and hold on the spacebar and you
go over to emoji by i.w.n.i a me I don't
know if that stands for everything if
you know what it does head down to the
comments and let me know let's switch to
that and now we can see all of these
different emoji these are the recent
ones that I have used it's going to
default to those right away from what I
can tell if you want to change to a
different list you can select a
different category here let's choose
nature let's say hey look that looks
like a hurricane so let's choose that
with a little bit of snow and rainbow
and I guess that's a volcano we can
navigate back and forth using those or
go back to our list using the button in
the middle will also come in here say
Statue of Liberty so lots of cool things
that you can put in here just to make
things a little bit more personal maybe
use a little bit less words it's not
clear on whether this is going to
actually communicate across to text
message users or if you're going to have
to have an Android to be able to receive
them that you'll have to find out for
yourself once Android 4.3 hits the
market next up is Bluetooth specifically
Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy now this is
something we haven't been able to
thoroughly verify yet but it sure seems
like it's included if you haven't read
our articles yet on Bluetooth 4.0 Low
Energy you need to go and do that it's
really really neat and it lets us push
out the internet of things a lot better
than what we have before with Bluetooth
3.0 which is what the nexus 4 had until
this release now again I'm making an
assumption here however this is my
pebble smartwatch it includes bluetooth
for capability in it it's backwards
compatible so it works with Bluetooth
three devices but I'm getting a lot more
life out of my smartwatch and out of my
smartphone and I suspect that has to do
with the inclusion of bluetooth for low
energy next up we have improvements to
the
app so you can see here it looks pretty
much like the old camera app did I'm in
HDR mode right now to change I just tap
and hold instead of having a big round
circle that I really can't see I now
have a little arc that has all of my
nice frequently used things and I can
get into it and make changes very easily
whenever I hover I can see clearly what
mode I'm changing to what settings I'm
manipulating I'm not worried about
covering up things like I was in the
previous version of the the camera app
one other neat thing rotating now is
nearly instantaneous there's none of
that lag when you change the orientation
of the camera maybe just a half second
while it switches but much much faster
much much nicer next up on the list of
Android 4.3 improvements is speed most
of the benchmarks that we ran show that
the speed was significantly increased on
Android 4.3 version versus the Android
4.2 version of the nexus 4 how does it
actually perform over all snappy any
hesitation that may have been on your
device before it's really gone now you
can see how fast this flips through
things game performance was very very
fast overall user interface also snappy
the whole device just seems smoother
this looks like project butter revisited
and made even smoother and even more
buttery than when we saw it before last
but certainly not least battery life
running on the 4.3 version of Android is
significantly better than running on 4.2
i was able using my just normal use i
was able to get one day one hour 52
minutes and 55 seconds out of a single
charge that wasn't using my device any
differently than i did before where i'd
normally get around 42 maybe six hours
of battery life so quite a leap up
that's a quick look at android 4.3
running on the nexus for one thing we do
want to mention
is it is a leaked release meaning it may
not be what you see when 4.3 actually
arrives though we're pretty confident
that you'll see most of what we showed
you here that'll do it for now if you
liked what you saw please give the video
a thumbs up and share it with your
friends on all your favorite social
media networks make sure you subscribe
so you don't miss out on what's coming
next for bucking now I'm Joe Levi thanks
