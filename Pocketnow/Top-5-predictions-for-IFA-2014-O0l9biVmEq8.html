Eva 2014 is just around the corner and
our team is already packing and getting
ready as they have to cross the pond
next week and cover everything you want
to see live so let's talk about these
things I'm hi meri beta this is pocket
now and these are top 5 predictions of
what we should expect to see at Aoife
2014 number 5 is not really a prediction
this is actually the products that have
already been announced because these
companies could not wait but we will be
seeing them until Aoife number one the
Samsung gear s number two the LG G watch
our and number three the asustes n watch
these companies could not wait and
Android wear is going to be one of the
biggest things to happen at Aoife we do
predict this we do expect to other
companies to adopt Android wear or
whatever operating systems they want and
push the SmartWatch market forward as
this is another opportunity area even
though smartwatches aren't really
selling what we need is better
smartwatches probably better price
points and obviously competition is
going to drive this number 4 let's talk
about microsoft and windows phone one of
the biggest things we're waiting for
this year is more with those phones
Windows Phone 8.1 is already out there
we haven't seen any products we already
heard teasers that Microsoft is waiting
to announce windows 9 and Windows Phone
9 in the next couple of weeks and yeah
we should be seeing products at least
that Aoife we are expecting to see this
nokia lumia 830 which is interesting
because uh first of all we see the
camera hump this apparently is a lumia
1020 but it's not and then again we also
have the successor to Lumia 720 which is
apparently going to the ax selfie phone
so yeah a lot can happen from Windows
Phone we are expecting to see more
Hardware stay tuned for that number
three we've got Sony and it's bachelor
products we hear that there is a sony
xperia z3 tablet compact my god what a
name there is another SmartWatch here
and the works we're not sure if this
will be running Android as the peeri
vyas smartwatches from sony or we will
be getting Android wear this time of the
biggest product is the Sony Xperia z3
mainly because of its design it looks
hot it's everything that we've ever
wanted and phone specifically when it
comes to design and everything
apparently a lot of the quirks from the
z2 will be solved in the z3 which is
just a
months back so yeah we are expecting to
see this xperia z3 and a whole batch of
products that revolve around it
hopefully Sony figures out a way to make
you want to buy all three products this
time because currently it doesn't really
matter if you have a sony tablet and a
sony watch that's not good number two
let's talk about motorola and HTC we're
gonna have to merge these boner bola is
going to have an event in Chicago our
own Adam doubt we'll be covering it live
so we are expecting to see the Moto X
plus 1 whatever name they'll be getting
this product the google nexus x if it's
going to be a separate product as we do
here the motorola quark whatever that
name is and we are expecting to see the
successor to the Moto G so these are
cool products that will happen in
Chicago at the time of Aoife in addition
to hcc which has also been teasing
smartphones to happen at Aoife as well
so we will be covering everything
separately but live and on time for you
we'll keep you posted on that way in the
top number one prediction for Aoife 2014
as samsung the company has always taken
the cake with its note lineup for the
past three years and we're expecting
them to do the same this time we're
expecting a fingerprint scanner on this
note a waterproof design hopefully and
we are expecting a new little chassis
with a rubber or leather or whatever
type of back on this product in addition
to other Samsung products will probably
see some tablets here and there we know
about the gear s as well but that leads
me to the question of this top 5 which
do you think will be the top player for
Eva 2014 because in my case honestly I
think it will be Samsung i'm a big fan
of the note lineup and this is something
that i want to see but leave us a
comment down below what are your
predictions thats it for our top 5 thank
