now calm and we're going to do a quick
comparison between the dell venue pro
and the HTC hd7 both available on
t-mobile so let's check them out so here
we have the dell venue pro on the left
and the HTC hd7 on the right and first
off you can see the lock screen you can
tell the difference in the screen this
one is a AMOLED screen and this one is a
railer LCD you can see the color is
quite different and we have very deep
blacks over here let's check out the
hardware too so over here my new Pro
really nice build very shiny we have a
gorilla glass curved screen there really
looks great and of course we have a
qwerty keyboard nice little thumb
keyboard they're really nice 5-megapixel
camera single LED flash you've seen all
this before we got fingerprints and the
hd7 both have capacitive buttons this is
a flat screen on the back is a rubbery
texture so less fingerprints and you got
a kickstand 5 megapixel camera and dual
LED flash and let's look at them
together it comes to thickness obviously
the venue pro is going to be thicker
because I was keyboard there and
size-wise the hd7 is a 4.3 inch screen
whereas the venue pro is a 4.1 inch
screen so you can see the difference
there
now software wise both are running
windows phone 7 and it's either both
really quick the venue pro only has 256
megs of ram while the hd7 has 512 but
you really won't be able to notice at
all because Windows Phone 7 really
doesn't do multitasking so doesn't
matter how much RAM you put in there
really it's very lightweight and managed
so you're looking at both of these have
the same theme you can see the colors
look different still but let me look at
a picture here's the pictures hub you
zoom in a little bit more so this one
looks pretty good a little washed out
with the color and the venue pro we're
seeing banding happening here see that
so that's kind of a pain but the color
looks better on the venue pro so there
we are with that now let's see how
quickly the camera will launch so we're
gonna go off
and they both come up real quick however
I take a picture here that one works
nope you can see our picture quality is
much different the hd7 is very pink
another thing that that's different
about these two the camera button on the
venue pro is very easy to press I can
tell that's a half press and that's full
press HD 7 on the other hand is very
tiny and it takes a lot to press that's
the half press maybe and then you really
have to press it hard to take picture
and see that any of the work so when you
press a holiday of shakes so that gets
you uh blurry pictures pretty easily
same with the power button that's very
very hard to press where's this one and
a pretty easy part button there alright
so next let's look at software the venue
pro comes with newsroom tell an app gps
family room personal finance program
those are two from dell and two from
t-mobile i also get t mobile TV they're
in my account those are the regular t
mobile apps and that's about it for what
is bundled and on the hd7 i already have
other things load here but you also get
the same t mobile apps family room t
mobile TV the my account those are all
there but on the hd7 you also get some
cool HTC apps
so these you won't be able to get on the
dell venue pro at the HTC how we got a
sound enhancer you got the special
youtube app from HTC a lot of extra
stuff that you can get with the HTC the
photo enhancer is cool note stocks so
those are some things you won't get on
the dell
but in terms of performance are both
really quick want to see your schooner
screen rotation
oh the venue pro is a little bit slower
maybe it's just the sensitivity anyway
both of these only work on tmobile and
you can only get the dell through the
dell website but you can get the hd7
from any store the hd7 is 199 with a
two-year contract the venue pro comes in
two models an eight gig 499 or a 16 gig
for 149 available from the dell website
the hd7 is only 16 gig and both are
running windows phone 7 really nicely so
I hope that gives you some choices as to
which one you might like better and I
hope you enjoyed this video and that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
