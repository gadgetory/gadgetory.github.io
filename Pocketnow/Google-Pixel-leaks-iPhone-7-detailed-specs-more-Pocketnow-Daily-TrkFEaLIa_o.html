launcher is the latest batch of rumors
Samsung doesn't seem to be having a good
time in getting approval for the note 7
replacements and we get more details on
the hidden specifications of the iphone
7 iphone 7 plus i'm hi mary vetta
wanting to boldly go where i could
pretty much record this video without
complaining about the monday this is
sparking out daily official news today
begin with a little drama if you've
received an email from samsung asking
you to switch off your galaxy note 7 i
did too and i followed instructions
that's because the cpsc already got
involved and once this government entity
becomes part of the deal this is not
good news for Sami we're not exactly
sure how long it will take for the
future batch of notes Evans to get
approved meaning you're probably better
off going for a galaxy s7 or something
in my case because i have an s7 i have
to wait for the future note 7 i will let
you know if i'm able to swap my unit now
as will the spotlight over to Apple the
company that has not yet had battery
problems with its new batch of iphones
we hear some hints pacific asians now
that the vices are uncertificated the
case of the iphone 7 we hear a growth up
to a 1960 milliamp hour battery which is
a ten percent growth then in the case of
the iphone 7 plus a 2900 milliamp hour
battery now these numbers sounds small
but we know that devices like the iphone
7 plus have become the battery life king
so let's see if Apple does walk the talk
when it comes to its claims that the
next batch of iPhones will have great
battery life and for those of you that
were disappointed at the apple event
overseeing pok√©mons go come just to the
Apple watch well we've got some trusted
sources claiming that the code within
this whole batch of new updates to
Pokemon go is actually also being
planned for Android wear now the fact
that Pokemon go made it to an apple
presentation means that there is some
level of exclusivity here not exactly
sure how long but we will keep you
posted now let's talk about Google for
those of you that have been waiting for
the new Google now launcher for your
Android devices
I think the reason why we still don't
have it is because it's changing name
and we cannot wait to see the final
version but apparently it's going to be
called a pixel launcher because pixel is
apparently the way that Google wants to
call its new batch of products which
actually leads me to the next news
that's coming up which is something that
we highly discussed as well because yeah
the hottest news today have to do with
some leaked renders that show us pretty
much everything we should expect from
the future Google pixel sailfish
whatever the phone is going to be called
next is no more we see no branding that
says next is apparently pixel is the way
to go now exactly sure if this name is
actually a good change nor the design
that we see in these renders because hey
it leads me to the question of the day
and I'm actually going to send you to
number one do you think that pixel is
better than nexus as a name and to do
you agree or not the Nexus devices have
always been dull in the front design
because in my case I prefer Nexus and I
do wish that Google did something
different about their front designs but
it was a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends you know the
way it goes if you want to get the news
earlier before the video was filmed
