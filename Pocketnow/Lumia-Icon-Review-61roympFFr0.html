we spent the week using it and testing
it and now it's time to see what we
really think of it I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow and this is our full
review of the Nokia Lumia icon for
Verizon Wireless the hardware portion of
a Lumia icon is up for much debate
there's a large bit of subjectiveness to
its appearance your fan of industrial
box the understated hardware the icon is
near perfection on the other hand if
you're more into nokia standard design
flashy circus peanut style handsets this
phone may not strike you as gorgeous
frankly we love both styles
either way it's impossible to overlook
how solid the hardware is or the sheer
attention to detail a subtle taper of
the glass on all sides creates an
alluring effect the slight curve on the
back helps the phone slip into the palm
of your hand and the metal trim aids in
making the home fill as premium as they
come on 166 grams it's new lightweight
but its heft helped add to how
substantial the phone feels in hand it's
a tank that reeks of quality and its
physical footprint for a 5-inch device
is pretty standard it's a hundred and
thirty seven millimeters tall 71
millimeters wide in nine point eight
millimeters thick its specifications are
comparable to many of the bests flagship
Android smartphones it's equipped with 2
gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of
thick storage it has a Snapdragon 800
SOC close to a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core
Krait 400 CPU and Adreno 330 GPU in 2420
million power battery 20 megapixel
optically stabilized camera in a 5-inch
1080p third black AMOLED display and it
comes with a now standard our school of
connectivity options Bluetooth 4.0
Verizon LTE
NFC chip wireless charging and Wi-Fi HD
but let's take it back just a step and
focus on the display for a minute
it's gorgeous the higher density display
is perfect for window so in the short
text and home screen tiles are welcomed
the viewing angles are fantastic it's
incredibly bright and Apple visibility
is especially great thanks to what Nokia
calls sunlight readability enhancements
we have no complaints with the Lumia
icons display and so long as you're okay
with the supersaturated nature of
ellipse tile displays you won't either
we've always felt the AMOLED display
perfectly complements the modern UI of
Windows Phone the pitch black splendid -
the bezels the whites on this display
are very balanced and the extreme
saturation makes the tiles of the home
screen pop overall we'd say this is the
best built Windows Phone yet it's
excruciating ly solid and we're quite
impressed with all aspects of this one
hardware software however will be hit or
miss with potential buyers
the Lumia iPhone is running Windows
Phone 8 GDR 3 with the Lumia black
update essentially the software is
identical to every other Windows hold
smartphone except for a few
discrepancies being a Lumia device it
has access to all of the Nokia's
specific apps which actually come
pre-installed bokya camera cinemagraph
care map sphere Drive creative studio
leaks radio and mineral a major
difference since the icon is clipped
with a 1080p display is the density of
the homescreen tiles more tiles can be
placed on the home screen and we love
how it handles the additional real
estate this makes dealing with no
dedicated Notification Center a little
better
sorted also there's no glance feature on
the icon a feature of Nokia's Lumia
devices which many love that also means
a DoubleTap of the display when the
phone is in standby will not power the
device while the Windows Phone software
is gradually maturing as is its
application offering but it's still
missing some key features like a
dedicated notification page quick access
to settings and a decent voice assistant
fortunately all those are believed to be
included in the forthcoming 8.1 update
performance as per usual for Windows
Phone is great on the icon it's not
bragging 800 paired with the RT buttery
smooth Windows Phone experience makes
for excellent performance we haven't
noticed any instances of lag performance
hiccups or other problems the software
performance of this phone is top-notch
network speeds have also been
spectacular here in the Charlotte metro
area using Verizon to network we average
rate downlink and updating speeds
eighteen point two megabits per second
and ten point three megabits per second
respectively call quality has been
exceptional as well the audio quality is
phenomenal thanks to the unique for Mike
rig it has four digital high dynamic
range microphones the earpiece speaker
is markedly clear and callers have no
trouble hearing us even in relatively
noisy areas battery life has been decent
the twenty four twenty milliamp hour
battery is only average-sized these days
and we were afraid the Snapdragon 805
inch 1080p display would be cause for
concern fortunately that was not the
case we've been able to go entire days
on a single charge with no trouble
that's pulling two Twitter accounts and
notifications of two separate Instagram
accounts free email accounts web
browsing benchmarking testing and
playing games reading feeds and more it
isn't the most impressive battery life
ever but you shouldn't need to have to
plug in more than once per day unless
you're going out at night finally one of
the most impressive aspects of the lumia
icon is its image sensing capabilities
no it's 20 megapixel sensor isn't quite
as impressive as the 1020's 41 megapixel
sensor but the effect is essentially the
same by default it stores images in both
5 and 16 megapixel resolutions at 16:9
aspect you can change the 4:3 aspect or
up to 19 megapixel images and you can
select a heavy phone save the digital
negatives if you really want to give it
into post-processing but even the
out-of-the-box settings will suffice for
many the Overson point five megapixel
shots are super sharp and clear colors
are balanced and true to life and we're
happy with the contrast levels and
thanks to oh is low light mode was also
impressive the nokia camera app is
linked to the hardware shutter key by
default and it's easily one of the
biggest selling points of the purview of
smartphones especially for camera
enthusiasts we would however love to see
an automated HDR mode built-in instead
of the exposure bracketing video capture
will create as well the stabilization
did cause some distortion in the video
clips but the audio was absolutely
stellar as wear colors and detail in
fact as a testament to the audio prowess
of the Lumia icon the audio for this
video was recorded using the built-in
microphones
and the audio is something you should
also take note of because this one
should be great
we haven't listened to it on the
computer yet we'll get to that in the
forward you but this thing has four
microphones so it should sound great as
we come over the stream down you should
still be able to hear it
you should still also be able to hear me
over all the lumia icon is one of the
best windows phones we've ever used it's
a testament to Nokia's pension for
quality we're pleased to say CDMA users
finally have a proper Windows Phone
handset which will contest even the
toughest Android competition out there
if you can deal with some of the growing
pains of the Windows Phone operating
system and ecosystem the Lumia icon will
not disappoint and it's camera and audio
performance will make your friends with
other phones jealous for our final score
in a more in-depth look at the Lumia
Nightline stay tuned for our full
written review which will be available
