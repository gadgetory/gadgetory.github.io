pacquiao calm and today I will show you
a view to ski which is a online web cam
viewer on your windows mobile device and
if you are a skier or snowboarder and
seeing that it's approaching winter and
the northern hemisphere I thought that
this program would be relevant so it's
pretty cool because you can actually go
on to most ski resort websites and they
have live video cams and you can
actually go to the beauty ski website
and put in your own video stream so I'm
just going to go into some of the
cameras I'm just going to change my
country first it's going to hear wait
for it to load so as you can see we have
quite a few countries and a lot of
cameras already pre-loaded onto this
program so I'm just going to show you
the ones that I've installed so I'm just
going to United States and then down to
crystal crystal mountain is a pretty big
ski resort here in Washington and here
we have golden hills for Crystal
Mountain so just click on there wait for
the images to load and as you can see it
is 1044 and it's pretty dark outside but
luckily this ski resort has nighttime
ski so I'll just go to the next cam this
is actually at snoqualmie and as you can
see it looks like it's pretty good
skiing so far this time of year let's go
to the next one well it is nighttime so
of course this cam doesn't have any
lights on it silver the next one and as
you can see current driving conditions
at snoqualmie and if at any point we
want to refresh the image all we have to
do is click down here of course some of
the images are not always live this one
is at 10 42 p.m. which is about three
minutes ago so just refresh and see what
it does and as you can see refreshed so
go home and now it from the menu here we
can actually go directly into the
cameras that we're at a minute ago so if
we're just click on camera we can go
into our cameras here go home so this is
vu to ski and the program costs around
four dollars on Windows Mobile
marketplace but a little secret is if
you actually go to the developers
website you can download it for free and
this is another marketplace cake where
we picked some of the best and most
useful applications on windows mobile
marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
