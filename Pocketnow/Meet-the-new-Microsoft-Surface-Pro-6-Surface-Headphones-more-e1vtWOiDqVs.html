wrapped up in New York City and the
company has just surprised this with
some great updates to certain beloved
products and then another that was
completely unexpected reporting from New
York City I'm high metal even at with
pocket now along with Adam Lane and
let's go hands-on let's begin today with
one of my favorite products the
Microsoft Surface pro the company has
decided to go back to using numbers to
designate its version and as of now this
is the surface pro 6 visually it's
pretty much the same computer if you
compare it to last year's model though
now we have the addition of a new finish
the surface pro 6 is still built of a
magnesium alloy but now we have a new
matte black finish that actually looks
really nice and it doesn't pick up
fingerprints that easily the updates
were mainly internal with mentions of
changes to the thermal system for faster
performance we have Intel's new eighth
generation Core i5 and i7 processors and
now quad core which is a first for a
product of its kind Ram options now
range from 8 to 16 gigabytes and storage
options that go from 128 gigs to up to
one terabyte camera seems to be the same
at 8 and 5 megapixels in the combo and
even if Microsoft doesn't really provide
battery specifications we here and then
same 13.5 hours of use the optional
touch cover now has a black color option
and if you want to know what's missing
well USB see like I seriously don't
understand this I mean we have the
surface go with us BC but not in the
surface pro this still remains at USBA
and Microsoft's proprietary surface port
and speaking of the lack of us we see
the new surface laptop just got an
upgrade but it doesn't include USB seek
either we also have the new matte black
finish in the aluminum with the same off
antara fabric on the palm rest now in
black the spec sheet is also pretty much
the same as in the surface pro now
extending capabilities for the quad core
processor
making it up to 85% faster than its
predecessor it with an insane battery
rating of up to fourteen point five
hours now what nobody was expecting was
the new Microsoft Surface headphones
like yeah not sure why they included the
name surface but it's here these are
actually very good-looking cans that
provide 13 levels of active noise
cancellation and you can actually
modulate the intensity through a dial
that's built into the left ear cup with
the other serving for volume controls
and with touch controls for a play/pause
etc we have 40 millimeter free edge
drivers for microphones for noise
canceling and beamforming mics for phone
calls which are also quite useful for
Cortana as it now finally finally works
through bluetooth and then we saw other
updates into products like the surface
studio which oddly does have USB see now
but kind of disappoints us it still
sports last year's processors we heard
talks about an update to Windows 10 that
now allows for better communication with
products like the Microsoft launcher for
Android which is overall very cool
pre-orders for the new surface models
begin today with prices starting at
$8.99 for the pro and $9.99 for the
laptop though the new black color option
is not available in the base models and
as for the new headphones these will
come later this year at an estimated
price of around $350 let us know what
