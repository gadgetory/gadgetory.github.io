parking calm and if you've been
following us on Twitter you know how
convenient it is to stay up to date on
news tips and tricks and software and
the programming show you today is called
tahini and this is a windows mobile
based Twitter program the first thing
you'll see when we load the pages
actually all of our Twitter updates that
we're following so these are people that
we're following on Twitter and these are
all their updates so we can just scroll
down and see what's been going on with
my people we can also tweet ourselves so
if we wanted to post something like an
update or an interesting news article or
something that we found we can do that a
cool thing about this program is that
you can add GPS coordinates and or two
or an address if you have a gps enabled
windows mobile device you can also add
pictures and a short URL I say shortened
URL because this program only allows you
to have 140 characters to type in so
this becomes rather convenient if you're
wanting to post a link just hit cancel
we'll go into the ad experience right
here and this is your username so at
experiences me and these are replies
that people have posted to my posts on
Twitter so you can see some of them that
have posted here and some of these faces
look pretty familiar of course as you
can tell these are pocketing out people
can also go to direct messages and this
is like an email setup for Twitter so
these are private messages that people
posted directly to you that aren't
displayed on your Twitter page you can
also go into favorites so if you have
something that you found interesting on
Twitter that you like to say you can do
that from here you can also go into
public timeline and these are the
updated posts as you can see some of
them are just one or two seconds long
these are the the newest posts on
Twitter that people post you from around
the world so if you want to see what's
going on in the world you can do that
from here can also refresh and switch
accounts so if we wanted to go to my
pocket now tweets account i can do that
pretty easily just by clicking one
button we can see what people post it on
our parking out tweets we'll just go
back
you can also go under tools and go to
user so if we wanted to go to a user if
I you know user's name I can just type
it directly in here and it will actually
go to that user so just cancel and if I
click on one of the user profiles here I
can see what the latest post is and I
can go down here and go to user and see
the profile and it shows me how many
people are following and how many people
parking out tweets is following
themselves it also gives you their
website we can update that also you can
also go under tools and go to options
and this allows us to change some of our
display so if I wanted to change the
font size or the theme if I want to
select a different seat theme like a
Seattle I can do that you can also see
if you want to display full names or
just screen names just click done and
you can automatically fresh so every
five it set for every 15 minutes you
play a sound win it and you can also
disable refresh when you're roaming so
just click done you can go to data and
download to it you can see that it down
will download the latest tweets so you
can have up to two hundred tweets and
also download images if you select that
as well and it will also give you your
cash information so we can either clear
it or just cancel
you can also set feedback so if I wanted
to send a message directly to the
developers of bikini I can do that and
give my GPS coordinates so they know
where I'm coming from was it canceled it
also gives you the ability to check for
updates so if I wanted to look for
updates it'll launch our default
internet browser and we had the latest
version running of course we'll just
close that the program does come with a
14-day trial but the prices range from 0
if you want to post a link of twix he
needa rectly from your website up to
nine dollars and ninety-five cents so i
will post a link and puffing out our
comments on how to get this and remember
to follow us on pucking out tweets
