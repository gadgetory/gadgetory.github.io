the love of giant screens and no need
for a stylus on your handheld device
then you might find yourself in the
market for one of these super phones
each one is almost a miniature tablet
with a massive display and powerful
media features but you're not going to
buy both so which one is right for you
let's try to find out I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow and this is HTC One
max versus samsung galaxy mega we've
already reviewed each of these phones
separately and we've also compared the
one max with the differently classed
galaxy note 3 check out our social feeds
to find those and subscribe here on
YouTube so you don't miss future videos
this comparison makes much more sense
from a head-to-head perspective because
the mega and the max are extensions of
the same idea done differently they're
not quite tablet replacements but
they're also much more than smartphones
that means in terms of hardware that
they're both incredibly oversized
one-handed use is challenging on these
phones if not impossible you don't feel
the Edit acreage as much on the Galaxy
mega due to its lower mass and its
rounded corners but it's hyper glazed
plastic finish doesn't feel quite as
premium as the one Max's aluminum
backplate the max is thicker than the
mega but it uses that inflated body size
to greater advantage it's actually a few
millimeters shorter than the mega
despite the inclusion of HTC's trademark
boom sound speakers which we love the
primary reason behind that oversized
hardware here is the huge screens
Samsung's contender is the larger one by
nearly half an inch but it suffers
elsewhere on the spec sheet
it's a 720p panel - the one Max's 1080p
screen meaning the htc screen features a
hundred and forty more pixels every inch
that's a significant bump and if you get
up real close yes you can make out the
difference but look Samsung's been in
the screen building business a long time
and it shows the Megas display actually
holds up quite well well enough next to
the max that you're not
likely to notice the difference unless
you're actually trying to find it or you
typically hold your smartphone 1/2 inch
from your eyeball around back we find a
nice change of pace in HTC's corner the
one max is back cover is removable an
on-board storage can be augmented with a
micro SD card if you're looking for more
space or a more convenient way to share
of course that's very familiar to our
friends at Samsung who almost always
include the same capability and the
ability to swap out the battery both of
those are present on the mega the
battery is not quite as large on the
mega as on the one max is embedded pack
but the fact that it's removable is a
big boon to road warriors because our
test devices aren't uneven ground in
terms of Radio load we weren't able to
do meaningful battery testing see our
full reviews of these devices for them
that said these are huge batteries and
both of them should last most users of a
full day or more those more concerned
with security than endurance might find
the one Max's fingerprint scanner ample
compensation for its slight battery
handicap but considering the scanners
hit and miss functionality we wouldn't
exactly call that a SquareTrade
fortunately for HTC the one max does win
in terms of raw horsepower the
Snapdragon 600 SOC powering the max is
decidedly higher end than the Snapdragon
400 of the mega and the max also packs
more RAM than the mega elsewhere the
feature sets settle into a more or less
common ground with Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC
and even IR features almost identical
between these monsters dive into the
software on each of these though and
identical will be the last word on your
mind we've gone into the differences
between HTC's Sense and TouchWiz many
times before most notably in our
comparisons of the one max with the note
3 and the galaxy mega with the HTC One
frankly it doesn't take a long look to
see what design philosophies fuel these
skins the HTC opted for restraint with
the Sense skin bathing the experience in
dark tones and understated design
elements and Samsung took the opposite
route prioritizing color and feature
density over minimalism that means we
find the one max the more enjoyable
device to use
on the whole it's more responsive more
consistent and aesthetically we prefer
it especially given the new touches in
cents 5.5 like the improved gallery and
blinkfeed social browser
Samsung has equivalent features yes but
it's ugly and sluggish gallery is
nowhere near in the same league as HTC s
and using a Flipboard widget on a
dedicated homescreen on the mega isn't
quite as streamlined as blinkfeed
on the Macs that said the mega does come
away the victor in a very important area
intelligent use of screen real estate
not only can you use the mega in
landscape orientation on the home screen
like the small tablet it is but you can
also use Samsung's multi window feature
to run two apps side by side at the same
time that may not be your bag but it
comes in handy if you want to say browse
your pictures while carrying on a
conversation in hangouts or search
Google Maps for a recommendation you've
just found on a forum in Chrome it comes
in handy when you least expect it and
the fact that the one max doesn't offer
a comparable feature is unfortunate no
matter how smooth it is in daily
operation moving on to performance these
may technically be smartphones but
you're never going to want to bring
these things up to your face to make a
call the one max being slightly narrower
it's a bit less absurd to handle but
then it's heavier and it's aluminum
chassis is a bit more slick so the whole
thing is awkward if you do end up going
this route though the voice quality will
be comparable between the two with the
mega offering slightly better noise
cancellation surprisingly the
speakerphone performance isn't all that
different either at least in terms of
amplitude the Megas rear firing speaker
manages to hold its own against HTC
boomsound in terms of loudness but it's
definitely not as dynamic as the one
Max's dual front firing speakers which
we continue to prefer overall in our
book the one max is still the phone to
beat for speakerphone audio quality
taking photos with these devices is
equally awkward due to their size and
their lack of optical image
stabilization means you'll want to keep
them steady if you can
the Megas camera enjoys double the
resolution of the unit on the one max
then by and large it delivers better
results white balance is better in most
situations without the wild swings and
exposure characteristic of HTC cameras
the Megas higher resolution means it can
render more detail in close-up shots but
samsung's trademark over saturation is
definitely an evidence here as well also
the one max beats out the mega in
low-light shots even using Samsung's
night mode on the mega didn't yield
nearly as much detail as the one Max was
able to render we like the one max as
wider field of view as well moving over
to video the wider angle is one of the
only things we like about the one max
over the mega audio quality is muffled
compared to the Samsung device and
saturation is much lower with slower
autofocus and auto exposure corrections
as well
once a day so I'll talk over it and
hopefully we will talk over it and
hopefully we were able to determine
exactly which phone delivers superior
audio with an MBTA commuter rail train
running by let's head on back to our
macro check finally the raw performance
metrics you'll get from benchmarks
predictably favor the one max with its
more advanced processor and indeed frame
rates do suffer a bit on the mega in
some very high demand tests and games
but we were surprised to find that we
could still run well made high strain
games like asphalt 8 just fine on the
Galaxy mega where they played about as
well as they did on the one max
obviously this will only apply to
certain titles but it's yet another
real-world example of why you shouldn't
put specs above all to be honest we
expected this to be a bigger slam-dunk
in the 1 Max's favor
it's the contender with the superior
processor display and acoustics and it's
all wrapped up in an aluminium shell
that feels much more premium than same
old Samsung's glossy plastic but the
Megas removable battery superior camera
surprisingly good voice quality and an
interface that better leverages its huge
screen size mean you shouldn't count out
the Samsung device if you're in the
market for a huge mid-range super pump
that's a big if though we're still
really not sold on the merits of this
product category if you're looking for
more than a smart phone we'd still
recommend you go all out and get
Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 if on the other
hand a top-notch smartphone in a normal
size is more your speed you'd be
hard-pressed to find a more well rounded
phone than the original HTC One if
you're still thinking of buying one of
these devices let us know down in the
comments drop us a line let us know what
you're thinking is which one you're
