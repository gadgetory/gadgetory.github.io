brought us the original Atrix a high-end
Android smartphone with a lot of
innovative features less than a year
later they brought us the Atrix 2 which
carried almost as many down grades as it
did upgrades and today we have the third
iteration of the Atrix line does this
newest device enhance the prestige of
the Atrix brand and bring it back to
prominence or does it just keep dragging
it through the mud of mediocrity
let's find out I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow comm and this is the
Motorola Atrix HD full review let's
check it out
we've been reviewing a lot of hardware
from Samsung from HTC and other overseas
OEMs here in PocketNow boston offices so
it's nice to get our hands on some
motorola hardware so we can see how
American Hardware stacks up against
those competitors I used to sell
Motorola handsets when I worked at
Nextel so it's been interesting to see
how Motorola's current Hardware measures
up against their past offerings and on
the hardware side this device has been
quite a treat while the Samsung Galaxy
s3 doesn't feel quite as cheap and
flimsy as some other phones it's
definitely not a phone you feel like you
can beat up by any means and like many
other phones it's covered in that glossy
coating that scratches easily by
contrast the Atrix HD feels built to
last with a substantial feeling in the
hand reminiscent of the Droid RAZR MAXX
it weighs about 140 grams which is
actually pretty standard but the
materials feel very robust we've got
Corning Gorilla Glass up front here
covering the four point five inch TFT
LCD LCD panel just one LCD there and
around the back the casing is covered in
a kevlar micro weave pattern that you
can see up close here that Motorola has
just stolen right from its own Droid
Razr line that I mentioned a second ago
the casing flares out more gradually
than it does on the right
giving the phone a thicker feeling
overall but it also rests very very
nicely in the hand overall so that's not
a bad thing down in front here we've got
the AT&amp;amp;T branding below the display I
like it because it's subtle but it's
also very easy to mistake for a home
button so some people may be annoyed by
that above the display here is the
Motorola branding the earpiece 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera and
there's a hidden LCD down there as well
off to the right here are the power
button and volume keys these are plastic
so they feel a little on the cheap side
but the power button is ridged so it's
easy to tell apart from the volume
rocker by feel that's a very nice touch
returning to the back side here we
revisit the Kevlar microwave which just
gives this device such a nice unique
look and a great smooth feel in the hand
under it is a 1780 milliamp hour non
removable battery and above it we have
this big lens for the 8 megapixel camera
the LED flash and the speakerphone grill
at the top and at the bottom barely
visible here are two out of the three
microphones that drive the crystal
talked plus noise reduction feature more
on that a little bit later and the left
side here there's not much to talk about
except the micro SD and micro SIM card
slots living under this shared door
that's microSD expansion up to 32
gigabytes and finally up top we've got
ports for the micro USB HDMI out and the
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack a little side note the micro USB
port on our device was very particular
about what it liked it didn't really
appreciate other chargers very much
especially not our portable power pack
that caused us some problems considering
this battery is as we mentioned non
removable you may want to stock up on
stock motorola chargers just in case if
you are a power user otherwise the
device is finished in Motorola's nano
coating which protects it from splashes
which is a very very nice touch overall
the Atrix HD feels a bit like a beefed
up razor or razor max
with the slightly budget feel because of
its blessed aggressive styling it's more
exciting than the Atrix to was and it
feels reassuringly durable but it's not
gonna win any beauty contests underneath
all that we're looking at some pretty
respectable specs the Atrix HD runs a
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
at 1.5 gigahertz backed up by one gig of
ram there's eight gigs of storage only
4.7 of which is user accessible so it's
a good thing there's that 32 gigabyte
microSD expansion option a quick word
about that LCD panel this is a display
with very very high pixel density and it
matches or beats the iPhone 4 and 4s
Retina display it's sharp its colorful
thanks to Motorola's color boost and
it's pretty bright the only complaints I
have are it's daylight performance and
it's blacks reproduction which could be
better but that's the case with most
LCDs the screen on this device is
definitely one of its high points so
that's what's under the hood let's talk
about what all that hardware is running
motorola has included a very close to
stock build of Android ICS 4.4 with the
Atrix HD it's one of the few non Nexus
phones so far to ship with the Nexus
like Android soft keys set of capacitive
Hardware buttons but it's not stock ICS
and it only takes a quick look at the
homescreen to realize that in this case
it's a good thing the lock screen gives
you the option to jump directly into the
phone the messaging or the camera
applications in addition to just the
straight unlock the phone and the good
times do continue when you do unlock the
phone and end up at the home screen when
you're getting rid of all the bloat try
to resist the urge to throw this handy
widget out with the bathwater here these
bubbles are actually quite useful
showing you digital and analog time the
weather in multiple cities and your
battery life and data allotment here in
addition to a shortcut to the settings
menu the big one here also displays your
last text or missed call which is really
really handy it's a very handy little
widget overall and we like it a lot
other elements closely resemble stock
ice-cream sandwich like the launcher
here with the widgets and the separate
tab and the notification drawer which
has the swipe of all notification
dismissal there but there are other
little nice touches throughout the OS
any icon with these little arrows
displayed next to it is swipeable so
it's expandable if you swipe up instead
of tapping on it you get a nice little
preview pane with for example in this
case your text messages and we haven't
actually opened the app we can tap out
to get back out of it same with the
phone app where you can see your missed
calls we're not actually opening these
apps we're just opening a little preview
pane that's very handy and very very
useful and of course there's the smart
actions that Motorola popularized with
the razor line for custom rules that
governs the phone's behavior so that you
can save power in various situations and
so forth
unfortunately not all of Motorola's
software work has enhanced the Android
experience in short the Atrix HD is
laggy it's odd because on the spec side
it's plenty powerful and it did just
fine on our series of benchmarks so it
should be able to handle Android just
fine but it can't lag is persistent
throughout the UI especially in the
multitasking view which is being quick
now of course because we've got the
camera on it but it often takes several
seconds just to appear very very
annoying and there's also a very
annoying scroll lag in the stock browser
where taps are excuse me swipes are
sometimes interpreted as taps that's
very very irritating
once again we're faced with an OEM that
couldn't resist tampering with the stock
keyboard Motorola's implementation isn't
as bad as the one we ran into on the
highway p1 ascend but it's not good by
any means out of the box haptic feedback
was turned down almost all the way and
there was no audio feedback so it was
hard to know when a key had actually
been pressed also the device would
constantly miss keystrokes that even
moderate typing speeds switching the
keyboard out for the stock ICS keyboard
immediately solved our problems but we
shouldn't have had to do that just like
we shouldn't have to install Swift key
manufacturers there are better ways to
differentiate than to meddle with the
keyboard by making it worse the stock
ICS keyboard is wonderful please leave
it alone our real-world testing of the
Atrix HD revealed something of a mixed
bag across the board depending on what
feature of the phone you're talking
about battery life was in line with most
other mid-range Android smartphones
we've tested which is to say mildly
disappointing more disappointing is the
camera performance which leaves a lot to
be desired
despite that big lens and the beefy 8
megapixels on the spec sheet shots often
come out either over or underexposed and
those are due to bad automatic exposure
settings where this can be corrected for
on other devices through the use of an
HDR setting that's not true on the Atrix
HD HDR is inexplicably absent these
problems persist in the video camera
which also has trouble with automatic
white balance and exposure compared to
higher end cameras like that of the
galaxy s3 or even the Droid Incredible
4G LTE now where the phone shined was in
voice calls
Motorola's crystal talk plus a noise
reduction isn't just a brand name it
really works wonderfully data speeds
over 18 T's LTE network were excellent
in the Greater Boston area we
experienced great coverage and
outstanding throughput both on the phone
and while tethering the phone also ran
games just fine explained 9 is my go-to
tester and it handled that alright it's
true that X plane isn't the most
demanding of games but if you're a gamer
you're not going to be buying this
mid-range phone anyway the Atrix HD is
available through AT&amp;amp;T with a two-year
contract for $99 so should you buy it
well it's got robust hardware and it
brings the razor design aesthetic to
AT&amp;amp;T from Verizon
it's got great voice performance and the
LTE speeds are awesome and $99 is a good
price
but the software problems in particular
the lag aren't something I would want to
deal with over the course of a two-year
contract true there will probably be a
bug-fix release at some point to fix
some of those issues but it's tough to
know exactly when or if that'll happen
OTA fixes tend to be unpredictable no
matter what om you're talking about so
without knowing that it's really tough
to recommend the Atrix HD we want to
love it because of its hardware but the
software just isn't fully baked enough
for us to do that not yet we give the
Motorola Atrix HD a three out of five
