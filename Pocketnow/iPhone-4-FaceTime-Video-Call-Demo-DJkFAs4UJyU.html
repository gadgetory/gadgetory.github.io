give you a call back so let's go ahead
and go through the process of what it's
like to make a call so it's similar to
making a call as you would on a current
iPhone but we're going to do is call
folly who is on the other side of the
hallway so what it's doing now is just
using the cellular network to make a
voice call so we'll wait for this to go
ahead and connect hey Holly let's do a
little bit of FaceTime so what I do is I
just press on the FaceTime button it
sends her a request which she can accept
or deny
we shall make sense hey how's it going
how's your end of the hall great we got
a reporter here with me hey Jason
oh my gosh it's a double whammy so a
couple of great features of face time is
you can move this window and window
around so if it's more convenient to
have it in another corner or down in the
bottom very easy to do additionally it
supports both landscape or portrait
modes and right now we're in portrait
and what we can do is flip it on its
side so she's flipping her phone as well
but if we're on the same orientation it
should fill out the screen as it's doing
now and then another really great
feature we like is for example if I want
to show her what's on the other side of
the camera I can just push this button
and it switches the view from the front
facing camera to the back facing camera
so exciting does it look lots of people
down on this end I know pretty cool huh
and then I'll just flip this back around
so that she's viewing us again and then
go back into portrait mode
thank you you're welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
