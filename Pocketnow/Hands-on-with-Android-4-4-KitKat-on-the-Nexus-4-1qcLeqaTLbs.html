released but unless you've already got a
nexus 5 in hand you probably don't have
it luckily there are some builds out
there that you can put on your own
device like we did with our Nexus 4 to
get the Android KitKat experience there
I'm Joe Levi for Pocket now let's go
hands-on with KitKat on the Nexus 4 this
is my Nexus 4 and I'm running an AO SP
version of Android 4.4 it is running a
kernel version at 3 point 4.0 not some
of the rumors that we're going to make a
big jump up in that and you can see kind
of what we've got down here this is not
the official ROM there are going to be
some some hiccups and some things that
aren't going to be there when the
official rom comes out for this let's go
ahead and get started first of all we
tap on the Android version we get a nice
big K we press and hold and we get
Android there's also a kind of fun
little thing that we can get to
sometimes I can get to it sometimes I
can't long press there see if we can
long press again and now here's our
little immersive game with all the
versions of Android that you can just
tap why not the first time you run this
it tells you to get out of this mode you
want to swipe down from the top and that
will bring up your your buttons animated
up from the bottom I think that's kind
of a hint at the immersive mode that is
supposed to be coming in Android 4.4
let's go back into settings first of all
settings themselves here's our
notification shade and our quick toggles
so pretty much what we're used to
location has a new icon which ironically
looks exactly like it should be it's no
longer a GPS satellite or an x marks the
spot or a target it's now and I am here
location pin finally that makes sense
and it works settings is now a cog looks
a little bit different than it did
before up here you can see that as well
it kind of carries through everything is
pretty much the same there are of course
some changes in here go into more you
can see just a little bit of stuff down
here new mobile plan is listed t-mobile
doesn't have any provisioning website
for it so it's not going to show you
anything there unfortunately so we'll
just go right past that Bluetooth it
looks almost identical we come on down
here we now have a home which we can
quickly and easily choose our launcher
and even get rid of one this is just the
stock launcher that comes with AOSP
coming on down here we have a tap and
pay this has a link that says learn more
mine doesn't do anything if yours does
post it down in the comment let us know
what it does for you there theoretically
this would integrate with Google Wallet
I've installed Google Wallet but there's
no cross integration at least not on
this ROM location we've shown you this
in the past we have a mode up here and
that's really all you need to worry
about is that mode you can come into
high accuracy battery saving or device
only kind of interesting the way that
they've decided to use that and I don't
know why a high accuracy should be
everything or device only and then you
should have battery saving as two
options so it kind of is interesting
that they've separated them out that way
but they have then you've got recent
requests for your location so you can
see what apps are trying to find out
where you are location services right
now Google location reporting is on and
Google search and Google Play services
have both used the low battery version
of finding out where I am so it's just
kind of a rough location but I can see
what apps are finding out where I am
right here quickly easily and if there's
anything suspicious in there I can take
action on it you can also quickly turn
it off if you want to coming back in
here just continue heading down same
accounts section that we are already
used to pretty much the same thing that
you are used to seeing there of course
as you add new services you'll get new
items in here like Dropbox and whatnot
we now have printing which does that I'm
sure it's supposed to do more than that
but right now just as that that tells me
that I need to go to the Play Store I
need to download an app Google Cloud
Print or something or somebody else's
cloud printing service and then
theoretically that's going to show up
here in this list and I'll be able to
select defaults and make changes and I
don't know we'll have to see how that
turns out but that's where you get
and then of course we've already shown
you about phone so that's the nuts and
bolts back in there show you that and
just you know regular stuff that we're
already used to nothing big there before
I jump into the home let's go into the
app drawer first of all you'll notice
there is no more apps and widgets that's
gone you also now have no little icon up
here to jump quickly and easily to the
Play Store that's interesting because I
got really used to that and it was right
there now I have to go and find it
alphabetically in the list but that's
what they've done you can see I've just
installed a very slim set of my favorite
apps this is still rooted so I bear that
in mind when you're watching everything
that goes through here I haven't done
anything special
with with supersu you know a completely
empty list so but it's they're coming
back in here you'll notice now that
still has kind of the animation icon or
the animation to it the zoom in zoom out
and that's pretty much it
very basic very simple we've got five
icons across and five icons down
easy-cheesy okay good now the fun part
you want to add something to the home
screen and it's an app you can do that
easily let's go ahead and put maps same
way that you're used to just like that
if you want to do that to another page
you can do that just like that now if
you notice down here on my little dots
and not my messages
my little dots to indicate what page I'm
on I have four home screens this one
that one my main one and then Google+
yes it's now Google+ downside to doing
Google+ this way is if you want to
dismiss these cards that way you can't
because it takes you back to your home
screen you now have to do it the other
way to dismiss it which is okay I just
kind of got used to flinging back and
forth and if I do that now it's not
gonna let me do it oh well it's the cost
of progress you can still get into it by
pulling up from the bottom it just does
the animation off to the side as well so
kind of interesting that they did that
back to our little icons down here let's
say I don't want to have four screens I
just want to have
three I move that back there and now you
notice I now only have three there's
nothing off to the side anymore so it
automatically adds those does that go on
forever I don't know yet I've only done
a maximum before and if you want to play
with it and let us know how many you
have feel free let us know down in the
comments next how do we change wallpaper
and get widgets to tap and hold just
like that and now you can thumb through
here kind of honeycomb like remember
when we could do this in honeycomb when
we have this kind of dock or this tray
down at the bottom well now we can do
the same thing here with KitKat we can
go into wallpapers and for some reason
that didn't do anything for me
wallpapers will launch the wallpaper
picker and everything is in here all of
your wallpapers including your live
wallpaper all in one big long list so
you don't have to know the difference
between them they're all just wallpapers
you set it and there you go just quick
easy simple just like that next up in
there we've got widgets tap on that here
your widgets you can you know quickly
and easily grab one just like you'd used
to tap it drag it wherever you want you
still have the widgets that scoot out of
the way the icons scoot out of the way
to make room for it really quick really
easy a simple way to do it last but not
least is we have settings so you can get
settings all about in this case Google
now and just kind of basic stuff that
you can do with your launcher right here
another fun thing is and I've used this
long enough that I no longer have this
little animation up in here that tells
you stuff to say I'm not going to say it
right now because then it'll do stuff
little animation that pops out and says
save this keyword and it does stuff so
we can and it's listening at least we
thought it was only going to be the
Nexus 5 that was listening this is a
nexus 4 and okay google what's the
weather goingto be like today just as
easy as that you can see I've got an
always-on at least when I'm on one of my
home screens listener
okay Google how tall is the Empire State
Building
just as easy as that again coming back
and I know I can continue searching from
that screen I'm just trying to show you
here I'm not touching the phone just
saying okay Google call Texas Roadhouse
steakhouse so quickly and easily from my
home screen I can very very conveniently
get to all kinds of stuff and use the
power that is in Google now without
leaving that home screen in fact without
even touching the home screen very
convenient I like it and I've already
impressed my friends with it so there
you go so that's been a first look at
KitKat on the Nexus 4 it is by no means
official code there is lots and lots of
rough edges that you're going to run
into I'm getting a calendar err about
every five minutes that having been said
the overall experience is very nice it's
smooth its fluid I like it and I like
the subtle yet profound changes that are
there but I'm curious to know what you
think head down to the comments let us
know what you thought of the video and
if you've already flashed this on your
phone let us know what you thought of it
there as well if you want to follow us
on social media we are there and we
would love to see you there and carry
the conversation there as well we're on
Facebook we're on Google+ we're on
Instagram we're even at pocket now on
Twitter I'm on Twitter too I'm at Joe
Levi for Pocket now showing off KitKat
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
