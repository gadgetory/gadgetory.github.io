released but unless you've already got a
nexus 5 in hand you probably don't have
it luckily there are some builds out
there that you can put on your own
device like we did with our Nexus 4 to
get the android kitkat experience there
i'm joe levi for pocket now let's go
hands-on with KitKat on the nexus 4 this
is my nexus 4 and i'm running an AOSP
version of android 4.4 it is running a
kernel version at three point 4.0 not
some of the rumors that we're going to
make a big jump up in that and you can
see kind of what we've got down here
this is not the official rom there are
going to be some some hiccups and some
things that aren't going to be there
when the official rom comes out for this
let's go ahead and get started first of
all we tap on the android version we get
a nice big k we press and hold and we
get android there's also a kind of fun
little thing that we can get to
sometimes i can get to it sometimes I
can't long press there see if we can
long press again and now here's our
little immersive game with all the
versions of Android that you can just
tap why not the first time you run this
it tells you to get out of this mode you
want to swipe down from the top and that
will bring up your your buttons animate
it up from the bottom I think that's
kind of a hint at the immersive mode
that is supposed to be coming in android
4.4 let's go back into settings first of
all settings themselves here's our
notification shade and our quick toggles
so pretty much what we're used to
location has a new icon which ironically
looks exactly like it should be it's no
longer a GPS satellite or an x marks the
spot or a target it's now and i am here
location pin finally that makes sense
and it works settings is now a cog looks
a little bit different than it did
before up here you can see that as well
kind of carries through everything is
pretty much the same there are of course
some changes in here go into more you
can see just a little bit of stuff down
here new mobile plan is listed t-mobile
doesn't have any provisioning website
for it so it's not going to show you
in there unfortunately so we'll just go
right past that Bluetooth it looks
almost identical we come on down here we
now have a home which we can quickly and
easily choose our launcher and even get
rid of one this is just the stock
launcher that comes with AOSP coming on
down here we have a tap and pay this has
a link that says learn more mine doesn't
do anything if yours does post it down
in the comment let us know what it does
for you there theoretically this would
integrate with Google Wallet I've
installed google wallet but there's no
cross integration at least not on this
rom location we've shown you this in the
past we have a mode up here and that's
really all you need to worry about is
that mode you can come into high
accuracy battery saving or device only
I've kind of interesting the way that
they've decided to use that and I don't
know why high accuracy should be
everything or device only and then you
should have battery saving us two
options so it kind of is interesting
that they've separated them out that way
but they have then you've got recent
request for your location so you can see
what apps are trying to find out where
you are location services right now
Google location reporting is on and
google search and Google Play services
have both used the low battery version
of finding out where I am so it's just
kind of a rough location but I can see
what apps are finding out where I am
right here quickly easily and if there's
anything suspicious in there I can take
action on it can also quickly turn it
off if you want to coming back in here
just continue heading down same account
section that we are already used to
pretty much the same thing that you are
used to seeing there of course as you
add new services you'll get new items in
here like Dropbox and whatnot we now
have printing which does that I'm sure
it's supposed to do more than that but
right now just as that that tells me
that I need to go to the Play Store I
need to download an app google cloud
print or something or somebody else's
cloud printing service and then
theoretically that's going to show up
here in this list and i'll be able to
select defaults and make changes and i
don't know we'll have to see how that
turns out but that's where you get
and then of course we've already shown
you have al phone so that's the nuts and
bolts back in there show you that just
you know regular stuff that we're
already used to nothing big there before
I jump into the home let's go into the
app drawer first of all you'll notice
there is no more apps and widgets that's
gone you also now have no little icon up
here to jump quickly and easily to the
Play Store that's interesting because I
got really used to that and it was right
there now I have to go find it
alphabetically in the list but that's
what they've done you can see i've just
installed a very slim set of my favorite
apps this is still rooted so i bear that
in mind when you're watching everything
that goes through here i haven't done
anything special with with super SU a
completely empty list so but it's there
coming back in here you'll notice now
that still has kind of the animation
icon or the animation to it the zoom in
zoom out and that's pretty much it very
basic very simple we've got five icons
across and five icons down easy cheesy
okay good now the fun part you want to
add something to the home screen and
it's an app you can do that easily let's
go ahead and put Maps same way that
you're used to just like that if you
want to do that to another page you can
do that just like that now if you notice
down here on my little dots not my
messages my little dots to indicate what
page i'm on i have four home screens
this one that one my main one and then
google+ yes it's now Google+ downside to
doing Google Plus this way is if you
want to dismiss these cards that way you
can't because it takes you back to your
home screen you now have to do it the
other way to dismiss it which is ok I
just kind of got used to flinging back
and forth and if I do that now it's not
going to let me do it oh well it's the
cost of progress you can still get into
it by pulling up from the bottom it just
does the animation off to the side as
well so kind of interesting that they
did that back to our little icons down
here let's say I don't want to have four
screens I just want to have
3i move that back there and now you
notice I now only have three there's
nothing off to the side anymore so it
automatically adds those does that go on
forever I don't know yet I've only done
a maximum before and if you want to play
with it and let us know how many you
have feel free let us know down in the
comments next how do we change wallpaper
and get widgets tap and hold just like
that and now you can thumb through here
kind of honeycomb like remember when we
could do this in honeycomb and we have
this kind of doc or this tray down at
the bottom well now we can do the same
thing here with KitKat we can go into
wallpapers and for some reason that
didn't do anything for me wallpapers
will launch the wallpaper picker and
everything is in here all of your
wallpapers including your live wallpaper
all in one big long list so you don't
have to know the difference between them
they're all just wallpapers you set it
and there you go just quick easy simple
just like that next up in there we've
got widget tap on that here your widgets
you can you know quickly and easily grab
one just like it used to tap it drag it
wherever you want you still have the
widgets that scoot out of the way the
icons scoot out of the way to make room
for it really quick really easy a simple
way to do it last but not least is we
have settings so you can get settings
all about in this case Google now and
just kind of basic stuff that you can do
with your launcher right here another
fun thing is and I've used this long
enough that I no longer have this little
animation up in in here that tells you
stuff to say I'm not going to say it
right now because then it'll do stuff
little animation that pops out and says
save this keyword and it does stuff so
we can and it's listening at least we
thought it was only going to be the
nexus 5 that was listening this is a
nexus 4 and ok Google what's the weather
going to be like today just as easy as
that you can see I've got an always-on
least when I'm on one of my home screens
listener ok Google how tall is the
Empire State Building
just as easy as that again coming back
and i know i can continue searching from
that screen I'm just trying to show you
here I'm not touching the phone just
saying okay Google call texas roadhouse
steak house so quickly and easily from
my home screen i can very very
conveniently get to all kinds of stuff
and use the power that is in google now
without leaving that home screen in fact
without even touching the home screen
very convenient I like it and I've
already impressed my friends with it so
there you go so that's been a first look
at KitKat on the nexus for it is by no
means official code there is lots and
lots of rough edges that you're going to
run into I'm getting a calendar air
about every five minutes that having
been said the overall experience is very
nice it's smooth its fluid I like it and
I like the subtle yet profound changes
that are there but I'm curious to know
what you think head down to the comments
let us know what you thought of the
video and if you've already flashed this
on your phone let us know what you
thought of it there as well if you want
to follow us on social media we are
there and we would love to see you there
and carry the conversation there as well
