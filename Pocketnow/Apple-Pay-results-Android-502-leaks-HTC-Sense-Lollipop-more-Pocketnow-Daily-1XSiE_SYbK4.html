exceed some of the expectations we
already hear what to expect for Android
502 lollipop and apples third-party
keyboard policies are throwing the
concept down the drain I'm high net
iveta and do what I do you should stop
complaining about mondays at some point
just not today this is out daily
let's begin today with what's official
as a sous has been one of those
companies that has been teasing a lot of
what we should expect for CES we have
already been invited to their events and
one of the things that we are expecting
is there's end bones to be launched but
interesting we've got these really cool
teaser videos that are in the likes of
the description and they show us a
smartphone with a very interesting
design and buttons at the back like the
LG g3 and g2 let's see how that looks in
the end as probably these aren't buttons
we don't know now even though Android
five dot 0 dot one hasn't really reached
anybody at least officially we already
hear what to expect with Android 502 and
if you're expecting major changes it
seems that the whole jelly bean concept
than the whole kit kat concept is dead
these dot 1 updates and dot two updates
are painless just improvements to bugs
and apparently that's what we should
expect in addition to Chen changes and
enhancements to the way Android handles
alarms hopefully it will do a better job
eventually we don't know exactly when
does launch would happen specifically
because we have to wait for the first
one but yeah it could happen early next
year and speaking of Android 501 let's
talk about the first OEM that's showing
it off let's talk about HTC we get the
first leaked screenshots of sense
whichever version it'll be running on
five dot 0 dot one we had seen some
previously but these were of a new alpha
this will looks more like something
that's almost ready to launch we heard
that HTC would probably push this in
early January and yeah it seems that the
whole lollipop UI is being adapted to
the existing version of sense but this
is actually a good thing the animations
are coming but we are also looking at
this new easy vote for entry-level users
which is great let's see when we get
this launch January fifth was being
teased now a company that's clearly
making things difficult for developers
is
full none of those are really happy with
third-party keyboards but now developers
are starting to complain as apparently
the company wants to change the way min
type works then type of school because
this is one of these keyboards that
actually allows you to switch the
keyboard into a calculator without your
need to tap the multitask you a
calculator which is common sense it's
really cool but Apple is requesting that
an n-type remove this feature as of the
next update and they're asking for the
next update to happen soon we don't
really know exactly why this is
happening but the apples already
crippled concept is just going down the
drain and finally for the very
interesting news of the day if you
thought that Apple pay would be a flop
it could be but it hasn't been just yet
we've got the first numbers of how
things happened during this first month
which was november and the company
pretty much took one percent of online
retail and digital retail which is big
it's huge we don't have an exact numbers
as to how much that amounts in dollars
but we do know that sixty percent of
users were using Apple pay twice meaning
they tried once they liked it and they
did it again which is great and then
amount it to 1.4 transactions a week and
NFC payments alone we're not talking
about online payments which is actually
separate these numbers are significantly
better than other services that are
digital like PayPal for example so yeah
it seems that Apple came up to a good
start but it could also be that people
are just going to get a try and that
leads me to the question of the day what
do you think Apple did right with Apple
pay that good google didn't do with its
a wallet because in my case honestly if
you look at these services they're
pretty much the same thing I don't
really notice a difference I just think
that Apple did a better job at marketing
it and at partnering with companies but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think that Apple did right friends
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video was
filming she'd follow us on Parker no
comments description to channel as well
can also follow me on twitter hi
mounters quarterly vetta please give
this video thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I am hina Rivera thank you very
much for watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
