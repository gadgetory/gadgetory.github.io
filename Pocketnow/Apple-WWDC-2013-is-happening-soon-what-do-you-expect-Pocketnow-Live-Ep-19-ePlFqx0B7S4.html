morning good afternoon good evening
everybody and welcome to pocket now live
I believe it is episode number 19 and
it's not the last episode next week will
be the last episode of season one so
don't don't be desperate we'll be back
we're just taking a short summer break
summer vacation as usual so everything
should be all right but until then I am
Anton denied managing editor and I am
joined today not as usual but as usual
in a tandem by Taylor Martin senior
editor hi Taylor had a y'all that wasn't
you Tony that was for you and I'm not
gonna follow up with a question on that
at least weapon action so you how are
you today I am great I'm doing great I
held up I'm I promised you a couple of
minutes to talk about your new your new
toy so before we start talk about your
new toy well I would have gotten it if I
knew I was actually gonna talk about it
it's in the other room but I guess it's
through yeah i think the controllers
around here somewhere right there is
i'll get the controller will do sort of
savannah I God ok your Mac Atlas best
yeah will do I haven't opened this
controller so will will open this one
really quickly um yeah so far it's great
it's nothing I mean obviously it's not
going to take from the likes of console
gamers or PC gamers it's just a little
lightweight android-powered gaming
console but it's as you can see the
controller is kind of inspired by the
xbox controller but it's it's more of a
way to bring game development for mobile
to the limelight someone Syrian we are
we are going to have a a coverage on
this sometime in the near future um
that's up to you yes yes we will we will
hear I'm not sure how
other people can see you but I can see
like a frame every 10 seconds so
hopefully that's only on on my end and
while we are at the introduction Airy
stage I would like to tell everybody
that you guys can ask Taylor and myself
questions both on youtube and um
somebody is not needed to please please
everybody who are in here and we are not
talking to you meet your microphones if
you have a question on youtube or pocket
now posted with all caps so i can spot
it between all the comments and the feed
yes is moving constantly and how about
we just kick this off right now and
dinner please choose somebody to talk to
well I will publicize the links on all
the other social media channels okay i'm
still like I think my internet
connection is is on the fritz right now
um but worst case scenario i'll be here
on my own until you come back libby
great want it well it'll be payback for
that one time that I had to do the last
30 minutes of the show by myself all
right let's go with um we'll go with Mac
I have not ever seen you here before so
we'll start with you how are you doing
today hi I'm good how are you great give
me well well yes here fine true okay
loud yes loud okay not not too loud it's
good it's a good thing okay fine so do
you have any questions for myself for
Tony yeah I want to talk about WWDC
because that's the topic obviously so
how how do you think you will see the
new iPad ah the fifth generation you
know redesigned slimmer thinner stuff
like that I highly doubt it i don't
think they're gonna do anything truly
new this year probably more sorry again
that's ok i will plastic um I imagine if
anything if we see any new hardware
there'll be new macbooks of course right
now as well chica yeah haswell chipsets
retina MacBook Airs which I will be
terribly terribly jealous of yeah
um and maybe maybe but I'm not putting
any kind of weight into it maybe the the
iWatch but there's rumor saying that it
will have an event of its own apple is
trying to get into this yearly cycle
with the iPads even though they've you
know kind of gotten out of it they heard
and then they kind of fell out of it I
don't imagine we'll see anything now
because the ipad mini came out in
october yeah don't worry exactly
september-october so we'll probably see
that yearly cycle we probably won't see
anything it'll probably be an event to
itself but yeah I would like to see the
new thinner design because if you
compare this to new Sony the tablet who
was you know reviewed on your website
hmm ah it's much slighter much thinner
so it would be nice to see Apple you
know going through the water tube it's
waterproof exactly so there you go I
don't need that but I would like to just
jump in with with just a short short
short sentence I wouldn't mind if we
wouldn't see any new hardware at all I
would I would still be excited to see
only iOS 7 a new iOS 7's and I just
lipstick on a pig and the see Tim Cook
say available I don't know august one
for everything beyond iphone 4 and above
and ipad 2 and above and that will make
me happy so I don't need new hardware
the iphone 5 is a youthful the ipad 4 is
a good tablet I just need a new fresh
look of iOS and that's my two cents here
well but that's what i really really
want a new fresh look of iOS i was the
iphone user for five years and i
switched to galaxy s4 which is here by
the way and it's nice it's laggy a
little bit but they have some updates
coming so that's good so yeah i would
like to see some fresh anyways
definitely yeah Oh which galaxy s4 is
that that's the Snapdragon 600 model I
live in Hollywood yet international
wanna look at the lag edition yeah I
don't like it
there there is an update that I applied
to mine when I was reviewing the AT&amp;amp;T
model and it it almost completely
eradicated the leg yeah there is one
update you know since two days actually
and it's available in Germany not
important right now or us so yeah that's
they say like fix its it's you know it's
much better and faster so also nice ad
for guys I had our video and out it is
but I i cannot see anybody I can hear
audio but I can see myself dropping in
and out but if you guys see everything
ok then that's just Google again and end
up at the lay back and relax I can see
perfectly fine so that's good yeah my
face I'm getting that is you guys seem
so I don't mind here I'm the host I'm
just a guest yeah it just relax you know
you're gonna do this to me again Tony
aren't you yeah well every time every
time he nervous here google is not
working I bring it down man but back to
you ya know the iOS 7 will uh I was
going on somebody's dog going somebody's
rubbing something I've been trying to
identify that sound and and um yeah I'm
not gonna talk about that let's move on
okay that's probably my dog actually no
 uh which is my ciao ciao and that's
the voice I can't do anything about that
sorry I swear I swear it sounds it
sounds differently over here no no it's
not related to you no no no nothing like
that I just messing with you come on its
friday niggas casual time at least is
right evening for me actually the same
for me so yeah so i would love to see
iOS 7 but i wrote an editorial unlike
Tony I don't really care if they really
change the software they just need to
upgrade the the interface because iOS
really hinges on application support so
that's what its applications are great
they are pretty much the best and we all
know that right but i want the fresh
look i want the new notification center
to look better and funk
better like on Android for example so
that's one chemisty my only two wishes
I'll be wicked we're gonna have to ask
you to make out yourself okay um my only
two wishes one is the the new interface
which it's almost positive is going to
happen to open api's so i can share to
tweet but from an example in the browser
set my default apps to change the
keyboard mouse change the keyboard open
api's but then then you run into the
people who are like ah you just want it
to be like android no I'd like options
options are great sure they always good
so how do you like your headphones I
love them yeah me too lot of use they
get a lot of use exactly so do you have
more questions for us no just want to
say you know I love your website love
what you're doing so keep it up well
thank you thank you okay all the best
okay take care of useful and okay i
don't i'm sure you know the drill maybe
yeah well much need myself sure well
when you're done I we ask you to drop
out so another person can join sure no
problem have a good time take care of it
thank you my and dinner apparently so
for me everybody is lagging but
apparently according to youtube comments
I am the only one lagging for you guys
in the viewers so but in case I just
drop out then the Hangout keeps on going
on Taylor you know what to do and you're
actually the only one this laggy for me
as well now but if you drop out it
doesn't go live anymore then then it
means that the live is just over so
without me there's no life ha before we
go to the next guest I have a question
from front pocket now and I'd like you
to learn to try to answer it it says do
you think apple will add lock screen
widgets or more notification widgets and
iOS 7 he says I am eighty percent sure
about that they will do i lock screen
widget what do you think um the lock
screen widget maybe I don't know it
depends on what your definition of a
widget is sorry I'm trying to pull
youtube comments so select screen
widgets I would say maybe in the form of
probably weather or stock strollers like
what you see a notification center you
might see those on the lock screen but
in Notification Center there are so many
more possibilities there's not a lot
that you can do with a widget on lock
screen as Android is a perfect example
of there are some that are great but
most of them are kind of limited in what
they can actually do as far as
Notification Center I'd love to see
third-party widgets on here we go again
third-party third-party third-party I
don't necessarily want to use all Apple
software all the time Twitter Facebook
stock apps I'd rather use tweet bot in
Notification Center but then again I
never even open Notification Center ever
it's like 5,000 notifications long by
now so that's me it's kind of useless as
in its current form so any protein
Notification Center we'd great there's
your wordy answer how about you pick our
next guest too well I will try to solve
some technical difficulties here okay
I'm just be a comment on YouTube what
are my headphones these are audio
technica ath m 50s they're some of the
best headphones that you can get under
150 bucks under 200 hundred three
hundred they're just they're great
headphones for the price so there's that
audio technica ath em 50s as for the
next person let's go with I need like a
randomizer but yeah just close my eyes
and pick one uh we'll go with Nicholas
Oliver you have to mute your mic so how
are you I'm great how are you reading
are you we're getting something I'm from
England echoing do you have any cables
any Williams you have any hit to go
again well I'm you seeing my phone is in
my store
oh I got it I can hear you but we're
getting I can hear terrible terrible
like a comparable waka and you just
block it sometime later what you say
Tony thank you Tom come you know me I
will well it's trying to ask you to plug
insane sounds and head back just look at
him in five or ten minutes yeah we can
hear you we can apply what you're saying
yeah it's okay boy me really quick oh he
dropped out okay alright then we'll
choose um oh gosh I'm what I'm gonna
slaughter this name anupam nuff I
probably slaughtered that what's up
how's it going did it bad that slaughter
your name now you did it okay yes it's a
rare occurrence are you I'm good
unfortunately though uh hang out update
didn't do at nothing at all oh yeah I
gotta and I don't know what it was for
it's probably some bug fix or something
it brought my conversations to life yeah
yeah I don't know how but it did so do
you have any questions for us today uh
no I'm just uh just trying to think like
if in WWDC they try to because I just
was reading a editorial by Steven about
the I radio thing that they just
apparently they have a contract with
sony music apparently state yup I have a
song they if they have that now so it
could be like maybe the fall of this
year maybe they could even launch I
radio or something because they have the
mate almost all three major companies
running on it yeah well so that's like
you get there Beatles on streaming yeah
since they have the monopoly on the
monopoly on the Beatles yeah it's is
that something we've used I radio /
Spotify Pandora or google music i would
i would test it out using all access i
would give it a shot there's nothing
nothing wrong with trying something new
all the time
Oh God unlike Google Play where it's all
us exclusive typing at least Apple get
distributes all their products almost
all over the world right away you know
who was like almost conservative almost
over their stuff yeah music is a tricky
beast though yeah I mean is there there
are a lot of companies out there that
just don't like streaming they don't
like selling digital copy still there
still stuck in the 90s and love their
CDs but yet digital music is a strange
beast and for a watch on call it iOS 7
do you guys have feel that uh if there's
not if it's what uh Anton said it's
putting lipstick on a pig what would you
do with that um I've already said that
the just an updated interface will make
me happy just because it's been six
years since the interface has really
been updated I mean they've added
wallpapers folders Notification Center
and multitasking and yeah but what
happens if like it's like it's like
exactly like what you add the prediction
say it's just like a flatter version
just flat you know what I'll tell you
what will happen absolutely nothing will
happen because about the only people who
are tired of iOS as it is right now are
our us the geeks are the media the users
and so on your your sister my mother my
ex-girlfriend or anybody else from the
street who uses iOS they use it because
they have a product which works out of
the box without any tinkering and they
don't really care about the relative
icons or the notification shade which is
a problem with in taylor's case-- they
they wouldn't care so that's 99% of user
base and us one percent I don't think we
really really matter in this equation
yeah I'm just curious if they're gonna
actually what you just said earlier to
the previous boy get open api's cut
because so annoying after a while even
iOS in progress of its life is getting
annoying it's not gonna happen I know I
ever say that straight up but Tim Cook
said that he's not against it which is
starkly different from from Steve Jobs
Steve Jobs would just roll in his grave
at that but Tim Cook said he's not
against opening the api's yeah so that's
a total difference there that's a
signification that signifies a totally
different Apple yeah if they do a
complete literal over all the companies
like it's almost to me like it's a
because they're they're trend is not
usually we're not gonna change that off
yet we're going to kind of keep it safe
and stuff but if they do a super revamp
of the whole platform it's gonna be a sh
gonna be interesting but it's gonna send
me a shock to everybody as well because
they just took your width or they're
gonna take a right turn up they took off
return you turn all to another direction
yeah they I've said it and gotten some
some negative feedback some some I
raised some flames you know proud of the
cattle and said that Apple is slowly
turning into you know the new blackberry
that they're they're just stagnant and
they're they're too conservative to jump
on changes and push forward because they
want to play it safe and keep the people
they have happy and and they're still
gaining subscribers so it's of obviously
working right now but how long can they
ride that same wave that's the question
yet I've always ask me they're just
playing catch-up now you stood they were
the leading dog but you're just playing
catch up to me right now they do that in
a lot of different areas though they'll
revolutionize it at some point again we
shot some it's it's gonna be a while
haha yeah that's about
that's about it all i have to say about
it yeah so do you have any other
questions for for Tony or myself no you
guys do I just want to say like you guys
do a great job what you guys do it every
day and in and out so yeah keep it like
you thank you have a nice day as well me
too I'm weekend Thank here that I but
alright is your Christian here a couple
of questions at do I look and sound okay
that's a relative thing good question
from from YouTube Anton what do you
think about these Nokia EOS leaks to be
honest I was skeptical at the beginning
but now I'm seeing more and more leaks
showing or trying to depict about the
same thing I have said it before and I
will continue saying it I don't really
care how to knock your iOS we'll look I
don't care if it's gonna be this thick
of a phone it's gonna have this big of a
lens I just want pure view on Windows
fell and that's and regardless of how it
will look I'm going to buy it favor um
what you keep talking while I find a
picture hold on thanks question what is
the current display on your smartphone
what type of display I saw that question
I didn't as probably resolution or or
the type of this movie all right now I
have a wxga galaxy note 2 so it has a
Super AMOLED panel this is what I was on
what device galaxy note 2 we're going to
know too so that's that's right now your
daily driver that's your main phone yep
this is all I was gonna say about the
use this I made that picture i called
that out it's fake but there have been
more realistic pictures of it too did
you see the video from this morning no i
didn't that shows exactly that camera
hump and it doesn't look fake to me in
the video at least i don't i don't think
all of them are fake but that one
definitely was how do you have two
different light
sources in it not affect both parts of
the picture yeah but that exact thing is
on video now oh yeah well let's see I
gotta find my title okay let us move on
I've seen somebody who I have not yet
met who has left the debt awesome then
let's talk to somebody else I have never
met Carlos aponte I made I made your
neighbor Latin sounding so I'm sorry for
that it's okay can you kind of can you
guys hear me okay yeah I can hear you I
cannot see you but as long as I can hear
you we're just gonna suppose this is
ready I'm gonna see my complete noob um
I don't use hang out very often so I'm
trying to figure all this stuff out I
apologize but um no all right we are at
episode 19 and we haven't figured it out
either so I'm actually it works i feel
kind of bad but um I'm actually curious
I I watched the d11 interview with um
with 10 dunno he's got an HTC device and
just received a notification yes how
does mean isn't what ghum sound yes I
should probably knew that I'm sorry I
can spot boom sound even from a quickie
hang up I was here to cross the pond he
knows yes my own rings he hears it I was
hanging out with some friends the other
night and my my wife called and
everybody is like wow that's not so loud
and as I guess it's my awesome phone and
you know like you guys said it's a
conversation starter so oh yeah i was
watching the 11 interview team come cook
and I felt like I don't know if you guys
saw the Q&amp;amp;A session towards the end but
it seemed like he was kind of getting
beat up a lot a lot of questions a lot
of people from developers and things
like that asking about different things
did you guys watch that what's your
feelings on it I have a feeling that
that Apple wants to respond to you know
like you said it seems like it's mostly
the geek circle the media but they don't
want to make these changes strictly for
the sake of respond
and maybe they're kind of gonna trickle
it out so it seems like they did it on
their own oh yes yes definitely they
definitely move at their own pace they
do their own thing and or it I should
say it we've been talking about this a
pocket now Apple does its own thing but
um uh I don't know I think Tim Cook is
he's I don't know the the expression is
under the fire I don't know he's under
fire I don't know what it is I don't
know the expression but he's um the the
in the middle of the spotlight right now
because he's feeling some really major
shoes and and if Apple's not innovating
it's going to be taken as Tim Cook's
fault as shed even if Steve Jobs would
have ran the company and and done the
same exact thing as it's doing right now
you know he would been under less
scrutiny because he Steve Jobs yeah so
so Tim Cook is under a lot of pressure
and it's it's really hard to say what's
going to happen and I have one more
question that's we're talking about iOS
getting stale and kind of old and i
agree i actually somewhere in my stuff i
have a work iphone that i hate when I
have to use it I wish they would just
let me use my android but um do you what
Len is Android gonna get stale I mean
they've made some changes in tweaks but
I mean how come how do you think they'll
be able to keep it up probably not the
pace are going right now because there's
a Matias Duarte has been implementing
change after change after change after
change I can change but the way that the
androids going and we've seen we've been
seeing a lot of this since i 0 android
is moving more towards being able to
update the operating system without
updating the operating system so
updating all the absent services
separately from android so everyone is
on a level playing field and the updates
themselves I imagine will slow down I
don't know Tony we know you hate google
um but the updates themselves we'll see
probably become
less radical and maybe only to improve
the interface and the core experience as
in how you navigate how you interact
with the operating system so at that
point when it becomes that will see it
become more still probably a little bit
interesting I agree I appreciate the
time oh yes yeah thanks for joining us
today thank you i'm i'm reading the
group chat over here and tony's losing
it so do you have any other questions
for us no not very i was surprised i got
in i kind of didn't have anything
prepared like a speech or anything but
just uh I just remembered watching the
11 thinking man he's just getting beat
up at the media and I was just curious
if anybody else called the same so I
appreciate it thank you oh yeah so have
a nice weekend and take care you two do
you know say if Tony refreshes we drop
off air so we can't do that um is do you
have any audio Tony
I don't think you can hear me yes I do
you do awesome so do you want to pick
the next person or like every word
probably so I'm just trying to figure
out what you are talking about uh it's
like a game isn't it there's it isn't
that fun happy one we're hearing that
this is lagging from zach as well as
anybody else having lag because i'm
getting leg from Tony and Tony only you
just just hold out just just just carry
over carry on in case you you can hear
everybody else probably problem on my
end I cannot quit so just take it away
all right um Zack you've been here since
the beginning uh she could unmute
yourself and I'm not even gonna try it
not your last name I'm not even sneezing
sneezing wow you should have heard
Michael Fisher but you that yesterday i
was on the UV he did it horrible I don't
even remember I can't even remember how
you said it amazing that what you said
yes that's correct form using okay I
won't forget that now how are you doing
great awesome do you have any questions
at a kiss you can't ask Tony a question
because I he can only hear every fifth
word so you can okay how can space a
mile long enough he might be able to
hear it um I thought that I was now I'll
just say this I was wondering about the
nexus 7 i'm thinking of buying a 7-inch
android tablet to replace I've rooted
Kindle Fire right here with Android for
up to two I was thinking of buying at
the nexus 7 but it's over a year old so
what should I do if you don't want to go
to the Nexus 7 I would definitely
recommend looking at the note 8.0 as
have one over there register pricey for
me it's a little bit expensive there's a
little more expensive um in that price
range I could buy a nexus 10 for that
much yeah but in that price range i
would say yeah it's probably just a
nexus 7 there's nothing really maybe
except for the phone pad but I don't
even know what Tony's waving the phone
data
yeah I knew he would I knew you would
not everyone wants to take calls on
their tablet Tony do they make a Wi-Fi
only model I don't know I don't think so
cuz I would kind of get exactly using
your pc if you don't want to do they
make a Wi-Fi model Tony I don't think
they do because that would defeat the
purpose it wouldn't be a foam pad then
unless you could just be a pal yes you
did voice over IP I don't know out um so
yeah my suggestion is probably stick
with a nexus 7 because it may be
outdated but really the only thing
terrible terrible about it is to display
ok also um can I just ask a couple o ask
/ well asking about you guys as
predictions for um like iOS 7 for ww see
if there's gonna be our seven oh yeah no
they're almost definitely be iOS 7 what
do you think it's gonna be yeah that's
that's the major question that nobody
really knows the answer to I would I
mean we're gonna see the interface
change the question is whether that's
going to be in a major way or if it's
just going to go flat if they're just
gonna take the icons i already have and
make them flat and upgrade the the
settings i air application what do you
mean like make it flat like oh alright
so well look at those icons right now
they look kind of 3d and glossy um good
point so for flat would be if let me get
an exact here my well just just think
windows phone 7 or Windows Phone 8 that
is yes yes where the hunger is is glossy
or anything I'm looking okay to see if I
can find so I got something to show off
this is if you ask if you had a phone to
this this is basically the Tony phone
yes um yes I switch my camera whore to
you but i'm not sure if people can see
you because i cannot so i will probably
watch that take of the tony phone and
the recording tomorrow morning it's like
this plus this put together so so
basically to go flat you're just taking
out all the glossy unnecessary visual
aspect and making it very stark and just
flour cookies
if you could do that with an appt nap I
mean like just change your app icon
Google is relatively Google's pretty
flat this is the perfect example of
going flat so the old man was was 3d and
glossy the new and is just straight
color okay yeah okay good I guess that's
all okay thanks for talking with me oh
okay I get myself a shout out like my
Twitter yeah Tony could you lock the
camera on him I don't know if you can
even see him it is it is locked on him I
have no idea but the recording will look
like but it is on him ok my twitter my
personal twitter is z SH bees zsc hme
easy and then I run a i'm working on
running a small tech website and tech
you know i run it i'm a website and i
have a a youtube channel it's table top
tech one word te voet opt e CH so you go
youtube.com / user / table top tech or
um and also our websites table top deck
blogspot com I'm working on it okay all
right well you take care and have a
great weekend okay see ya I need to turn
this back on get out of there apparently
I am back but who knows for hon so I
have a question here from YouTube do you
think most current Apple users will
leave iOS if this next iteration
disappoints my answer is short no no
most people are happy with you I can
hear myself echoing so someone needs to
mute themselves if Apple will lose some
users it will probably be from from the
new users those who probably would
consider iOS but since theoretically the
new iOS will be the same they will
probably switch to android or windows
phone but current users I think
personally that will not walk away from
iOS 7 if it will be the same as iOS 6
most of them are already happy with it
as it is um there's a question on
YouTube for me do you think that Google
will ever try hard to market their Nexus
devices to
peeled to the general public or will
they always be a developer phone tablet
whatever um they've been trying to do
that more and more and it's failed
several times now as far as someone
blocked themselves I don't know how to
happen oh yeah I don't know but they
have done that before with the google or
not google the Galaxy Nexus on verizon
LTE model the sprint model the t-mobile
version of the nexus s 18t model if they
make success they've done it several
times and it really hasn't worked that
well I think to date I don't know if
numbers will back it up but the most
popular Android or Nexus has been the
nexus 4 and then x 7 and putting them in
google play and allowing people to buy
direct from google in a straightforward
very simple way has helped matters but
it's probably not ever going to happen
until you get one in a carrier store for
a subsidized price at least not here in
the states because people don't see that
phones are worth five six seven hundred
dollars they're worth a hundred dollars
fifty dollars tuner bucks and that's it
that's my answer okay let us talk to
that person I wanted to talk to in the
beginning who left and is now back
Rodriguez I'm not sure if your first
name but the one on the yellow shirt
you're the only one three guys here you
hear me yes we can't allow and clear I
cannot see what I can hear you oh yeah
hi hi where are you from today I drunk
around yeah columbia awesome columbia
WABC or or anything else and i have a
question about WWDC go ahead do you
think do you think the iOS will look
uglier now that it's more flat because i
think so well this is a tricky bug ago
has its objective it's it's very much
objective not in your opinion in my
opinion I love flyer I love
arc flat interfaces I mean I love it too
but in the iphone i think it wouldn't
look ask nice I don't know we haven't
seen it um I haven't felt some some
themes in cydia for a flat interface and
they don't look bad but they also themes
in cydia are pretty half-baked usually
sue them I know this much and just just
quickly I I have two opinions one as an
iOS user who would say that I don't
really care how iOS 7 will look like
because I like it the way it is and one
has a tech editor a geek a tech writer
and I'm saying that I hope as a tech guy
that iOS 7 will be completely different
from iOS 6 mm that'd be nice iono on our
question you had sure about the Sony
event I heard some rules or seen some
rumors that somewhere I don't know about
a four point eight inch 1080p Snapdragon
800 Sony but everyone is wondering about
the cigar Ephraim but what about the
other one I think it was called name
honami something like that yeah I
remember reading something about that
was it wasn't that the rumored phablet
know as that still daddy konami's
another one with that 20 megapixel
camera such like that yeah I remember
reading the rumors um I haven't really
heard much else about it so I don't you
think it's not gonna happen right um
might I mean if it's rumored it could
most most rivers have some hard truth
like I can eat like there's part truth
in any rumor but I don't think Sony
needs another normal sized decent sized
film because the experience that is
still a good phone what the soul needs
is oh yeah it's small compared to a fail
but but what they need is something to
differentiate something to to be
different because if they come up with
another phone after the Xperia Z is just
going to
another competitor for the s4 another
competitor for new one and why not
another competitor for the Xperia Z so
if they come up with a tablet that would
be a step ahead of Samsung because
Samsung is slated to release the note 3
sometime in august or September so they
would have a competitive edge here so
I'm just hoping that they are coming up
with a six-point something inch with
stylus or not phablet and what i hopes
about the tree luminous display can you
repeat the question please what are your
hopes on that tree luminous display that
is my technology of funny yeah I have no
idea what you're talking about and I
have no shame in of them um i have read
about it i really had not don't pay much
attention to sony because their displays
just haven't really been great yeah but
that's just a marks truth I don't know I
mean I mean look at the Xperia Z or as
Tony says I Xperia said the displayable
map is the worst 1080p display on a
phone that I've seen by a long shot you
can hold the phone at certain angles and
can't read what's on the display like
not even a sharp angle just a slight
angle and it's just where I guess it's
polarized that it's you can't see
anything on the display it's it's bad
the contrast is low the colors are okay
when you enable the Mobile BRAVIA Engine
2 the colors are really really nice but
that's only in videos and pictures so in
day-to-day usage the displays really not
that great it's the worst part around so
I hey ok thanks for your time BRB yeah
take care and if you could um just drop
out of the chat so someone else can jump
in oh yeah sure thank you have a nice
clean a good buy you out the question
why is Sony pudding so bad displays into
their flagship devices
and this is a really a good question
because I know Sony can is able and and
and they really can do great this place
why is it a simple question they can't
why is it so crappy on the experience
and that's the question i don't know i
mean their televisions are bad but their
their phones displays are pretty awful
at least the last two and i don't know
about the tablet i didn't watch the full
review from from i want to call him Tony
but Michael why always want to call him
Tony because what he calls him Tony
Stark i guess but uh Michaels xperia
tablet z review i I don't know about the
display on that so well she said I I
have watched the review and if you had
not tailored please go ahead after this
and watch it i want to sale i have
watches missed the displayport shoe the
display she says a display is good but
sony is trying to compensate for for
some aspects of the display with
oversaturating and with very colorful
wallpapers but overall it is very very
super amoled like saturated and that is
according to him and Michael love
saturate the colors a good display this
right here is the pinnacle of a mobile
display the the contrast could be better
the blacks aren't terribly but black but
this and the HTC One and the galaxy s4
have probably the best displays on
mobile devices I I wouldn't say the s4
has one of the best displays out there
because not it is said I afraid I don't
know I don't have I have a problem with
super ambulance being saturated but
Samsung did a great thing with the
galaxy s4 they allow you to tone down
the saturation to a point where colors
look almost almost natural my biggest
problem is that once I step outside of
my room outdoors I can't see anything on
the screen yeah that is a problem with
the AMOLED but I don't know maybe I'm
the only one who feels this way but when
you tone down the s 4's display and set
it to the natural screen mode is it just
me or does it just not look
or feel is nice like what in the
operating system it's meant to look just
just pop and look really cartoony turn
it down it looks really drab and that's
because you've gotten used to using the
the phone the icons TouchWiz with a
supersaturated setting use it like that
for a week and then you'll get used to
it maybe I don't know it just doesn't
look optimized for for normal sector
yell at you yeah your coal mine okay
hold on um you choose okay I can't go
with that question there was a question
I was trying to find that I can't find
it so the changes you're expecting for
that I don't think we'll see the ipad 5
at WWDC if we see one this year it'll be
with the iphone announcement in
September ish but iphone or ipad 5 may
be a new design I don't know I don't
want to put too much into that because
the design on the new iPads are the
existing iPads isn't bad but I'd like to
see the larger iPads have the same
design as the ipad mini that i have in
the other room and that's gonna be only
happen yeah same thickness same shape i
love that and the same colors as a black
one like that would be great all black
I've had other than that maybe a
processor a bump but it doesn't really
need it definitely doesn't need it the
displays at the peak resolution so I
don't know other than that iOS 7 and a
new design probably not much you Tony if
you have anything to add to that
I would say that I really wouldn't mind
if Apple would skip the ipod really
needy iphone 5 and the iPad 5 and
instead give us just the iOS 7 we all
dream about but if I have to choose i'd
say that yesterday would you yeah i
agree with you the ipad any should land
this looks to the ipad the big ipad it
has to be much much lighter and much
much portable because if you're
comparing it with the sony xperia tablet
z who is a 10.1 inch or somewhat larger
than the ipad and it still looks and
feels better about the iphone there's
nothing wrong with the iphone as it is
today so I'm just seeing a spec bump in
iphone 4s with a slightly faster
processor slightly larger memory
slightly better camera slightly
something slightly something and
probably iOS 7 so slight slight slight
and every sense of the word that's
that's apples game so yeah I would if I
have my way and Cesare is right on point
if I had my way iphone 5s which or the
iphone 6 i guess would be a much larger
phone I can't really comfortably use the
iPhone because it's too small I have big
humongous matey Paul's and typing on the
iphone is pretty difficult so if i could
get an iphone in 4.5 4.7 4.85 inches i
would be in heaven so to speak okay
let's see let's choose somebody else
from from the gentleman and ladies below
Taylor please alright um I think I saw
is it finish think I saw that this is
his first time and i hain't no so let's
welcome him you'll have to unmute
yourself it's on the top right we can't
hear you did anyone else hear him as i
can not me if you look at the top right
of the window there should be a little
red button it'll say you're muted
all right see if you can figure that out
we'll go to someone else and try to come
back if we can get you unmuted I haven't
been here in a while Tony are there any
new people I can't tell if they're new
or old sorry oh uh I can I can tell you
that uh cami doesn't have video but he's
new and also as Aldean ease Aldean is
also near the gentleman with the glasses
in the middle okay um we haven't picked
a regular yet would you like to do that
or stick to new people up to you really
okay your guests okay now I hurt my foot
so I am now in pain too um we'll go with
SL Dean I i may have slaughtered that
hello how are you how do you do ah I was
doing okay until I slammed my foot down
and now sir like any moving with me I
can yes yes I'm very far far away I'm
from Jordan actually nice you're
actually closer to me than to him yes
and so do you have any predictions for
WWDC actually I think that WWDC if I
phone or App will want to do something
new they have to enlarge their screen
for the iPhone because it's small as you
said and we have big fingers and begins
yes it was designed it was large when it
was made and now it's small so yeah it's
time you compared to other phones right
now you know like this for or the HTC
One it's time guys let me ask you
something you are complaining that the
iphone 5 as it is now with a 4-inch
screen is too small don't you think that
that could be exactly apples niche I
mean the iphone is currently the
smallest high-end phone you can get and
all the people who don't know large
phones will probably go to the iphone
how about that there's no reason that
they can't keep a 4-inch phone and
there are at least two phones they're
not but they could I mean these two
iPads we said they weren't going to make
a small iPad because Steve Jobs said
that if we wanted to make a small iPad
we'd have to sell it with sandpaper so
people could sand the tips of the
fingers down so they created right so I
mean why not it's it's a difficult
samsung it's a different apple though
Tim Cook is proving that i'm not saying
that will but i would i would love it if
they did because they're cutting out
just as there in that niche they're
providing a small high-end phone for
people with small hands they're also
cutting out all the people with bigger
hands that have trouble using it yeah
but not all the people like Apple you
know but there is much of them and the
most of the consumers this days want a
bigger phones like this well I'm justice
you want yeah this right here is is one
of the perfectly shaped and sized homes
the nexus 4 I and I love the size and
shape really good that sure yes it's 4.7
inches and why can't you know Apple do
that why not you know yeah like the
health now most of the consumers as I
said it want bigger phones so why not
the Apple made a one big one small and
have not a very trouble with the price
like it'd be the same ole same ole but
not as you think like let's see this for
now we have the active we have the rugby
stuff and we have the normal work right
and the minute it is it is contrary i
believe to everything what Apple is and
represents throughout the history not
now not under the Steve Jobs a robot as
company Apple is not a following company
Apple is the company that tells you what
you need so you don't tell Apple what to
do Apple tells you what you need and and
as such I don't see Apple following a
trend set as specifically by competitors
Jesus whoa whoa whoa I can't remember
where but I
edit somewhere app customers pay us for
us to tell them what they want
absolutely i think that was from from
tim cook's the 11 interview i think yeah
it was something like that but um you
say that but they also make several
sizes and laptops and tablets there's no
reason they shouldn't in phones there is
no legitimate reason they should not
make a different sized phone two sides
agree um but I was gonna say something
and I totally forgot it as I said but oh
this yeah right I may have that um I'm
gonna try to think this through mm them
then bumping the size of the iphone 4s
to the five going from 3.5 to 4 inches
was half as ered at best I mean like
from Taylor that wasn't quite a size
that was for the aspect ratio yes it was
it wasn't they say it's a bigger display
it is technically but really it's only a
taller display which means it's not
really bigger because bigger in size of
portrait devices moves wider because
that's what makes it easier to use
easier to type on their their way to
gloss over that and kind of smooth it
over was to say it's bigger but you can
still use it with one hand if you want
and you're talented and have meaty paws
the size of mine you can use this phone
right here one hand the note 2 I use it
one-handed all the time just saying just
saying Apple I have another question yes
or you'd better first of all what you
prefer the Galaxy Nexus or the LG Nexus
from the side of the screens like the
Emulex alexis or the l just like the
nexus for Galaxy Nexus yeah well do know
the the nexus for the Galaxy Nexus had a
pretty terrible display I hated it from
day one the AMOLED the Super AMOLED was
very very pixelated you could see
because it was pentile the grit the
whites were
really gray if you turn the display down
they looked like parchment they look
like paper rather than a display and
that just it killed me killed me so
there's that we don't know about that
yes but between the two it would be hard
to choose between design because I like
the design of both of them even even
plastic it felt much nicer than the
plastic samsung uses today so there's
nothing about using a windows phone in
the future yes I have considered it um
the thought of leaving google and
everything I have and all the accounts i
use and everything behind just kills me
because i use google plus very
frequently gmail calendar which i can
get those on windows phone I use YouTube
a lot which that's you know they're
working on a new app but what are some
of the other services keep just all
these google services that i used a in a
day out I wouldn't be able to use them
so there's that but I would make the
jump for the EOS camera I would do it
fits as good as it's supposed to be it's
rumored to be I would definitely use
Windows Phone I would go back to
carrying two phones I will we recently
had in my country the nokia 920 recently
just a few months ago wow we're really
in this situation what we have android
and i have a rooted phone actually it's
not much but it's an android yeah well
do you have any more questions for us
actually I have one for Anton okay yes
please let go where is your so good it
opens your see me to hear you where's
your cigar that's what I've ran out and
i can't wait for for me to meet hi Mary
vera in Berlin for e flat so that he can
bring me some awesome endurance of ours
thank you for this and I wish you the
next time Thank You Santa care david
awesome week
thank you never um okay uh uh I see mr.
James lanik here who I have not seen
before so let's try dude I'm sorry I'm
still finding cold let's try to talk to
him James we cannot hear you but there's
a here yes we got it all right yeah I've
been trying to join this hangout for all
my tablet I to figure it out ever since
episode one and i have not so yeah so
you're walking around a minute ago I
kind of figured you were on a computer
so what do you want to talk about today
Jake um um I was talking up I guess I
saw y'all talking about WWE see so I
always think of you probably see the
ipad mini 2 and not the ipad 5 because
the ipad mini still doesn't even ever it
in a display or an a6 processor stumped
I'm thinking they'd probably upgrade
that besides the I've I've had five
because I fi forward has a Retina
display and do you think they would do
it at nine months versus a full year I
mean that they have their their typical
fall schedule now that they follow I
don't think we'll see hardware not not
mobile hardware at WWDC I would love to
be wrong I would love a Retina display
ipad mini because my ipad mini gets more
use than probably any other mobile
device i have but the display is
terrible i am a pencil drunky and it's
so bad I've seen on my sister has one
and it's just I look at the pixels and
it's just terrible i have a galaxy note
8.1 right now and i can and the display
bothers me on that too look ya know the
mid sized tablet sector is definitely
the black sheep of tablets and they just
don't get any love in the display area
how'd you lose audio again Tony what is
going on I say that you're getting
frustrated I don't think you can hear me
so do you have another question for me
or a prediction or anything oh oh yeah
I'll sink it
um if iOS 7 is like the flop and a
disappoints do you think most people
will go for like Android or those stick
with iOS and squawks only the vocal
minority are really begging for a new
iOS most people like my mother she's a
she loves tech she's got more tablets
than I do she has several phones but she
is perfectly happy with iOS the way it
is right now so I don't think so she's
she's it along the lines of what most of
the iOS users are in terms of being
content with iOS 6 I think that's the
only iOS lated question there's just one
more it's not really related to WWDC
yeah there's my contracts my contracts
up around like October and I was
thinking of either the Galaxy Note 3
when it comes out or the HTC one I don't
know if it'd be really relevant what
October um if the note 3 is out then I
will probably have it I will most
definitely own it but between the two it
really depends do you want something
that large you already have a note 8 do
you want another device that's really
close in size to that or would you
rather have something that is defined as
a definite phone yeah I was just
wondering like how easy would be in a
hold of one hand and if it would be like
practical if it's around the same size
as the note 2 it's it's easy one-handed
I use a type one handed all the time you
just have to learn how to hold it
differently I hold it like this so it's
very loosely used in my hand but I use
it one-handed and can reach everything
on the display so if it's around the
same size it'll be fine if your hands
are around the same size as mine which
I'm guessing it probably not that and
the one will most definitely be easier
to use one handed so if you're looking
for one-handed use probably i would say
HTC one it'll have a higher density
display probably a better camera well I
don't know about that I take that back
I've learned HTC One welcome back Tony
oh it's good to be back all right so if
you have another question for Tony or
anything since he just got back what
feel free to ask who knows for how long
um no I think that's about it so ok I
got a question for you can you guys hear
me yes I can what I see a lot of nodding
so I think the consensus is we can hear
Tony I'll see that his face is turning
red that's the first thing yeah thanks
for joining us James if you want a we
can have people follow you on twitter or
whatever if you give us your handle you
can not the camera on you but I wouldn't
if I if I would know which thumbnail is
him yeah well he old hag of anyway what
I have a twitter account but I just use
it to like look at people's tweets like
famous people I don't really post on it
so so your twitter stalker um yeah
basically yeah all right well thanks for
joining us have a have a great weekend
thank you and we'll see you next week
hopefully later please all right we're
gonna go with a usual we'll go with
donessa just because we share pain right
now yes exactly hello how are you
horrible I want to die right now but
it's fine i'll get used to it wow it's
pretty awful but um maybe talking about
WWDC will alleviate some of that pain by
making me feel more pain because i know
you don't like iOS oh I really don't but
I mean most of my best friends have the
iphone and actually my cousin who's
texting me right now uh she hates
android because she had she every time
to get to another phone she has a really
bad experience and i think overall
people that don't like I'm doing is
because it's a little more complex than
iOS and they're just so yeah I always
ask you guys something I don't know if
you and Tony know about
but one of such best friends it's asking
me and keeps asking me which cover is
better for the iphone 5 the lifeproof
the atlas or the other one incipio I
think it is and I keep telling her is
that so far is the lifeproof yes if
you're looking for for quality and you
know being water resistant stuff like
that water of the lifeproof or otter box
I don't really know of the incipio one
there a lot of incipio cases I don't
know and I don't know what the Atlas
case I've heard of it but I haven't seen
it or used it but lifeproof and otterbox
I can definitely attest to their quality
but I have a question for you yes yes uh
what would it take at this WWDC for iOS
what feature that would make you switch
to iOS yeah nothing they could do
nothing cuz i had a pass today I don't
remember a fool but I heard my cousin
telling me about um how they're gonna
switch and do something drastic with
colors or bring a cup of color to iOS
and then I was thinking so instead of
the generic great grayish blue gonna
make you I don't know they're gonna give
you the opportunity of Kenya to red
purple or bad i mean it's iris is great
i really like their devices the laptops
at the phones but it's just that it's so
clean for my taste in a way that i can't
do i can't tweak it the way i would like
to do it and my cousin Tom Brundage
jailbreak and I'm like yeah but I should
be having that option kind of full not
just me jailbreaking the phone because I
just I don't want to do that but I mean
she's so if they if Apple put one
feature in there that just put android
to shame you wouldn't do it no because
it's just one feature ok ok ok question
question back right back at you thinner
what's that one feature that we put
android to shame I have no idea
clue mind reading app or something that
the app that tells you what you want
because that would be the most Apple
centric at possible yeah they do tells
you what the application made by apple
cold 1000 wish it yeah and you have to
pay for it it's like like thirty dollars
a month and it tells you what you want
all the time like like a maple lab ok
Google now Apple I've got google now
which Tony hey Tony hates it I can't
because not existent here so you're just
jealous Oh relied was see read but then
over time because theory beats out of
the things that people will ask her it
went straight to just completely us
together don't drop the ice bombs sorry
oops it's the truth I don't I'm gonna
have so much hate for it and I get that
you're an apple fan but it is what it is
this is why I like Google now if I can
show you this i have a google search
isle of man TT um at some point last
week like beginning of last week and i'm
getting new stories automatically from
sources i would never read before just
because i don't really read use i'm
getting news updates because i searched
for it last week ok tanner I love you
want to know and everybody do you guys
want to know why I don't like Google now
this ok this is my galaxy s4 and now i'm
gonna start okay i'm gonna do it like
this i'm gonna fire boooo now boom
that's my google now whether let me let
me ok this the keyboard is gone this is
my google mail whether that's all here
no more cards it's just sample cards
that's all and when I get back I the
keyboard goes away this is my google now
so this dear google is why i do not lie
your google now hold on let me turn the
brightness up on mine so I can show you
all right so if you can see this we've
got maps I don't know if that is at the
top maps Isle of Man stocks weather hey
I got wet or too I just know this is a
constant flow of stuff all the time so
when you can actually use google now
because of your geographic location it's
great I feel sorry for all of you who
cannot humble brag yes indeed okay so do
you have any more questions D&amp;amp;S no i
guess i'll wait for you guys to go to
the middle pc hey what's gonna happen
see what happens a good big thing I if
there's that one feature that just wind
you and you just swoon over it I will
laugh a lot out loud well it's alright I
don't pray because I like Android
probably a little more than iOS but
nobody knows that I didn't say that all
right thank you for joining us you want
to lock the camera on her so it is logs
on her right all right have an egg a
great weekend take care everyone I'll
see you guys next week for the last last
of the season yes don't cry don't cry
I'll try thank you there may be a
cliffhanger so you have to come back mr.
Dallas Henley of the gun I can now
actually hear you awesome headed home
bar you from I'm from Michigan I'm
Michigan and what do you want to talk
about today I want to know what your
favorite feature in Iowa today
what could be the next big thing in Iowa
hmm that we're off button sorry I had to
I had to know um today my favorite
feature in iOS honestly it's just the
app ecosystem you want to consider that
a feature because that's really it yeah
the multi-tasking isn't great okay sorry
go ahead Tony good no I was about to say
I would a deer a deer to that but I
would also say that i really like a
quick way of updating your facebook
status and tweeting from the
notification shade and that is something
which i really prefer and again the apps
the way the apps look whether if it's on
the iphone or it's on the ipad and the
entire ecosystem and how well everything
is interconnected and it just works that
is probably the main feature which which
I prefer on iOS hmm well the only thing
I have to disagree with there is the
integration the interoperability because
apps can't work together and do things
they have to work separately but i will
say that my favorite feature i'm going
to stim away from the app ecosystem and
say that gesture support is probably the
best the coolest feature because on my
ipad 4 fingers swipe back and forth and
go between most recent apps and closed
with a pinch funny you should mention
that and we we don't usually talk about
this that much because we are luckily
not in the case it's not the case but
but iOS is probably the best operating
system when it comes to accessibility
options hearing impaired for for for
those who have sight problems the blind
so that I think that's the leading OS
right now that offers that that is true
but I had actually a hold on blind
podcaster on Twitter that's the twitter
handle blind podcaster I'm tweeted me
and said at least on Android hangouts
are a lot more accessible with talkback
than voiceover on I
was from a blind user of both well that
depends is that a a limitation of the OS
or is that a limitation of the hangouts
app itself I don't know that I can't
like we should check yeah but it'sit's
interesting but yes iOS as a general
rule is better for the hearing and
visually impaired mm-hmm but we're off
topic i think ellis go go ahead any
other questions thoughts thank you so
you think that um iphone app iphone net
not really act on iowa and general has
better app and android would you yes yes
i do a lot of people would agree i tend
to disagree but that's just me I'm not
playing the devil's advocate but i just
i prefer the extended functionality over
the form the iOS apps are definitely
prettier in most cases but android apps
having settings built into the app
instead of having go to go to a settings
out and to toggle things and you know
things like that it's just you know if
you mean yeah nap Taylor what is your
tablet choice I'm left now that the
android is the iowa it's die pad mini is
it okay yep no te on verizon that is my
answer it now okay I think you got vape
it on my question thank you you're very
welcome and have a nice awesome awesome
weekend ladies be joining us right take
care Taylor please we have time for I
think two calls h okay two calls each
we're keeping it to the five minutes
because that would be a first wait I'm
gonna I'm gonna stick with another
regular Cesare you've been here and
chatting it up in the group chat all the
whole time so how are you today even uh
I kind of chat the lock ya see that so I
want to start with a question for you
actively I want to hear you're pretty
patience 4wd beauty WWDC if it's
anything that we haven't already talked
about well I want to see how I always
can get smarter I don't know how they
can do that better that's what I was
going to ask you what height x nowhere
context-aware Siri ok so the big no-nos
theory no I know and I'm stemming from
it but the big divide between Google now
and Siri is that Google now is
context-aware it knows things it learns
from your searches it learn from what
you have installed all sorts of
different things Siri is something you
have to call upon you have to say I want
to open you and I have to ask you a
question but with google now it's not
like that it's it's a totally different
syren experience will assist them to
have to ask for her to do something
right so where I'm going with that is
not only Siri but they need to improve
Syria Apple needs to catch Siri up with
everything else but I'd like to see them
bring some of that context aware from
google now to other parts of the
operating system you open something up
and it knows you want to search you open
up I don't know i'd be there are a lot
of ways they can make it smarter I'm
than what it already is and one of those
ways is to make like I've said before
open up the api's and lets you share
something to tweet by it or share
something to gmail or share something to
another third-party app from the browser
to set default apps there are ways that
that make it smarter than what it
already is without a lot of effort that
should happen I don't see why they don't
make the api's go and just have the
option to share to work with a nap
regular it simplistic they like having
to train ya know I conducts okay they
have their own thing but they should
help the other apps developers it's too
closed out now oh yes oh alright so you
were going to ask me a question or Tony
now that was the question I want to know
how I can you meet it as it's Friday
they never it's Friday that's my excuse
yeah i was thinking that widgets are
android swing gestures hmm so and so at
least on the iphone what can they do
besides the ABS know something to the
you are I don't know thank you said
stuff I I'd like to see something
different than the wall of icons all
right Kenny Smith is going to have to
stop you know aside from the fact that
iOS looks the way it looks it has the
static grid of icons yes I think iOS is
is a very very very matured OS so in
terms of features there's not really
that many things which can be at it of
course there could be added a couple of
minor tweaks changes improvements but as
as a whole iOS is a very much your OS
cell hit me they'll have toggles toggles
quick toggles in this in Notification
Center where you can just tap from
anywhere and turn off Wi-Fi or turn on
Wi-Fi or mute instead of having to back
out of what you're doing go to the
Settings app find the setting and then
turn it on or off for jailbreak like I
ain zoo stuff all right Wow Cammy Smith
please please oh that's the weights the
way he's gonna be for the remainder of
the skull he's going to come and go so
that's what i have so about the apple
event and I'm do you see what happens
the next day I'll have an exam so I
don't have to stay up with watch you
should you should take Lucy pocket now
because we will have the usual pocket
now round table or it's not going to be
a round table is going to be live
coverage where Taylor michael brandon
and myself will be watching the event
with our left eyes and watching
ourselves and you guys with the other
eye and commenting on things
they happen take someone does it look at
the direction absolutely and we're the
best at that okay so have a great show
and a great night likewise greg egan
take care man okay i think it is my turn
let's talk to to whom let's talk two
bedroom it's metal estima okay yeah you
don't talk to carrie smith i have to by
the time i see his name he's gonna be
out anyways no pedo please unmute then
let's talk hi guys hi oh you're from
Brazil yeah Rio Rio that is very nice
how's the weather I hope it's it's
warmer than here it's a very warm that
is good i want to move there what do you
want to talk about yeah what talks about
what do you guys think that maybe
because everybody asks what will make
people not go from iOS to Android and my
questions it's exactly the opposite what
do you think that maybe Apple can do to
make people go from Android to iOS if
there is something at this point in time
I don't know free phones yeah well they
already almost reforms I mean if the if
maybe they not not them maybe not now or
maybe later in the year they have like a
larger phone if that's going to make
them I'm not sure that's gonna be the
solution you know better I think that
Apple right now is exactly in that stage
in which Microsoft was when Apple was
taking hits at it I mean Microsoft had
that that well established position on
the market they had the so-called
monopoly an apple was the new kid on the
block was the alternative now Apple is
the one established on the market and
Android with HTC with Samsung and all
the rest are the alternatives and they
are all hitting on Apple's so I think
that that the the balance is shifted a
little bit over time
yeah maybe later what do you think um
stop typing or else we're not gonna be
able to hear you it's of course when I
go to be proactive Cammy Smith stops
joining so I missed the question are you
asking still about what no the question
was what does apple have to do to
convert people from right yeah and I
said that Apple is in this moment in the
exact same situation in which Microsoft
was when Apple was kicking its ass now
Android is kicking apples ass yes what
Apple will have to do to get Android
users to use iOS um file a lawsuit
against google win and put Google out of
its misery which is not ever going to
happen so I honestly honest answer I
don't know um maybe in an iWatch that
really puts every other SmartWatch to
shame but even then you're only talking
to a small number of users who care
about a watch that has notifications and
apps and functionality when you have
stuff like Google glass on the horizon
smartwatches kind of a small little blip
on the map so I think that we have now
in 2013 reach a point where Windows
Phone Android and iOS are so well
established and they all offer their
unique features aside from doing the
same things that it's no longer about
shifting users from one platform to the
other but it's about fighting for new
users first smartphone owners because
I'm not sure a windows phone guy will go
iOS or Android because they love Windows
Phone and that's the same as valid for
Android and iOS so I think that it's no
longer a question of stealing users from
each other maybe probably from
blackberry or from symbian as much as
it's a question of getting first times
too expensive so if a new guy will never
buy an iPhone that is a new guy so this
it's the case around the world unless
you are in the USA I'm here in in
Eastern Europe and then I phone costs
one thousand dollars but that's just
Apple Apple is or at least they want to
be all about premium and they they will
tell you to your face if you can't
afford us move away yes they don't they
don't mind yeah yeah because they're
doing so well pretty much everywhere
else in the world are pretty much
everywhere in the world yeah they're
there they're doing well i mean android
is far ahead in terms of market share
but Apple is just killing everyone in
terms of revenue profit margins
everything but the only thing that
really bothers me because I just love
Android and I love mixing with custom
roms and stuff but if when you go to
accessories I mean the cases and stuff
apple just kick it's because everybody
makes beautiful cases beautiful
lifeproof stuff but I just wanted I left
yeah I know I I just want a lifeproof
for my s4 and I may never see it I never
seen on the s3 and never see on the s4
that's the only thing that bothers me on
the android android because not the
system yeah that's because there's one
iphone a year and there is close to a
hundred android smartphones per year if
not more so what if your application it
is yeah yes of course all right do you
have any any other questions or thoughts
or anything else you'd like to share
with us not that's ok thanks a very very
good pleasure to be here if you guys the
pleasure was on our and i'm gonna lock
my camera on you because i see you have
your twitter handle right there so
everybody if you want to follow bedro
that's where you can find him on twitter
better ok thank you very much have an
awesome awesome weekend well bye take
care my tire taylor final call of the
day is yours all right i'm gonna go with
Alex uh you're sure I don't know how to
pronounce the last name you've been
sitting there very patiently
expressionless and and calm
so how are you how are you you guys hear
me yes you can doesn't me a stock
paceman wondering i know this is an
apple call of wondering about the HTC is
too late to get agency one is the next
best thing around the corner the next
big thing is always around the corner
but that's the problem it's a it's a
catch-22 you wait it out and and pick
the next best thing or the next big
thing or do you just buy something now
if you're cautious you wait because
there is always something on the horizon
but once you wait you're also gonna buy
something and then something else is
going to come out so my advice is to
just get what you want now and try to
look away with it yeah and try to be
happy with it even when new stuff comes
out that's how I've managed to keep
using things like the Galaxy Note 2 or
the nexus 4 I use older devices because
it just doesn't bother me anymore
looking at this 2 1 i'm like that's
really a pretty high opponent that ages
cream and the quad core processor is
very fast and all that and also what
we're gonna go from there and everything
is really great i mean what else they
put on you can't really chew off the
course and 4k displays and twenty five
megapixel cameras and better numerous
better battery life we have two big
things yep those are the two things that
they talk straight to my heart if you
have a phone that has a great camera and
awesome battery life I'm sold that's the
Nokia 808 PureView okay and it has to
have a decent legitimate relevant
operating system yeah and just keep on
adding to the list symbian does not
count anymore share accounts is got
point seven percent of the market yeah
that dropped from like eighty percent
2.7 in like two years I think that was
one of Nucky as biggest mistakes yeah so
and the apple uh-oh you call we call is
it you guys don't think a visor come
from there jbb software
could you repeat the question I could I
didn't get a leaker I at the Apple what
he called a WC I guess you know WWDC I
you guys not be any new devices will
come from there I don't burn new
macbooks but no new iOS devices that's
my prediction that's what I Jenny what's
prediction is yeah we'll see macbook pro
or mate excuse me macbook air with a
Retina Display new mac pros and probably
no iOS devices are it said the iphones
gonna release two iphones and have the
five is funny but cheaper version and
the six is going to be a hand version so
you guys think is that the true that's
just a rumor hi read an article what
what i read an article that said that
your article was wrong thing that most
people fail to remember is that old
models of iphones are still high end and
cheaper you look at the iphone 4s now
it's almost as high end as the iphone 5
just a smaller screen the cameras just
as great by real life and everything is
pretty much on par you just don't have
LTE it's cheaper iphone 4 is just
slightly more lightweight older than the
4s and it's even cheaper and you know on
down the line so that's the the model
that apple is created they don't really
need a cheaper iPhone because that's
what last year's model serves so yeah
that's what I always said uh I would ask
this question for a while now I remember
I remember a hard copy was on your guys
side I mean I'm not sure I remember that
I think Simon hired some time with some
students write that bad things about HTC
it was like Vic I that's retro or like a
like I think the HCI ain't government
find them with something that I I think
I covered a story as I remember it I i
I'm here to follow about what happened
it doesn't do disturbed and then do
oh I have only followed the story up
till the point where where Samsung
acknowledged that they will no longer
use and employ anonymous marketing
policies and politics and and that's
just about it so they basically not
necessarily admitted but indirectly
admitted to that but I'm not sure
whether the Taiwanese government or the
officials have officially find them with
something or or something like this so I
couldn't follow up on that but I know
that HTC UK is right now very busy
selling samsung UK about that and trying
to find yours and ongoing there's an
ongoing Twitter war between HTC UK and
Samsung UK yes as we speak but but no
matter what the result even a great fine
millions hundreds of millions of dollars
it's just a slap on the wrist of Samsung
absolutely yeah but the 20 billion
dollars or what what amounts i have read
today that they had lost in their shares
because some analysts predicted that
that shares are going down because the
galaxy s4 is no longer enjoying that
buzz that's just I'm not going to
comment everybody knows I hate analysts
but that that might hurt if it's the
case and regardless of what the cause is
the stock went down and they lost a lot
of money today I don't happen at some
point when you're starting fleet I think
that this would be my last question is
that I mean I'll talk by 2013 all phones
be waterproof by now but that's on
behave of money how come my prize if I'm
making waterproof phone like you know
all of them by now all right yeah every
show every phone should be waterproof
right now but it's not the technology
has been there for years and it's just
not there it's not being implemented I
have a company called Lake hope Ally
order that you can send your phone in a
day and waterproofing for you yep nada
yeah that idea really a thing um if I'm
not mistaken it voids your warranty
though everything was your foreign to
him because they open it up and they
I think they sprayed them with that
layer of whatever no coding yeah yeah so
I mean that technology companies like
that have been around for the better
part of a decade really there was one
back when I got my first blackberry I
thought about doing it same exact
concept but it's just not implemented on
a large scale my only the only
explanation I can find as why that may
be hello Cammy Smith uh is because it's
hard to work into a manufacturing
process may be that it's more expensive
than the payoff would be something to
that degree that you know it's probably
be there they are doing very very very
small quantities they cannot make an
autumn ization process in which they
probably coat 10,000 thousands they just
work by the order and the it's its
manufacturer it's probably not on a huge
scale like Samsung would need it on a
scale of hundreds or at least tens of
millions of phones and that's a big
project when you have a small company
like Liquipel at least I think it's a
pretty small company looking at color
compared to sams yeah compared to pretty
much any company looking to do something
somebody dancing um when a small company
like that looks at a scale on Samsungs
magnitude it's it's just totally
different so because you could because
if you look outside of the galaxy s4 if
you look at the galaxy note 2 the s3 s4
the active the many all these different
phones if they coat all of them that's
hundreds and hundreds of millions of
phones they would have to code what I
think that the phone is still sell
better and thank you that's an added
plus like la vivienda Xperia Z or Sony
am I I think the only part of the thing
about it or the new tablet from Sony
that is waterproof and that's you know
that's a sighting of the one that we
might have a like a like for example for
Apple watch the only big benefit I see
from switching from a from a from an
Android
to an apple going to be benefit is like
it's expired so you can get advice on
that on the iphone that's like the only
benefit I see for myself but you made
from Andrew to an apple they're out it
may be no I mean I'm not saying I will
and this thing that would only benefit I
see you know of course a year that the
more acts the medical system but I think
that I mean I know a google play store
has much good stores up you know any
funding for me is that there that virus
pretty even the boy free you know click
Angus anyone its kind of that's my
opinion yeah oh but if you look at it
from that perspective if if every
company used a waterproofing technology
it wouldn't be you know a big selling
feature anymore because F as if it were
easy enough for someone like HTC or
Samsung to apply it to their phones then
you would see all the other companies
use it as well that was right yeah oh
yeah but it wouldn't be a selling
feature anymore it's like uh just like a
two thousand million power battery isn't
anymore it's just just something that
every phone has gentlemen let us wrap
this up yeah I gotta get back to work
people like toys yeah thank you very
much for joining us as you view yes
