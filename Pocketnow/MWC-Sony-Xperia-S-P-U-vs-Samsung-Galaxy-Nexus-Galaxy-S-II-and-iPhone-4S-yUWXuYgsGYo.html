weather for parking out comment we're
here at the sony booth we're going to
look at make a comparison of the whole
experience going to be released this
year we've got the Xperia S here which
is the flagship smartphone they've got
the Xperia P which was recently
announced and we've got the expiry you
also we already know the hands on you
guys already know the specs let's just
make a full comparison with other
flagship smartphones so let's start with
the Xperia S this is your
top-of-the-line phone it's gonna be
available in Barcelona as of tomorrow
actually so this is large so anyways but
let's compare it initially with the
Xperia P obviously this is all HD
absolutely everything this is pretty
much qhd display megapixel camera we've
got a 12 megapixel camera here so if we
look at the phones obviously the S is a
little taller it's definitely a little
let's see they're actually almost the
same with we could say you look at them
from an angle at the top obviously the
fee has new technologies like the white
magic that you don't see at the S yet
but obviously this compensates with HD
and just about everything that it has so
this again if you have to choose between
both of them it'll have to do with your
taste obviously this is more entitled
for full power users though that be is
no slug I mean it could definitely play
the same cards in comparison to the S if
we definitely compare the s2 let's talk
about the you the you is like your
entry-level Sony smartphone it's a
beautiful display obviously it's small a
lot of people are out there for small
phones so this probably will bring you
the same Sony Xperia experience only
definitely with not the same size so
definitely a dwarf in comparison with
the S if we compare it with the P
obviously also a dwarf right there but
again it's your perfect entry level
smartphone for kids are just about any
way to start with Sony obviously in my
personal if any light I like any of them
it'll only depend on your preference
obviously again all pretty much the same
with
definitely yeah
and again the height and now let's
compare these with obviously the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus your flagship Android
smartphone the Galaxy Nexus is huge by
comparison but if you compare with the
Xperia S it's I call this the perfect
size by problem with the Galaxy Nexus is
the screen is actually too tough to
touch if you have my hands are big and I
still have problems but if you notice
with the Xperia S it's not that
complicated will have a full review soon
for you to compare them obviously you
could consider the Galaxy Nexus to be
thinner but remember the hump at the
bottom it's kind of a little bit of a
tough way to compare but I'd consider
them almost the same we could probably
try the Galaxy Nexus that compared with
the you stick them a theater in Mecca
let's try to do that let's just see
there we go with dwarf obviously little
thinner let's try with the P obviously
taller but again the Galaxy Nexus tries
to show that it's thinner not the same
case we were able to compare the iphone
4s with the be at the keynote obviously
almost the same height we were able to
see that the TrueView technology on the
Xperia P was much better than the screen
resolution on the iphone 4s with the
whites though the thickness will notice
pretty much the same let's see what the
Xperia S sorry
almost the same thickness iphone far as
this a little bit thinner but not that
big of a deal and then let's go with the
you obviously the you is going to be the
iphone 4s is a tad taller than me you
obviously a little bit wider thickness
wise almost the same deal and then
obviously the galaxy s2 that almost
everybody has not our favorite phone too
plasticky if we would compare build
quality with the Xperia line and then
with the samsung flagship smartphones
I'd go with the Xperia line definitely
on built quality the same almost the
same height a little taller on the
Xperia S obviously a little bit I don't
know if that could be shown on camera
but a little bit thinner but again
plasticky great build quality it's a
no-brainer
almost pretty much the same height
bigness wise again and then obviously
let's go with you a dwarf in comparison
with the galaxy s2 taller obviously a
little thicker so again finalizing
what's your next smartphone well it BBS
will it be the feed well the Sony Xperia
line be worth it for you in our
comparison honestly going through the
vent of the past build quality from Sony
I wasn't a big fan of the xperia play a
little too plasticky but the new Xperia
line definitely proves to have a lot of
really great build quality a lot of
great specs out there I'm not
considering it a catch up I actually
consider the folks be quite compelling
we saw something really good in the hand
side over the yesterday so we would
recommend the experian thank you very
much Tony on camera Lucian the coffee
was great thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
