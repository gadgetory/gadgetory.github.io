slash now hello everybody and welcome to
the weekly brought to you by pocket now
and xda-developers on this day the 29th
of March 2019 now we have a whole lot of
stuff to talk about today this was a
weird announcements week that's pretty
much what I called it this week and we
watched every single announcement that
was happening there actually a lot of
them even Sony Playstation had their own
but we're not talking about that one
what we're talking about today are going
to be Apple's announcements my guest
today has a lot of opinions on that we
have the Apple announcements but then
just the I think it was the day after
was huawei's announcements and of course
that has to do with the Huawei P 30 and
the P 30 Pro however I do want to focus
not only on the phones from Huawei but
also all of the other products that they
announced because there's a lot to get
excited about just in terms of a
just in terms of just the products that
were announced on stage and that's
outside of the smartphone itself in any
case we do have one guest on our show
for today last week we had a high me and
David Cogan the week before it was just
me and you as well so we have our
two-person podcast back with thundery of
bored at work what's going on man I'm
good a good how are you doing doing okay
got my got my coffee this morning I know
you you tease me all the time about
about coffee in the morning yeah yeah
you know I'm drinking water how to work
out ready to roll I've talked about
Apple with Kwan on his his podcast on
Monday I'm gonna relay some of those
thoughts here but before I even do
anything I have to excuse myself briefly
because I need to plug in my Sony a7
three before it actually dies fair
enough I have mine set up over here I
wish everyone could see the way that I
have my camera setup right now because
since I'm always in a hurry leading up
to the broadcast of the the weekly I
have to like Jimmy up a bunch of song
right now I have a 1 plus 60 box McLaren
Edition I have a nest thermostat box I
have a me 9 box that that's the next
phone I'm reviewing by the way the show
me me 9 then a bunch of books that also
includes the bulletproof diet all
stacked up and then the cameras on top
because I can't feasibly put a tripod on
top of this table here uh this is
actually where I do my overhead rig so
right here is my my overhead camera and
also one thing that I wanted to put out
there
EW I'll show you again in a little bit
but to any of our our geeky fans out
there just wanted to show off this tee
shirt real quick spoiler alert my
brother got me this shirt I thought it'd
be really funny to wear it on that on
the show yeah no I see the shirt I was
gonna say you can get a mini tripod I'll
send you a link no I have a mini tripod
I just had no time to set it up
I always never I'm gonna set it up after
this that way I could just clip it on my
mini tripod is forever on my on my desk
right there okay yeah all right so
Monday started off real interesting I
remember waking up it was kind of early
I remember it being like it was it was
kind of an early announcement I remember
waking up and I watched the entire thing
by the way Apple doesn't
broadcast their keynotes on YouTube
they don't use any Google services for
that Twitter you can now watch on
Twitter and you can watch it live off
their website which is what I did which
I was having trouble like chrome casting
it from my xiaomi to my TV like I was
having trouble trying to figure that out
so eventually I just found there were a
bunch of people just ripping the stream
just putting it up YouTube yeah that was
hilarious
um but okay let's go ahead and do this
like little by little so everybody in
the chat by the way let us know what you
think about all of these Apple
announcements we're gonna start off with
the first main one that they had and
that was Apple News plus magazines
there's all about magazines in this case
now they did give a big shout out to the
Los Angeles Times I'm from LA it was
actually one of my dreams growing up to
actually work at the LA Times so I
always have do they always have a soft
spot of my heart so to see that I was
like cool LA Times like going more and
more digital but far as magazines go and
all of the rest how did you feel about
Apple News plus there's your reaction
right there yeah I mean I mean it's nice
and dandy but somebody said I think what
does Engadget if somebody had an article
about you know the fact that you know
these magazines are doing what they need
to do but is it the best things for them
to do plus I think we also are in the
situation I was having this conversation
with Sam about how magazines refused to
to evolve you know I mean I like I like
the idea of a curated magazine section I
wish I wish Flipboard did it not Apple I
wanted somebody to do it that is away
from anybody's ecosystem I'm gonna be
great you know if Flipboard was the one
who had done it I would have at least
liked it a little bit more but again
it's magazines one of the things we
talked about was like magazines refused
to adopt a formula that fit into social
media that's what has killed them you
know I like car driver you know I like
Motor Trend I like those magazines and
they have a YouTube channel but you know
for me I'm going if you got a lead up to
a long review on the site that goes into
detail breakdown right you have a
website oh yeah
an app that has a DT that gives me the
detailed written breakdown everything
you do why are you not teasing the fact
that you're just testing out the
brand-new Camaro right on Twitter show a
couple of clips there you know give me a
head by head comparison with the older
Camaro on YouTube I mean that's a big
magazine that they will give them those
cars it's not like it's not like small I
mean it's not small outlet like you know
they get these cars for like three four
months to spend time with it right so if
you're teasing that stuff for me I will
definitely be checking it out because
I'm like oh okay zero to 60 in the
Camaro okay I see that it's a short clip
on Twitter and then I'm like you know
they're showing me Camaro versus a Tesla
Camaro versus support like that's the
stuff that gets me to now go okay I want
to buy a Camaro now let me look at
everything that's in there in depth and
that's how you generate traffic and I
feel like they just have not grown so
Apple has the opportunity there's
nothing wrong with Apple doing this
stuff it's it's cool it's nice but I
think if you move down a generation it's
passed in the sense you know and I think
that's I mean I could be wrong you guys
can tell me the chat but even though yes
I'm I'm you know I'm on the upper side
of the Millennials we're technically I'm
not really a millennial but you know for
me magazines just don't make any sense
at all yeah I mean speaking as people
who live on social media like I shudder
to use the term influencer but we
understand how all of these different
platforms work like if you are a
publication you need to make content
that caters to each of the platforms so
you have something for Twitter you have
something for YouTube you have something
for Facebook you have something for
Instagram and a lot of these brands tend
to do that but the magazine format kind
of betrays all of that because if you
have that information in plenty of other
platforms to begin with what's the point
of actually subscribing to a magazine
when all that info is easy to find on
their website anyway but that's that's
for the fool that's why to me a magazine
it's it makes sense if you do it a way
where you're leading up to a very big
detailed expose it's for a car driver
friendly I use contracted with this I
like car driver but I will also want
when that monthly issue comes out I see
the full breakdown why the new Camaro is
better I see horsepower torque balance I
see it on different tracks I see on D
like all you're teasing me is one track
and that's just one video that we hit
how many hundreds of thousands of views
or maybe even close to a million because
they are the first ones who have it
right you know that's the kind of thing
that's why I said that when you build up
to that then it becomes something where
your big your big reveal is a full
breakdown of of the car of the month
plus a big review of the month then they
also because they do this is contract
they do this six-month review of a car
like after driving the car for 30,000
miles then I can see then I should be
seeing content written content on that
and a short of five minute video about
somewhere oh yeah somewhere else on
YouTube but it's still linked to this
that's how you connect it like you have
to build it so that at least as a car
driver fan I know I want to get that
broken I don't know how will work for
every other publication out there but I
think making it where the the the user
receives all that information constantly
logo there is Android Central there's
Android authority this pocket now right
you still go to the website the website
is the magazine let's just call it what
it is
yeah it's missing right the website is
the magazine except in this case you
guys still make content on YouTube you
make content on Twitter there is some
Facebook content you know this Instagram
content but we still wait for the big
stuff we wait for the big break down so
you know big for the written stuff out
there I mean like Windows Phone central
is a prime example right they make
youtube videos I still go there and read
this stuff because they do a very
different breakdown on the website yeah
I just don't get the whole magazine
aspect I mean it's cool to look at it on
you and to me that's the software that
is all just a programmer making a nice
presentation layout which your Apple
does a good job and all our program has
to do a good job for you but well it was
obviously all ecosystem stuff right so
what what Apple is trying to do is get
all of these big brands and we're talk
about big brands first off with Apple
News plus speak of Babel news plus
there's a couple of stuff
a couple of comments in the live chat in
many ways Peter Hayden in many ways I
feel like News Plus is what Apple News
should have always been that's kind of
true for a lot of evolutions of not only
products but services also like this you
actually have all of these big brands
these no I wouldn't say brands but
publications that they do act like
brands a lot these days though you have
all these big publications coming in
actually adding to the ecosystem Apple
is gonna get a huge cut from a lot of
these people trying to represent high
farm 30% that's a big cut that's also
what they get off of actual applications
so for the big publications to come in
invest not only their content but also
some other money into being in this
ecosystem I mean that kind of makes
sense I can see where people who are
actually reading magazines on the
regular feel a little bit better that
everything is in one place which is also
common that some people said here like
where is it again Peter Aidan I
genuinely believe that for those people
who read magazines and there are a lot
of people out there this service would
actually be interesting for them I agree
but I want to move a little bit away
from like the actual big publications
KooKoo and the price is $9.99 a month
that's right
this is one of the few services that
actually had a price point throughout
the entire announcement but we also have
another one that came out the moving
away from big publications and moving
into the Indies this is what this is one
I'm really interested in hearing from
you um
indie game developers investing their
content and some of their revenue to be
part of a new exclusive ecosystem that
Apple has created for their iPhones
iPads and Mac's
called Apple arcade like where do you
land on on this not only from a gamer
standpoint but also from a developer
standpoint because if you're really
struggling to get eyeballs on to your
content yes having having placement in
Apple arcade helps people get to see
your game but does the trade-off of the
30% or whatever how much actually matter
it matters so you get to spend sighs
that's literally what it is I mean
there's a reason why you will not see
epic in there oh yeah no it's not even
just in these really just games right in
general but I know they've got a focus
for indie developers because they know
those are the people they can poach on
it's just all
you know Pub GE in the EAS with asphalt
those even all the the big RPG games
you're not gonna find them on there
because it makes no financial sense and
I just want to hearken on that 30% just
because this week also Spotify dropped a
video explaining why they are taking
Apple to task in Europe because they say
hey look Apple is a direct competitor
against us and they are taking 30% now
yeah which we tend to forget which is
true you should not be doing that so
they basically basically if you think
about it if Apple Spotify basically
comes out and has Spotify music right
and to be on the Apple Store having a
subscription that goes to the Apple
Store Apple takes 30% if you sign up
through 3 that I mean through the 3 or
Foe
I believe that's exactly the way it is
now iTunes music comes along and Apple
is not subsidizing basically Spotify is
subsidizing Apple's own service which is
absolutely wrong I don't care whether
you like it or not you should you can't
be doing that that's something that they
would have to not do so with developers
you're looking at that in that aspect
where every game you make you're losing
30% Apple makes most of his money like
this it's not selling iPhones never has
been well this is the end this is the
methodology for companies out in China
like Xiaomi you have 10 cent and WeChat
it's all based upon like the cut that
they get by having content on their
platform so I mean this is just America
catching up to what has been be
successful I've been doing this forever
this is how they've made most I mean
iPhone oh yeah I agree
yeah always been a big sale but the
Apple the App Store has been the main
bread and butter remember if you don't
him down now though yeah doubling down
earlier this year Tim when they had that
revision and everybody was scared about
Apple and the stock price dropped and
Tim Cook said look we're gonna focus
more on services everybody thought they
were gonna offer something new and fresh
this is Apple they never do it means
that we're gonna double down on what's
already there so news is now news plus
it was already something that's there
every time yeah the the gaming arcade is
just a solid vacation of
we have games on the App Store that's
literally it really it's it's not just
but they have content that's gonna be
exclusive that was actually a huge word
during the announcement was exclusive
content exclusivity exclusivity and so
sort of harken back some people in the
chat were asking where Jaime is he's
actually traveling to South America
right now so he's in the air currently
while we're doing this cast I do want to
harken back to something he said while
we were talking about a bunch of gaming
content over the last number of weeks
the problem with games on mobile
platforms is that Sochi on Android
they're available for so many devices
that it's hard to pinpoint them for
pistorius specific audience like that's
on Android now on Apple you literally
have games that are only available on
Apple arcade and you know this is why I
may was saying like if you create
exclusivity when it comes to games it
actually makes them more desired makes
you want to have the thing that makes
that game possible and in this case it's
iPhone iPad Mac oh no I definitely hear
that and that's very very cheap here's
the thing about gaming and we're talking
about exclusive concert look we'll go
back to Stadio google says they'll have
exclusive content you can say you can
have exclusive content and look at
gaming truly Microsoft has had a hard
time making exclusive content Sony has
had a better luck but we all know who's
the king of exclusive content its
Nintendo oh yeah
exclusive content is not about content
it's about recognizable IP and ya know
but nobody nobody shows more love to
Indies than Nintendo yeah yeah I mean no
recently though recently Microsoft is
the one who used to show a lot of I mean
they still do actually but Nintendo
because of the way the switches but but
going back to Apple yeah it makes sense
but I might what I'm saying here is that
I don't think this is a service that
will do as much as the hope I think the
news will actually do for a a large
number of iPhone users because there are
a lot of older people who use iPhones
when I say old I mean people were
literally only 10 years older than me
and they they tend to be dumb switching
to anything else and I'm calling my
friends out there when I say I'm not
trying to insult I'm just saying that
the big kind of lazy in switching you
don't want to list a feel comfortable so
those are the kind of people that would
get that
the games I think it all depends on who
you are but I think a lot of the games
that are big are not gonna be affected
and what people spend a lot of time on I
think you'll see a good significant
pickup I think what they will if you're
smart enough if they focus on children's
games Apple can now say this is games
for your kids that we have checked and
it's safe then the parent will pay $9.99
a month for those games that's where
they can make it make them money vote
for it
yeah we're getting a lot of messages in
the chat about like what the price would
be for something like this because
you're paying a month you're paying for
access that's the thing so this is
everything is becoming a subscription
thing so your paper access is gonna be
monthly and then you get access to these
games you can play them all you want and
one thing that I did like about the
apple arcade announcement was that you
pay for the access you download the game
but every game well I'm this is what
they said on it was kind of vague with
their language on on stage but
apparently every game is going to be
playable offline so these are
necessarily online games so as long as
you're paying for the access you can
play the games however like just as much
as you want they're offline blah blah
blah so so a couple people were saying
like thirteen ninety-nine a month that
seems like a lot for Friday yeah I would
say $9.99 but that $13.99 it's gonna be
interesting because right now microsoft
offers xbox live arcade way I think over
100 games right now so 100 games but
it's adding it for $9.99 a month hmm
these are these are console quality
games but I get it like I said if you do
towards parents that might be something
that it makes sense now somebody had a
comment in the chat said $5.99 5s egde
if they do that they watch the news
customers they would absolutely want it
because people could now get whatever
phone they want mm-hmm be fine you know
oh yeah I think that's funny if they if
I message was a paid service oh my god
you have any idea how much backlash
there would be people will get so mad
and then what if they made like I miss
people who are on free iMessage for like
a dumber shade of blue compared to
people who know if you could move
iMessage over
what you do is you do you do $9.99 for
the app and then a one dollar a year
service fee perhaps by the way all these
people who complain okay I've seen I've
finally seen it firsthand I know a lot
of people who complain about the green
when they talk to people on my message
who are on Android phones like it's it's
kind of smart on Apple's part to make
that green so disgusting but at the same
time I'm like why does it bother you so
much you know the only thing I get with
iMessage which is useful is whenever you
send video you get the full resolution
of was a friend sent me a video and I
looked at it and I was like yeah cuz you
know I have text and then he sent it and
I'm like I'm gonna watch this it's all
it's all crunched out so I get that
aspect of it but I don't see that
happening yeah for sure
okay now before we get to like the main
one that I know you have so many
opinions on would you okay
are you I was on Twitter the entire time
by the way one of my tweets went
absolutely viral and that's about this
particular subject I'm not looking
forward to the days I live in LA you're
in Brooklyn so we live in two particular
places where we know that we're gonna
see people in cafes in bars and
restaurants and we're gonna hear this
phrase a lot I get there are some
responses to my tweet and I get it yes
it is a MasterCard but you know you're
going to hear people say oh do you
accept Apple card do you said Apple card
Dubcek Apple card I'm not looking
forward to that at all
on Twitter I did see a lot of people say
like this is ridiculous but I'm gonna
get it
were you one of those people enough dead
I don't need I don't need any more desks
so I mean the card is made I get it it's
very synergistic to your iPhone
that's what I don't like like I hate I
personally hate being close to the
ecosystem I'm a windows person and being
a Windows user makes you so susceptible
to open markets right you want to use
your stuff the only way I get it so this
is basically the evolution of Apple pay
to say if Apple pay doesn't work you can
use a card but here's the downside of
Cardon everyone kept on forgetting right
is that there are no numbers on the
corner like oh yeah because it just uses
like whatever it gives you a random
number each time I'm like true except
when you try to swipe it it doesn't work
mm-hmm I got a plan you have to say like
let me see your card and then you show
it to them and you're like oh hold on
you got to take your phone out you got
to go to the app and like here's my
number number
exactly and that's EMS and that's the
thing and I was and I was talking to
someone I said look I had this
experience so I'm doing a PC build once
you get a clamp to bend the PCB PCB
pipes I'm out of Home Depot with Sam and
we get a clamp we get there I scan it
and I was like I should use Samsung pay
but like not like let me just it may not
work
I don't know if because some separation
should work everywhere unless you block
it that's the thing you know it's true
everywhere unless the company actually
blocks it because I tried it in an Apple
store II work the first time the second
time it doesn't work because he blocked
it so I put in my chip didn't work then
I swiped didn't work and the guy was
like what's going this is like I can see
the card because I went through self
checkout then he typed in the number
yeah didn't work oh really
dirty work and it sounds like Sam
something and I went work that's like I
should ban you from the very beginning
now does he look spaced better about the
saying that you were run into weird
situations like that where the MF ST
radio signal works with the credit card
swiper because it couldn't actually
swipe properly but it can read a signal
if it came through and the number
punchin didn't work for whatever reason
and the chip wasn't working you're gonna
run to some of those issues especially
when you go into smaller towns and
smaller places because when you get
abroad yeah when you get when you get
the card you want to use the benefits
you know this cash back and all that
kind of stuff so I get it you forget
it's Apple it's a credit card that has
some benefits so you want to use those
cash back benefits and when you get
there you can't use it and also when you
use it as a card you're gonna get 1% if
you're using with Apple pay you get 2 or
3% so they're trying to force you away
from that and there's no late fees on
the card which is interesting so
which is not nope not true not true
because if you have a late fee they add
to your interest your interest goes up
your engine stop if you write yeah not
nothing late fee but the interest goes
up yeah and the other thing here too is
that because this is Goldman Sachs first
card and also because of all my socks is
the issuing Bank I can guarantee you
that it's not gonna be for a lot of
people it's gonna be for people with a
credit range of maybe I would say seven
eighty eight hundred up just to ensure
that you know you have people who can
pay I just thought of something um all
of you out there who are getting really
excited about the Apple car just because
there's a logo on there like I'm not I'm
not trying to say that this is gonna be
a bad card I mean they're gonna be some
issues like like Anna bong was saying
just now but um but the thing is like if
you're if you're into this card so much
that you're going to apply for it
immediately don't do that because
applying for a card already puts a ding
on your credit score if you don't know
that right now you don't you shouldn't
be applying for this card I don't want
there to be so many people out there who
all of a sudden have lower credit scores
because they're doing credit checks just
to get this card look just make sure
that you get your credit history up and
when and then you can get either the the
chief what can wait to get yourself the
Chase Sapphire or you can get yourself
an American Express black card so when
your friend drop the Apple card you can
say my card we eat your card your money
your life so take that away yeah
all right so before we get too long into
these I want to get into the meat of the
Apple announcements okay they were
already they already peaked my interest
during Apple arcade when they brought in
one of the makers of Final Fantasy but
the name-dropping they took it to eleven
ones Apple TV plus became a thing and
then here's where here's where I and I
were having so many conversations about
like what what does this all mean well
does this all matter we were I was I
wasn't okay I'm gonna let you go ahead
and I gave your opinions on it because I
was gonna say I wasn't quite as upset as
you were but I don't think you about
upsets not the word I think like you
just had a lot to say about it trash
absolutely trash
okay I've said probably is the word yeah
it was a waste of so for me the whole
press conference was two hours we see
time yeah it was a long it was a long
one and I remember thinking like a lot
of her friends were there like super
staff was there Michael Josh was there
and they were like what are you going to
do videos on like our fellow youtubers
are there what exactly are you gonna do
if anyone even I couldn't do a video on
it reacting to all of these
announcements because I figured we were
gonna do it on this podcast but they had
nothing to do they flew out there just
for that mm-hmm no I mean I think what
it was like to me this is something they
could have announced the new stuff they
are Apple arcade could be an announced
online actually as a press release the
TV stuff could have been a shorter
announcement so here's the thing Apple
is getting to the TV game right is
Google going again to TV game now Google
is actually moving out by the way
YouTube is no longer doing premium
original content didn't scan that right
now Microsoft is not even smelling in
this area Microsoft has some shares in
Netflix so I guess they are okay with
that the own part of the company so the
question is that whole announcement what
was it for what's the service the I
think the biggest annoyance was the fact
that didn't announce a price or even
when they said fall so sometime around
the I guess even around the iPhone 11
launch or after the 11 launch
you know maybe in October or something
like that is when this will come through
here's why I called a complete trash
because Apple does not understand
entertainment so they invited Spielberg
who by the way made all this brouhaha
about Netflix you know what you know
maybe maybe he still feels the same way
it's just that he's now making money
from Apple that's fine as long as he
comes out and says look whatever I make
here should not be should have even I'm
late for an Oscar exactly exactly then
I'm cool I get it divided up women they
invited because Evans was there you know
there were a lot of stars even JJ
haysoms JJ Abrams
come on Gianni who's announced whose
actual teaser by the way was the only
one that made me feel like I should get
this cuz that story that he was
announcing up there about the I wanna
say Pakistani immigrant who like ran a
hotel all by himself because his parents
yeah they're deported or something
that's so that's it that is an actual
story I got I got so annoyed that I
didn't pay any of that I was like this
is just rubbish because there were no
trailers you showed me nothing right
it's true that's trauma and yeah granted
I might check out it I might see his
show I mean I don't even know here's the
thing here's the big thing that a lot of
people and a lot of techies sense amidst
which is why I always find funny
whenever Apple announcements come out
Apple is facing up uphill task with TV
plus it doesn't matter whether you have
in an installed base again content is
king hmm what does Netflix do every
month they they filter stuff in and out
yeah in and out but but now they have
more original content every month if you
noticed is starting from last year with
bird dogs there is one key Netflix movie
every month you may not I can't Ameno
begun but it's always been there right
bread box was fun it was interesting
they had the just had the one with Ben
Affleck here tonight there's another one
coming up with Kevin Costner there's a
couple others and these things don't
cost them too much money but they spend
money for this kind of content they are
building their content library even if
yes like yeah we know daredevil and the
rest of them are gone but how weakens
our concern oh they now have content
they're building their own superhero
library because they went and bought a
comic publisher to actually make that
stuff there that's why then the biggest
behemoth is coming in the fall Disney no
that's right Disney is coming and let's
put it this way every parents I know
we'll have a Disney account just
automatically because you have kids
second all of you there want to watch
all these Star Wars shows that they have
they've got two already coming up
already shooting as it is right now and
then we have coach all coming Knights of
the Old Republic which is gonna be a
huge then we have every Marvel TV show
now there they're doing plus-x ma'am
they finally got the rights to X minutes
yeah so so think about it this way if
you don't think about the dollars you're
going to spend on on stream II most
likely you already have Netflix
that's what Disney is gonna eat up your
number two right there you're thinking
is Apple gonna take over that or will I
go to Hulu or or what he has a trick
who owns roughly about 55% of Hulu guess
which company was it I can't I can
remember off the top of my head well
that's right Disney because yeah so they
own ABC they're both Fox right now what
that means is that most likely Disney
will either have Hulu as a bundle
package maybe an extra five bucks or
some small amount with your your Disney
package that leaves Apple in a very
precarious situation which is why if you
look to write Google pulled out not just
because they can't do it on you know I
have money it's just not a feasible
landscape plus the amount of content
that's going around then Amazon is also
there to Amazon is there because it's
tied into your Amazon subscription
number one Amazon is gonna be dropping a
lot of rings show end of this year I
believe again it shows that blitter you
take me go oh I want to see it yeah you
know that's why all the then we have CBS
all access yes they have a Star Trek a
few Star Trek fine you're gonna get it
and then there's another I mean like
those are the kind of things that they
need to show me like I didn't see I saw
a brief trailer real and I was like okay
this is nothing this is just literally
three second clips three or five second
clips of things that I don't know what
this is about I need to see trailer some
of these shows and go okay what's your
sci-fi show what's your trauma
what's your thriller what's you sure
that I don't understand what it is but
goddamn that looks good yeah exactly
that's that's what you need to give me
and they will learn that lesson but
right now they're not going to get which
is why they they're gonna face the
problem that they're facing with iTunes
the fact that there are more people on
iPhones modified that would I choose
music I think the only I think the only
Apple original content that was actually
interesting enough to make me think do I
want Apple music was like carpool
karaoke but nothing that was announced
on stage I think that was teased on
stage I should say actually gave me that
whole feeling of like oh I actually
really want to watch that it's it's
something that I could like really watch
on the regular aside from the community
on anything but that wasn't like a
highly intellectual level like the all
of the content that was up there was
like on this weird intellectual plane
that only people who live in the Bay
Area would like totally be into like
well think about it right I like it
that's the problem look at Netflix we've
got our season Aziz Ansari um the other
guy that does Patriot Act what's his
name again
Hasan Minhaj Hasan Minhaj is show which
is basically a comedy show around news
yeah I mean again it's it's like Comedy
Central except this is stand-up right
he's doing a standard version of that
it's hilarious and it's there I mean
like that's the kind of stuff that I
mean Apple I just if you showed like if
they should content that I went oh wow
okay yeah all right I mean I might have
to get this service and or just watch it
on my samsung TV sure you know but they
didn't and I'm not saying they won't
have don't get me wrong it's gonna be a
hard battle to get there that's a
different because here's the thing
people will still be paying for the
HBO's hmm right it's not gonna pay for
their Netflix because Netflix is not
gonna be on the service obviously people
are still gonna be paying for the other
streaming services and you're right like
they're also stacked that TV Plus still
doesn't have anything so compelling that
it would but the thing is it's gonna be
another this is the reason why I harp on
the whole thing of like it's all
subscriptions subscription subscription
subscription this is why we talked last
week about Google stadia about how like
you're just gonna add another
subscription there aren't gonna be a lot
of people who are just like alright put
it on my credit card
like there's another monthly fee yes so
this is why I look here I look at that
and I go I think even maybe Microsoft
might have a better idea like a lobby
but say Microsoft we're gonna go full
subscription for gaming and I don't
think so hmm I think I think what
Microsoft is gonna give you is a weird
mix imbalance is that number one you can
stream you're right now you can stream
your Xbox games directly yeah that's
nice but instead of you paying for
subscription service you pay for xbox
live game past and you get the game's
not the subscription and and that keeps
you in your own realm offline as long as
my xbox is you know the allowances Power
Save mode on or whatever you want to
call it and then I'm good or the set up
a proper mode that just says okay as
long as you have two parties in Xboxes
in this mode whatever you have on Xbox
game live you can actually play what I
extreme in from their servers or from
your xbox it all depends on C's but
eventually by 2020 you're gonna get into
the very quick subscription fatigue
kazamia let's let's do the math right
now right
I pay $14.99 I pay $15 for Netflix
because I need to have the 4k Netflix
then I pay hulu hulu I think $9.99 for
Hulu no no the the ad-free version I
think is 11 or 12 let's go to $12 $12
for whoo right there's that then there's
also HBO which is another 15 bucks right
there right so you're looking at 30 plus
12 42 42 dollars in there
then I've got Spotify right which is
another $9.99 for Spotify Premium I
believe because I want I better buy high
res audio you know higher than shitty
quality audio so that's another 10 bucks
right there that's making you fifty two
dollars on there now granted if you're
thinking you're going man your pain a
lot well I'm smarter I'm sharing all my
services so I don't pay all that amount
but it does but if I were to even go
further luckily I have crunchy and I'm
an opera Hulu and Netflix do have a
lotta enemy but I couldn't get
crunchyroll and come on my anime fix or
something no I was $9.99 for no ads and
HD or you can get the free version but
if you want no ads in HD you go
that's fax it up then if I were to add
in any of these games
descriptions yep right PlayStation now
Xbox Live Apalachee right in there oh
and and Quan bought up a very good point
big gaming subscription it says how will
that affect net neutrality because when
that kicks in and that gets higher it's
in their providers gonna say hey look
you know what Google study you need to
pay us more money because you're using a
lot of bandwidth right but here's the
other part for us consumers you do know
that you actually have a cap for you
Internet users at home you say you never
reach it you actually have a cap the
internet hope somebody thinks about
three to five hundred gigabytes if you
are streaming games I guarantee you hit
that in a week yeah yeah
that's what's gonna happen but they does
all of the all of the internet providers
are just gonna have to they're gonna to
find a way doesn't leader your internet
bill is gonna go up too and that's on
top of all the subscriptions you're
paying and all of that so it's crazy
okay before we get too far on this one
we do have to get to our while we talk
so this was all of the stuff you just
heard was day one of this week this was
just Monday the next day was walk away
so we're gonna get into that but first
we do have a little bit of a break all
right let me get into this one if you
are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of
remote controls you have cluttering your
entertainment space then you should
check out the control center by kaavo
the control center simplifies your home
theater so you can control everything
connected to your TV with one remote
that includes voice control plug any
media system into your control center
even your game console and it will take
care of the rest one universal voice
remote controls at all just say what you
want to watch and you can enjoy every
second of your viewing time without
having to lift a finger and search for
other remotes this is a big problem in
my house actually my parents have this
thing where they press the buttons way
too hard on the remotes and then they
become inoperable that's part of the
reason why I needed to get something
like this and it also made all five of
our remotes just become what check it
out for yourself and get 40% off the
control center with the promo code
weekly
that brings the price down some 5995
from the original 99.95 service plans

free control center is available at CAA
veoh.com and best buy control center by
kaavo one remote that does it all
all right cool can I ask you a quick
question
either is that shirt an apple shirt oh
no iPhone name of company it's a
luggage company
oh okay cuz the same exact font I've
been looking at that this all tonight
yeah I mean they base their base out in
the west coast okay so before we get
into the hallway stuff I did want to
have one other guest on here at the very
least who had like the p30 in hand
because I'm getting my my review unit
sometime next week
you had Dani sin go out and he has it
right yeah but my Union is coming in
tomorrow so expect more videos it's
gonna be a barrage of videos coming in
more than likely yeah next week is gonna
be really crazy and then a week after
that we have even more announcements
that we can't talk about yet but just
look forward to the next couple of weeks
now one thing I did want to touch upon
because since we have you know the
self-proclaimed quote-unquote gamers
here um did you watch Sony PlayStation's
state of play event did you like watch
it back after the fact because I know
you you asked me what I was watching
when I was tweeting about it no no I I'm
not a big PlayStation gamer oh yeah I'm
really okay I'll confess I've never been
a fan of PlayStation at all my whole
life I was a Nintendo diehard
so when PlayStation came out I refused
to get a Playstation now my first
PlayStation was the PlayStation 4 nice
yes that's how good but I still played
games in my friend's house with
Playstations and stuff like that so I'm
not the biggest playstation game okay I
mean God of War fantastic you have it
I have iconic spider-man yes I haven't
touched you I've not had time I need
just like to spend time in places that's
how I feel right now like I'm playing a
sec you know shadows died twice right
now and I know I heard that game is
difficult it's so hard like expert in
local game and I'm not I'm not
first in Dark Souls or blood-borne games
so I'm I'm coming in doubly blind so I'm
dying left it's also okay so the state
of play event it was another
announcement that happened it actually
happened right after the Apple event
which is the reason why I wanted to
bring it up for a second it's great to
see that everybody's starting to do
these like live events this was
basically Playstations version of like
what they call a Nintendo Direct yeah
but not nearly as good so they did do
some announcements around like Mortal
Kombat 11 and all that stuff so I mean I
just want just to give you further
context audience as to just how much of
an of an announcement week this was like
that was another one that came up even
yesterday I don't know if you have any
uh any thoughts on this Borderlands 3 so
oh yeah so like there's so much stuff
going on this week but of course
probably the biggest one aside from the
Apple one is the hallway announcements
so I was not there at the event didn't
really work out this time for me to be
able to go but I did see a lot of our
people including Jaime were out there
and that's and again the reason why he's
not on the show today is because he just
came back from Paris where they had the
announcement that he's flying back home
so he's just traveling and traveling and
the guy the guy is such a such a trooper
when it comes to the podcast most of the
time but if he's in the air I mean
obviously we can't get him on so but if
he was jet-lagged all to hell he would
still try to be on alright so you were
not there you did get a look at the
phone though you did do plenty of plenty
of looks at the device I was hoping to
have somebody on who actually has it on
hand but you have way more information
about this fund than I do
I just I'm just working off of
everything that was on YouTube boom but
I mean so we had a pretty briefing early
so a lot of people working I got this in
my first video they were like you're
using gadgets Matt's video I was like
well look we there were only a couple of
devices available I'm yeah yeah here and
you know we know Michael Josh oh we were
just and he was basically mourning for
us just pretty much it but the devices
is nice I mean the it feels a lot like
the p20 in a sense you know now has the
dimple notch it's the front-facing
camera I'm concerned about most
because while we spar 15 cameras are
atrocious ly bad for my skin color they
make me look pale so it's lld are low
low dynamic range does I so I've got a
test that out more but the cameras in
the back I mean at the pre-briefing
event it was good I mean like the zoom
functionality is really good it is on
point
distel you know they've got that 5 5x
optical 10x hybrid 50 just for the for
the front of it and you saw that if you
go on if you go on Instagram you can
check out all the guys who were there
you know pink out Fisher Tim Schofield
the the ultra photos zoom into the
Eiffel Tower and from a distance where
you could read the lettering yes it was
fuzzy be still read the letter e yeah
exactly
there are a lot of there are a lot of
side by sides that people are doing and
just give a shout-out to one homie out
in Hong Kong Ben's sin he he did one
immediately a moment he got back to Hong
Kong and he had one with like it was the
p30 Pro the s10 and the I want to say
the previous the p20 or the meet 20 I
forget which one well yeah he was like
zooming into a bunch of signs in Hong
Kong and it's like it's crazy how much
detail is in there and that's what I
find so interesting about this this
announcement like there were always
marquee features for the last 2 or 3
Huawei phones that we all got excited
about I think the p20 was the first one
to actually properly do that night mode
and then so that was fun and then the
May 20 came out and it was night mode
with the wide angle now what's exciting
about the p30 Pro is that you get that
night mode again and then you get this
zoom which is really high quality you
can use the night mode with the zoom and
it's like wow like it's crazy just how
how yes to this thing so guess who
bought the company that developed that
zoom lens is well I remember seeing it
first with up oh yeah but the company I
know besides release the device yes yeah
so Samsung bought the company that
developed the periscope
yeah the develop not to spare car they I
thing like the way it's actually
implemented so I think they bought them
earlier
in January or something like that this
year oh is that right I don't think it's
gonna be the no but I think the 11 next
year will probably have it that's
ridiculous like thinking about
everything that the s10 can do you add
an S Pen and then you put this periscope
in there what are we going in phones
right now like so that kind of leads me
to a question that I had I this is
another one of those videos I wanted to
do at MWC but it just didn't come
together when I went to the Oppo events
and all they had to announce was that
you know we have 5 g and 10 times ooh
we played with the prototype that had
the 10 times zoom in there it was
definitely interesting it was a little
creepy but it's 10 times optical zoom
and in this case a hybrid zoom that gets
you up to what you say 50 at the most
yeah how useful is that to you to begin
with though so yeah that's the question
I got from a lot of people because I did
a video we did a video comparing it to
the s10 plus a lot of people like us
curve mode creepy mode you know all that
kind of stuff yeah well yeah here's the
thing I live in Brooklyn where I live
we're going to start I have I have a
bathroom of the city I can see from One
World Trade Center up to about 92nd
Street like that I take a picture of any
phone right now I don't get that land I
don't get him get what I see yeah
exactly
now I can now I think now I can do even
with just 5x it's a much better
landscape for me to now take that and go
here's because I'm gonna do that I'm
gonna I will do that for you guys I'll
show you what that means for me it's
that here's here's here's standard is
fine and here's Ted and here's 50 right
in front of Empire State Building I can
technically zoom I can see all those
buildings from where I live so for me
with my eye I see them really clearly
when I capturing the phone I'm like uh
yeah it's terrible right yeah so that's
what this affords me and this will
afford for a lot of things like that you
know where you can if you want to take a
big picture of something online mark
you're you're a bit far away and like oh
wait okay nevermind done I don't need to
walk all the way there to do is the same
thing with a wide-angle lens I
need to step back it's just it's the
reverse of that he knows we all go I
love wide-angle lenses yes it's great
because you don't want to take five
steps back to actually get the same shot
now it's the same thing when you see
something you go oh that's really nice
you look at it and then you zoom you're
like okay that's actually better done
yeah there's a there's a comment in the
live chat let's give one person huxton I
prefer wide-angle zoom
those are two different things men but
also under that period I guess that's
the name of the person it's useful for
stocking your crutch from IG from far
away yes okay but look at restraining
orders with the p30 Pro all right yes
well guys remember when you have a
camera right a regular camera DSLR or
even a pointing sheet they have zoom
you've used it before it's not like film
so this whole thing that people are
thinking it's now creepy mode and I'm
like no it shouldn't be it should be it
should be look I'm standing here like
I'm standing here I live on the
technically tenth floor and you know
there's a sign or something they're like
I want to take a picture of that sign I
can zoom in and do that as opposed to if
I go downstairs my perspective is lost I
have to get it allowed to get any better
perspective I don't need to do that now
I think a lot about just Missy I'm not
not missing but I'm maybe a play with
that fact that it's a creep ohmmeter
yeah well so the the thing that I'm
really excited to try out I mean this is
sort of becoming a bit of my my brand on
YouTube these days is like blogging with
the smartphone so I'm really excited to
try that out
so she if stabilization is actually that
good on the zoom because wide-angle has
always been my favorite I'm always going
to be a fan of wide-angle however
getting tighter in having more of that
background compression is actually
really useful to have especially when
you're doing something like video
because like I wonder if I can show it
off right now let me try this real quick
oh yeah look at this see me here
yeah look at that
and then and then it's yeah you do a
better job of focusing in on your
subject yeah exact point where is my
setting is that it that's it there you
go so now if I were to move back a
little bit well this is yeah but you get
the idea
like refresh it you don't see as much
I'm far in all right let me push mine to
the max and see what I get
oh look at that also I didn't have
autofocus on so that's one other reason
but again I'm using the Tamara I'm using
the Tamron 28 to 75 lens which gives
really good bouquet so so here we go the
would you consider so here we have vise
nose in who actually donated thank you
so much you donated and asked the
question not just slash holes or an
invented problem thoughts like so I'm
gonna I'm gonna have us answer that
question real quick but also is it a
regression for huawei to still be
putting notches on the pro version of
the phone when we've already seen like
hole punches and other ways of like
getting away from the knotch
yes and no but I think that because the
zoom really took everyone by surprise no
one's really talking about that and then
not I mean the the dimple notch is fine
it's not it's not there's nothing really
wrong with that to me and to you to the
question from Vashon know Zen
it's sort of an invented problem I think
the idea I think notches because of
apples apples not really was one that
threw everything off really because if
you think about it before the iPhone
came out we had the what's that
essential phone and it had that
beautiful temple not yet it was a little
bit bigger but it was a nice dimple not
and everybody was like you know what if
we have this before we go to bed less
phones this is great right this is an
Apple came and gave us this
bastardization of a haircut you know and
you know and then and because Apple did
that you know a lot of engine
manufacturers followed not just
because they followed because of costs
would you mean if if Apple is taking
huge orders for that to make any screen
like that will be cheaper for any other
phone out there so that's one of the big
reasons why and then we've got a lot of
the you know you know the weird haircuts
for phones which destroyed our view
displacement when we were going on the
path that it looked like it's either we
had thicker bezels thinner thinner than
our dimple notch and then no bezels and
then up or showed us that we can with
the find X and then you know they're
more opportune oh the Reno's gonna have
the same thing too so those kind of
things that I think I had been in
invented problem the one thing I'll say
about the hole punch stood Susie knows
point is that I find it just much better
than a not for whatever reason
especially if it's on Islip in her eyes
on the lower right hand corner I it just
gets lost in the scene of whatever I'm
watching so mmm okay what else about
this okay so with the zoom we also got
that not sure you were just discussing
the worst of really anything else that
was particularly different right so this
for camera lenses of the four camera
modules at the back a tough the tough
even though the US but Richard he was on
stage going tothe camera by the way I
have to give Richard you so much credit
like he's he's he may not be the best
showman that we've seen in tech onstage
but he is a hundred percent excited
about what he's talking about when he's
up there it's great yeah yeah the the
tough lens was which is something I
think we're gonna see more a lot of
Android phones you know like Samsung has
on the 5g galaxy which would give you
just better depth placement overall you
and I think you can see from people's
bouquet photos not not the color on the
high dynamic range but the way the
graduation of the bouquet looks is a
little bit more more like a DSR and less
like what the pixel is and all the
people like the pixel pixel just blocks
out the back it's like take it or leave
it
that's really what it does from
computational analysis but you also have
every sensor is new they accept the
right angle I think it's the same wide
angle 20 megapixels the 40mm
for no there's no what is it the Sony 40
mega pick someone that we've loved no
there's no Sony 48 but it's a also a
brand new 40 megapixel sensor that is
they are yyb sense yes now was kind of
cool like that's an interesting take on
it because if yellow is able to get more
light into the sensor as compared to
green which in a way kind of makes sense
like when you think of the actual white
balance spectrum like you can get you
can get more in a yellow color diode but
that doesn't make a lot of sense I
thought that was interesting not a lot
people are talking about that cuz it's
so low level but yeah it's it's it seems
to be working pretty well yeah and then
then you also have the periscope a class
zoom which is a module I think somebody
I fix it's not a tear out of it you can
actually see the module in there and
that that's eight megapixels and the
f-stop of 3.2 so a couple of those bus
it also has reverse wireless strategy
now like the mix 20 and and it's got the
far strategy it's got all the things you
expect following the mate line it's the
photography's change where they've now
got an AI not it so this is the AI
photography for your auto mode which is
kind of now built in a little bit and
then you've got the AI assistant for
video as well to give you better
civilization and also better look like
video quality
yeah the low-light stuff with the a is
the the AI image stabilization
I think is the fulcrum for that one
thing that I said in my video over in my
channel when I was reacting to these
announcements was like some of those
photos that people were getting super
excited about like the nighttime photos
the Star photos and moon photos and all
that like keep in mind like you're just
just to make sure people are actually
looking at the fine print this isn't
just a photo that you go outside you
take a picture it looks like that
underneath that photo it said it was a
30-second shutter so everyone should
kind of just be sure to know that
there's going to be a long shutter speed
in order for you to get that night mode
to work at its best so that's that's
kind of the the thing that I want to put
out there but those photos did look it
pretty they did look pretty incredible I
will I will say okay so the phone itself
very exciting by the way we have a funny
thing I'm sure some people in the life
Chad noticed that Jaime just appeared so
he wasn't in the air per se but he's
about to be he's in the United club
right now which is what he told me so
we're gonna have him come on but not for
the actual show what we're gonna do here
is a thunder he and I are going to
continue on once we end the show
quote-unquote we're going to leave the
live broadcast going get Jaime in and
we're just all gonna chill out for a
little bit with all of you so we're
gonna have a little bit of fun two three
of us just chilling out for maybe 10 15
minutes post show so this is just for
the YouTube audience so something
something kind of fun for you guys so
before we do that not a lot of people
are talking about the accessories so you
have the free lace headphones I don't
know if you have a neck band earphone
near you so we can kind of like
illustrate that quick one from this is
from let's see Dan on EJ Mundell mkb she
says twitted air power canceled
I don't know which is interesting you
know we all know that's the the vapor
we're from Apple oh there's the other
thing too like okay not to not to get
too far back into an old topic but
clearly there was nothing for our
youtuber friends at the Apple event
actually work with and that's because
air pods to quote-unquote were actually
announced right after and not announce
but even launched I mean you even have
the air pods to you right now you so
yeah I don't know I don't know about
this TechCrunch for Apple castles air
power products I see inability to meet
high standards for hardware mmm well
that's the thing about wireless charging
in general right like it's there are a
lot of expectations for charging and
wireless standards just can't really get
it yet alright so let me make sure to
send the chat link over to Jaime first
so that he's ready for us when we're
done but I want to get your take on
these accessories because I got really
excited over mainly the smart eyewear
like it's actually coming from a
reputable company that is not Bose Bose
was kind of the first one but this is
going to be I think this is something
that could actually be a good step
forward for wearables in general you
have a gentle monster in Brooklyn don't
you
I don't know I think there's one in New
York it might be in Manhattan but I know
that there's one here in like Beverly
Hills in LA but gentle monster is a
Korean eyewear brand so this is uh they
make some really stylish glasses the
ones that you saw on stage may not have
been amazing but but I know that they
have some good-looking ones but to have
glasses that are developed by a company
on like Huawei that actually have all
the bits and pieces inside to make it
smart that really excited me I don't
know where you stand on that you don't
wear glasses so no I mean I do have I've
got the bows I'm getting the phone call
North bifocal the ones that are
augmented I got I got size for them I
actually have to go pick them up and I
like the idea of like for me wearables
which is why I I think maybe we had this
discussion amigos with Danny Wingate I
was talking about the fact that Android
wear and I got this me and Sam got these
arguments not admin but discussion going
on where we said Android wear needs to
be we're not a watch if you wear wear
sorry
then it needs to focus on the wearables
you've got glasses and and Bose is good
to both started off with just audio
that's what they do so that's that's
what it is but when I found with that to
it was really cool was I was using it to
navigate while walking around New York I
was looking for there's a restaurant and
I was looking for and then it said turn
right and you felt like somebody was
whispering softly in my ear saying hey I
should just take a right here I was like
this is nice everyone there's ain't I
kind of stuff but but having wearables
that are connected you know like you
know Nike in the past had those things
where you could put in your shoes make
you where's my she that tracks my
running right so I don't want have to
wear watch you know where's my clothing
they can check my heart rate you know
like it's that stuff but meanwhile we're
busy busy trying to make a watch do
things that are what should you do we're
busy trying to put screens on everything
that's always been my complaint so like
that's always been my thing
give me one sec I'm having a little bit
trouble getting this link my friend and
my friend just I guess she's in the chat
watching here she said gentle monster
monster New York flack
store is on 70 Wooster Street knew I
worked there straight okay so there you
go finally got it
Thank You royal flush we she ate it yeah
yeah for sure
anybody else in the chair with some
comments on the on the accessories um
let me see here not a whole lot there
was some talk about EMU iodine Oh
everybody has like their thoughts about
EMU I I actually have never really hated
it to be honest like earlier on May 10
well it's not a big fan of that PETA and
May 10 Sochi before that but yeah um
yeah that I I agree with you there that
like wear has to be less about the
screen and more about the smart
functions in established form factors
and that's exactly what the glasses are
so they're not trying to go so far it's
like at a screen so that you have stuff
to look at and it messes you up like
that that always that always pissed me
off about where where OS is that it when
that when that watch goes off and I look
at it it's the exact same function as me
picking up my phone and looking at it
anyway hmm so that always got me that's
reason why I use hybrid smartwatches
most of the time or even fitness
trackers that just vibrate and I look at
it gives me maybe like one little icon
to tell me what it is
but even then I might not even look at
it if it vibrates a certain amount of
times like maybe two or three that tells
me oh my girlfriend messaged or you know
our work chat message or something like
that it has to be programmable in a way
that that signals to you rather than
being the replacement of the original
thing that's what it's been my whole
thing sure I mean but in terms of the
accessories just going back there a
little bit is Ramon's excited for the
charger the portable charger but I'm
somebody said he was going to be 300
bucks I was like no thank you the 40
worth portable charger just like a
fast-charging super fast charging on a
power bank the USB type-c headphones
were cool so okay there's one I wanted
to ask you as the headphone guy the fact
that one of the earpieces can disconnect
and then you get a USBC connector right
there I agree that that's pretty
ingenious
tech like I kind of like that
but I don't know I don't like the fact
that I can pull apart that's that's my
one worry with it is that you can
actually lose that part you know people
complain about air pods that you could
lose one of your ear pieces this is this
is this version of that kind of sorry do
you have one that doesn't it no no no I
have one that I have one from
Plantronics that is interesting so it's
it's a neck bag right Wow and it's also
got a and C built into it see it right
here if you guys can look at that so
that's cool but what's interesting about
it is the caning a charging cable that
it has so you've got a regular cable
that has micro USB on one side right and
then you've got this USB 3.5 millimeter
cable so you can plug in the micro USB
and if you're on a plane you can plug
this to listen on the plane so you can
do many things with it
what I was hoping was for something kind
of like this from them where even though
you plug in via USB type-c they should
just be like a little attachment here so
that even if you don't plug it it's
always gonna be no interesting I see
what you mean yeah so even if you unplug
it and you like oh okay fine I'll just
plug it back in and then I'm good that's
true that's true
I mean to be fair though five minutes of
charge on those headphones for four
hours of playback like that's not that
long so I mean that's no that's pretty
good you forgetting it it's the problem
is biggest thing you're doing stuff you
say you plug into like your iPad pro
right you plug it in you set it down I
gotta run to something and you come back
and I gotta go
you see plug to your phone I'll meet
your iPad you just pick it up and go and
then you realize oh and it's only one
half yeah exactly
all right cool well before we go too
long here I know I said that like four
times on this podcast already we're

BRB we can hear you okay good I so talk
away and ask questions okay I can't hear
him you need to cheat you need to change
your mic settings you let me know your
mic you're not not you Jaime I mean
you're good Jaime you'll be out tomorrow
I guess I'm the middleman here know
what's going on yeah because I can hear
you guys just fine yeah I Josh jump out
and jump back in I'm trying to it's
funny how he can hear me and I can hear
Jaime I must have some powers yeah I'm
fine I want people together it has
nothing to do with that t-shirt you're
wearing because I'm beautiful inside of
course ringings from the glorious United
club in New York International Airport
oh yes yes your favorite place I hate
this Airport Lord does anybody have a
drink uh okay but since we're talking
about the p30 pro and you spent the most
time on that device and
yeah you have it in hand you mean this
one
oh you've got the red one oh my god you
know what forget you of course
forget yeah how about we end how about
we just end this call right now so what
do you think about the p30 Pro uh guess
what I have here two P 30 pros another
community oh man okay so judging by the
photos and I just finished filming a
video in Paris about my experience using
it um I love the concept of the losses
flume but if I just I'm having a hard
time noticing a difference between the
hybrid zoom that we had up to 5x with
the previous May 20 Pro does that make
sense
um I disagree though I mean he's just
from images it's my mate xx hybrid zoom
I didn't like that at all
exactly and so it's cool it's good but I
can't say that it's like wow great well
okay I mean I would have to see more for
myself because I'm saying that I even
the images the Daniel took and sent to
me I was impressed they are impressive
don't get me wrong I was just never
impressed with the mate 20s hydrogen I'd
even like it yes but it was better than
anything else out there you have to you
have to agree with that
and so it's like the p30 pro is better
than anything else out there I just I
don't know man it feels like if they
still have more work to do with the
software in order to make that zoom more
usable not just from a sharpening
perspective there are things like for
example the AI does certain things like
it'll oh hello Josh can you hear us
can you hear us I can hear you I just I
can't do two calls on the same computer
so that's why I gotta go here okay oh
man it's it's just interesting like for
example if you switch off master AI
it'll jump between a 1 X 5 X 10 X and
then you can push it all the way to 50
but then if you switch on master ai
it'll detect
what it sees and be like you know what
5x is to ship is to prop then let me
give you a 3x tier so it's really hard
to figure out how to pull that and I
wish that they had like more options and
so it's not like you know when you grab
your camera lens and you you know you
carry that you grab the human zoom ring
and it has a very practical way to move
in and out of a subject and you can
notice that it's lossless this is like
it's periscopic but it's a direct jump
from point A to point B and try to jump
in the middle is is the user interface
it needs a little work yeah but I don't
even think they can jump into the middle
of that well the beginning is periscopic
you're going through different lenses
right exactly so why shouldn't it be
possible it feels like that's what I'm
saying it feels like that instead of 3x
like on the May 20 Pro it's 5x it's just
it doesn't feel like if it was a
periscopic thing it just feels like if
they jump 225 millimeters directly boom
Josh look really good twice man oh man
that's kind of freaky it's it took you
forever to actually recognize that they
must have cloned him twice okay so
alright so that's nice
there's some things to work there what
about the main sensor it's got that our
yyb sensor which we should be she should
give us more light right so what about I
will send you some photos dude I'm sure
daniel has sympathy already but it's
like I have photos that I'm gonna use
for this video where it's like well I
had to take a screenshot of the
viewfinder because if I don't you just
won't believe that it's true like you
have photos like this where my
viewfinder is like pitch-black
yeah can't see anything and then if I
show you the final photo you're like no
that can't be possible
dude like this thing is just shocking
like it feels I love that Huawei did the
demo in the presentation here it is this
is the photo that it took that is the
photo that it took then you see it that
was the pitch black yeah it was
pitch it was a viewfinder shot and look
at look at Jenna right here look at her
detail hold on try to damn it you see
her face yeah I can see it I said okay
dude you have no idea and this is not
with night mode actually this is oh no
it's just Auto it's just an app the
photo it's if you use night mode
actually it'll it'll because of because
of the long exposure and people are
moving it'll do a worse job with night
mode then if you just auto like that
it's it is it there's no other way to
describe it than shocking like you
thought that will you saw in the
presentation was BS you thought that it
was just something staged no it's not it
is not it is real okay jaimé could you
toggle your camera on and off I'm just
I'm hearing that your your video is not
showing I'm talking via the me9 right
now so well I'm just I'm waiting to see
if it actually comes right I can see you
but I don't think oh there you are
you're back yeah you're back yeah you
know the United Club Wi-Fi is the best
food there are like 700 people in here
and there's only seating for like 200 oh
nice by the way in our live chats and so
having some fun here DJ DJ John's to
Joshua's this is the worst time line we
talking about man is the best time line
guys boy am I the only guy that's
drinking is it isn't this the after
podcast so the camera is good right I am
it's stunning and anything else that
they added to your device that was new
and different other than the fact that
we've gone okay we've got reverse
wireless charging which is reverse
wireless charging they had to get rid of
the stereo speakers because that one of
them is that you know it's like the same
it's like the LGG a where it uses the
screen but the screen doesn't emit audio
and so it's only like if it were bone
conduction and they
except the the g8o uses the screen and
one of the speakers at the same time so
exactly both on this phone doesn't
happen
so just it's a mono speaker it's a mono
speaker it's very loud it's not bad it's
just if you cover it that's it that's
you know that's the only bad part it's
just a very like tiny sled that little
tiny area at the top that little slit
right so there's not a whole lot
emanating yeah but here's the thing like
Michael Fisher did a call like he was on
the phone for like 20 minutes
over I don't know what he was talking to
her who he just hung up the call and he
was like this was a surprisingly good
phone call like way better than I
expected that was I still haven't made a
phone call with this thing so I can't
tell you I'm about to land at a country
where people actually do make phone
calls so I'll let you know okay all
right so you like it so what about the
p30 how different is that from the 30
bro if somebody's thinking no if you
want a p20 Pro and you didn't buy it go
for the p30 Pro don't you do okay really
if you if you wanted to be 20 Pro but
you didn't get it just go grab the p30
Pro it's got it's got everything that
the p20 that the p30 pro chef had like a
headphone jack like a standard earpiece
I haven't checked if it's got dual
firing speakers though see this would
have been a good thing though cuz like
okay if if it wasn't so late in the
Philippines we would have had ISA on my
girlfriend she has the p30 not the pro
but the p30 so whatever yeah she's not I
have a p30 here it's just I've been
activated it the peak the peak 20 pearl
right now is four hundred and forty
dollars I just saw the price today oh
yeah yeah so it might just be better to
get a p20 Pro than a P 30 right uh
that's a good question we're gonna
solvent for under 500 I mean for under
bucks it's just I don't know man it's
like the see the peak the peak 20 Pro
felt like like an iphone flown in so
many ways from the nagy to the and then
it's like a blend of a chin that makes
it look like a pixel it was this like
really odd design that I didn't like
this phone is badass like it feels like
it's own thing that's not trying to
compete with anything
jaimé jaimé you're you're there there's
a FedEx probably around the corner how
about you drop that send it to me here
I'll take good care of it right and when
you come back to to New York I'll give
it to you
maybe am I really the only person who
actually doesn't dig that red color like
yes you are going you have not held it
that's why I'm even wearing a red shirt
to match man that's because when I saw
so many of like everyone's videos going
up including yours it was like okay so
this red one's really cool and the first
thing I thought was like salmon that's a
sockeye salmon and like that's cool but
like it doesn't it doesn't jazz me up
the way it does most of you guys I don't
know what it is do you have to hold it
man
it's like Joshua it's okay let's move on
you don't need to complain this is we
enjoy your and and a bong what camera
are you using are you using the Logitech
the Brio no nabis in my a 7-3 oh I hate
you and this is the G this is the GH
five as usual yeah I need that switch
than you guys have because this I didn't
pack the Brio because I was like I could
I can barely fit my underwear here in
this bag he tells us yeah and so uh
dammit I left the camera and this
MacBook Pro even though it's new has a
camera from what 2002 oh yeah I miss it
you know sweating you mentioned that I
remember I was talking to a couple of PC
manufacturers and give me some gaming
laptops and I asked them I was like okay
if your gaming laptop manufacturer why
don't you just take out the camera and
offer us something else that we can buy
and attach because the cameras in in
laptops are terrible
they're trying terrible there anyways
with doesn't someone make doesn't one of
the gaming brands like that is it razor
that they have their own webcam right
yeah do that camera that Logitech Rio is
fantastic
it's logic has one too it's just a large
camera but it's fantastic yeah it's yeah
yeah this is a BRE oh oh okay
you know I do need to update mine if it
is that good it's a it's a 4k camera
highly recommended one of the questions
I just wanna be sure anybody who stoned
the live chat if you're still hanging
out with us for this little post show
thing anyone who has questions go ahead
Brian Rendon says all the wats on the
reverse wireless charging more or the
same no that's a good we don't have that
information on the spec sheet so we're
gonna have to test it don't worry guys I
have a video for you on Sunday
yeah but in art comes in soup into
unless you're trying to charge a pair of
headphones don't expect much yeah I mean
I remember one we had that made 20 even
with the Samsung like even with sm+ we
were trying to charge each other's
phones it went nowhere well so I know
that you can usually the Samsung you can
and the Samsung and when I did my video
people it's it's it's as fast as Apple's
wireless charging so don't cause those I
want you to look at this photo okay this
was horrendously dark Oh eyes I again
these guys are in the mode of rewriting
the future of photography and whatever I
kind of dig it man I'm not saying they
have obviously I need to like I pull the
photos into the computer they look great
but I need to make a couple of
comparisons with a couple of our GB
sensors because yet I don't like this
phone has a crazy insane amount of
dynamic range and you know and you know
what's more interesting so there was
this guy in the presentation who is the
photographer that went on stage and the
guy is like we were talking with with
David Cogan about the the ISO that it
was four hundred nine thousand I don't
know what the guy was like actually it's
eight hundred something thousand and I'm
like no dude this is what they told us
in our in our video he's like you have
it wait for it wait for it there's more
I'm like eight hundred thousand ISO like
seriously
well it is looking good for like low
light stuff but we have a comment wall
does they need to work on the colors
though I looked at in a few comparisons
that we're already coming out recently
and I will admit the color science on
the Huawei stuff does seem to not be
supernatural even you were saying
earlier that like Sochi on the
front-facing camera for somebody like
you the color science is still not all
there yeah I'm sure I'm sure it makes me
look try make me look way I mean come on
Michael Jackson what do you think oh I
don't know Rita sure problem the problem
right now in Paris it was horrendously
gloomy like it was New York weather
pretty much it's gloomy in Paris mr.
sunshine in California mr. internal
sunshine um so I wanted to get better
photos I don't think I got the photos
that I wanted because of just you know
there was just no sunlight it was gloom
every single day there was rain but for
the most part I you know I like what I
see do I I guess the biggest the biggest
comparison and I highly recommend you
guys look into this because I'm not
carrying mine with me I highly recommend
that once you get your units you compare
the results with a mate 20 Pro ah
definitely so here's here's a 15 you can
see this image this is what Danny took I
love this photo come on share managers
between these cameras is crazy like like
me the one I'm talking into right now
looks so horrendous compared to my
actual hangouts just kind of froze on me
it's still working with it
but Danny ring it has a photo of the
Eiffel Tower and he's kind of like dead
center and you can see the colors of the
Eiffel Tower so clearly and then the
light beam cuts across I know if you can
go to just go to his Twitter page it was
like one of the last two posts
with it I might be again this is crunch
down from Twitter - oh yeah which is I
love it I love it when people are like
oh but the detail on your photo is
trashy I'm like you guys know anything
about compression like you know how that
works
like seriously all right all right so my
chrome is crashed but I'm still here
so you're putting your chromis trash
it's crashed so basically I'm using
Chrome for the hang of hangouts and it's
crashed completely yeah so yeah you're
talking about this photo
yeah I'm tell my laughs oh yeah yeah
it's again it is a great photo
I don't know Eagle Oh whatever I so for
example things that I didn't like about
the the b20 throw is that colors were
overdone
they were oversaturated they they looked
like a cartoon most in most cases yeah
very funny okay the Meher 20 pro toned
that down significantly and now the p20
parted then the p30 pro does it even
more like I posted a photo of a coffee
of you know a cup of coffee that I was
drinking and I the reason why I post it
is because okay I can see that like
toned down film like grain really well
here and so I see more of that with the
p30 Pro which I really like on the May
20 Pro so you know I feel that they're
they're going in the right direction
obviously this is new man I mean how
long have they come up with this whole
ryy BIA I'm even thinking like Syrian
but you know when they talked about that
whole change into sub pixels that are
yellow I'm like the yellow is not a
primary color how does that work that's
true
ah yeah it's not a primary color I can't
remember if somebody had the oh I know
who has my cam my camera guy Mari and I
told him and he told me about splitting
green and I can remember what it was but
yellow still takes me more light than
green so that's well and you know like
smartphone cameras even though even
though you know they do all the
tremendous work that they do whenever
you know an on process photo from a cell
phone is fully green just pure green
yeah and then software comes in kicks in
and does all the processing that the
text
what color is what and everything sort
of like a negative the negatives are are
I forget what color they are in a
standard photo and then in a smartphone
they're green so I wonder if that
changed in any way yeah you know what
you might be right though because so I I
don't I don't know if you guys let me
know in the comments I can't see it but
so Daniel did a a cinematic video which
we do all the time anytime we do any of
these events with Huawei so he did a
cinematic video of Paris and things were
looking a little more yellow and green
yeah so I mean you know what I'll put it
up tomorrow get up tomorrow do it guys
do it let's see one of our live chat
people this is a beside the topic that
we're talking about right now but you
know we're not even this isn't human
life
this isn't an actual show someone in the
chat wants to know is that a clear back
know me or no 10 or rather sorry no.9
no.9
yeah um you you you it's the I'm waiting
for the Galaxy S 10 version of this -
exactly
I want I want that so bad as well yeah
you know I think I can trader of red
thank you I could try to read P P 30 Pro
for that I sure sure the problem is no
response after that I'm sorry I got
interrupted right now I apologize it's
probably the the red flare on the camera
[Laughter]
quick thing I I don't know if you
finished the daily up for today but did
you hear about this whole airpower
cancellation
no Apple canceled the whole air power
sorry but uh sorry but I had to free
record the daily because I'm still
flying for another six hours
yeah so I had to pre-recorded what are
you serious yeah oh my god yeah my the
kiss yeah there you go Mike the Detroit
so yeah they said one yeah it won't it
won't it doesn't it they have some sort
of standard that the air power just
won't meet so there you go what did the
the reality distortion standard that
Apple usually pulls on people or what
yeah that's true I mean I was saying
that wireless charging there is just
something about that standard that is
really hard for every everyone to meet
you know by itself it still it obviously
it's it's we did something we've been
waiting for for a long time air parts to
finally came out with a wireless
charging case but now I don't I don't
understand the hype for air power
what was so special about it neither you
wanted to have you know what's one of
the cool things about the design of the
p30 Pro that it can actually stand on
its own oh snap because of the over the
way that the body is built at the top of
the bottom they could stand on its own
oh nice yeah are you showing you an
example I don't see it did it come on
fix that camera viewers can you see it
oh there you go it's a one-to-one s
migration here okay okay so what's
special about the air power I mean other
than the fact that it tells you on your
iPhone what your stuff is charging it's
just that you could charge three things
at the same time but then Samsung pull
the charger with the no.9 I mean come on
they also just people just wanted an
Apple created I just wanted it to be an
apple charger because you know Apple
users don't trust anything that doesn't
have that logo on I mean I mean it's
just three coils why can't you three
coils to be done no I know that's
exactly right which is the reason why
this is such an incredulous announcement
for them to make like it worse the
announcement it's it's a lot of people
reporting a TechCrunch just reported it
I think
got that puppy has recorded in right now
yeah that is so unlike Apple damn it
Apple officially cancels aircraft okay
they don't because their power they did
need apologize this week for MacBook
keyboards yeah right
official apology so yeah fashionable
charging after much effort we've
concluded that air power will not
achieve our high standards and we have
canceled the project we apologize for
those consumers who are looking forward
to this launched two of them we continue
to believe that the feature is Wireless
and are committed to push the while
experience forward send Dan ratio Apple
senior vice president of hardware
engineering ok yeah a whole snap do you
see we should do casual lives like this
more often because we just got a $50
donation from I am blur and you know
what I got like the shouts out to you
bro because not only did you don't made
you also shout it out my new channel
that's awesome but the biggest tech news
of the week is Josh's new gaming channel
JV plays games that's what's up oh yeah
definitely do you actually do you
actually play bro yeah I'm on I've been
playing on we were talking earlier just
to give a quick shout out to because you
know just just to connected to pocket
now in college doing like currently I
actually released a video this morning
without a thumbnail because I haven't
but I released a video this morning that
was recorded off of the black shrug to
playing LG mobile so if you guys want to
check that out searched AV plays games I
don't know I mean do you actually play
like when are we gonna play and see I
need to test all my new gaming hardware
man dude Logitech really hooked me up
the oh man that that mouse and that
keyboard are fantastic like why don't I
bring why don't I bring my my capture
card next week cuz they're all going to
be meeting up next week
we can't say for what yet but we're all
meeting up sometime next week why don't
I bring my capture card and we'll do
we'll do some JV plays games together
all right
is that horribly horribly messy sounding
mechanical keyboard do you have a good
wired or wireless which one man I'm not
using I'm not using one right now I
don't know though that keyboard that you
have is it wired or wireless which
keyboard where the one that you're
always using this noisy AF oh it's wired
it's why yeah okay okay good because the
mechanical ones that Logitech sent me is
also is also wired and I'm like oh okay
all right it's school Wireless and
mechanical keyboard don't quite go
together yeah they're trying to make
them but it's weird like they want to
have that end and key rollover and it
doesn't work at wirelessly it does come
back let me solve that problem module
SEC has a wireless gaming keyboard that
is very good shot um I have to find it
but it's it's just really large I know
it's when you it's large and it doesn't
have backlit keys because the batteries
so that one uses two double-a batteries
it lasts for a year but if you throw in
if you throw in LED backlights then it
just dies like in no time
I am blurr just donate another twenty
two five Jaime can't play games bro his
hands are too damn big thunder eazy-e's
are even bigger in this fool that's why
he's on xbox because a PlayStation
controllers I make em seem that all the
times like you has another mine I don't
need in the asian guy on the podcast I'm
I'm not even gonna try yourself
come on but yeah I know
no you're right one sec does make some
really cool accessories I love their
stuff man you told me about them and
then Diego kept insisting that I had to
make the move to Logitech and
damn like my response is like damn it is
 I really like the tech or I mean
SteelSeries is coming not done see you
shoes ok so here's the thing right in
terms of audio
I give SteelSeries better audio than all
of them right now in terms of game
keyboards and back to razor and the
original switch is not the other stuff
that you doing is between late razer
logitech gaming mice like batman that
9:03 is delicious man I'm leaning
towards the launch is that because you
have a 9 yes over the wireless Pat and I
have the pad I have the wireless frickin
thing and the coolest part about the pad
is you can choose if you want a soft
surface or a hard surface you can choose
whatever you want then it's the coolest
thing yeah so I mean I do Razer has
something similar which is good I think
the sense on Logitech is just slightly
better if you know when you get into
like a lot of just hardcore games and
that kind of stuff but doing doom on it
I love it to pieces it's good stuff it's
really good really good hardware going
back to one other thing we were talking
about Greta or a Christensen
Kristensen are there or are there any
good charging pads that can charge up to
three devices that way no just two which
is the Samsung the same someone yeah
didn't what though there's a wireless
charging pad right like there's like
it's just it just looks like a mouse pad
you just keep playing so so so the
biggest problem with what with any
wireless charging pad is like for
example I have a lot of products from
raft power they send me a lot of their
stuff and there's a reason why I didn't
do a video on them I love their battery
packs up to the point where the battery
pack that I carry with me permanently
this one is a raft power that I've
bought they didn't send it that's a is
worth every penny but then there are
wireless charging pads they either
overheat and when they overheat they
stopped charging um that also happened
to me with the spigen one I think that
the only company that gets fast wireless
charging right but they're in mind I
haven't tried the shower yeah the one
that was included in the box I haven't
tried it yet
um the only company that gets it right
you gotta have a cooling fan like me
yeah you have a cool show me one is the
film again I just like there's actually
events on the bottom so to give you to
give the audience a little bit of it
does yeah no ventilation is necessary
for this if you want fast wireless
charging you need ventilation there's
just no way around it and it's not like
if you can stick a fan beside her in
there it has to be in don't don't try to
invent it doesn't work that way yeah
exactly it's not making your own it's
like making your own whiskey if you mess
up you go watch what kind of whiskey
have you been doing there's only a guy
who tried to distill his own whiskey and
then he drank it and he went blind he it
was cuz I think you can really mess up
your body by drinking like pure I have a
really good friend who started making
his own beer he now sells it it'll do it
as and yeah that damn prompts your
friend man how's this vision lately by
the way we're getting a lot of love from
the light a Chad for this post show
stuff we might do this more often we'll
see like we'll see what's up because
literally in the air stone no no no so I
have a five hour wait and I actually I
actually was able to intercept the phone
that was sent to me right now that I
can't tell you about until not next week
but the week after a week after yeah the
week after I believe that all of you are
gonna get one too
so we we have good fantastic so I was
able to intercept it today okay before
before before we wade into that
dangerous waters um there are there's
one thing I wanted to bring up this is
again close show stuff this is something
I want to talk about on Instagram video
actually there are a couple of companies
I think it was Facebook Microsoft and
one other one that are saying that they
are they're banning April Fool's content
did you see this
like they're a bunch of companies that
are saying they're not going to allow
April Fool's jokes anymore because they
provide it because it makes them have
like it gives them undo new cycles like
people are looking at the wrong stuff on
their websites when the news comes out
is because about it's probably because
some of their stuff is boring starting
with Facebook damn it no no I mean
Facebook has to do that because of the
the past election cycles we all know how
fake news has just being the prominence
we're not even just that people don't
know how to research news you see a
headline
we don't read headlines I mean you don't
read articles anymore so no one jumps in
to read no one goes to go who else wrote
this story right is it on a bigger side
that stuff like that so yeah at least
for them I know Facebook I understand
they're fine they're like nah nah we
don't want touchless I get it but but
you know Google
I guess maybe also just because on the
news feeds and stuff like that so so
sorry the kernel will make an appearance
this year that's too bad what is this
all gonna be endorsing this time private
jets
or I mean you can't now you know now
they've locked him down you know what
wait a second you mean you mean the
colonel has married to his fourth wife
number seven remember
oh but simultaneously right now is it
four or is it all seven I gotta check
his calendar I'm not sure I thought my
parachute it a few on a recent
helicopter test you know would have been
really funny is a single a card yeah
parody that book or oh yeah yeah I'm
trying to do her so there was another
point that I wanted to make by the way I
realized what I should have done in the
beginning doubled up on my feeds so
camera coming from the pocket now
account audio coming from Mike
literally cooking to different places
trying to come what other news that kind
of came out earlier this week oh hi mate
we might as well ask you since you're on
are you gonna get an apple cart no thank
you
why would I I mean I don't know I I
noticed like for example they say they
have no fees in this leg of bait Apple
really need to here's the thing some
somebody asked me the other day like
wide oh shoot I was in the Apple Store
swapping this computer and the Apple
Genius asked me why don't I use Apple
pay and I do use Samsung pay and I told
them because I get really producer bit
did you work for you I'm like I get
rewards for samsung pay I getting
nothing from Apple what's the point
about having Apple pay I mean come on
man I get rewards on every single one of
my credit cards I get nothing from Apple
come on
when just did you Samsung people work in
the Apple Store oh I didn't try that I
you know but he's like do you use I will
and I'm like now I use Samsung pay for
everything he's like why and I'm like I
get the points and and they give you
deals depending on the amount of
consumption that you do on Sam's like
they were as on Apple but you don't get
nothing man
I love that like just the inherent
tribalism of of all of that for you to
take out like a Samsung phone the Apple
Genius is like contracted to be like why
are you using this guys I don't know do
you find I don't except for the
convenience of pulling out your phone
but what's the difference for me and
pulling out your credit card what's the
difference okay yeah maybe because if
you do get like cash back rewards for
using Apple pay Apple cash in general or
oh but the card itself the Apple card
itself I don't really know I mean and
and then there's the funny part where I
have a hundred one of my credit cards is
from wonderous still and it's the funny
part where my hunter and credit card has
had NFC contactless payments since 2014
in 2015 and that still doesn't exist in
the United States so my walk in toner
you do have that I have that with my
paypal card I'll show ya good and so and
so like for example every single time
I'm in Europe like I have no problems in
paying with my conch don't cover that
yes I mean okay that's pretty much it
yeah it's right there but it doesn't
work everywhere well either that's the
thing um III mean in the United States a
doesn't you go to Europe dude it works
everywhere from the subway to any
restaurant it was like I was telling
them I was telling you know the folks in
and Josh about my experience and why I
used Samsung pay I mean the points are
great and all that but I was telling how
like I had a great experience when I
went to Home Depot I tried to use the
chip it didn't work I tried to swipe it
didn't work we try to punch it in it
didn't work and then we use samsung
plays MSFT and that works yeah and i was
like that is a good point actually they
left the apple cart itself that titanium
might be titanium you're probably gonna
pay like $200 a year for that but like
the the card itself should have had like
Apple pay like some sort of shipment in
order for you to like do tap pick it
doesn't have tap pay and also no it
doesn't have your number on this so you
can't type it in if there's an issue
with the machine
yeah I would some people I always tell
people I was like I use Samsung pay
because I live in Brooklyn the only two
ways you pay in Brooklyn either old
credit card machines or cash that's it I
mean no one has I mean there are people
who use square payments but nobody
nobody's really using Apple pay or NFC
payments or google play it's literally
square cash or super old credit card
machines because why change it yeah
Brian Rendon USA is liking payment a
hundred percent like I'm a just said in
Europe there are so many different ways
that you can pay they all work and in
Latin America they're everywhere it's
hilarious
because Michael Fisher when Michael was
still working with us we were trying to
pay for parking and
Vegas at CES when we landed and his the
card system didn't have a chip it than
have anything it was only contactless
which is flairies I don't know why or
you pay cash and so I'm like oh give me
a second deep I tapped it and this was
like 2015 man 2015 or something like
that he's like how do you have that I'm
like no I mean okay Japan had contacts
those payments since 2007
yes no no my bad started earlier with
the old Nokia phones you could still do
that too because they had NFC um early
2000s so I mean we we are way behind in
the stuff yeah yeah weakly you don't
have NFC payment with bank accounts here
with your phone banking app or the bank
pass over there it's super it's like
it's like a rare it's very selective
like meanwhile in the UK this will be
one of my favorite stories from the UK I
do you don't have to buy an oyster card
anymore to use the subway if you have
some sort of contactless payment like
Apple pay Google pays em some pay
because you just tap your phone to the
same terminal the same exact terminal
and it would just take the money out of
your out of your pay account you should
make a payment in the in the United
States and the MTA do you like any
Subway's also and MTS conferences
payments is coming this spring yeah it's
coming to spring to four stations man
there are 800 miles of no no here's the
thing though what if MTA still uses a
swipe mechanism right swipe yeah but
it's a very thin card from that most
Samsung with Samson thick
no no so unless you load your card in
there or something like that then what
would be really I mean if you could
refill your MetroCard directly from
Samson hey that would be genie oh no I
didn't have your card in there yeah I'm
losing Metro cars all the time and I
have no idea how much money I left
yeah to stop by one of the machines just
to know how much money you have and I'm
like dude I'm like dear dear MTA this is
New York nobody has time for that
and yeah nobody has time to stop and see
honey you have to you have to get a
special kind of one which one that which
you you can refill and then you can
check online to see where I found which
card it was but somebody was telling me
about it so mmm it's a special one you
can actually get let me actually open my
window here I get some light there's one
there's one comment in the live chat for
behind me MJ a Jaime not saying his name
in the daily is an April Fool's joke can
you imagine that on April 1st you should
do that where you go I'm and then it
goes right into the intro my name is I'm
now and this is I'm using other people's
names gonna give everybody odd you know
because they're like you didn't say his
name oh boy and I would see how much
more time do you have before you fight
anyway oh my god one hour okay one hour
one hour before we board okay well I'll
tell you what let's give it maybe 5 10
more minutes
anyone in the chat still around like any
more questions just amount of wine I
mean they a lot of people left here so I
mean we can you can chime in okay yes
Jaime we talked about Apple TV only plus
and all that stuff I I called it trash
your thoughts what do you think about it
oh my god so I did any of you see dieter
bones video in the verge I know you have
to watch that video from theater man
theater is awesome and he's like I don't
know why I got invited to this thing
it's like what just happened right now
like we walk in and it's you know it's
one of these presentations where you get
to see a lot of services that are not
alive yet and some of them are not gonna
be live until August and the only thing
we can talk about really is Apple news
Plus and then everything else we can't
even test so what just happened he's
like we just had a like Apple
just announced a couple of iPads and a
new pair of ear pods separately why
wasn't it backwards why didn't they do
an event for those iPads and the air
pods and do their music things
separately or whatever it is that we
just saw everybody you I think what they
should have done was actually announce
all those products and talk about how
entertainment focused and how you can
watch all the shows on your brand-new
iPad in brand new I you know like all
that kind of stuff we would say hey at
least now we have an ecosystem with our
products and with our services Thank You
Sun use its argument and I have to agree
with it is I think this was just present
like their stock has been down their
sales have been down this was this was
just like you know what company you know
what investors were doing something just
we need more time yeah like it was a
flex it was literally a flex I got all
these Hollywood people in and you know
what to that to that point earlier like
you know what I was I was actually kind
of in it for a while like I was happy to
see Jason Momoa I was happy to see
Camille Nanjiani I was actually trying
to think intellectually about the
content of the pad and then they had
Oprah who's like Oh doh Oprah's there
and like the the Hollywood craziness and
I'm from LA like even I get annoyed with
the way that Hollywood can be being from
here like when Oprah went up there and
she was like and we're going to do this
with Apple the moment she said that I
was like I can't do this I can't yeah
okay has her own network on YouTube
premium like I'm not I'm trying to
understand like she's just one show on
Apple Network we're just one show so in
speaking of flex I'm looking at his
stock chart for five the last five days
at the beginning of the announcement in
around 1p 12:30 that day the stock hit
$190 per share drop down and it always
drops initially yes drop down to $3 then
went up the next day to 191 and then it
dropped down again and now it's a little
bit on a steady path about a hundred and
eighty nine so it's gained about a
dollar roughly as I was saying yeah but
which is not what they wanted so the
probe
they're flexi Ariston they didn't flex
the right way they didn't actually do
the announcements the right way in terms
of like if you look at like Disney
Disney has not officially announced this
service Disney whatever it's gonna be
called their stock keeps going up they
keep going up because what they did
first was said we're pulling all our
stuff away from Netflix everybody's like
Disney service is coming right and then
through the trades in holiday they
announced there is a Loki TV show
there's gonna be a they're filming right
now adays this coat or this Loki yeah
the Star Wars series I mean they're not
they're not messing around so when you
mentioned those things in the trades
everybody goes where's that going to our
new service but we know we're not we're
not ready to announce it yet that's the
kind of flex you do that investors are
ready plucks you now have all these
movies you know Captain Marvel has come
out and game is coming out and then they
said Captain Marvel will be the first
show first movie to be on their
streaming service that's you know
straight from theaters so you're going
oh okay that's roughly in about five
months right oh I'm excited like it's
it's getting that buzz out where you
build it up for people to get excited
Apple just showed us a bunch of
celebrities know content and I'm like I
don't care if it's feel Birdman like I'm
sorry doesn't matter I don't give it as
JJ I don't see anything on strange I
love your aqua man but sorry no this is
not the same thing so I think that's
where it's gonna meet you seem to see
would you get their service though I
love Disney 9 + TV plus I meant meant to
TV plus all right man here's the problem
I already have YouTube TV and I love it
to death man I you know I can't be
having 20 subscriptions dude you know
you know in the end that's gonna be all
about the content and so if they weren't
able to show that today how's that
runner's world working out for you it's
just I suck I know I I have so many
service
that I paid for and I forget that I pay
for and that I would at least expect
them like crap damn it but yeah like I'm
I'm not willing like I'll give you an
example air pods - I mean if people it's
the fact that everybody has them like
everybody and their mother and even the
grandmother of their grandmother in the
grave is wearing a pair of air pods
right now
they still don't do it for me I don't
find them valuable I was even thinking
about going to buy one of those parrots
just to be like okay let me see if
there's anything better in this
generation - and I'll probably make a
video about it but if it's still within
the 14th day return period I'll probably
return them because you know once you
try better audio it's really hard to go
back man and yeah and so I tweeted about
this a day ago like he's been a long
time since I've just used wired in a
good DAC
I bought a deck I ain't you bought a
deck and so I'm sorry like I other than
the convenience of being able to connect
quickly which Samsung is now figuring
out and qualcomm is already providing I
mean I don't know why why going back to
services why don't I have Apple music
because Spotify is superior mm-hmm I see
the deck I agree yeah I do agree with
you why me I think I think we talked
about this earlier Apple's focus on
services was the wrong one yeah it's
basically if you think about all the
services the news Plus is to say the new
service they had now it's just more
polished and better the gaming service
which is nice it's just an amalgamation
of here we have games on the store now
you don't have to pay for each one now
you can just pay $9.99 so it's not
something that brings anything
traditionally new or and then provide
any pricing - yeah and yeah and no
pricing now the service was the one
service that could have brought in
people who are not Apple users that was
the main one that could bring in non
Apple users if you show content if you
showed like what Apple needed to do what
the biggest mistake I made in that
conference was they had no big I pee
for for TV so think about it Netflix is
not Netflix I'm Netflix or struggling
for a little bit
they got Star Wars they got Netflix TV
shows right I mean sorry I'm Marvel TV
shows everybody wanted to watch those
Amazon has been trying to get a few
things they got the guys who did top
gear that brought in a crowd they also
brought in they have a Jack Ryan show
everybody knows who Jack Ryan is and now
they're they're they're award-winning
also helps yes marvelous Miz Mazal
that's like such such an award-winning
show Joe and then you now have Lord of
the Ring show definitely gonna check it
out just because it says Lord of the
Rings you know so that's the thing that
they like I was hoping for them to say
oh and this book we're making whatever
book or from the creators of Game of
Thrones comes this then I go oh okay you
know I'm I don't want I want to watch
that yeah yeah something that people
know because all these celebrities I've
seen they're going it's nice for what
are you showing me yeah yeah yeah you
know what they call the Hollywood elite
that's literally what they flexed it was
like the Hollywood elite you're going to
love it because it's Spielberg you're
going to love it because it's Rachel
Green you're gonna love it because of
this the problem with the Hollywood
elite you know what it is is that
sometimes you're hot sometimes you're
now when it comes to Hollywood man Sam
Worthington was one of the best actors
that avatar did so many movies Clash of
the Titans and now nobody knows who Sam
Worthington is he's not on you know
that's the problem the problem is people
come and go actors come and go their
popularity is not permanent and so
illegal so here's the thing Apple needs
to understand that people have an
emotional connection to the content that
they construe why don't I move away from
Spotify because I took the time to build
those playlists the first thing that
Apple needs to do is what every Android
phone has done which is figure out a way
to make it seamless for you to transfer
your stuff from an iPhone to an Android
phone that they need to fit if they want
to pull people from Spotify to Apple
music they need to figure out a way to
make it seamless for me to not lose the
service but then again if I can't follow
somebody else's playlist if I call
at playlist with other people I could
give two craps about Apple music man or
the following people's playlist was
something because I remember I was
talking to - Sam Sam song Google YouTube
music now and he was like why do you
like what if I was like look because
look you know me I'm an old school music
person I don't listen to a lot of new
stuff but whenever I hear it I go what's
that and you're like oh I've got a plate
I was like yeah you know what send me
that play this right now and so it
becomes a social thing it's like a it's
a subculture social social network for
music based on music you follow each
other
yeah they are so I've been to places in
Brooklyn here you go to a restaurant a
little bar and I'm eating I'm like I'm
like I'm like man I'm like who's this
it's like oh the the waiter comes by is
like oh it's my Spotify this is an
hour-plus yeah yeah no he's like no it's
mine like it's yeah - do the tunes you
know in the in the bar I'm like real
okay look give me that let me let me
listen to you one of the prime examples
of that is in Manhattan the Bauhaus if
you want some good old school hip-hop
Bauhaus playlist it's the playlist a
play in that restaurant and exactly and
the cool thing like for example if you
go to any Starbucks and you're listening
to a song you like they even have cards
that tell you this is our Spotify
playlist and that's playlist evolves
over time that if you follow the
playlist you'll get all the music and
it's mostly Coldplay though I've
discovered some really good artists
using that and like for example why am i
a big fan of YouTube TV the first reason
which is for me the most important is
that right now it doesn't matter if I
have an Android phone and iPhone if I
have an iPad a Windows computer if I
have a television I can watch my YouTube
TV now on demand here or there the
second thing the second thing which is
for me the most important is the fact is
unlimited DVR for six months and so I
don't have to be following the damn
Jimmy Fallon show I could just watch it
whenever I want
you know it'll just record it and
YouTube wins because I'll end up
watching their advertisement whenever I
get the chance and so I I don't see how
Apple I'm not saying that I will can top
that but when you have a beast like
YouTube
it's really difficult unless they're
willing to invest the amount of time
that it's taken to create YouTube the
beast yeah
yeah I think I think for them there's a
lot they have to do and there's a lot of
money they have to spend you know for
them to win in this in this category you
have to be so we heard that I think the
rumors is Apple has spend like a billion
or $2 for contents yeah they're spending
in freakin carpool karaoke man no no
it's not forget what even they're
spending on right think about it this
way
billions to the hospital tents Amazon
reportedly paid 1 billion for Lord of
the Rings 1 billion for bunch o Netflix
spends 12 to 14 billion per show we all
know how much Disney spends for all
their movies and stuff that they do you
know so it's it's a matter of saying
like you've got you don't have to spend
12 million but you got to spend more
money and also focus on the right right
selection if you will yeah a great
agreement so that entire announcement
event was basically them saying this is
how we're going to fund all the content
that we have to make Apple do that like
they literally became the Steve ball the
Microsoft from Steve Ballmer where we
announced Windows Phone 7 Series in
January but you won't get a product
until October yeah I've never seen Apple
do something like that and I I don't I
do not understand the purpose I don't
understand the point I don't understand
like Apple is the kind of company that
would rather rough it out and let people
criticize them before announcing a
product they're not ready to show well
let's just go to what it is though I may
have said this for years Apple is a
company that doesn't have ideas
let's just be factory I'll tell you why
I say they don't have any I'm a seen as
ideas as in being that they can't make
something like right now be in a
position where because when when when he
came out early and said we are focused
on services that was where it was really
key I was like what new services are you
gonna mention for us this year and
ready you tell the services I'm going
you don't have ideas you're basically
just trying to enter our market because
and they said it throughout the whole
press conference we have over a billion
devices and Oprah kept them shouting it
all the tweets and videos you see she's
like we can be on a billion devices you
know Oprah does a thing and I'm going
that's where their mind is thinking and
it's very operational Tim Cook is
operational guy there's nothing wrong
with that
there's absolutely nothing wrong with
that but it also shows that that's where
they're thinking okay look let's
solidify the base yet let's let's make
sure that base is secure instead of me
going how do I get the Android guy to
play here he doesn't have to leave his
phone but he's paying me money but that
but this is business this is the problem
with Apple and here's the problem with
Apple and this is where people Apple
needs to act up into the way the way
technology is evolving for Xiaomi the
phone is a terminal it is not a way to
make money yeah for Amazon all their
services are a way to lock you in
they're not necessarily a way to make
money you get free shipping you get
discounts and whole foods you get Amazon
music you get Amazon Prime now how many
services do you get for a hot 120 bucks
so you're telling me that I have to pay
TV plus news plus Apple music like how
much money am I gonna have to pay over
the fact that I'm paying you 1,000 bucks
for that damn phone of yours mm-hmm yeah
and good god obviously that's the thing
to me the biggest thing if you're upset
with Apple TV plus to get me in is for
me to go and since you are a an Apple
subscriber for whatever or you use this
Apple product Apple TV pross is free if
you have an Apple TV or whatever zactly
exactly and then later or you can say
now you can get Apple TV from this
premium which is 4k for five bucks I
think that Apple has written on a good
stream of growth and that's fine but the
fact that they believe that that stream
of growth
was realeased realistically sustainable
forever is literally what's fighting
them back because right now they need to
focus more on continuing to keep their
consumers continue to get their fidelity
based on more than just their brand
because a lot of companies are showing
off that they could do just as good if
not better for a lot less money man yeah
it's not just the price though think
about it this way and look at look at
Microsoft
you know they've not made that
announcement yes there were rumors
coming out that said Xbox Live will be
available on the switch would be
available everywhere Sony if Sony wants
or them to release it Sony has allowed
but Nintendo's allowed it on the switch
the first thing that's taking that is
cuphead we have xbox live into a new
integration and Microsoft has now said
look we have a cloud service gaming
service coming and you can play anywhere
we don't
Microsoft has adopted that approach to
us said office everywhere doesn't matter
we don't care like please just
I thought your inner in our use case
ecosystem and you're there and that's
how you make and book for them they know
that half of that money is on the back
end with their servers because they can
make money there but it also know
consumer doesn't care the consumer knows
if I open office on my Mac and I
switched and let's say I I mean in a
pinch and I need to switch over to a PC
I still have office it's the same
experience and it's cloud connected I
can download everything I saved in the
cloud back on here and work on my stuff
I'm good and my and Microsoft's
marketing cap has surpassed Apple for
the first time in how many years I mean
Steve Jobs are still alive when Apple
surpassed Microsoft yeah the thing about
it is Microsoft has literally been
banking on their start price because of
how much they're dominating the market
particularly enterprise the same as
Amazon Amazon is not making any money
and so Apple seems to believe that they
still need to be that company that makes
an insane amount of money for their
start price to be high and Amazon is the
perfect example that you don't what you
know your stock price can depend on so
many things with marketing the minions
would market the minion is one of them
you know I don't know and III it's not
that I feel sad I mean I feel that
Apple needs to learn a few things one of
them is again man they can try to play
for the elite all they want but right
now that's not where the money's at I
mean and companies like guar way and
Samsung are not confused will Xiaomi
they're not confused they know where the
money said and it's not in the elite all
right I hate to cut it off for anybody
who is inside of him better exhausted on
perfect timing okay so we went for a
solid hour after the show so anybody who
who joined in also I am blur for
donating a couple of times thank you so
much for that but yeah we're gonna go
ahead and just sort of end the broadcast
it's gonna be one of the first times we
have a two-hour plus video on the
channel so let's see how that goes but
one hour of overtime after the show
thank you so much for for for tuning in
for sticking around if you did on the
YouTube version I'm gonna go ahead and
stop the broadcast now we might continue
the conversation but we'll see the rest
of you guys next week see you guys later
