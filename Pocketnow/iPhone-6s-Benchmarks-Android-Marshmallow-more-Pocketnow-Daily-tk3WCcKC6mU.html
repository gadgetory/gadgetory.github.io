powerful iphone success we get leaked
photos of the LG Nexus and renders is
the Huawei Nexus and google makes the
name Android M official I'm hi Mary
betta and I wonder how much we should
care about an Android holding a
marshmallow this is parking out daily
the official news today are kind of a
bummer most of us were stoked with the
news of a galaxy note5 variant with 128
gigs of storage at least for the United
States but Samsung has just come clean
and confirmed that there was an error in
the listing so for those of you that
wanted this device with a humongous
amount of storage sad nose will be the
spotlight over to Google one of the
hottest news today have to do with the
leaked photo of the LG Nexus we were
kind of worried about the design that we
saw on the render video but as it turns
out it doesn't look that bad at all and
camera hump is a little odd and it seems
that the fingerprint scanner is not a
button but and everything else that
device looks bare bones just like every
Nexus let's see what we get and speaking
of Nexus devices just like we had that
the leaked video of the LG Nexus we now
have that same leaked video of the
Huawei Nexus and renders and well in
everything that pertains to the front of
the device it seems that both devices
are identical the same speaker grills
obviously a different size but yeah it
could seem like if both devices were cut
from the same mold but then when it
comes to the back we do notice some
differences obviously these are two
devices that we are waiting for and
hopefully we get new soon now let's talk
about Apple there seem to be some leaked
to benchmarks from geekbench of the
iphone 6s or at least the prototype and
as it turns out it seems that we do have
two gigs of ram and a try core processor
that rather some very interesting
performance particularly because the
results according to geekbench are
superior than the galaxy s6 when it
comes to single core performance but
then when it comes to multi-core the
galaxy s6 wins but then when compared to
other devices running a Snapdragon 810
processor the iphone success wins these
with its apple a 9
let's just see how much that the amounts
to in real world results whenever the
phone gets an out and finally for the
news that a lot of us have been waiting
for if you wanted to know what Android M
stood for Google pretty much solved that
riddle today they have just brought out
their new statue for android marshmallow
it is an Android of holding a
marshmallow and even more interesting
even though we thought this was Android
52 as it turns out google has pretty
much published the sdk for android 60 so
yeah this is version 6 thought oh but
anyways it leads me to the question of
the day what do you think about the name
android marshmallow was this what you
expected or did you think something else
and if you did which one because in my
case I prefer Android M but leave us a
comment down below what is your case
what are you predicting friends as
always you know the drill if you want to
get the nose earlier before this video
was filmed machine follow us on finding
out about comments and sharp changing
channel as well and follow me on twitter
jaime alguersuari better on instagram it
