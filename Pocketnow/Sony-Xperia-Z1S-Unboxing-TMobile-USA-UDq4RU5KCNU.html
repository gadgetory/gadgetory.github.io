while
and my first t-mobile review unit in
over a year and just because we're not
giving the full review treatment to the
Sony Xperia z1s
doesn't mean we're not going to take a
close look at some of its features
but first let's unbox it so here's the
packaging of the z1 s and I will tell
you right up front folks that we are
racing a winter storm to get this
unboxing done I have to take this phone
out and take a lot of pictures before
the snow comes in because it's the Sun
the Sun is out outside and I haven't
seen it in ages and I want to get some
good pictures so if this is a little
rushed
forgive me you'll notice this is the
t-mobile USA branded packaging that is
because t-mobile is the carrier that
brought this device to us Sony had us on
the list but it was t-mobile who was
able to get it to us faster so we thank
them for that Sony is the official
partner of the FIFA World Cup in Brazil
if you didn't know that I did not know
that but it's on the box in case you
forgot let's pop it open see what we've
got in here this is of course the device
we saw at CES 2014 had a little bit of a
hands-on the most notable aspect of this
device possibly is that in contrast to
the European version the American
t-mobile variant has a plastic frame
that is a plastic skeleton not a plastic
exterior the still glass on the front
and back and we're told that was a
request from t-mobile to ameliorate some
reception concerns so that's information
from Sony on the show floor seems pretty
believable to us there's some inserting
the micro SIM card instructions exciting
first seem first t-mobile device I have
had in the Boston area in probably a
year to review so I'm really excited to
see how their coverage has panned out
has expanded here's the sony wall
charger USB plug in on the side there
and of course USB cable not much
exciting their handset recycling plan
from t-mobile in case you want to
recycle your old unit Start Guide more
literature than we are used to seeing on
a device even more literature trouble
shooting guide children and guide
another language FCC's statements
showing specific absorption rates and
some barcodes no headphones no case no
fun we pick on AT&amp;amp;T a lot for doing that
but really all the carrier's just just
take all the accessories the
manufacturer includes and then there's
just it's just such a shame we missed
the glory days of unboxings hey let's
get this microphone down into position
so we can do about ripping off this
screen protector which has call-outs but
first so first let's let's look at those
USB charging input over here memory card
micro SIM you can read them yourselves
here's the big old power button on the
right hand side back home and
multitasking and a dedicated camera
button Sony calling this device the best
camera on an underwater phone this phone
of course rated just like many of its
siblings for immersion let's go ahead
and peel the screen protector off as we
come around to the back we've moved the
mic back to the narration position and
I'll just call out the fact that Sony is
telling you to charge this thing for at
least 30 minutes after you take it out
of the box it seems at least that's how
I interpret that gives us some
instructions for removing the flap for
putting in your SIM card and your
microSD wow that is glossy stuff man
Sony can make some beautiful hardware
I'll tell you that this is also the
first Sony smartphone I've had in this
lab in quite a while that's a twenty
point seven megapixel lens around back
around front is a triluminos display and
we're gonna see if we can bring that to
light by pressing and holding the power
button immediately disobeying sony's
instructions to put this on the charger
for thirty minutes before using it but
we'll see how it goes
other specs is we wait for the boot to
Meigs at two gigs of ram 32 gigs of
storage and expandable up to 64 gigs via
microSD there's our t-mobile splash
screen calling out the 4G LTE
compatibility in whatever markets
t-mobile has 4G LTE deployed battery
life is quoted from the t-mobile specs
pages up to 15
hours of talk up to 600 hours of standby
and the ships with Android 4.3 jelly
bean please close the external connector
covers to excuse you close those covers
if you want this thing to be waterproof
try and get a little focus on that yes I
think we are clear on that and don't
worry we'll be testing that out by the
way not sure I mentioned this in the
lead-in and not sure I will mention it
in the host out but this device we're
not doing a full review on because we
did a full review on the z1 but we will
be covering everything that's different
not to worry we'll cover what we need to
cover folks so just giving you a heads
up there English United States and
there's our set up so we're gonna go
ahead and set up this device but that
for now we're gonna leave it be wow that
is just gorgeous the the heating vent is
not gorgeous that's reflected in it but
it's a it's a very very pretty device
this is the Sony Xperia z1s

media folks all the links are there in
