pocketnow.com and this is ask pocket now
episode 1 let's get to it so this is a
new segment we're trying where we ask
you to send us your smartphone questions
and we're going to come on video every
week or every other week depending on
how much you guys like it and go through
the questions that you've asked so let's
start here we've got a handful of
questions in order to try to get through
as many as possible the first question
is from shell Harrington why don't ask
include a close button in android that
will force the program to be removed
from memory well if you remember back to
legacy windows mobile the old version
before Windows Phone 7 came around every
app in the touch screen version of the
operating system had an X now pressing
the X would actually put the program
into hibernation it wouldn't actually
take it out of program memory so in
order to close the app you had to go to
the menu and hit exit so they didn't
carry this UI element forward to any
mobile operating system today no
operating system android iOS blackberry
they don't have an X button because
mobile operating systems have gotten
very good at managing memory without
having to have apps close all the time
that said an Android there is a way to
force a program out of memory and the
answer is you press the back button so
let's say you're going to the Kindle
application and you get to a page on a
book you press the back application or
the back button it'll take you to your
book index you press it one more time it
exits the application and puts it out of
memory so the back button will do the
same function as the sort of X button on
your on your computer for example next
question so long your question from paul
s i'm still using the HTC touch pro2 on
verizon and i've been holding out for an
awesome phone all this time I've been
out of contract for over a year but I
don't care much to leave Verizon I'm
deciding between the Thunderbolt from
HTC and the motorola droid bionic the
Thunderbolt seems to be essentially an
HTC evo on verizon and you're right
that's pretty much what it is with no
real upgrades from last year's
technology but the droid bionic seems to
be the promise of promising future proof
phone can you do a comparison and
possibly reckon
dation of the two if you're considering
the Thunderbolt or the droid bionic both
phones which will be on verizon the
Thunderbolt actually started shipping
yesterday or pre-orders went up for it
I'd say go for the Droid Bionic the
Thunderbolt is like you like you say a
last generation phone it's got a single
core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor it's
got a WVGA display the droid bionic is a
step beyond that it's got a the same
size screen 4.3 inches but it bumps the
resolution to qhd it also has the dual
core tegra processor and of course it is
also lte-capable so definitely if you
can wait for it get the droid bionic
that is the phone to get on verizon it's
going to be a pretty cool device next
question here from Daniel Daniel I don't
want to say the last name here parent
tale will the next Windows device be
from Nokia if not who will beat them to
the market I think the question is who
will create the next or release the next
windows phone 7 device obviously they
have slowed to a trickle we've got the
seven pro coming out on sprint in the
near future and the answer is nokia
probably won't be the next one to make a
windows phone 7 device they're likely to
wait for the mango update coming up this
summer just in time for the holiday
season before that we're likely to see
some summer phones perhaps from HTC
maybe from LG we still have ctia coming
up where new phones will be announced
we're likely to see a couple new windows
phone 7 before the holiday season comes
around and a lot more new phones come
out next question from T will I really
want to Windows Phone 7 but I just
really want to know when can we expect
front-facing cameras and video calling
well not anytime soon in fact Microsoft
just talked about what the mango update
will bring for windows phone 7 so we're
going to have fast app switching with a
little card view when you tap and hold
the back button will have IE 9 and a few
other things but not among them is video
call support and you've got to have
operating system level support for a
front-facing camera in order to do
front-facing video chat so it doesn't
look like 2011 is going to bring
front-facing chat to Windows Phone 7
there's always a chance at a man you
facture could sneak it in somehow but it
doesn't look likely that we're going to
see that anytime soon but hey most
people don't use video chat anyhow so
it's a nice to have feature but the
truth is that a lot of people use it
once or twice and then they realize it's
a novelty next question Michael
Letterman do you guys at pocket now
think that Nokia will actually benefit
from adapting the windows phone 7 OS or
do you think they'll end up failing in
the end windows phone 7 partnership
between nokia and microsoft is a huge
win for both companies nokia needs a
strategy going forward an operating
system that already has a built-in
ecosystem as they say which means
developers software maker hardware
manufacturers and on the other hand
microsoft needs a hardware partner that
is well respected that has global reach
which nokia has it's a fantastic
partnership that we think is really
going to work out in the end for both
companies another question from Sean
talks about multitasking in Windows
Phone 7 and as mentioned Windows Phone 7
will finally have fast app switching
sort of like iOS in its ability for you
to do some sort of action and be able to
swipe between or foot but to flip
through apps that are currently open and
it's kind of palm pre like actually or
webos like what you do is you tap and
hold of the back button you get live
previews it's kind of strange you only
see about two applications on the screen
at once get swipe to the right swipe to
the left tap on the app you want to open
and then you'll go from there that's a
big missing piece of Windows Phone 7
that will probably excite a lot of
people although it's a little bit of a
digression or deviation from where other
companies are going on Android if you
want to multitask you tap and hold the
home button well that takes a second or
two which is kind of annoying when
you're trying to bounce between acts
very quickly google has come out and
said that in a future version of Android
they're going to quicken that by putting
the multitasking out above a tap and
hold kind of like we're getting in a
honeycomb with the permanent button
that's always there for you to go to
multitasking so hopefully we'll see that
soon and Android Microsoft what they're
bringing to the table
bit behind the curve let's go to the
next question from coal bogus i have the
samsung fascinate on verizon and i
wanted to know if I should get a new
dual core phone when they come out or
just root my fascinate and try to add
faster rums well we're always for
rooting your phone and trying faster
rumps anyhow because you already have
the phone why not see if that makes you
happy if that doesn't make you happy as
mentioned the droid bionic on verizon is
going to be awesome if you want to go
with an HTC phone you've got the
Thunderbolt but again droid bionic is
going to be the one to watch so that's
it for this segment of esque pocketnow
episode 1 if you like the segment please
give it a thumbs up and also ask your
questions here on the video or in the
comments will try to get to them in the
next segment thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
