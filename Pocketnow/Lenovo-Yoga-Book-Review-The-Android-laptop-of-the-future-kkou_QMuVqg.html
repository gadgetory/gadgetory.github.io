killer solution for making a hot
multimode hybrid the yoga book features
the flipping hinge popularized by yoga
laptops but no mechanical keys this
touch surface doubles as your text input
and a sketch pad does the extra
flexibility offset some of the
compromises of this setup well here's
our full review getting specs out of the
way first the yoga book has a 10 inch
1920 by 1200 resolution display powered
by an Intel Atom chipset 4 gigabytes of
RAM is backed up by 64 gigabytes of
storage and a micro SD card slot hiding
behind a pin tool door Lenovo rates the
8500 milliamp hour battery for around 15
hours of use this Hybrid comes in
Windows and Android versions and were
reviewing the Android variant which came
with marshmallow installed out of the
box looking at design this thing is
undeniably cool when I was a kid I
thought the glass end comm keyboard in
Tron was one of the coolest things I'd
ever seen yoga books keys and trackpad
almost perfectly recall that vibe it's
like looking at Star Trek The Next
Generation it is cool the whole kit is
satisfyingly thin and light sensors and
battery but we don't have to owe any
space to mechanical keys the whole
bottom section is thinner than most
phones it's so light it can be tricky to
open and I've not been able to
gracefully lift the lid with one hand
this aesthetic is simple clean and
professional a portrait mounted Lenovo
logo looks a bit funny when used as a
laptop arguably the most common
orientation for this hybrid but
otherwise it's tough finding fault with
this style this clockwork hinge is
subtle and sexy providing a smooth
action for adjusting the screen angle
and wraps all the way around for
Lenovo's different modes flip it for a
straight tablet or prop up the screen
intent or stand modes there's a bit of a
rattle coming from this part of the
hinge here but nothing too distracting
considering these pieces and connections
HD resolution is reasonable for this
screen size especially as it'll mostly
be used laptop style at arm's length and
while this panel is decently bright and
it can be used outdoors in shade it's
not quite bright enough to overpower
direct Sun with this cloth
teaglass one of the only hardware
criticisms we can throw at the display
the whole affair is so lightweight
there's a lot of screen wobble when
touching and swiping we don't spend a
lot of time on tablet cameras and these
are functional enough for video calling
and in a pinch when you have no other
photo option there are two cameras
though they are designed for tablet mode
the rear camera on the keyboard above
the backspace somewhat useless when
typing unless you really want to show
off your nostrils taking a quick tour
around the software Lenovo is delivering
a more stock experience these days and
we're happy to see a proper app drawer
happily not a lot of bloat with just a
handful of Lenovo apps and a new user
guide pre-installed most of lenovo's
additions are focused on multitasking
this dock at the bottom almost replacing
the alt tab style app switching found in
nougat and providing an easy way to
close running apps by dragging them away
Lenovo's apps can be used in
split-screen but there's not a lot of
support for third-party programs like
Google Docs or Microsoft Office there's
still a bit of wasted space converting
Android to a larger screen size with
these little tweaks from Lenovo help in
delivering a more laptop like work
experience moving to performance from
when we first played with the yoga book
we're really happy to see how much
smoother Android slides around on this
finished Hardware this might be the best
optimized version of an Android portable
using an Intel chipset we've ever used
benchmarks aren't far off from the top
Qualcomm performers and this hardware
has no issues swapping back and forth
between media and productivity apps
looking at some gaming the yoga book
tackles Marvel future fight better than
any other Android device we've reviewed
recently very nice to see is this game
is poorly optimized for Qualcomm
chipsets getting to the heart of this
device though the yoga book is trying to
introduce a new input method the entire
bottom section is one large touch sensor
when used as a keyboard vibrations help
deliver some tactile feedback there's
obviously no key feel this being a
completely smooth surface so touch
typing largely becomes an exercise in
muscle memory the yoga's software
piggybacks on androids text correction
which helps a lot in minimizing the
amount of editing needed a nice benefit
over the Windows version of the yoga
look where Windows 10 doesn't seem to
support text correction for Hardware
keyboards
though writing the script for this
review on the yoga took quite a bit
longer than using a traditional keyboard
but it wasn't as painful to transition
as I was expecting a few small issues
though one this is a touch sensor so
there is no resting your hands on the
keys this panel is very unforgiving
accidental touches I have no idea how I
managed to but halfway through typing
this I somehow switched to the layout to
French a couple accidental keystrokes in
the middle of trying to type quickly
also the autocorrect can sometimes
interrupt your flow if the tablet is
offering you text suggestions and you
move on to another part of a document
and continue typing sometimes the
keyboard would populate one of the
suggestions in that new section of the
document a quick look at the touchpad
it's entirely functional but a bit
blingy I was far more likely to just
reach up and touch the screen then try
to use the mouse cursor to navigate and
the benefit of using a large touch panel
here is the ability to pull double duty
as a canvas for stylus input the yoga
stylus works on both the screen and the
touch panel and lenovo includes a screen
tip and replacement pen tips for users
in addition to an actual paper notepad
designed to stick to the bottom panel
via magnet I'm not much of an artist and
I have terrible handwriting but this is
a handy way to take notes or doodle for
using mobile hardware the entire affair
is surprisingly responsive and we're
happy to see that it's largely a
plug-and-play solution no pairing over
Bluetooth or customizing input settings
one last note about this touch panel
magnets are nifty for keeping the paper
pad in place but they're also strong
enough to stick the yoga book to a metal
cafe table just a little word of warning
moving over to audio we're impressed
with these speakers for such a slim
product these little vents easily
compete with most tablets we've heard
and even best some ultra-thin laptops
I've reviewed in the past while the
speakers are better than average the
headphone playback was a bit
disappointing the yoga book was
outperformed by our little fee ok1 DAC
and beaten by a number of phones we've
got this Dolby software on board to
adjust playback for music and movies and
this kind of EQ tweaking can be fun but
overall we wouldn't rank this headphone
jack high for multimedia playback and
lastly looking at battery life the yoga
book performed well in our media test
streaming one hour of age
video over Wi-Fi 190 Lux drained 13% of
the battery not bad at all considering
screen size and how slim this whole kit
is recharge times were also acceptable
if a bit underwhelming 30 minutes using
the included charger delivered a 21
percent battery top off a decent chunk
of runtime after a short stint plugged
in and happily the unit remained cool to
the touch so let's wrap this up where's
that leave us with the Lenovo yoga book
experiments are exciting lenovo has a
pretty solid track record for driving
innovative designs the functionality of
Windows 8 was first shown off on Lenovo
experiments like the twist in the yoga
bringing more premium pieces like this
clockwork hinge is a great aesthetic for
an Android hybrid it's also interesting
seeing how it only takes a few touches
to get Android closer to the
functionality of a more traditional
computer operating system a little more
support for multitasking apps and many
consumers would be hard-pressed to see
the differences between a Windows ultra
portable and an Android laptop
ultimately this experiment lives in dies
by this futuristic touchpad we can't
claim it's our favorite solution for
typing as after a couple weeks I'm still
faster on a Bluetooth keyboard but pen
input is well implemented for notes and
sketches
there's just something fun about lenovo
combining mobile technology with paper
and pen and we can definitely imagine
situations where this functionality will
come in handy looking at the competition
a base-model ipad pro with an apple
pencil and smart keyboard is around
three hundred and fifty dollars more we
think lenovo has achieved a happy
balance between price form and function
