running the official play edition
software I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is how to turn your
HTC One into a play edition earlier this
week Google updated the devices section
of the Play Store with two new faces the
Play edition HTC One and galaxy s4
naturally since these two new well sort
of new devices launched just a month ago
some existing owners have been a bit
upset since the Play edition devices are
something many have been begging for all
along official stock Android on flagship
handsets as per usual the development
community came to the rescue we now have
a quick and easy way to turn your HTC
One into a plate edition one in just a
few minutes first of course there are
some prerequisites your HTC One will
need to be bootloader unlocked and you
will need to have a custom recovery
installed and it also helps to have ADB
setup on your machine if you plan to do
any Android modding to unlock the
bootloader head over to HTC dev comm
create an account and follow the
instructions for more detailed
instructions on how to flash a custom
recovery check out our previous video on
flashing a custom ROM to the HTC One
linked in the description below once
you've gotten all of that taken care of
head over to the thread in the XDA
Developers forums also linked below pick
one of the many mirrors to download I
went through several before I found one
that wasn't going to take several hours
to complete the file is just over four
hundred and fifty megabytes so it may
take some time
anyway if your connection is slow once
the download finishes you will need to
move the file over to your HTC One this
has gotten a little more tricky over the
years but there are a few methods that
work reliably you can use an application
like Wi-Fi File Explorer Pro and
transfer the file via Wi-Fi but the
method I use most often for large files
is ADB plug your phone into the computer
open a terminal window and change the
directory to where the file is located
type ADB push the name of the zip file
forward slash sdcard forward slash and
press Enter this will take about a
minute to complete the terminal prompt
will tell you if the process failed or
succeeded but if you're unsure you did
the step correctly you can double-check
and find the file on the phone before
rebooting with a file explorer
without unplugging the phone in terminal
type ADB reboot bootloader the phone
will reboot to the H boot menu from
there use the volume keys to highlight
bootloader and press the power button to
select then select recovery depending on
which custom recovery you installed
things may look a little different at
this point but they all do about the
same thing it's a smart idea to perform
an Android backup using the volume keys
scroll down to backup hit the power
button to select and select backup once
again the process will take a couple
minutes then you will want to perform a
factory data reset and wipe the cache
partition then select Install zip from
sdcard choose zip from sdcard and scroll
with the volume keys until you find the
proper zip file confirm the action and
wait just a few more minutes once the
flash completes reboot the phone this
reboot will take longer than normal and
once the phone finally powers on you
will be running an official pure stock
version of Android on the HTC One and
save for future updates being pushed
directly from Google your HTC One will
be virtually no different than the
official Play edition HTC One that's
going to do it for now if you enjoyed
