pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to compare the Nexus S with the
Nexus 1 let's get to it okay so the
Nexus S here is running Android 2.3
Gingerbread the Nexus 1 is running
Android 2.2 Froyo so we're really gonna
focus on the perceived differences the
things that you're going to notice
between Gingerbread 2.3 and 2.2 we're
not going to talk about sort of the deep
technical changes in Android 2.3 but
overall it helps developers makes the
system more stable it allows it to have
integrated voice over IP support right
in the dialer a lot of other little
things but we're going to focus really
on the visuals of the user experience so
let's start off we're going to turn on
both devices here and of course the
Nexus S is a set up a little bit
differently now what you're going to
notice right off the bat between these
two devices is the Super AMOLED screen
really shines we've got a little bit of
a glare or a little bit of shine coming
through on the screen and the Nexus S is
cutting through the glare really well
and you're able to see it this is really
representative of the outdoor visibility
so we're actually gonna turn dim the
lights a little bit so that it's easier
to see the screen alright that's a
little bit better so let's talk about
some of these aesthetic differences
first thing you want to point out here
is the application tray so of course in
the Nexus One we saw in Android 2.2 we
saw this cool 3d effect where you can
see sort of the icons icons fade away on
the bottom and on the top but in Android
2.3 or this may be a testament to the
clarity of the Super AMOLED screen it's
very subtle but you can see the icons
even before they're visible even better
so let's get a little bit closer to the
Nexus S here so you can actually see the
maps icon right there this is a market
icon over here I don't know what that is
what is that that is messaging you can
see them all clearly and then you can
see about four rows beneath them here on
the Nexus One this is not that big a
video again but it's interesting to note
you really can't see the next icon or
row of icons down they're kind of
blurred out so they've made it a lot
clearer and crisper and the Nexus S
which is just a nice little visual
change
in the new version of Android you get a
lot more black color for example the
notification bar at the top is now black
and some people say that it helps the
sort of notification area fade into the
screen and make the device seem like it
has a bigger screen but I haven't found
that to be the case at all so here we
can see the black bar up there with the
green icons a notification has popped up
there flick this off and then on Android
2.2 the stock notification tray is
actually greyish white color as you can
see here with no notifications let's
jump into the settings on both of these
devices okay here we are again the Super
AMOLED screen really shines to bring out
that black color so we've got very
similar settings here there are a few
things that are different so if we go
into say Wireless and network and I'm
trying to tap at the same time so you
get a sense for speed between these two
devices we can see the new style of
checkboxes again a lot of little subtle
changes here in the in the new version
of Android let's open up the browser on
both of these of course we've got
different colored icons down here so
let's launch the browser okay and
they're gonna go to the same page let's
do a little bit of a speed test we're on
the same Wi-Fi network curious to see
which of these operating systems loads
the the page faster of course we want to
make sure that we disable plugins or at
least have it set to the same thing so
if we scroll down here to plugins
always-on on both of them both of them
so let's go to on-demand just to prevent
them from popping up so let's go to
pocketnow.com on both of these devices
and we'll see which one gets there first
okay let's let's launch it and they're
off let's see ok the Nexus One actually
won by a small margin but it actually
went to Google actually not a not the
actual site so we're gonna scroll to the
bottom here and actually load the
desktop version to get some graphics
loaded boom they're off
Nexus S is winning should right
okay Nexus S is done Nexus One finish
about five seconds later let's check
your screen rotation speeds here okay so
the Nexus Ness is faster in the Nexus S
should be faster it's running a new
version of Android that said they both
have a one gigahertz processor and 512
megabytes of RAM so inside they're not
that different let's kind of flick down
this page and see how how smooth
scrolling is so very smooth on both
devices we can do the pinch to zoom of
course which has the nice nice animation
effect now let's talk about the
on-screen keyboards because Android 2.3
has brought a new multi-touch keyboard
to the table here so let's go into a new
message so here we are here are the two
different keyboards what you'll actually
notice and what Google didn't tell you
so they made the height of the keyboard
smaller which is actually kind of
annoying you can see that these screens
start exactly in the same spot let's
zoom in just a little bit to make that
more clear so the screen start in the
same spot but the Nexus S keyboard
finishes up higher that's because we've
got this additional row of suggestions
here on the Nexus S so let's talk about
these keyboards what does multi-touch
keyboard support mean well it means that
you can type faster you don't have to
lift up every finger before getting to
the next letter but in practice this
doesn't really make the typing
experience any better in my opinion
anyway so let's type the quick brown fox
here on the nexus one well zoom out just
a little bit so we can see what's going
on so the quick brown fox
okay the quick brown goes there let's
try it out on the Nexus S and of course
by design you're gonna have a slightly
better typing experience on the Nexus S
because the screen is bigger so let's do
the quick brown fox so very good word
prediction on the Nexus S I can't say in
daily use that the keyboard actually
feels better on the Nexus S compared to
the Nexus One but hey this is Android if
you don't like the keyboard change it
out for swipe change it out for the HTC
keyboard you've got a ton of different
choices out there and of course both of
these keyboards have a landscape version
for those that want the maximum size
keyboard
and on the nexus test obviously the
keyboard stands out more because you're
using a lot of blacks and some white on
a Super AMOLED screen which has really
high contrast another subtle difference
between Android 2.3 and 2.2 is the phone
application now right now we don't have
the voiceover p10 to create it into the
phone application but the way it looks
is different okay so here we are in the
dialer and you get this sort of 3d
bubbly look to the letters and the
numbers on Android 2.2 so we can dial
like so and over here on the Nexus S
they just look a little bit different
and presumably the buttons are bigger
because the screen is bigger so they're
easier to press and the rest of the tabs
along the top are the same car log
contacts and favorites so nothing really
has changed
besides the overall look of the dialer
there so overall Android 2.3 on the
Nexus S while having some nice visual
changes doesn't seem that different from
a consumer perspective or an end-user
perspective I'd say it's about 10
percent faster than Android 2.2 and
Android 2.2 was much faster than the
previous 2.1 by about 50 percent so
we're seeing a smaller in game here in
terms of performance but you get a lot
of added visual flair better options for
developers who are making games and
applications for the platform definitely
a point one upgrade glad they didn't
call this Android 3.0 that really
wouldn't have made much sense we'll be
back soon to talk a little bit more
about the Nexus S software now before
