getting featured hmm hi Matt ravenna AKA
one cannot simply say in Capitan once
and I'd rather that than my AKA being
phantom but plat if I ever see him at a
bar i'm cracking him in the head with a
bottle and that's not a nice way to say
hi that's right it's that time of the
week I am high metal give it up this is
pocket now and this is the bargain out
daily recap for last week so on Monday I
asked you if at this point you still
care about the Apple watch as well as it
turns out the consumer satisfaction
surveys say that the the watch is really
nice 739 comments was one of them says
overpriced mac features bad battery life
looks kinda nice but geeky Mac I'll
stick to the $99 first-generation pebble
watch if you already own a SmartWatch
that would probably be my biggest advice
the Apple watch is Scylla
first-generation product it hasn't
proven itself so i would rather stick
and wait for Apple watch to the comments
are filled with Apple watch hate but
it's too late it's already the
best-selling smartwatch and it truly is
the question is if it can continue with
that momentum what kind of company makes
an overrated smartwatch and presses it
over nine hundred dollars a crazy one
indeed but I have to agree with you one
of the biggest mystery topics right now
is having the Apple watches or sold and
the topic of Tuesday was mainly about
the fact that I asked you why you think
that Apple is not providing sales
figures for this product even after q3
earnings we have thrown in 70 comments
of course the watch is appointed in
sales the ones that really wanted an
Apple watch free ordered it on the very
first day they could the ones that
didn't fall into three categories can't
afford it want to see more and I could
care less and I think that your analysis
is right on the spot indeed but there
were some people that want to be Apple
watch on pre-order day and there weren't
enough units as well they're hiding the
Apple watch numbers because they have
been disappointing Apple likes to brag
about numbers so if these numbers aren't
there they won't mention they won't even
mention it and true dude Apple is a
really that kind of company that loves
to baffle over how many products they've
sold the fact that they haven't done so
is the reason why things are
edgy like you said hi Apple is not
selling apple watches as they expected
but that also applies to any smart watch
maker regardless of the price tag in my
opinion smart watches are not that
useful yet let's see next year how they
evolve and you've probably brought us
one of the best comments of the League
particularly because it's not just the
apple watch s fault true indeed pretty
much every smart watch out there some
look cool some don't but they're not
really that useful I feel that the
killer used for a SmartWatch hasn't
really been defined yet once that it was
all about the galaxy note 5 and galaxy
s6 edge+ I asked you which one would you
pick as we've got some strong rumors
about it we have 978 comments thanks a
lot guys out of which we start with
three gigs of ram in the note 5 WTF I'll
keep my note for them it isn't even that
much of an improvement now I was excited
about 4 gigabytes of RAM ah you know I
would agree with you the thing is that
whelp the note 4 and particularly the
note edge have terrible software
experiences so we are really waiting
more about the software experience that
comes with there's no line I'm and that
could probably make a significant change
in there for make the amount of RAM
available not that needed meaning we
don't need more ram this video leads me
to the answer of the day that sounds
familiar I'll take a note 5 no matter
what once you had a note device you'll
buy a better and improve note device and
true that's my case particularly a6 edge
or note 5 toughest decision of the
summer basically boils down to sexynezz
versus functionality swag riches s-pen
help me baby Jesus and if you want my
opinion I'll take the note 5 LG CEOs on
record on Thursday talking about a super
premium foam to come later this year
because up they need to fix a little
stock slump that they have right now and
I asked you what would you want on this
phone we have 832 comments LG g4 with
front facing speakers yes me included g4
at a fingerprint scanner and some
front-facing speakers and yet even more
but man is your username bend over a
complete revamp to the lgu I I love
this comment because yes LG G Y has
gotten better but there is still a lot
of work to do finally on Friday the
topic was market share we learned that
Apple and Samsung are the kings of
smartphones right now Samsung being the
top and Apple traveling behind but
trailing on Samsung's numbers and I ask
you which is your favorite smartphone
oleum to stop big numbers we have 1259
comments thanks a lot guys one of them
says easily Sony they make fantastic
devices that are sorely underrated true
I love Sony devices I wish they had more
popularity I like companies that always
innovate or at least try something new
and have to give it to samsung nokia and
apple i would give it more to samsung
and nokia uh not necessarily samsung
because of its gimmicks but because
everything that comes out of R&amp;amp;D they
publish some things are not useful some
things like the note line of work I
trust Google when you have a nexus you
never go back a lot of people don't I'm
one of those people that did because
there was a time when Nexus devices were
better than its competitors they push
the edge because these were more
advanced lately Nexus devices don't do
that they're actually behind in most
cases just to keep the price down except
for this year but you know it wasn't any
better than anything that was out there
so I feel that Google should really work
on its strategy with the Nexus lineup
and figure out what works because in the
end that is the brand that we want to
trust but not necessarily the one to
deliver that's it for the pocket out
