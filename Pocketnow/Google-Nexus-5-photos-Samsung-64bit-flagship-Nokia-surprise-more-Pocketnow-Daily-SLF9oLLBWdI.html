5 have surfaced from the FCC Samsung
already teasing with their next flagship
bringing a 64-bit processor and Nokia
says that they have a surprise for us
tomorrow but we'll see I'm hi meri beta
and if you can't relate the name Jason
to the date Friday the 13th then you
missed a really good decade this is
 out daily listeners day off
talking about nokia there is a lot to
cover here first of all those of you
waiting for their 1520 dub phablets well
apparently this device will be announced
on September 26 and if you want leaked
descriptions on everything you'll get
into specs links down below and speaking
of specs you can also get another link
down below where it shows you more of
that project serious which is the nokia
tablet that some of us are waiting for
now on an interesting twist the company
has been tweeting that they have as a
price for us tomorrow friday the 13th
and we just hope that it's not something
that doesn't include a new phone now for
those of you wishing that Windows Phone
included a good voice assistant judging
by their good voice control service as
well as it turns out Apple has Suri
google has their Google now and well
apparently Microsoft has court Anna and
yeah if you don't know what Cortana
means you don't know what halo means as
well but apparently that's gonna be the
name of their new uh you know voice
assistant and apparently we will be
getting it by Windows Phone 8.1 we just
wish that we could just call that thing
court or Anna not you know Cortana that
big name now let's talk about Samson
those of you that believe that apples a7
chip that powers the iphone 5s will be
the only 64 bit processor in the market
well you know the way technology works
and it turns out samsung she already
came on record to state that his next
flagship will include a 64-bit processor
the only problem with that is that their
next flagship will pretty much be the
galaxy s5 which is slated for next year
probably in may or april so well you
know the way this news goes i mean in
sams the most probably collaborated for
most of that 87 processor anyway so stay
tuned for that it should happen soon now
let's talk about HTC we've got four
colors for the HTC One and it's almost
year-end meaning the next HTC flagship
will probably launch next year or
leon but as it turns out we've already
got leaked photographs of another color
for the HTC one being the golden or
champagne colored HTC one which will
probably be launched by the fall we
don't know if it's gonna be a carrier
exclusive or what I just wish that aside
from new colors they brought a new
camera but let's see how that goes and
finally for the hot news of the day yes
put the rumors to rest we've got the
first leaked photographs of that LG
device at the FCC and yet the Nexus 5 or
we don't know if it's going to be called
Nexus 5 but it looks exactly like that
Nexus smartphone that was leaked at the
Google event for KitKat so it turns out
that we aren't getting a nexus 5 from LG
very soon hopefully it's just
interesting that in the photos there is
no branding for this nexus phone it just
looks a lot like the nexus 7 only
smaller so that leads me to the question
of the day is the nexus 5 or whatever
they're gonna call this phone your next
phone is that a phone that you're
looking forward to in my particular case
honestly if the specs are the ones that
we saw at the FCC I mean even if that
phone was expensive i'd be interested in
it but anyways it was a comment down
below is it's something you're
interested on especially if the price is
right friends of course for an early or
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone in South go make sure you
