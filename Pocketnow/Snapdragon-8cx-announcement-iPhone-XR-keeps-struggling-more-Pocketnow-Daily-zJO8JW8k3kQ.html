take portable computing to a whole
different level your Apple watch series
4 can already start giving you and your
doctor and ECG report and Amazon
confirms that that 1 plus 60 McLaren
Edition is coming very soon I'm Jaime
Rivera and for those of you that think
that I'm actually here in Hawaii
partying
there's no tan here it's clear that I'm
here to work this is PocketNow Daly
sponsored by one plus the official loose
today are actually a lot that we're
gonna leave them till the end because
they're actually hot but let's begin
with deals those of you who want devices
like the huawei mate 10 Pro it is
currently on sale for 500 bucks and
pretty much Amazon B&amp;amp;H Newegg a couple
of companies and we're talking about the
6e could buy variant in addition to the
fact that it's I believe it's the dual
Sumerians it's the international one you
can learn more about it in the
description now let's move the spotlight
over to a teaser that we just received
from Amazon but Amazon India where we
get to see that that one +60 McLaren
Edition is a reality it's coming soon
and yeah sure it's just a separate
teaser in addition to the one we already
received from oneplus now the major
rumor is that the salute to speed is
going to be in some extra ram we're
hoping there's more than just that but
we'll keep you posted now let's talk
about the iPhone 10 are as of suppliers
are already having issues they're
confirming for example in the case of
GIS where they are pretty much 12.1
percent down and the amount of orders
that they were expecting from Apple
which pretty much gives you an idea of
exactly how many iPhones have not been
sold it's pretty much that 12.1 percent
and apparently the iPhone 10 R is the
one that's most affected right now I
guess it has everything to do with the
fact that you know what Apple that is
not an affordable phone you should have
I don't know man and you guys need to
think of something really quick now
speaking of Apple there is something
positive
watch OS 5 point one point two is now
available and it offers the ability to
get ECG readings from your watch you
just have to tap on the
on the digital crown and it takes about
30 seconds to run the test I haven't
really updated mine yet but I'll keep
you posted that's well that's a cool
thing to have
I mean seriously but finally the hottest
news that they have to do with the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 8
the most extreme processor that Qualcomm
has ever made according to them the
presentation was rather interesting
because they're pretty much claiming
that there is no stuck on cept here is
not to miniaturize a processor it's a 7
nanometer process but the thing about it
is they've made the largest GPU the
largest processor that they've ever made
in order to be able to power computers
as they should
so yes the Snapdragon 850 is still going
to continue out there for always
connected pcs but this 8 CX is going to
be a tier far higher up to the point
where it's 30% more battery efficient
we're talking about almost 200% faster
than the Snapdragon 800 5 that was
powering the original always connected
pcs we've got multi gigabit LTE in
addition to 5g support whatever that's
available so if you think about it this
thing is a true beast
there were comparisons being run against
the you know Intel's of low-power
processors and they made them look
really bad the question is will it be
great or not let us know in the comments
down below I mean what do you think is
this do you think this is the future of
computing the fact that Qualcomm is
betting really high on these mobile
processors to power computers because in
my case you know I believe that there
will still be a need for Intel
processors for like the really powerful
pcs definitely those are the ones that
we need for video editing but I saw this
thing like edit photos on Photoshop just
fine in a demo today so I think that
these processors are gonna go really far
but that's just me leave us a comment
down below it love to know your opinion

would love to thank our sponsor oneplus

the oneplus 60 is currently one of our
favorite smartphones it innovates and
features like it's in display a
fingerprint scanner insanely fast
charging and a price that puts all other
flagships to shame and now it's even

t-mobile
