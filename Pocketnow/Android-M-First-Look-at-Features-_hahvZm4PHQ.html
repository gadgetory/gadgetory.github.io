keynote much to nobody's surprise they
showed us Android M the version of the
Android operating system that's
following Android L which we found out
was called lollipop we still don't know
what M is going to be called but we do
know that a developer preview is now
available and we've got it running on
our Nexus 6 this is our Nexus 6 that we
bought through the google play store and
as you can tell we've got a tmobile sim
plugged in however this is not the
t-mobile version of the phone good thing
though we do have t mobile Wi-Fi calling
baked into this image so let's go ahead
and unlock this and see what we've got
we've gone ahead and set everything up
already the setup process is almost
identical to Android lollipop so you're
not missing out on anything they're
looking right here we've got android
version em just like android version l
did when it was a developer preview and
this is building number m p z for 4q so
let's take a look i have done virtually
nothing to this this is just set up and
restore from my account so I've gone
ahead and said okay to Google now and
it's all set up my widgets were
automatically put in place all of my
other stuff here has automatically
downloaded and installed so let's go
right into our app drawer where you're
going to see the first change up at top
you'll see the the recent or commonly
used I don't know exactly what that is
yet but it could be the most frequently
used apps or it could be just the app
that you opened a little bit more
recently than the others this has been
updating as I've been using it so I
don't know if over time this will
stabilize and it'll become your top four
most commonly used apps or if it's just
going to be the last four apps that you
used but nonetheless there it is your
apps are now organized into alphabetical
order which is very nice and in my
opinion long overdue you can also come
in and search your apps so if you want
to you know what it's called you just
can't find it
for some reason like my Wi-Fi analyzer
right there really really helpful to
jump right to what you're looking for
new so you could tell that was pretty
snappy that alphabetical stuff carries
over as well to the widgets so if you do
this you can see here that there's no
kind of ABC on the side but it is
alphabetically ordered and the widgets
for each one of them are included here
and you can scroll side to side you want
to see what else is in there so we'll go
ahead and open up YouTube and we'll go
through this the first time I've run
this so let's go ahead and look at san
andreas so here's that video come over
into landscape mode and now let's go
ahead and adjust the volume so here it
thinks that this is media volume that
I'm adjusting which I am there's muted a
lot more responsive than what we're used
to with lollipop but the other thing is
if you'll notice there's a down arrow
that shows me my alarms my notifications
and the media all right there and then I
can close that so it's still trying to
be smart you'll also notice that this is
the active color and then the others are
gray but as soon as I switch over to
that it switches to to highlight that so
you can tell which one you're adjusting
just because it's the one that's got the
focus color set on it next up we saw
Android pay showed off today at the the
keynote however there is no Android pay
on the device and Google Wallet is the
only thing that comes up when we search
for android pay so we'll probably have
to wait to see that until a little bit
later on next up let's go to our
notification shade one thing that's new
is a do not disturb mode so you can tap
on that and it will bring up do not
disturb for whatever you want to set it
to it for until you turn it off or for a
specific amount of time that you can
change you can also jump into more
settings you can go into total silence
or priority mode and there are some
hints and tips in there that tells you
what each one of those means so really
nice the way that they've done that we
got to wait and see how it plays out in
practice to see if there's really any
improvement there another thing that was
mentioned in today's keynote is some
improved copy and paste abilities so
here are some of the notes that I took
today
it's just a text file I'm going to long
press and if I can stay in one place on
the page you can see that long press
selected the word that I was pressing on
and now i've got this floating bar that
i can select all copy share or some
overflow buttons i can do a web search
and whatnot on it if i want but i don't
want just that word so let's drag this
out and you can see it's snapping to
wherever I am so it snaps two words by
pull down it snaps two lines so a lot
better a lot faster than you know what
we've had in the past one of the other
things that we saw about Android M was
the new permissions manager and how apps
can have various permissions that you
can turn on and off now I don't have any
here that I've been able to see and if
you notice that says show and hide
legacy you come back in here to security
I think this is where we're going to see
them when you sort by permission type
right here in security and down
underneath apps with usage access again
my list is empty reason for that as far
as I can tell is we were told in the
keynote that for apps to take advantage
of this new app security model where it
asks for permission to access in a
location or text messaging or something
like that it'll ask at the time that
it's requesting that permission rather
than it install well to do that the app
has to be compiled against the new M SDK
the Android M software developer kit and
it doesn't look like I have any of those
apps installed so I can't show you that
here that will come over time of course
but it's one of the features that I
really really like really want and can't
show it to you right now this is an
early preview I've had my fair share of
problems I've already had a few crashes
I don't think this can be my daily
driver but I didn't have Wi-Fi calling
before and I do now so I'm really kind
of tempted to to keep this at least for
the time being and see how we do and see
if I can't just live with some of those
crashes what's your favorite thing about
Android M make sure you go down to the
