labs but the Samsung Galaxy gear has
recently received a rather extensive
update from its manufacturer and we're
here to take you through it I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is your
guided tour of the mk7 update for the
Samsung Galaxy gear before we get
started I want to mention that yes we
know the update came out a long while
ago for some markets but here in the US
we had to wait quite a bit longer
that plus CES 2014 pushed this video
back some in the queue but we think this
is still worth taking a look at because
of the enormity of the update in a few
specific areas the first of those
notifications as we mentioned in our
after the buzz video for the Galaxy Note
3 the gear well it finally earns the
title of SmartWatch when it launched it
did not when you received a message on
your phone your gear only told you to
check your phone which was stupid you
couldn't get any more message details
unless it was a message received through
the stock Samsung messaging apps and you
know who wants to use those thankfully
with software version mk7 you can
finally get the body of emails text
messages via third-party apps and
Facebook notifications and so on and it
actually works quite well given the
gears display which is just as big and
beautiful as ever
the only hang-up comes when multiple
notifications come in at once
you still can't parse them individually
and all the subject lines kind of run
together obviously that's not ideal when
we're looking forward to that being
fixed in a future update but this was
our number one complaint about the gear
with its release software and we're very
happy to see it's been fixed our second
biggest complaint was also addressed
with this update battery life and that's
a good thing because not only is it
inconvenient to you know charge your
watch all the time but the gears
charging cradle is bulky and it's not
something you want to carry around when
you're traveling the gear still can't
match the performance of devices with
less power-hungry displays like the
pebble but its current endurance of
about two and a half to three days
between charges even with moderate to
heavy message traffic means it's come
quite a distance from the first software
versions 25 hours
speak in a distance you can now use your
gear further from the note three than
you could before thanks to improvements
to the Bluetooth connectivity
whereas before going into the next room
put you at it like a fifty percent
chance of disconnecting now it takes a
walk of about fifty to sixty feet in my
recent test I had to go outside to
finally shake the connection again a
welcome improvement at this point I know
this video basically seems like a
commercial for this update well that's
because the improvements are also
welcome that it's hard not to praise
them and they deserve praise but two
things one all this should have been
present at launch there's no question in
my mind that the Galaxy gear was
prematurely released and to the last
bullet point in samsung's release notes
s voice improvements well it's supposed
to be faster and well it's just not is
this indeed faster you're shifting the
blame you to be clear s voice is still
handy on the Galaxy gear for little
things like voice dialing or calling up
the weather but it's not detective Lee
faster in my experience after the update
our advice stands if you're expecting s
voice to WoW you ever well stop
expecting that because it won't but
those are two small blights on an
otherwise excellent update while the
gear is still pricy and far from perfect
with this software package it's become
one of the better smartwatches out there
especially if you have a Samsung
smartphone I'm still struggling to find
much use for the camera and I'd really
like to see some additions to the
stalled app ecosystem but the Galaxy
gear running mk7 is now right up there
with the pebble as one of my favorite
smartphone accessories
