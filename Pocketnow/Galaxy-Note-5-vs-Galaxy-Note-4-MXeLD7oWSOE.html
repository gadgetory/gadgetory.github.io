phone tablet hybrid each year we get an
updated one and each year we compare the
new model with its immediate predecessor
to see what's changed this year those
changes run to the very core of what it
means to be a note I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow and this is Samsung
Galaxy Note 5 versus Galaxy Note 4
the changes are most pronounced in
hardware and a lot of them are upgrades
the imitation leather back cover has
given way to curved glass last year's
sharp edged chamfers melting into this
year's 7000 series aluminum rails and
that combination makes the note 5 a more
comfortable device to hold in the hand
last year's finicky swipe fingerprint
scanner is gone replaced by the more
reliable press and hold type and though
the screen size has stayed the same at
5.7 inches the new device is smaller in
every dimension with slimmer bezels to
boot that's a big deal because the note
has always been clumsy to use one-handed
and even this moderate slimming helps a
lot the speakerphone sounds like it
could be the same physical driver but
it's been moved from the back cover to
the bottom edge alongside the new s-pen
now on the note 4 deploying the s-pen
was a simple matter of pulling it from
its silo but on the note 5 Samsung has
fancied it up with a click and release
action that's so cool it makes
everything else feel primitive also the
s-pen itself has gotten a paint job to
make its plastic look well less plastic
II but it's still plastic not all these
changes come without a cost while the
aesthetic modifications do a good job of
bringing the note in line with its
smaller sibling the Galaxy s6 the
trade-off is a phone that blends in more
than it stands out also the new S pen's
clicky deployment mechanism is a little
more cumbersome to use than the old
quick-draw method and let's stop burying
the lede here the biggest and most
controversial change to the note 5 is
the watering down of its hardware
customizability the microSD slot and
removable battery that have been staples
of the note line since its inception are
gone and to add insult to injury the
battery size has also been reduced by 7%
in the new phone for those who've always
bought the Galaxy Note because it's the
most powerful most versatile device in
Samsung's lineup it's doubtful that the
fast wireless charging or 100 gigs of
free onedrive storage will make up for
these perceived downgrades
things are more encouraging in software
where Samsung has ported many of the
positives from the galaxy s6 first of
all while these displays feature
identical resolution the out of box dpi
setting is higher on the note 5 allowing
for more information to be squeezed into
the same space there's more use of
transparencies less use of pop-up
dialogs and subtle signs of
modernization in places like app folders
if you still don't like Samsung's design
language you can theme the note 5 for a
totally reskin to Android experience
something's still not possible without a
third-party launcher on our Verizon
Wireless Note 4 the note 5 is also
somewhat snappier than the note 4 but at
this point it's an open question whether
that's thanks more to the uprated
processor and RAM or the fact that we're
comparing a freshly unboxed unit with an
older one you'll want to stay tuned for
the after the buzz coverage on this to
find out the most significant software
changes are the ones we saw demoed last
week in New York the s-pen now fires up
a low-power note-taking screen when it's
deployed which allows you to take an
immediate memo that will then be auto
saved when you put the s-pen back you
can also use the s-pen to sign PDFs with
no additional software now which is huge
if you still deal with companies or
people who insist on faxing things
there's a little more utility here with
room for custom apps in the air view
floating launcher and the multi screen
capture that lets you save long lists to
a single image file their support for
Samsung's new ultra high quality audio
if you're not content with current sound
quality and of course there's Samsung
pay support in the new phone tube which
will become more relevant to American
buyers come September walking around
town with the Galaxy Note 4 alongside
the note 5 it's easy to see why Samsung
opted to modernize the design the
slimmer lighter build does make a
difference in the hand and in the pocket
the edges of the new phone don't dig
into the palm as much and the new glass
back looks nicer than the pleather of
course it's also more fragile and it
attracts many more fingerprints I was
happy to see Samsung make the lead to a
nano SIM from the older micro sim
standard and incorporate the newer
generation cameras that were such a hit
on the galaxy s6 in practice you
probably won't be able to tell much of a
friends here as the note fours camera
was already so excellent in bright light
these results seem almost
indistinguishable and in low light
there's maybe a slight advantage to the
note 5 after very limited testing the
principal upside to the note 5 s primary
shooter seems to be a wider field of
view and on the selfie side it brings a
higher resolution shot now be it in a
4:3 aspect ratio the note 5 also has a
much more usable and responsive
viewfinder with Raw support which you
can launch just by double-clicking the
home button if you're watching this
video
odds are you're a note fan someone who's
been buying or at least following this
product family for some of its four
years of existence and in a very real
sense the note 5 changes what that
family stands for it's no longer that
take no prisoners powerhouse now Samsung
knows what it's doing with this form
factor it invented it after all and that
means it'll probably turn out to be a
great phablet again stay tuned for the
full review but it also means you're
going to need to look to yesterday if
you're shopping for what used to define
the note the swappable battery
expandable memory and distinct look and
feel well you won't be getting as wide a
range of color options or the latest and
greatest features you can at least get
close with custom software and
aftermarket hardware skins and you'd be
saving an awful lot of latinum to boot

companion the galaxy s6 edge+ stay tuned
