beautifully crafted android smartphone
but it sure is big so for those who put
a premium on pocket space or pocket
change HTC has crafted a smaller
alternative that brings the wanna mates
design language to the midsize category
but the landscape of mini smartphones is
dotted with disappointment so is this
just another compromise in disguise
let's find out together
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is our video review of the HTC One
mini - if you're like us carrying the
one mini - we'll make you feel like
you're getting away with something
not since Sony's Xperia z1 compact have
we encountered such a high-end feel in a
mid-sized phone the one mini twos casing
is 70% aluminium available in three
colors with a plastic border that looks
much better here than it did on last
year's One mini we like the design here
even more than the flagship m8 it's
simpler cleaner but no less luxurious
it's light without being chintzy thin
but still gripple for our average hands
it's the perfect size for one-handed use
if you're an iPhone user considering the
leap to Android this thing is going to
get your attention if there's a handicap
with the build its the buttons the
volume rocker sits naturally under the
thumb but the power standby key is still
located up top which is still pretty
awkward on a device as tall as this none
of the keys has terribly good travel or
feedback that said our Hardware here is
pre-release so that may change in the
production version the specs though are
set in stone and here we see the 1 mini
2s mid-range fruits more clearly its
heartbeat comes from a Snapdragon 400
system on a chip backed up by an
acceptable gig of ram and 16 gigs of
on-board storage with about 10 of those
user accessible fortunately there's
microSD expansion here for up to 128
gigs of music movies and other media or
you can stream the same over HSPA or LTE
in certain markets or dual band 8 or
2.11
a BGN everywhere Wi-Fi is available
you'll watch that media on a 4
point 5-inch Super LCD - that's quite
vibrant when it wants to be but
everything from the viewing angles to
the Milky gray blacks to the 720p
resolution is straight-up
middle-of-the-road making up for that
average spec sheet is an above-average
software experience Android is getting
so good that 4.4.2 doesn't need crazy
hardware to run well but it's surprising
how nicely HTC's Sense 6 runs a top it
here the day-to-day experience is as
fluid as you can find on most flag ships
and HTC's modern flair is a welcome
reprieve from the sameness of stock
KitKat you get a lot of added utility
from sense customizations during our
testing the HTC Browser came in handy
when chrome couldn't handle a live video
feed and the consistent visual cues
across all the core apps unified the
whole experience making the mini to seem
like something more than just another
Android phone while we'd still like more
options for accent colors particularly
in blinkfeed
using the software is as much a pleasure
here as it is on the one m8 and that's
high praise sadly we can't say the same
for the 13 megapixel camera if you're
interested in how this shooter measures
up to the m8 s ultra pixel camera we go
into more detail on our Mini 2 vs m8
comparison video and in a dedicated
photo shoot out at pocket now linked in
the description taken by itself the 1
Mini 2 s camera is well the best word is
probably adequate pictures in good
lighting or fine the camera defaults to
9.6 megapixels if you want to preserve
the wide aspect ratio but you can
manually crank it up to 13 megapixels if
you want and you'll get all the added
zoom ability that extra resolution
provides but colors on the whole fall on
the BLA side they're less vibrant than
in real life with brightly lit areas
tending to overexpose and both problems
are exacerbated by the too aggressive
HDR mode and the propensity of HTC's
exposure controls to dramatically
overcompensate when using tab to focus
low light shooting is flat-out bad even
in dedicated night mode which seems to
have little or no effect on the dim
noisy and results none of this should be
a surprise unless you Revere resolution
above all else this is after all the
same exact camera as found in HTC's
decidedly mid-range desire 816 it is
possible to take good photos with the
one menu too but while it's fun to try
thanks to the excellent feature-packed
viewfinder software it's not easy that's
true of the 5 megapixel front face as
well no matter how fun the eye enhancer
is all this holds true for video as well
be advised though that most of these
samples are 720p the default out of the
box setting our full review at pocket
now features a proper video sample reel
in full resolution the launch of HTC's
new Zowie app this summer will help
compensate for this cameras shortcomings
like the outstanding viewfinder and
gallery features already do but on the
whole we are just not impressed by this
shooters results we are impressed pretty
much everywhere else HTC has of course
brought back boom sound whose software
brings an added OMPH to playback through
earbuds on the hardware front the front
firing speakers aren't quite as throaty
as the bigger chambers on the One m8 but
their worlds better than anything else
on the market
that's evident in both media playback
and gaming which the one mini two also
handles with aplomb while the more
intense graphics of some titles aren't
always available gameplay is quite
smooth with very few if any frame drops
are skipped we've only been able to
crash a game once and only by running it
immediately after another memory
intensive title otherwise it's been
smooth sailing and for respectable spans
- we've been able to consistently get a
full day's usage out of the phone and
even with heavy use including streaming
HD video over 3G for an hour we were
able to break eight hours before
powering down how about the phone well
two weeks of testing on a TTS HSPA
network in both New York City and
Greater Boston haven't turned up any
problems with reception and call quality
is terrific on both ends in earpiece and
loudspeaker modes we're not able to test
LTE performance as the one mini two
lacks the proper 4G bands for the u.s.
we expect that to change if and when the
One mini two makes it to American shores
the one mini two will launch in Europe
the Middle East Asia and North Asia in
June and HTC tells us it'll be available
for about 360 pounds that's
significantly cheaper than the 530
pounds three is asking for the One m8 at
full retail and the One mini two will
also obviously come in significantly
cheaper up front with a contract still
there's no getting around it if you
consider that the aforementioned Xperia
z1 compact is selling for about the same
price with a markedly better camera
faster hardware and waterproofing to
boot the One mini two certainly feels
overpriced
HTC just doesn't bring enough with this
smartphone to overcome that significant
imbalance but it is an aluminum cloud
smartphone with a super premium feel
fresh responsive Android build and
best-in-class
onboard audio HTC sought to bring the
One m8 experience to a midsize device
and in large part it's exceeded
if you're a person of specific tastes
and nothing else will do and you're
willing to splurge a little you're not
likely to be disappointed be sure to
check out our HTC One mini vs. HTC One
m8 video here on YouTube and our full
written review at pocket now linked in
the description below also don't miss
Adam lanes photo comparison between
samples from the One m8 and the 1 mini 2
if you want a closer look at how the
pictures between these devices vary
until next time this has been michael
fisher with PocketNow thank you for
watching and we'll see you on the next
one
