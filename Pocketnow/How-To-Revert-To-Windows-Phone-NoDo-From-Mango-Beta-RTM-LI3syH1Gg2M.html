from pocketnow.com windows for mango
brings a lot of features 500 plus
according to steve ballmer and many of
you have tried and succeeded in
installing windows for mango beta 1 or
beta 2 and then even the rtm released to
manufacturing build on top of it once it
was late now windows flamengo should be
out any time now and the robot process
should hit your device is really really
really soon but upon one condition you'd
have to be on the official track which
means your device has to run Windows
Phone no dough or the security update
after no dough which is build 73 92 in
this video we're going to show you how
to revert from mango to meadow and wait
for the official mango update to hit
your device so station
now if you go into zune go to phone
settings update a check for an update
and it returns the following message
your phone is up-to-date version 7.0
7720 now if this is something which you
are seeing on your computer don't panic
just close you there are really two ways
of reverting to node 0 the first one is
the easiest method remember that backup
we told you to keep in a safe place well
that's the backup the tool used to
install windows so mango created up your
phone and it was here on your c drive
and the pre mango state folder now the
tools which you have used required you
to run the updates that be 80 now
reverting to no dough is very easy you
just run restored up be 80 and the
restoration process is going to be a
one-click process now the second way of
reverting to node 0 and this is going to
be the one which we emphasize on
requires you to take the no lo updates
of your phone put it in the Windows
Phone update folder and you will be
restoring via zune so you go to your c
drive to your pre mango state folder
where your backup is presiding you just
copy the no todo backup folder and you
paste it in the following folder you go
to your C Drive go to your users folder
your username in my case it's anthony
nod you go to AppData you go to local
and scroll all the way to microsoft and
windows phone update it should be clean
but if it's not clean just paste it here
and in case you need to overwrite
anything over right but make sure you
keep a copy of what you are overriding
upon okay so we have the update copy to
the folder we'll just blanch
zune wait a second for it to connect to
the phone there you go go to phone once
again go to settings and go to update
and beside that message you should have
available a restore option and as you
can see our available restore point is
of July the second now in order to
restore you'll have to put this restore
button right here which we're going to
do right now so let's hit it restore the
previous version and you read understood
the above and you're ready to restore
your phone next and the restoration
process is on its way phone is shutting
down this is goodbye so to see you again
mango really soon and the phone should
be restarting in its update mode
let's see
yes it's in the update mode I'll just
place it here in the middle of the
screen so you can see it there are a
total of five steps now we are step
number three the restoration process as
you can see a driver has been installed
and we have our status progress
indicator on the top hook up back in in
a couple of minutes so five minutes
later and we are still kicking as we
approach the fifty percent mark all
right about now and we'll cut back once
again at the end of the process so here
we are 10 or so minutes after we started
the restoration process and we are
already at ninety-nine percent finishing
the process right about now and we'll
see what's coming up next it stays a
little bit longer on the ninety nine
percent mark
and we're done it's restarting the phone
step 4 out of 5 let's see that Yeah
right there it's restarting old Windows
Phone logos are circled around one mango
introduces the new one and we have an
error of not enough space but this I
think is in relation to the media which
we are trying to sync to the phone the
phone seems to be stable and restoration
successful we have to finish and let's
just confirm we have the proper build we
go to settings we go to about and as you
can see we have built 73 92 which was
the built we had before updating to
mango beta it's the security update for
node 0 matching Internet Explorer so
you've watched how to revert to no dough
from mango this was anthony night from
pocketnow.com stay on the official track
thank you very much for watching and if
you liked this video give us a thumbs up
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
