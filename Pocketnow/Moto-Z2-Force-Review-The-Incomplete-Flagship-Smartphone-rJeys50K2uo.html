which is just a bit more controversial
than all the rest this year would seem
motorola has inherited that honor the
comments on our z2 force videos have
been pretty divisive at the phone that
makes us question what we should expect
from a flagship is this a system you
should invest in here's our review of
the Moto z2 force starting off with
design holding the z2 is still
impressive it's a shockingly thin gadget
and there is a fun wow factor at play
when you hand it off to other people the
brushed rear panel nicely updated over
last year's phone but motos current
design language feels incomplete
function complements form the pins on
the rear encourage some kind of add-on
but no style mod is included in the box
the advertised Elan moto cyant is a
rebate for a projector mod which is not
exactly the kind of hardware we imagined
people using as their daily driver
instead a style mod is going to cost an
additional twenty dollars if you want to
hide those pogo pins a slap on back just
doesn't quite have the same charm as the
customized phones of Motorola's past the
internals have also raised a fair bit of
discussion chipset RAM in storage are
all par for the flagship course but
there have been some concerns over
battery capacity which we'll discuss
later in this review the force auto
lacking rated water resistance
durability has become a more important
talking point for consumers the
trade-off is the shatter shield screen a
flexible plastic instead of a brittle
glass the z2 should do a terrific job of
surviving drops which would crack other
displays what plastic is not good for
though is surviving daily lifestyle
abuse only a week of moderate activity
our review unit already showing fine
scratches and Nick's on the front face
you're always conscious of how you
handle this phone it's not really a big
deal for other devices anymore if they
end up in a pocket with keys every now
and then for the z2 force though that
could be a really bad day the AMOLED
panel behind that plastic is vibrant
contrast II and respectively viewable in
direct Sun many folks in our audience
will no doubt be happy to see that you
can tone down the candy color saturation
that and I do want to send a personal
thanks to the folks in our comments who
helped point me in the right direction
for the fingerprint sensor controls I'm
not a fan of Moto's out-of-the-box
implementation only acting as a second
power button below on-screen controls
I'm too programmed to use hardware like
this as a home button so switching to a
multi-function setup eased some of the
muscle confusion from using other phones
where several Hardware points might
generate debate moto software remains
terrific subtle enhancements to a
largely stock build of Android this is
becoming our preferred method for using
a smartphone moto has been on this track
for several years and it shows with a
wonderfully refined clean pixel like
user interface nearly all software
augmentation can be found through this
moto app or they're activated by a moto
mod this is beautifully tidy
significantly reducing the look of
manufacturer app bloat though I wish
that these options could also be found
in the main settings list users forced
to remember a specific setting is in a
different location that attention this
streamlining software delivers liquidly
smooth performance the force really is a
joy to use and daily interactions are
accomplished fantastically fast
alongside phones like the oneplus 5 are
you eleven there's very little which can
slow this puppy down and it's one of the
stronger performers for the games we use
to benchmark the phone's audio however
is something of a mixed bag and we have
a full separate review of the speaker
and headphone performance for a closer
look the z2 force delivers one of the
better mono speakers we've heard thanks
to pointing that speaker directly at
your face unfortunately this dongle for
headphone output is disappointing not
just for being inconvenient as a
proprietary solution but also producing
mediocre audio quality it's a shame moto
couldn't deliver some nicer earbuds or a
high-quality DAC moto mod as an
accessory what's impressive for the z2
force camera is how moto packs in a dual
sensor shooter the same housing is
previous zphones
there's no zoom gimmick here these two
sensors work in tandem on every photo
you take one color sensor one black and
white it's not as nicely refined as
Huawei's partnership with Leica but it
does serve to improve contrast and
clarity we've also published our real
camera
you for this phone for folks you really
want to see what the system is capable
of on the whole it's a competent camera
with excellent exposure but prone to
subtly over saturating shots especially
warmer colors software stabilization
smooths out video well until we get to
lower light conditions the phone can
make some interesting choices with your
framerate at night of course the
signature feature for several phone
cameras this year
artificial background blur this is a
first generation feature for Motorola
and it unfortunately shows the only
issue we had with a poor UI performance
depth of field mode turns your camera
viewfinder into a choppy slideshow
emoto's app for editing however it's a
lot of fun to use giving you control not
only over the blur effect but the
ability to easily create black-and-white
and color pop images based on that depth
information the slim frame delivers
concerns for runtime this is a smaller
battery capacity than we're used to for
a product in this price range but it's a
distinctly moto lenovo aesthetic to
deliver we all remember the razor right
well actually both razors now that I
think about it this company loves thin
and there's an idea that people who need
extended power options can shop specific
solutions for themselves you can't make
a phone thinner after you manufacture it
I was pleasantly surprised how well does
e2 Force handled our short media bench
reinforcing the idea that this phone on
its own can be a solution for consumers
who value brief interactions with their
tech but even on a light day I was
running on fumes after dinner we were
hoping to see speedier recharging thanks
to the smaller capacity but top off
numbers were simply good we've seen
phones with bigger batteries recharged
a larger percentage of that bigger
battery in the same amount of time
lastly the crown jewel feature of the
Moto Z line is the ability to slap on
moto mods this is the best
implementation of modular phone hardware
available to consumers we did not get a
comprehensive batch of mods - review
this year but one of the newer mods
including a 360 degree camera is a
compelling look at where this hardware
could go still we faced some difficulty
in addressing whether this system
delivers a significant benefit over
Bluetooth and USB peripherals
you're buying into a phone much like you
would invest in a nice camera ecosystem
there is a tangible consumer peace of
mind knowing that you're buying an
accessory with the best possible
compatibility for your phone whether
that's enough to justify additional
costs is a question only individual
customers can answer so let's wrap this
up where's that leave us with the Moto
z2 force I keep coming back to the word
incomplete out of the box we've got a
shockingly thin frame but exposed tech
guts and a battery many in our audience
will feel is inadequate we've got a
shatter resistant display that could
really benefit from a piece of glass
stuck on top
we've praised several phones this year
for including a complete experience in
the box by contrast this moto feels like
a platform to encourage value add on
accessory purchases still I can't write
this device off there's definitely an
audience for what the z2 force offers
the user experience is simply phenomenal
and even without a style mod this is a
brand which still resonates as hardware
for grownups and professionals with the
popularity of the Moto G for example
this could be a great upgrade path for
people seeking familiarity while
migrating to a more premium tier those
individuals will certainly want to
invest in a screen protector though as
