pocketnow.com and in this video we're
gonna show you probably one of the
coolest of windows mobile skins we've
ever seen it takes a while to set up but
once you do it's pretty darn cool and
when I turn on this device you're gonna
know immediately what it's skinned after
so let's do it and we'll zoom in a
little bit and you guessed it right it
looks like Windows 7 this uses wise bar
advanced desktop too plus a variety of
plugins to get the desired effect and it
operates very similarly to how it works
on a laptop or desktop so let's take a
look at kind of the features included
here so we tap the Start menu to get a
Windows 7 like Start menu we can go into
computer and get a list of all of the
drives that we have well sort of rom RAM
and anything left on the micro SD card
on your device and over here on the left
a lot of this isn't clickable but some
of it is let's see if we tap documents
we jump into My Documents and let's go
back to computer and some things don't
work such as music it just takes you
back to this area and there's some other
things you can click on here you can
obviously launch any of these programs
by tapping on them you can do a search
by tapping on the search area again this
is where it turns into some kind of a
program launcher if we tap on the
shutdown button we're taken into kind of
a lock screen which looks really cool
and to get back in you just tap on the
little right arrow and you get a fade in
let's see what else you can do you can
obviously click and drag the icons and
kind of rearrange things we can click on
control panel it's a link right to the
control panel some of these things down
here are very similar to how they look
in Windows 7 so we get a volume control
a volume slider which we move up and
down we can tap on this little button
here which is sort of your network
status and you can see the buttons in
the upper right corner are very
reminiscent of Windows 7 you can tap the
power button and we can't actually
change the power plan like you can in
Windows 7 but it kind of looks just like
it we can tap on the clock to get a
little pop-up like we would on Windows 7
and also this little up arrow actually
is a task manager that will let you
switch between various open applications
so overall a very very cool skin for
Windows Mobile death
more so for the advanced users there's a
lot of things you can change about this
to kind of customize it and make it work
the way that you want to set up takes a
while unless you're an events user so
again we're going to post instructions
on pocketnow.com on how to do this but
if you're not an advanced user you may
not want to give it a try or you may be
dealing with many hours of frustration
but a pretty cool way to use Windows
Mobile to have an interface that looks
like Windows 7 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
