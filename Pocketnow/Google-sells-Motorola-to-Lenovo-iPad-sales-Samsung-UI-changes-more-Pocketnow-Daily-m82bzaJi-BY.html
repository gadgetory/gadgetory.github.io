sold go to rolla mobility to lenovo
samsung seems to consider ditching
TouchWiz magazines ux under some google
pressure an apple is back to positive
ipad market share according to analyst
I'm hi Mary Mary and boy am I happy I
didn't buy that wouldn't Moto X in
bamboo this is pocket now daily let's
say off with some official news as the
IVC has just shared their estimates for
sales and tablets during the holiday
season and the ipad is up again and
actually this is significant because the
ipad has not been up in market share in
a long time they've been losing market
share every year because of the fact
that obviously cheap android tablets in
china make a better deal for a lot of
people but still they're up thirty-three
percent of the tablet market share they
own one third of the market worldwide
compared to 29.7 that they had on the
previous quarter and this is 15 points
up compared to the next tablet
competitor which is samsung so this is
great we just wonder of apple's going to
keep the streak of growing with no more
tablets for the rest of the year now
let's talk about LG is one of the highly
expected smartphones for mwc 2014 is the
LG G pro 2 and I know I almost got
confused with the name and especially
because of the fact that this phone
looks a lot like the g2 looks almost
identical the only difference is that
this phone is going to be bigger and
apparently it will bring a better
processor and a better everything so we
should be expecting for this G pro 2 to
make some big fan paradigm do you see
obviously we will be covering it live
stay tuned we are expecting for some
more leaks of the front but so far it
doesn't look good now let's not about
the samsung galaxy s5 in two very
interesting rumors first of all we get
the first league photograph of the
camera and apparently this is the 16
megapixel I so self shooter we're not
expecting the 20 megapixel shooter
anymore though obviously there could be
variations and a second that we get a
ton of model number leagues which is
interesting but the bad and odd part is
apparently Samsung is considering
sticking to 1080p displays for this
phone which is something we did not
expect we were waiting for 2k displays
they'll hey 1080p is not really bad
though but the odd news for Samsung have
not ended as apparently the only company
and the only group of people in the
world
don't really like samsung's new magazine
UX you know the one we saw at CES is
Google apparently google has been in
talks with Samsung asking them to please
change that you want to make it look
more like Android because it seems that
google wants to keep that even though
android was supposed to be a free
operating system and still apparently
samsung has invited apparently the
company will get rid of the magazine UX
and probably not bring it to the galaxy
s5 which is very bad news we actually
did like this you XO I mean cool come on
and finally for the very shocking news
of the day that was not the only odd
news about Google the company is just so
motorola mobility to lenovo for 3
billion dollars just for you to compare
they bought it for motorola for 13
billion dollars and they're selling it
for three the reason why is because
google will retain most of the patents
and then the hardware division will go
to lenovo sort of like what IBM did with
their laptop lineup to lenovo as well
and this is really shocking this is
extremely shocking i mean the moto x was
just gaining traction a lot of people
were falling in love with this phone and
now we don't know what to expect so that
leaves you to the question of the day
what do you feel about this the shocking
news it just happened right now you know
google selling motorola to lenovo in my
particular case i'll be honest with you
i am worried because even though i do
like the lenovo thinkpads that were
previously from IBM i do not like lenovo
smartphone lineup every time i've seen
it at CES so leave us a comment down
below do you think this is good or bad
because i don't think it's good and
friends you know the drill if he wanted
it was earlier before this video stoner
she follow was on pocket our comment
subscribe training channel as well he
also follow me on twitter Jaime
underscored iveta please give this video
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
hanging up it up thank you very much for
watching we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
