tablet you think it is when it was
announced a few months back it was
presented with its optional keyboard
connected and it was positioned more as
a convertible than anything else in fact
that's what the C stands for while the
hardware absolutely delivers the
software is still more smartphone than
tablet and the result is something of a
paradox I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow
and this is our video review of the
Google pixel C if you're someone who
puts hardware above all else
stop this review now and go order a
pixel see the design is classic and
refined minimalist without being dull
it's made almost entirely of aluminum
with precision cut ports for the
speakers power and volume keys and the
USB type-c port the tablet is completely
void of any traditional branding the
only nod to Google's paternity being the
single strip LED on the top edge of the
back panel which displays the company's
rainbow colors by default but also shows
battery life with a double tap on the
casing on the flip side the display is
large at ten point two inches but the
pixel sees seven millimeter profile
makes it feel like a much smaller tablet
the panel itself is LTPS and comes
packin over 300 pixels every inch making
for a very sharp picture if you want a
nitpick there's certainly room to do it
there's some color shifting on the
screen when viewing it off-center and
some might say the featureless backside
is a little too minimal but these are
very minor complaints and they're
certainly not shared by everyone in
terms of industrial design and fit and
finish this is one of the best tablets
you can find on Android maybe the best
that exceptional Hardware work is
mirrored in the pixel C's keyboard which
you can snap up for an extra 150 dollars
well that's no small amount of dough
it's actually a few bucks cheaper than
Apple and Microsoft charge for their
competing tablet accessories and the
pixel C's keyboard has them both beat
for sheer coolness why magnets
slap the pixel C onto the keyboard and
you've got yourself a notebook
replacement with a variable display
angle and the strength to hold together
no matter how you carry it
like most convertibles it will work in a
lap but it's much better on a table or a
desk and the typing experience is really
really good with an almost nineteen
millimeter key pitch and 1.4 millimeter
key travel there's not even much of a
learning curve if you're used to a wider
board we adapted from a MacBook Pro in
less than a day and Android supports
most of your favorite keyboard shortcuts
- whether it's copy paste bold italic
and underline or tab shuffling and Crump
the keyboard talks to the tablet via
bluetooth and transitioning between
physical and virtual keys is as simple
as separating the two or bringing them
back together
Google claim is battery life of up to
two months from the keyboards embedded
power cell but you'll probably never
have to put that to the test if the
keyboard automatically charges via
induction when you lock it in place so
what's the downside
well the keyboard lacks some toggles
we've gotten used to on other
convertibles like volume and track
skipping controls for media or a
brightness selector for the display also
as stiff and sturdy as the hinges it
can't keep the tablet from wobbling a
little when you have to touch the screen
as you often do because there's no
trackpad in sight and most damning of
all there's no backlight on this
keyboard if you want to type in the dark
on this $150 accessory you need to do it
in the reflected light from the display
the pixel see ships with Android
marshmallow an excellent smartphone
operating system but on a 10 inch
display optimized for landscape it
sometimes feels like it's over
stretching to cover the whole canvas
with interface elements often banished
to far-flung corners once you get used
to that and you start getting comfy with
the keyboard you might start to feel
like you've got a real productivity
beast on your hands after all that's how
Google is positioning the pixel see is a
new way to play and be productive on one
device to a limited extent it succeeds
you can work on a Google Doc for example
while listening to Spotify in the
background and taking the occasional
YouTube or Netflix break the problem
comes when you try and push the pixel
see any further for one thing the
perennial problem of some apps not being
optimized for tablets is still very much
alive and streaming music in the
background is about as
you can get to any kind of heavy
multitasking because there's no native
split-screen support you're forced to
hop into and out of your active apps any
time you want to leave the movie or
watching to answer a hangout set or flit
away from that long article you're
reading to check your Twitter feed yeah
you can use a third-party solution like
tiny apps to run some overlays but
that's a kludge solution and even
running stock there are occasional
stumbles once while juggling a couple
Hangouts with Chrome we must have run
out of RAM because Spotify closed itself
abruptly ending the song we were
listening to in the background that's
the very definition of working and
playing on the same device so we can
understand why the pixel C has taken
some heat but frankly we think it's
gotten a bit of a raw deal even the
vaunted
iPad has some of the same problems with
a lack of optimized tablet apps
Microsoft's surface pro line can do much
more than the pixels see sure but at a
significantly higher cost and when you
actually use the pixel C hold it in your
hands type on its keyboard you
understand why Google thinks it can get
the price it's asking here the pixel see
normally flies on its Tegra processor
the lag that was present on the early
review models has all but gone and the
Maxwell GPU handles games from asphalt 8
to Galaxy on fire to SimCity just fine
also the sound from the stereo speakers
is loud
if lacking in bass
but some games like arc Redux just don't
like to run on this hardware and other
games like sky gamblers air supremacy
have corrupted graphics these are the
exact same problems we ran into during
our time with the Nexus 9 so is this a
CPU problem a GPU software issue it's
tough to say there's not much to say
about the cameras the front-facing one
gets the job done for video calling and
periscopes and so on and you shouldn't
be using the rear-facing one to take
many pictures anyway so let's round out
the review with battery life in short
you shouldn't have a problem we put the
screws to the pixel see with a day of
heavy word processing in Google Docs
we're talking hours here - followed by
an hour of streaming podcasts at full
volume ending up with about two hours of
holiday shopping on Amazon and all that
was done with the keyboard attached even
with such heavy use it took us 13 hours
to hit the low battery warning at 15%
you'll want to charge it every night if
you're a power user but more moderate
users should easily be able to squeeze
two or even three days out of it so the
pixel see isn't what it looks like it's
not a surface competitor not really and
it doesn't pack the power to replace the
laptop for most people what it is and
let's just call it this it's the most
beautiful Android tablet you can get
right now with one of the best portable
keyboards yet and it's probably only
going to get better when the next
version of Android drops next year that
makes it a pretty solid product in our
eyes but one that doesn't quite earn its
price tag if you're a heavy Google user
looking to round out your Android
experience with an excellent tablet well
the pixel C is for you but if you're not
yet entirely sold on the idea of an
Android tablet to begin with this won't
do it
you'll want to wait until the price
comes down or Android n lands whichever
happens first
