is brought to you by XCOM global well
what do we have here huawei another
mid-range er option to play with fresh
from the press event at FIFA we have our
hands on the Huawei Nova plus a quick
first impressions from the hotel room
inside the box we of course get a phone
got to get this wrapper off under the
shelf there's a box which would normally
hold the papers I wouldn't read anyway a
European plug charger which will
actually come in handy on this Berlin
trip a nice looking pair of ear pods and
a USB cable for charging in file
transfers Huawei employs a couple
different design tricks for their
various phone lines instead of following
closely behind the p9 or Nexus 6p
the style of this phone more closely
resembles phones like the GX 8 it's a
softer look rounded sides with these
cutouts that likely improve radio
reception this being the larger of the
two nova phones announced we've got a
5.5 inch 1080p LCD powered by a Qualcomm
6 to 5 chipset and three gigabytes of
RAM with 32 gigabytes of storage space
the unlocked international version will
have this handy double sim and micro SD
card tray a 16 megapixel rear camera
with optical image stabilization and the
Nova reports a three thousand three
hundred and forty milliamp hour battery
we've got the rear mounted fingerprint
sensor the bottom speaker though there
are a pair of vents only one broadcast
audio USB type-c and of course these
pretty chamfered edges after getting the
phone set up you will be greeted by emui
Huawei's custom skin which eliminates
the app drawer and changes home screens
and notification shade to more resemble
iOS in a happy bit of kismet I'll likely
be installing Nova Launcher on this Nova
plus it's an attractive device which
certainly looks the part of a premium
handset but style doesn't necessarily
always come cheap in Huawei is
positioning this handset above options
like the oneplus three acts on 7 on or 8
and Alcatel idol 4s pricing it at 420
999 euro
this is hyper competitive territory will
certainly be digging into this phone to
see if it can live up to that price tag
at least we can show immediately that
for folks worried about performance this
Qualcomm 65 does support UHD video
capture
how does a fun perform how does it stack
up against other mid-range er solutions
is this camera legit all questions which
will be answered in future reviews and
comparisons instead of paying terrible
roaming fees when travelling abroad or
the hassle of buying another SIM card
why not try a smarter solution XCOM
global gives you unlimited internet
connectivity through a Wi-Fi hotspot
rental for just seven dollars and 77
cents a day simply follow the link in
the description below this video and
order your hotspot before you depart
XCOM global sends of the device and
includes a return envelope with shipping
fees included and if you use promo code
pocket now you can cut $10 off your
first XCOM global order as always thanks
