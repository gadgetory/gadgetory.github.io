company dubs as an icon reborn but even
though it builds on the success of the
key one it seems that the rebirth is
really of another Bulger icon from the
past reporting from New York City I'm
high memory that I would Jules wrong on
camera and let's go hands on the
BlackBerry key to the BlackBerry key to
retains many of the fundamentals of the
key one like the fact that it's not
joining the race of uniformity with
competing Android phones instead the
famous form factor that we praised last
year makes a return reminding us that
its primary focus is to be a
communicator now you'd have to hold the
key to to understand just how different
it is to last year's model at launch we
have two color options silver and black
with the silver one being my favorite
it's a tougher build that actually is
far slimmer and sleeker we have the same
stipple back but a box here a little bit
unfinished surrounding it and also
rounder buttons on the side call it more
of a refined product if you may one of
my favorite improvements is the keyboard
I like the key one but the keys felt
mushy to me making the learning curve
steep the key to keyboard is now matte
with key presses feeling more flexible
it almost feels like the icon reborn is
the bold 9900 as this keyboard almost
feels like a throwback to one of my
favorite phones of all time the spacebar
continues to be the fingerprint scanner
thankfully just your support makes a
return for navigation you can still map
shortcuts to all the keys for added
convenience and there's even a new speed
key that allows you to jump into these
shortcuts without needing to leave the
app you're on sparing you the need to go
to the homescreen above the keyboard we
have a 4.5 inch IPS LCD at 1620 by 1080
and protected by Gorilla Glass 3
the navigation keys are now only visible
if you interact with a phone which I
actually like we have new dual cameras
at the back both 12 megapixel one being
your standard wide RGB with 1.2 8
microns on the sensor and F 1.8 aperture
and the other telephoto at F 2.6
aperture and standard size microns the
front-facing camera is of 8 megapixels
for selfies as well its internals are
based on the more power-efficient
welcome snapdragon 616 processor 6
gigabytes of ram options for 64 or 128
gigs of expandable storage a whopping 30
500 milliamp hour battery that supports
Qualcomm quick charge 3 and there's even
machine learning features that help this
phone last even longer running the show
we have Android 8.1 under blackberries
minimalistic user interface all focused
on security favorite elements like
swiping up on icons for widgets is here
along with the blackberry hub etc DTEC
receives a major upgrade with a more
intuitive user interface and a bird's
eye view of what permissions you've
granted to which applications will now
flag of your camera or a microphone or
being used through a notification and
even if the application is in the
foreground or background following on
the steps of the BlackBerry motion there
is also a locker function that allows
you to store anything you want
separately and you can choose if you
want these applications to be fully
hidden or if you want to launch them
from the home screen and ask for your
fingerprint authentication a company
even bundles the Firefox focus browser
for those of you that want even more
security for navigation so yes this is
the BlackBerry key - my first
impressions are that this is definitely
a bold upgrade to one of our favorite
phones of last year but to learn if it's
right for you stay tuned as our full
review will be coming in the next few
weeks while you're at it make sure you
