through its paces over the last week
it's been compared with some of the most
notable devices from 2012 now it's time
to look at the Sony Xperia Z under the
microscope by itself I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow
and this is our full review of the Sony
Xperia Z when you take the Xperia Z out
of the box for the first time you're
gonna stop and think wow that is a
beautiful device but the problem is that
the hardware is conflicted its ip55 and
ip57 ratings for dust proofing and
waterproofing suggest a durable device
but it's made almost entirely of glass
thanks to a combination of dragon trail
on the front and Gorilla Glass on the
back it's relatively scratch resistant
but it's not as Hardy as plastic or
metal and in one small slip could result
in a nasty shattered device durability
concerns aside the Xperia Z is one of
the most well built devices in recent
memory the matte finish plastic around
the edges of the device offers just
enough grip to assure a firm grip and
the glossy metallic trim gives it the
level of finish only a true premium
device offers it feels great in the hand
but the flat back and hard edges don't
make for a comfortable grip and the
unusual placement of the standby and
volume Keys makes it a bit unwieldy in
addition to the 5-inch 1080p display the
Xperia Z packs a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon s4 pro chipset 2 gigabytes of
RAM 16 gigabytes of built-in storage
with a micro SD card slot expandable up
to 32 gigabytes a 2330 million power
battery and a 13.1 megapixel camera
around back it also has a front-facing
shooter at 2.2 megapixels and all of
your standard connectivity NFC Bluetooth
Wi-Fi b/g/n etc the display is another
point of conversation as it is a very
vibrant panel thanks to the Sony Mobile
BRAVIA Engine 2 colors are vivid and the
1080p resolution means everything is
exceptionally crisp but the display
lacks proper contrast blacks look more
like a dark gray than an inky black and
narrow viewing angles make for an even
more milky appearance watching out all
colors at almost anything but a straight
on view all in all if it weren't for the
visually disruptive chrome power button
in the middle of
the Xperia Z would be a contender for
the most sleek and well-designed device
of the year at first sight the software
on the Xperia Z is a bit underwhelming
there's nothing truly intriguing or
inspiring about how it looks and there's
nothing that truly grabs your attention
and makes you say hey I really want to
see what that's all about
compared to older versions of Sony's
Android skins the software on the Xperia
Z is surprisingly lightweight aside from
a few customizations the software is
very stock like from the Settings app to
the way you access Google now sony was
sure to keep the best parts of stock
Android intact the most predominant
customizations are found in the camera
application which includes a long list
of user configurable settings filters
and a superior auto mode another unique
software feature which takes full
advantage of the generous display size
is found by pressing at the task
switcher button there you will find five
mini applications or more if you take
the time to download them from the Play
Store these applications are
free-floating caps that hover over your
current application and can be moved
around or closed without ever leaving
the app their utility though is quite
limited
fortunately for those who don't like
blow where most of the non-standard
applications on the Xperia Z can be
removed in all the Xperia Z software
build was a pleasure to use it retains
most of the best features of stock
Android while offering users several
customization features out of the box
without being overbearing our sad story
with the Xperia Z began when we started
testing it there are actually two models
in the market so before you buy it make
sure your unit supports the bands in
your area our Xperia Z review unit only
supported UMTS bands one five and eight
bands not supported by AT&amp;amp;T in our
testing area that means we were stuck on
edge for the entire review period this
obviously affects both data speeds and
battery life so keep that in mind your
personal mileage will probably vary call
quality with the earpiece speaker was
just loud enough to hear in a moderately
noisy environment though the audio was
slightly muffled colors didn't have any
trouble hearing us in a noisy coffee
shop or outside in breezy weather the
speakerphone performance though was
disappointing even at full volume
it was barely loud enough to hear the
person on the other end of the line and
voices came through sounding muffled and
robotic
user interface performance was
disappointing at times as well there is
a noticeable ramp up period we're
lagging some stuttering is present on
the home screen quickly scrolling and
even switching between applications even
with full support of project butter with
its modified build of jellybean 4.1.2
and despite its very high scores on
synthetic benchmarks the software
doesn't seem to be making the best use
of its power under the hood at least in
basic usage that power and the bright
vibrant display seem to come at the
expense of stamina we managed to average
around 20 hours before needing to plug
in that doesn't sound bad but that
figure includes only an hour or two an
hour and a half of screen on time and
remember that's on edge paltry at best
considering the 23 70 milliamp hour
battery the thirteen point one megapixel
camera is one of the more notable
aspects of the Xperia Z's list of
high-end specs testing alongside the
Nexus 4 Galaxy s3 and the iPhone 5 only
lent credence to that as its shots came
out more accurate and detailed than the
former two devices and proved to be a
near spot-on contender with the iPhone 5
autofocus locked on quickly although the
focus misfired occasionally in some
edges err on the side of too soft but
color reproduction contrast and a bevy
of features and manual adjustments more
than make up for the occasional stumbles
HDR video mode also manages to bring a
more balanced output to videos in scenes
with tricky lighting all-in-all the
Xperia Z is one of the most well built
smartphones in recent years its build
quality and design are mostly flawless
and the device feels substantial in the
hand only the low contrast display
non-economic button placement periodical
stutters and poor stem that keep this
device from being one of the best
choices on the market if you're looking
for a larger device with raw power and
great battery life this is probably not
the phone for you but if you want a
smartphone that offers great video
playback a solid gaming experience and
very good camera performance in a pretty
package the Xperia Z will be among your
top choices so long as you're open to
keeping a spare charger around we give
the Xperia Z and 8.5 out of 10
