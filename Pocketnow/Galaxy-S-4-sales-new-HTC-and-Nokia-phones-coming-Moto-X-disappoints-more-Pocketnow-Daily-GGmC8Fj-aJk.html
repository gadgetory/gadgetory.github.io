s4 this period carrier leaks point to
new no get HTC phones coming soon and
the Moto X custom options get explained
then you're not going to like them I'm
hi meri beta and think of the Moto X as
the new male barbie where you're going
to be able to dress it up and just about
everything this is pocket now daily
let's start stay off with the expected
news is even though the galaxy s4 hasn't
really sold as much as the galaxy s3
that doesn't mean they're not selling in
millions that's 20 million to be exact
for the period obviously Sam sexy EO
will come on record with a press release
and all the official statements coming
soon but still raise your hand in the
comments how many of you got a galaxy s4
so more leaks of LG's new flagship of
emergent apparently it won't be called
the optimus g2 just the g2 and it seems
that among the enhancements well we saw
the back buttons you know those volume
rockers were at the back apparently
every button will be at the back and
it's hearts and a wine could it be that
this phone is gonna be so thin that the
buttons don't fit anywhere but on the
back hmm stay tuned we'll see now Oh to
Germany has now leaked the full list of
phones that are coming in the roadmap
and we are getting the Nokia EOS that
hasn't been announced and also a milky
of Mars that's making some headlines
here not sure what that project is about
but aside from that we've also got some
HTC phones the HTC One mini and the HTC
One max yeah i know is about to say maxi
but still you know links down below for
the full list it's kind of interesting
to see what we will be getting in the
next couple of months and speaking of
the HTC one mini we've got a full
gallery of photos of this phone that's
coming up being compared to the HTC One
and as you'll notice well the buttons
are a little bit different but other
than that the phone looks exactly like
an HTC One only smaller but you'll
notice in the photos that it's not
really in that much smaller so it makes
to wonder if you guys are going to
prefer the smaller version or the normal
version if they're not really going to
be very different except for the specs
and finally for the sad and
disappointing news of the day well
Motorola has kind of explained what to
expect with these customizations that
were going to get in the Moto X and even
though we were expecting tailors
fine as they were kind of saying in
their banner ads well it turns out that
you'll be able to choose from a dozen
colors you'll be able to engrave your
name on the phone as if that's going to
make your resale value any better and
you're also going to be able to send
them your wallpaper so they could send
you the phone with the wallpaper as if
you were lazy enough to not do that
yourself when you pick the phone out of
the box it's extremely disappointing for
Motorola to be you know marketing
something that's not really
revolutionary unless you tell me
otherwise that leads me to the question
of the day I mean do you believe that
any of these Wow features really wow you
because honestly oh man the Moto X is
going to be a flop on my book but leave
us a comment down below what do you
think about these things of course it's
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and talk rubbish you follow
us on fire get out calm subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well you'll also
