showing us its unique approach to
laptops and convertibles last year at
CES we were left desiring the windows
variant for the Samsung Chromebook pro
and let's just say it's finally here I'm
Jaime Mendeleev a tie with pocket now
with Jules Wang reporting from CES 2018
in Las Vegas and let's dive in now
before we go through the latest and
greatest Samsung also gave us a glimpse
at its product refresh for the lineup
let's start with a note put 7 spin that
follows on its name and its ability to
have its display spin into tenth mode
and even give you the option to be used
as a tablet when you need to it features
a 13 inch touch display and all the i/o
you can ask for which goes up to the
fact of including USB 3 HDMI and yes
there is a fingerprint scanner on the
side that reminds us of what the galaxy
flagship Sprott in the past spec wise
we're talking about options that include
a gigabytes of RAM and the processor can
range from an Intel Core i7 or i-5 now
the notebook 9 Series is a different
animal we're talking about two laptops
in the lineup with a ton of power you
have a choice between a 13 and a 15 inch
diagonal display that's also touch
sensitive now both have the same i/o at
least an appearance but the 15 inch
model includes Thunderbolt 3 support on
the USBC connector while the 13-inch
model only offers us be ergonomic here
are huge with the display being able to
fully arrest flat on the surface there's
also a fingerprint scanner on the
keyboard for convenience a gigabytes of
RAM and a core i7 processor come
standard on both where the larger
variant shines is with the option of a
16 gigabyte of RAM model that includes
an nvidia geforce MX 150 graphics card
and then there is the star of the show
which is this 13 inch notebook 9 pen it
looks a lot like the others even up to
the magnesium alloy on its finish but
the treat here is in the rest of its
capabilities the internals are very
similar but windows hello here has the
addition of an iris scanner something
that's hard to find on notebooks and
then the cherry topper is the fact that
it includes an S Pen and I'm not just
talking about your standard stylus this
is truly an S Pen up to the fact that it
looks identical to the one included on
the Galaxy Note 8 but the only
difference here is the latch to pull it
out
and then most important to be pull out
the stylus we have the same pop-up many
of the know date and the same
applications of the know date that
support the stylus in addition to also
having it support Windows ink capable
applications and yes that's because all
these computers run Windows 10 and we
should have a solid price and launch
date in the next coming week so stay
tuned while that happens make sure you
