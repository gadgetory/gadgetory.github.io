excel have just emerged this time with a
complete hands-on oh yeah for those of
you that haven't gone the galaxy note
nine yet Samsung is now giving you two
more color options and the iPhone 10 R
has been approved by the FCC so now we
just need it in stores I'm Jaime medley
that and for those of you asking where
am i these are actually the XDA offices
and also our offices now this is parking
out daily the official news today begin
with some shady practices from Spotify
the company I actually received an email
recently with a survey and it asked me
of the people in my family plan we're
living in the same house because
apparently the company is wanting to
implement something where it notices the
GPS tag of where the people in your
family plan are and if you don't live in
the same house it will deactivate the
family plan now we're not sure if it's
going to execute this at some point or
not but buyers beware as this is
definitely gonna hurt Spotify if they
pull it off now and some semi official
news because that's what I like to call
Evan blast leaks you know he's famous
and he's a great tipster he's pretty
much showing us the design of the razor
phone too and I mean he might as well
just got an image of the razor phone one
because it's pretty much the same design
we're not exactly sure what the
enhancements are but given the fact that
there's so much hardware around that
chassis I hope that they pull off the
internals that we were missing on the
first razor phone this will the
spotlight over to the iPhone 10 are and
I fumbled like three times trying to
remember it's not XR which is the most
horrible name ever for those of you
looking for it October 19th is the
launch date it just got approved by the
FCC so obviously we just have to wait
for it to get the stores you get it for
the moderate to cheap price of 750
dollars the sarcasm was high on that one
I was one of the spotlight over to the
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 as for those of
you complaining about not being able to
get silver for years it is now finally
available in the United States as a Best
Buy exclusive as of October 12th and
then you also get the option for the
midnight black which is the version that
pretty much everybody had of the Galaxy
Note 8 I'm still enjoying the blue
variant that I have but I definitely
feel that the midnight
would probably be the best color option
for this phone so long as you have like
a chamois to keep it clean all the time
you know what I mean and finally the
hottest news today has to do with the
Google pixel 3xl you know finally what I
was expecting just happen I mean if they
stole a shipment in Russia and a lot of
people bought it for $2,000 where are
the videos now we have a full hands-on
video of the phone it does not look fake
at all and I get the point of why the
knotch looks like the size of Long
Island they're trying to somehow make it
symmetrical with the bezel at the bottom
with the speaker even if the size of the
speaker grille is not the same and I
feel that just the whole approach is
completely ridiculous but then again
have a look at the video let us know
what you think in the comments do you
like this as the final design of a pixel
3 Excel or not because in my case you
know I need pixels like I travel so much
I rely on project 5 this is the way to
go but my god this is probably the worst
design of 2018 and that gives me an idea
for a video leave a comment down below
let us know what you think but before
you do that it's Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and I'm here to
remind you about though weekly now on
this week's show we are talking about
whether or not you get more or less with
the iPhone 10s given that you're going
to generally spend more and I know what
that's like because I'm using the 10s
Mac's right now and then we talked about
how Facebook's recent meltdowns might
mean some drastic changes and news for
whatsapp and Instagram so join me in the
crew on the weekly on wherever you get
your podcasts friends again if you want
to get the news earlier photos I'm
talking our kind of subscribe to both of
our channels English and Spanish for
more videos like this one you can follow
me on Twitter Jaime underscore get on
Instagram behind madly data please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I'm Jaime metairie but I think
so much for watching we'll see you next
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
