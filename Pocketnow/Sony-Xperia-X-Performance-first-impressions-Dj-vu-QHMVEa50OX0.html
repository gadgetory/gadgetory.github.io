this year the xperia x left us feeling a
bit underwhelmed we genuinely enjoy it
when companies focus on a back-to-basics
year sony walked away from what the
xperia z represented and is claiming to
focus on the features which really
matter to consumers but we're still apt
to pay a premium for that Sony branding
of course before we can really review
this phone we have to get it out of the
box this simple packaging holds what you
would expect it to the xperia x
performance crece up front we get a
charger a cable and those papers will
never ever ever read like the regular
xperia x it's an attractive handset
clean angular lines a monolith style
design straight out of 2001 a Space
Odyssey and this brushed exterior looks
great in the hand there's just nothing
separating this from it's less expensive
stablemate and we wouldn't blame anyone
for confusing them out in the wild most
of these specs look familiar to a 5 inch
LCD with a 1080p resolution 3 gigabytes
of RAM and 32 gigabytes of storage a 23
megapixel rear camera front-facing
speakers and a microUSB port though we
do move up from a two thousand six
hundred and 20 milliamp hour battery to
a 2700 milliamp hour battery so that's
an improvement and we will be reviewing
the international version of the xperia
so our review phone does have a
fingerprint sensor built into the power
button an option which will be removed
from xperia sold in north america first
boot is respectively quick though the
setup process does have a few additional
Sony hoops to jump through and the Wi-Fi
scanning was one of the slowest we've
seen during an initial setup there are
some helpful menus and an introduction
widget to get people up and running
quickly and we get about the same
collection of pre-installed bloatware we
found on the regular xperia x now sony
skin influences almost every aspect of
the android UI but overall navigation is
still stock adjacent no one's going to
be shocked pulling down the notification
shade switching apps in the
multi-tasking menu or scanning through
settings early impressions this phone is
a solid performer and it's a great form
factor for using a phone one-handed it's
got a well-balanced bit
heft to it which feels nice and adds to
that premium appearance we love having a
dedicated camera button but this volume
rocker still doesn't make much sense
with how low it's mounted it's early on
we just got this phone out of the box
but we're already having difficulty
sorting out our feelings on this phone
we held off on some of our sony coverage
waiting for this specific xperia for
example delaying our real camera review
so we could use sony stop offering for
this year we knew it would be similar to
the xperia x but we were hoping to see a
few more differences and that's probably
where we should wrap up for this first
look we need to spend a little time
playing with this phone determine if
it's more than just a processor upgrade
and we'll report back how does it
perform as a gaming machine our speaker
playback and headphone quality improved
does this version of the xperia still
throttle the camera after nine minutes
of video so many questions to answer and
the ex performance faces some intense
competition from recently review phones
like the one plus three the Moto Z and
this axon 7 which just got dropped off
in our hot little hands we'll have
plenty to report soon as always thanks

sony xperia x performance coverage and
