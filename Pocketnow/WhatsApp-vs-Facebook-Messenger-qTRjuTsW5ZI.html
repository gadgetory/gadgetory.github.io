completes the company will have to
instant messaging services at its
disposal which of the two is better
which client should you be using I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is whatsapp versus Facebook messenger
chances are if you have a smartphone
you've dabbled in one of the dozens of
popular instant messaging clients kik
WeChat bbm Google Hangouts apples
iMessage Facebook Messenger
what's up etc in February Facebook
caught the tech world by surprise and
purchased whatsapp for a staggering
nineteen billion dollars in total but
Facebook already has its own inbuilt
instant messaging system Facebook
Messenger and it already acquired a
group messaging service Beluga in 2011
still why it wanted whatsapp is
blatantly clear world domination
at least by a social means the question
now is which of Facebook's instant
messaging clients is better what to each
have to offer and which of the two
should you be using Facebook Messenger
is the client many of us here in the
States are more familiar with Facebook
being the incredibly popular service it
is gives us a dozen reasons why we
should use it over practically
everything else but it isn't perfect
what's F is incredibly popular in the
eastern world and doesn't have nearly
the same sort of user base stateside so
first and foremost it's important to
realize which is more popular in your
region of the world and which service
all of your friends are to use it's a
lot easier to use what everyone else is
using rather than trying to convince all
your friends to use some client they've
never heard of admittedly prior to doing
some research before making this video I
was not a user of whatsapp I had avoided
it for its antiquated interface and
because so few of my friends or users
once you dig past the surface however
whatsapp begins to shine set up as a
breeze open the app for the first time
enter your own telephone number and let
it take care of the rest it will send a
text to your phone and automatically
confirm your number into your name as
you want it to appear and you're done
other whatsapp users are automatically
populated from your existing contacts
lists meaning all of your friends who
are currently using whatsapp will
automatically appear in your list of
friends provided you have their mobile
number this is where we sort of have a
problem with whatsapp however you cannot
simply start a chat with someone if you
know their number you only
way to begin a chat with someone is to
add a number to your phone as a contact
in your address book it's a minor gripe
but a gripe and the less once you begin
a chat it's business as usual messages
are sent immediately you get symptom
read receipts and you can send media
we'll get into the inner workings of
whatsapp in a second Facebook Messenger
provided you're already a Facebook user
is also quite simple to setup you can
use Facebook Messenger in two ways
either through a Facebook app or through
the dedicated application if you're
logged in to the official Facebook app
logging into Facebook Messenger is as
simple as confirming you want to
continue with the same account you're
immediately taken to your inbox where
all your previous conversations are
aggregated you can compose a new message
with practically anyone on Facebook by
hitting the compose button at the bottom
of the screen
of course friends are suggested first
but scrolling down the list will reveal
other people who fit the query again
once you're in a chat it's quite the
same messages are sent and received
immediately and you're given sent and
received receipts as well
visually facebook Messenger and whatsapp
are a good bit different Facebook
Messenger was recently given a visual
overhaul and it looks surprisingly nice
and simple a white background a Facebook
blue bubble for sent messages and a
light gray bubble for received messages
whatsapp isn't hideous but it definitely
looks like it's stuck in the late 2010
era of UI design it's over developed and
packed with frivolous features like
wallpapers they're nice for customizing
the experience if that's your sort of
thing but the Android app at the very
least is in need of a slight facelift
the iOS app recently received one and
looks notably better the other major
difference in user experience is chat
heads when you receive a new message in
whatsapp you must stop what you're doing
and open the app to fully read and
respond to the message no big deal
that's usually the case with almost any
app but last year Facebook introduced
chat heads on Android when you receive a
new message a circular icon will pop up
above the current app you're in tap the
icon and the chat will expand atop the
current app tap the head again and it
minimizes if you no longer need the
floating chat head flick it towards the
bottom of the screen and it will close
you can disable the chat heads feature
in settings what's HAP on the other hand
has a laundry list of utterly useful and
awesome chat features you can attach
pictures videos
eclipse location pins contacts and a
boatload of emoji to your messages the
maximum file size is around 12 megabytes
and whatsapp will automaticaly compress
files sent at the expense of quality
inside Facebook messenger you can also
attach images in emoji no video and
within whatsapp and Facebook Messenger
you can record short audio cuts for a
bit by bit voice conversation or sort of
integrated voice mail whatsapp voice
messages were of notably better quality
Facebook messenger also comes with
support for stickers additional packs
can be downloaded if you so desire one
of the neatest features of whatsapp is
the ability to email entire
conversations for safekeeping however
there is no cross device support since
your whatsapp account isn't tied to an
identity but rather a number so for
someone like me who carries two
smartphones every day conversations are
not synced across devices in fact as far
as whatsapp is concerned I'm effectively
using two separate whatsapp accounts
with facebook Messenger you can't email
yourself a log of your conversations
outside manually copying and pasting
them into an email but you do have
cross-device sync and access from the
web which is a huge feature for someone
who spends a lot of time behind a
computer finally support what's app
supports blackberry Android iOS Windows
Phone and Symbian Facebook Messenger is
available on android iOS and Windows
Phone as well as some feature phones for
any basic users neither of these will
likely be better than the other the
feature sets are very similar but the
concepts differ quite a bit it will boil
down to what your friends use and your
region
facebook Messenger is an instant
messaging service tied to a social
account meaning it requires a Facebook
account to be able to use it
whatsapp on the other hand is standalone
and comes with no baggage if you have a
working mobile number whatsapp will give
you no hassle however it's important to
note the first year of weds up is free
after the first year it's 99 cents per
year Facebook is entirely free
if you need cross-device sync Facebook
Messenger is the only option however if
you need to save old conversations
what's up is probably the better choice
personally I'll be sticking with
Facebook messenger since I have hundreds
of friends who use it and only a handful
of friends who have ever tried whatsapp
