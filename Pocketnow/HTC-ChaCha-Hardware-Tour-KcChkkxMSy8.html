from pocketnow.com today we're going to
take a look at the hardware on the HTC
ChaCha
which is a Facebook phone together with
the HTC Salsa HTC launched the to
Facebook phones or so-called Facebook
phones with the occasion of this year's
Mobile World Congress and what's really
interesting about it is that when HTC
launched these two smart phones and
we're talking about the HTC ChaCha
in particular here they launched it with
a 600 megahertz processor but the
smartphone itself is shipping with an
800 megahertz processor so along the way
HTC boosted up the frequencies to make
sure it can cope with the Android 2.3
Gingerbread and all the applications
running so let's take a look at the
hardware on the HTC ChaCha
so here we are with the HTC ChaCha for
which we thank our friends from globe
that code that's UK for supplying us
with the rhenium unit and we'll take a
look right at the start and the battery
which is one of twelve hundred and
fifteen million powers which which is
good for a smartphone with such a small
display it comes pre-installed with a
two gigabyte sandisk micro SD card which
goes right in there and unfortunately it
is not hot swappable because the battery
locks it in and this is the place where
you would slide in your SIM card let's
put the battery back as well as the my
recovered which slides into place like
this and let's take a look at the device
itself it's got a two point six inch
hvga screen which means half VGA is 480
across by 320 down and at the top it's
got a speaker grille on the right of
which right here you will have an LED
for notification which will glow in
amber when you are charging or green
when you have a notification active that
your smartphone once until you receive
something on the left side here you got
your proximity and ambient light sensors
which are responsible for shutting up
shutting down the display or turning
down the backlight right below the
screen you've got four capacitive
Android buttons we've got one for home
menu back and search you've got two
dedicated buttons for call start and
Cohen and at the bottom you've got a
four row full QWERTY keyboard and on the
button right side you have your four
dedicated directional keys now I'm not
sure you can see what the keys
themselves are rounded and they have a
nice rubber ish feel to them with a
pretty decent feedback and texture to it
so it's quite comfortable to type on it
it kind of reminds you of the
HTC snap or the - from the good old days
and this little fella here is the
Facebook button we'll talk about it more
in our software in you on the left side
it's got a volume rocker for volume up
and volume down plus the microUSB
charging and syncing work there's as you
can see absolutely nothing on the right
side at the bottom you've got your
microphone hole this one has got three
microphones one is at the bottom which
will capture your voice one is at the
top for noise cancelling so it will
subtract from the total sounds sounds
which are captured by this microphone
and only believe sounds captured by this
you got a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
plus a power button and at the back
you've got a five megapixel camera which
unfortunately doesn't even record 720p
videos that only records in 480 plus an
LED flash an additional microphone for
capturing video and you've got the
speaker grille right here this part
right here is metal the rest is plastic
but it gives it a nice unibody feel and
at the very bottom you have a hole which
you can use for a lanyard or some other
accessory now the the smartphone itself
is pretty lightweight it feels very good
in hand and it's rather thin and as a
comparison we'll bring out the iPhone we
always use the iPhone because it's a
very popular smartphone you can see that
they are approximately of the same Samus
and you can see of course how small the
2.6 inch diagonal screen is even
compared to the small 3.5 inch diagonal
screen on the iPhone and in terms of
thickness well it's a little bit
deceiving because the HTC ChaCha has
this arched shape for when you are
typing if you actually bring up a little
bit the display closer to your face so
that you can
like more comfortably but if you take
any other fixed spot you will see that
it's just a little bit thicker than than
the iPhone this was an Cindy not taking
a quick look at the hardware on the HTC
ChaCha
following will be our software tour and
our full review of the HTC ChaCha here
on pocketnow.com thank you very much for
watching and if you enjoyed the video
give us a thumbs up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
