Park geun-hye calm and today I'm gonna
show you a new version of face contact
and what this program is going to Lau
you to do is actually scroll from your
contacts directly from your today of the
screen so we can just scroll over and
see our contacts so we've got a few
familiar faces on here but as you can
see I don't have too many contacts in
here right now so let's just add a
couple so I'm just going to go into the
face contact settings so if I wanted to
add a contact I just click on add
contact and I'm just going to add my
calling card right here and that will
show the icon with a picture right here
so it's pretty simple and you can just
flick through each one of your contacts
so if I want to get specific settings on
one of my contacts I one right here it's
just a fake person I can go into I can
see contact details and I can see the
list of phone numbers as well as the
address and email so that's pretty nice
you can also add notes so if I want to
add a couple of notes onto the contact
information I can do that as well I can
also sort my contacts so if we want to
change it to just first names only I can
do that so if i want to say show first
names it will align my context by their
first names only and to remove a contact
is pretty simple as well you just click
remove contact and it will remove it so
i can also go into my contacts folder
directly from the directly from the face
contact program so here is a list of my
contacts and i can just scroll through
them so from the today screen it's
actually pretty simple to dial phone
number we have John highlighted right
here and it's his mobile number so all I
have to do is hit the talk key and it
will start dialing number so I'll just
end that so from the today screen it's
actually pretty easy to call this person
if I want actually call him directly to
his mobile number i just hit the top key
and it will start dialing we'll just end
this there's a few more features if i
want to do a single tap it'll load a
list of phone numbers as well as email i
can send a text message
and get settings on this contact a
double tap on to the contacts name will
load an email program so you can send an
email directly this contact a tap and
hold will load an SMS message so i can
send text message directly to my contact
so they go back into the program i'm
going to load some settings here so if i
wanted to adjust the picture of this
contact i can do that so if we want the
picture more to the side i can select or
more to the center i can always select
one of those things I just click done
here you can also go in to replace
picture stuff want to replace it from a
file from the gallery or take a new
picture on the camera on your windows
mobile device you can do that as well
can also remove the picture to customize
the contact you can just go into it you
can see full screen width with plug-in
icon so if I want to select that it'll
show the full screen width of the
contacts picture so I'll just deselect
that because I like it the way it is and
also show the phone tag and caption so
as you can see it says mobile and little
em right here for mobile so that's it
that's pretty neat feature so that you
know which phone of your account and for
these other features down here draw
solid background and use bold font I
have the bold font selected right here
this is only implicated when the plugin
is active or inactive so if i go to my
picture settings i can change the shape
of my picture so i can have a circle a
cylinder a diamond a gear rounded which
just changes the edges to a rounded
points or a square which is the default
and I can also change Lee picture size
of the one of the pictures larger I can
do that I can add a reflection so as you
can see on the bottom of the pictures i
can add a reflection or delete that
reflection so it's kind of like a touch
flo 3d sort of image i also change the
transparency so if i wanted them to be
more transparent i can do that as well
so as you can see it becomes more unless
transparent you can also change the
motion settings so if we wanted the
scroll range to be increased i can do
that and change the scroll speed I like
it the way it is right now so I'm just
gonna leave that can also can also
change the index tracking to progressive
or predictive and I have the
optimization set to automatic but you
can have best picture quality or
smoother motion times going to click
done we'll go into some of the
preference
is right now so you can have the
rendering set at fast mode or safe mode
i have it set to fast mode right now
because the pretty fast device can also
disable prompt sounds and the 3d user
interface you can have slider controls
tab controls which changes the tabs to a
normal generic windows mobile tab system
push buttons and screen headers you can
also change the 3d contrast on the
actions button we can change the way
that our single tab double tap &amp;amp; tap &amp;amp;
holder set up so if I want to change the
single tap to another menu item I can do
that as well so if I want to just be
phone dialer I can select that and a
little set guys phone dialer can also
change the messaging so if I want to
change the email account I can do that I
can select either outlook or whatever
email you have set up on your windows
mode advice and your text messages in
mine is just SMS right now so I'm click
done so that is face contact 2.0 and
i'll post a link and parking outer
columns to how to get this the program
does cost around fifteen dollars and
ninety-five cents and it will run on
most windows mobile devices with the
touch screen thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
