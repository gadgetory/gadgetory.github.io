pocketnow.com and this is a hardware
tour of the samsung omnia i 900 let's
begin on the front on the front there
are no buttons except for these two
right here call start and call end and
this has the same brushed metal texture
as does the back and we'll go back to
the rear in a second in the center here
we have an optical joystick or a d-pad
so you have the option of rubbing your
finger along it and having a cursor move
around on the screen or you could use it
as a d-pad right left up down and click
inward the screen is 3.2 inches diagonal
and compared to other devices like the
iPhone the iPhone is 3.5 inches diagonal
the HTC touch diamond2 two point eight
inches so it's a larger screen for
windows mobile device which is nice the
resolution is 400 down and 240 across
that's
w/q vga for those that are keeping track
on the top here we have a front-facing
video camera for those that can use that
functionality and a speaker which I
found so far to be kind of quiet but
we'll get to that in future reviews
going over to the side we have a lanyard
loop here and over to the right we have
a little trapdoor here and if we open
that up we get the port that is used for
audio charging and syncing that uses
Samsung's proprietary USB connector that
one if you have a Samsung phone you've
seen that before
let me close that up and let's go to the
bottom there's nothing there except for
a microphone going to the other side we
have a dual action camera button so it
has autofocus if you hold it in half way
it will focus the camera and all the way
we'll take the picture we volume up and
down over here is a notes button and on
the top in the same place that you'll
find it on the iPhone is the standby on
an off button let's turn to the other
side here's the back it's got this nice
finish to it we have the five megapixel
camera sensor here with an LED fill
light taking off the battery is very
easy
just like so and here we have the slot
for the microSD card unfortunately it's
not along the edge here you have to open
up the battery to swap out the microSD
card and of course we have the SIM card
holder here now you may be wondering
where is the stylus well quite
interestingly this device doesn't come
with a stylus built-in I think they did
that to keep down on the size and indeed
they did that but it's kind of annoying
because you have to carry around this
thing if you want to use a stylus this
is not a makeup holder like I thought it
was in the the unboxing it's actually a
stylus and the idea is that you carry
this around either in your pocket where
you use the lanyard loop to loop it into
this hole well I am certainly not going
to carry around a stylist for my phone
they're trying to encourage you to use
your finger on the screen or use the
optical joy joystick here which I think
really helps to make it easy to navigate
the device I'm actually not missing the
stylus with the I 900 here and finally I
want you to notice that the screen is
completely flush and it feels really
nice the sense sensitivity is fantastic
I found typing on the keyboard to be
much better than typing on an HTC
Touches keyboard it has a similar kind
of on screen you know you have a choice
between sure type and t9 and all those
sorts of things so in the next video
we're going to actually turn on the
device and show you all the cool things
that this does it automatically
reorients the screen when you turn it to
landscape and there's a lot of other
cool things so more to come really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
