bionic HTC plans a September 20th event
in new york city and sony ericsson just
backed up from their ice cream sandwich
promise all this and more coming up
right now
hello everyone I'm hi metairie better
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
android revolution the show we go
through what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
let's start this week off with what's
hot okay so this has been another great
week with announcements for Android so
let's start talking about them first of
all LG has just announced that they'll
be making their optimus one successor be
called the Optimus hub though it's a
mid-range device nothing really
interesting its specs but what's cool
here is that it'll actually cost you
like two hundred and seventy bucks off
contract so really good choice if you
want an unlocked phone for prepaid or
traveling and while continuing on with
the Samsung Galaxy monikers we've now
got Vodafone UK getting the galaxy y
though we're not sure why the list of
specs is not really interesting and well
it's just a mid-range device AT&amp;amp;T has
also announced that their galaxy s2 sign
up pages live you can expect the device
as soon as September 16th and well you
can bet there's already somebody going
on that webpage every single day because
that's me I really want one and while
September 18th will also be the day when
AT&amp;amp;T is getting there Xperia Play
finally really good device from Sony
Ericsson that brings you some
PlayStation love so really good deal
right there and well US cellular has
also announced they'll be getting the
motorola electrify which is the same
photon 4g that you've seen from motorola
really good device really great specs
and it's a really high-end device and
well finally if you want a really good
deal for this week well first of all the
sprint epic touch 4g or epic 4g touch i
believe it is it's not only on sale on
wirefly on pre-order but you could also
go to walmart.com and get it for as much
as a hundred bucks on pre-order so it's
a really good deal really good
smartphones coming up and well HTC has
just sent us an invitation for September
20th event for most likely new devices
that will be released the card doesn't
give any specifics except for the fact
that it says come celebrate in style
with HCC so definitely we can expect
some really good devices for the fall
lineup now stick around for the next
segment as we talk about the rumors of
devices that will most probably get on
this event and well our men Evan blass
expert in all leagues foreign and
domestic is just hooked
put some more leaks really good ones
first of all he was able to pull up some
press shots of the HTC Runnemede which
has got the weirdest name I've ever
heard and it seems to be like a flagship
device sadly we've got no information on
a carrier just the fact that it's got
really great leaks and well it seems to
be costing like 900 bucks off contract
so let's see what the September 20th
event brings and well the HTC Victor has
also made it to the FCC with a lot of
images and a lot of great specs so again
a lot of things to wait for on the
September 20th event that will be
covering live and well he was also able
to confirm that the sprint LG Marquee
that we were able to leak just some
weeks ago it's going to be the LG
optimus black variant that's going to be
coming to sprint so it's a really good
device that's coming up though we still
have no release dates and yes as of the
Samsung Galaxy monikers we're not
getting any weirder the samsung galaxy w
has just hit the FCC and it seems to be
going to tmobile as a t6 79 it's got
really decent specs though again we've
still got an overly states really good
rumors really good devices September
20th will be the day for HCC and we will
be there live we'll keep you posted out
of this week's coverage on our website
make sure you hit deke Adams recent
video reviews of the motorola photon 4g
so far so good we also go hands-on the
motorola droid bionic that everybody
waited for so long and while we also
have HTC Wildfire s full review from joe
levi animaux sadly it barely made 2.5
stars out of 5 not really the device and
we also have this article from joe where
he actually tells us how to surf the web
on t-mobile without a dataplan really
good they're a really good article and
won't finally Adam lanes recent LG
thrill 4g video show us some software
side though sadly he's not thrilled at
all anyways
okay so that does it for what's hot and
let's continue on with what's not in
well sony ericsson came on record
recently to promise everybody that owned
an android handset from sony ericsson
that they'd be getting a free upgrade to
ice cream sandwich though it was
probably wishful thinking because
recently they came on record again and
stated no they pulled back on their
promise and said sorry guys we can't
offer it for all devices most likely it
has to do with hardware specs we're not
going to be really hard on them it's
just really sad to see that while Sony
Ericsson's got some really good devices
and sadly it took them a long time to
upgrade their old xperia x10 so not
really sure what to expect from sony
ericsson's future on android if they
continue delaying all these updates with
so many excuses sad news that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching i'm high metal you better
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
