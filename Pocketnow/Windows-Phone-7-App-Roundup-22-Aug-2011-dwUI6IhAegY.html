calm and this is another episode of the
windows phone 7 app roundup and which
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it leopard
translate is a free application
available in the windows marketplace
little eyes your translate virtually any
language into any other language using
either Microsoft or Google Translate
service so we can go down here we can
translate this a bit like so I can
translate it from English to Spanish and
now if I want I can go down here and
consent as a message or I can send it as
an email that can also click up here to
change the various services which use
the languages and if I want I can just
click here and it will reverse the
language back so that I can translate it
II led me is a free application bill in
the windows marketplace allows you to
create various text LEDs kind of like
you'd see on a banner outside various
stores and whatnot and can even play
some of these LED games that we have
available so we have Tetris and bubble
blaster and all these other games down
here we also have these led art
emoticons and other sort of images so
let me just go hero click go change the
color of the LEDs if I like so now i can
scroll across and it will show me the
message block mode in which we can
invert the LEDs and all other various
settings I am plus is a free application
available in the windows marketplace
that makes it very easy to instant
message people on numerous accounts so
from here you can go down here and can
add a contact if I like it can also go
to a council from there I can go two
counts so let me add a new account solo
down here and edit so from here I can
add any one of these accounts I have
facebook yahoo and all these other
accounts that i can have and it's pretty
nice to use just one program to use all
these other instant messaging account
chromate riley is a paid for xbox live
in similar to mario curtain which you're
trying to gather these various bones and
other items that you can throw at people
so let me just go forward it's kind of
difficult to use right now with the
camera on and not being able to use the
accelerometer and the exact same
positions that i like to so here we're
going to collect some of these items
so here whenever each nocona I can throw
something at her and here i just threw a
bone at her and the game continues on
like this throughout the rest of the
labs foodspotting is a free application
developer on the windows marketplace
that allows you to find various
restaurants that people have posted to
the foodspotting server so here we can
view the latest and it looks as though
some of these have done pretty good
review so we can do a stuffed red onions
at the light so it can view a little bit
of information about these stuffed red
onions and I can also go over and see
exactly where they were made and who
made them or what restaurant they came
from so i can clipped back and if i'm at
a restaurant i want to share something
i'll just click on the camera take a
picture of an uploader to foodspotting
