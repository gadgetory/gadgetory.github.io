n s oh my god we're back again brother
sisters everybody's sad yeah I'm gonna
bring the flavor tell you now you got a
question for you better answer now yeah
alright why hello everybody and welcome
to episode three to eight of the weekly
brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers you baby reported on
Thursday the 18th of October 2018 from
Huawei - well Huawei - a little bit of
Porsche but really why wait yeah that's
what we're gonna talk about today I'm
your moderator in this case I got four
people surrounding me - - and - we got a
panel here - - and two people flanking
me it's Josh for Gaara what's going on
everybody and on my right your left we
have first of all David ml of course
known of Android Authority David Hogan
over here the unlocker
that doesn't unlock anything and I made
a veteran shocked and of course we have
while sitting on the floor today is a
michael fisher thee mr. melville himself
all the narrative flank you know either
way
whatever side you need someone someone
say what time it is right now it is 2:17
a London time we've got ketchup mustard
and a glass of old wine here
ketchup must forget the well named brown
sauce which I refer Stephanie look at
it's just brown so brown is that they
were like we need good branding what
should we call this brown brown alright
so we have been here in a London for a
number of days mainly because of the
Huawei and of course the Huawei Huawei
new und huawei mate 20 pro but it's not
the only one that we saw right so we're
going to get into the huawei mate 20 pro
which is the one I believe all of us are
holding in one way or another we did
also get Huawei Pete Huawei mate
twenties as well so we're gonna do new
content between the two but there's way
more two more two more
well way more in a way it's a lot more
work on Huawei more yeah Huawei more yes
way long so what what else happened at
this event which happened in the middle
of central London was a madhouse let's
go ahead and talk about all of that
stuff so while we may 21 meet we pro
what was what came next what you want
start with I think would we did we were
they made us wait till the very end for
the big surprise right so the next thing
we got in the sequence was the only
wearable prize yes yeah right oh wait
while we watch GT is that what you want
to talk about either one and whatever
you want to start off with yeah this is
all in the same segment for this part
you mean the wear with not wear is not
internally but visually it's like I mean
yeah it looks yes so I I feel like I may
not be alone in this but every year that
Huawei announces a new SmartWatch Ickes
I expect them to revisit the success of
the first generation one they brought a
Swiss designer in to co.design watch and
every year it seems like we kind of get
a rehashed while we watch to watch to
classic whatever it's a very familiar
body but it's the most interesting thing
about it it's not running where OS yeah
okay so my question in that case is like
we have a
a new OS what they call flow flight OS
flight sorry flight light OS light Louis
flight light flow OS and this is is this
signifying we have Tizen obviously we
have other operating systems in the
wearable space ones that might be
proprietary to those wearables like
Fitbit and whatnot is where I was in
trouble if Huawei has abandoned it for
this year's wearable I'll just just
think about this I mean how many
processors from Qualcomm are being used
by Huawei right now zero zero and so the
3100 which is the processor that we were
waiting for we are waiting for which
just launched today on the Mont Blanc
the launch of the mobile on is the first
3100 processor the processor that
whatever they created which they
provided no details on is exactly the
same thing only made by Huawei but
obviously because there's like the sort
of partnership with Google where this
3100 is exclusive to where OS it seems
that they pulled some weight or
something where it seems for them to
adopt whereas they had the dog to abduct
a Qualcomm processor and I guess they
didn't that seems to be it I don't know
I can't speak to the strategic element
of it but I was surprised to see another
company trying to develop a new
SmartWatch platform from scratch yes do
a I think it's the way it looked decent
yeah I think it's it's unwise to count
out a company like as big as well way at
this point for it because the Samsung
has been pushing on with with Tizen for
forever and even though it doesn't
really have an ecosystem comparable to
where OS at this point it's this what do
it every single year and they still sell
him sell them every single year sure so
like and and given that they're
targeting this thing at apparently
Fitness folks you know I don't know I it
may have a chance I have to say that
personally speaking it was on the floor
for three different meetings or events
and I've walked right past it to get to
the phones so yeah that's where I'm
coming from a little bit yeah did you
yeah I like to watch because watch the
watch is really good-looking yeah it's
gorgeous super thin it's just wow I
really hope that we'll we saw it the
event is not the final thing because
this
software was clunky AF you used it for a
bit I tried it out at the first pre
briefing we had in New York and it
seemed pretty good hmm but maybe I'm
wrong I don't know it for a first date
for a first a minute see some of those
choppy animations that were happening
and like the touch latency that was
happening on the screen and all that
okay for what it's worth that can always
be corrected before release I don't
always get the way that they implemented
the UI seemed decent though and the like
for a first generation like OS that's a
good point that's a very good point
David but this is also this is also a
contained entity right so we're not
really expecting it to have all of this
app developer support right out the box
yeah you're gonna have basically why we
fit why we health yeah Huawei health on
a watch I mean this is this is I think
at this point everyone is seeing the
success of the Apple watch and thinking
proprietary not only that I mean if you
think about it from the business model
of China like in China alone because
they own their own app store yeah in
right now they can pull their weight
there yeah yeah that product makes sense
so so it gets WeChat when we chat yeah
yeah yeah now who's gonna make the point
that like yeah we're looking at this
from a Western perspective yes yeah yeah
pretty clearly nice really Morris yeah
so this watch has Beauty modes I do
honestly think the watch looks perfectly
fine and I just remember we're getting
really excited when I knew that that a
watch was going to be at that pre-brief
and then when I turned it on I was like
what am I looking at here you know and I
don't I'm not gonna booboo it much
because obviously it's it's a first
generation product is a first generation
OS I would be excited to see what it can
bring to the table but while we has
always been a been one of the darlings
of the watch world I mean even I
remember when we were looking at the
wall we watched too we weren't fully
convinced until it took us maybe what a
week or two of wearing it every single
day to realize we really liked it is
that true I remember that maybe 50 I had
never liked that series I'd like the
giant waste of time with the first gen
anniversary
again they took the time to draft a real
piece of work I remember to the point
where especially people using 360 and
the Huawei watch 1 are the two still
best watches never best looking watches
ever good yes we got used to the look
side we had this off the Andhra thorny
podcast when I ate one when I had you
want definitely not like you were like
you were like you had gotten used more
used to the design I remember this how
many was only into it you weren't
totally into it but you couldn't take it
off because of battery life was actually
not too bad thinking of you just said
about that Huawei watch to that Huawei
watch yes you ever seen anything so
stylish not really okay rite aid on the
way over here I said this in my video
that it's the strap that really makes me
not like that watch like it just feels
like not 3:49 word yeah this is this the
strap is what gave me the impression of
a drugstore Timex which I called it and
my hands on I did say Timex to yet yeah
and then you combine it with like how
you like that ultra sickness I have to
be honest I do feel bad kind of kind of
dumping on this this watch so much
because this with this watch listen it
we don't have the classic which is
arguably the better-looking one which
still looks like an LG watch urbane
urbane yeah yeah but here's the problem
while we set itself up I think for
failure here by creating arguably the
best-looking first generation Android
wear watch right everyone's saying I am
and you know I obviously that design
partnership did not extend to this
device and the upsides of this are that
the screen is is bright and awesomely
OLED and stuff and the it runs Android
wear too tight oh really well but it's
an expensive missed opportunity on every
other you know how I feel about taps and
swipes like I like no rotating crown no
rotating dial like it's just
unbelievable hmm yeah very very
surprising and I'm a company that
doesn't do a lot of missteps anymore you
are that that maybe I may have been
wearing it for the duration of that MWC
just did not want to know I always
thought that could that design was
really
poor and when wood just wasn't it was
very clear there was much effort not as
much effort has been at bay they did
even the classic I am shocked that my
review of the classic did so well
because I'm like there's plastic with a
Huawei name on the sides of this yeah
yeah what was on their mind it was such
a radical change because the first gen
was so like so beautiful I mean Michael
send it to me all beat up and everything
but it wasn't affected by default much
to the fact of the default watch to if
was like a Fitness watch was just like
you wouldn't the complete opposite
direction I never said you loved it I am
the eternal optimist of tech yeah and
you know what I appreciate it well I try
my best it can be hard sometimes like
for example blowing up an entire phone
in order to throw shade at Nintendo but
like for me that's a tall order yeah
what immediately when I saw the made 20
pro I'm a 20x rather then the huawei
mate 20x appear on there and write
nicely will not brief that by the way
exactly
we were not briefed on that phone yeah I
mean and right next to it was a Nintendo
switch to my first thought I think I
said it out loud
David Lum was right next to me and he
was I can actually do L look there you
go ah it was Dave it was David and David
David that is such a space ball see I
straight up just like at the screen and
I was like can i play Mega Man 11 on
your phone well wave no it's it's the
specs is not what makes an antenna
switch great
it's the IP that they don't right it's
the all the Nintendo games that the
nostalgia it's not like they're like we
have a 1080p screen they have a 720 I'm
like but no but how do you own a
Nintendo switch I do so have you noticed
that it's so packed with indie games and
like games that you'll see on iOS it's
like really loaded with that and
every now and then there's a really good
compelling game that launched don't get
me wrong I've only played the games that
I know like Nintendo don't get don't get
me wrong the Nintendo show is something
that the Nintendo switch continues to be
probably my favorite gadget of last year
and this year the I think makes the IP
makes a lot of sense and mobile but the
thing is mobile gaming Assoc on Android
and iOS have gotten so great over the
last year rate is the word compared to
before compared to before it's made good
yeah compared to before there are a lot
of great titles that are coming out
Nintendo is actually investing in mobile
and there are some pretty great games
that are coming out these days nothing
close to the switch though so here's the
thing for me when I saw the presentation
if you saw my tweets on the pocket now
account like what why because first of
all yes the Nintendo switch may be a
great gaming platform but it's a
terrible gaming product from a mobile
perspective it's clunky AF the screen is
a screen is not that's not terribly as
room for improvement but it's not
terribly better it does the job really
well and I see them everywhere and I
asked them I asked about them everywhere
and everyone says that if you tell me
something if the Nintendo switch looked
like the huawei mate 20x what would you
think I'd be all about it exactly so
that's the thing I'm not saying that
you're blending two worlds together
though have you ever owned a ps4 ps3
Xbox those are the devices that focus on
specs to get the highest possible output
the Nintendo focuses on fun and mobility
and mobility which is mobile games in
fact which is why it's great mobile
games yes mobile games are not that
level of fun but I guess what I'm trying
to say is this may 20x is literally what
the Nintendo switch should be it can't
be no no no okay I can already do
I can debunk that immediately the the
tactile feedback of the controls on
there is on the left side and you still
rely on the screen for the right side
right which if you ever use
wait it doesn't have a right control
have you turned the motorola controller
for the Moto those are pretty those a
vice grip looks wait no no I can't wait
to try the controller for this yeah once
that comes out though they say but
that'll be even like an Xbox yeah that's
like an acumen joules popping in with a
plane is holding up the razor phone yeah
[Laughter]
there are certain habits that I need to
pick up from Michael when hosting the
show I'm just here to complain about the
camera be in there yeah so for me for me
to care about mobile gaming I need I
need two things which the Nintendo
switch nails it's games where you don't
see like if I'm if I'm playing a
first-person shooter I don't want the
soldier that I'm shooting to run in a
weird direction which exactly is that
that's the first thing I need and better
at the game the second would be tactile
controllers yeah that for me is the key
and so if Razer can create a controller
that's like it like if it can be like
the w1 chip on the air pods where you
can immediately quickly connect to it
and it just somehow magically connects
the games and you don't have to be
setting up keys and crap like that that
would be me yes all that should crap yes
exactly yes I think raises issues that
isn't the controller they announced
basically just an Xbox controller with
it looks like lamb with a client I just
don't I don't like that you kind of
wanted to be like awesome the controller
for the rock the ROG it's a company
called game vice who have who have
actually sued Nintendo for taking what
they thought was their patent for the
side-by-side controller so yeah game by
vices are having a little bit of trouble
actually developing as many controllers
as possible for all these phones that we
all love so there's a little bit of
problem with that but I agree with you
there should be a side by side control
because it makes it a lot easier yeah
yeah that's exactly I would love
physical controls while wait it is no
Huawei Studios is rotating while waiting
for our studios right guys I think that
if Super Mario Odyssey was made today
and Mario didn't exist that would still
be an incredible game oh I Mario I agree
is the it doesn't trade too much on this
alger but it does it relies on intuitive
to a bit to degree here's the thing
though like the more we talk about was
boring physical controls being attached
to smartphones the more I remember that
like yeah mobile games I'm just not
there for them and maybe I'm alone in
this and this is this is weird
no you're not alone but I if I attach a
physical controller to a smartphone yeah
I'm gonna use it to load some roms that
you know I have a full library of every
single Super Nintendo game ever would
you like I would like some of them would
you like to distribute them to me across
the anti-piracy warning I wouldn't take
him but I could totally so no but listen
to this just notice how much I feel that
it's so funny that during that event as
much as I feel that the may 20 Pro is
probably one of my favorite phone so far
this year I just found it so shocking
that that made 20 ex took so much
spotlight because regardless of the
behemoth of
phone it is it's got the camera of the
may 20 Pro it's got an OLED it's got the
headphone jack that some people care
about it's got this huge freaking
battery life it's big AF it's literally
the the honor the honor note 10 but the
fact that it actually supports a stylus
so it's it's God it's so many things and
yet it still Essex it's it's $200 less
expensive almost $300 less expensive
than the May 24
you know it's worried about that is that
it the things that it does do are the
things that people care about which is
battery life and camera but they also
they also miss something then giant
screen and it's no latina has a
headphone jack I take I take a lot of I
take a lot of a lot of exception to the
way that they marketed it on stage
though because they're trying called it
shouldn't be a gaming device an
old-person device this is an old people
device no seriously like are you are you
like everywhere everybody has those
people in their family who like require
bigger screens because their eyesight is
going or anything like that maybe they
just want the ease of use of a larger
screen despite the fact that it's a big
screen it means it's a big phone it's
hard to handle but there are a lot of
people I know who would prefer a phone
like this and there are like a cheaper
and I can see it well but let's do it
cheaper cheaper in the sense that like a
737 cost less than a 757 like these are
not cheap phones yeah they're not no
none of them in any sense and yet and
yet
yeah like dude it doesn't air aircraft
yes yes yes yes and yet it's it's got
everything that we care about the may 20
probe in a package that sucks expensive
and that offers more yes I disagree and
I feel like the may 20 Pro which we're
gonna talk about in a second yes has all
of the panache it has all of the style
that this phone lacks this the
compromises that Huawei has made to make
the mate ex this massive slab more
affordable are very evident you hold it
and it's like it's slab-sided it says he
doesn't taper to 2 million actually you
unlock it with a fingerprint sensor that
is a regular all round thing stuck
beneath the beautiful matrix that's
symmetrical to the mate 20 so it's right
right yet instead of like the under
display thing and it doesn't have face
unlock right and it's got a 1080p
display right not yeah not the irony
depth so there's there's a lot of
compromises that that take away from
everything that made twenty pro is this
is a phone for people I would argue that
this is a phone for like a lot of the
people and I don't know my comments who
every time I run a piece on like that by
phone without a headphone jack they're
like would this know by I need something
with a headphone jack and also a big
screen would be nice and also a five
thousand why don't they put five
thousand milliamp per hour batteries and
phones well there it is
oh yeah this is for power users of like
a certain stripe I was about say I feel
like this is a is a spec hunter yeah if
you if you just care about specs that
phone ticks a lot of boxes
yeah like any so does this and I and I
like this phone a lot it made two so far
they're a pro but I get them the appeal
of the MINIX like I think that that's
very much like if you just want a large
screen you just want the headphone jack
you just want the battery life you want
the same processor as all these ones you
want a great camera like check check
check check check
it's cheaper have at it grandpa I mean I
think no I think they're regular
overkill for grim I think they made 20
pro the maternity Pro is like something
the word they want to compete with like
Apple buy basically it's the high-end
because it is their future device
because they put all their newest
techadon this is a great competitor to
the 10r
yeah Bigsby would like me to connect and
try again I apologize yeah you know what
you know what on that note when we take
our first break this episode of the
PocketNow weekly is made possible with
support by coz theta by Lutron and today
i want to talk to you about casita by
Lutron smart lighting control brought to
you by Lutron pioneers in smart home
technology with casa de you can schedule
your lights to come on at dusk so your
family always comes back to a weld at
home cuz say the dimmers put the power
of lighting your home with your voice
they work with Amazon Alexa Google
assistant and Apple home pod speakers
plus a lot of other smart home devices
like security cameras thermostats and
music
systems from nest Sonos and more you can
say that casita is pretty well connected
you can trust that it works because it's
from Lutron the company behind the first
electric dimmer with nearly 60 years of
experience guys I'm still waiting on
Jules to send me some of these he's been
testing them out he's been testing them
out for the past few weeks and he says
that being able to turn off his bedroom
light without having to reach for the
switch is pretty convenient you guys all
have smart lighting I think we could all
agree you know I think we could all
agree that if you want to get to sleep
you want the fewest things as possible
to get in the way in controlling to say
the switches with your smart speaker
helps with that so go get your smart
lighting and get it the smart way with
casada by Lutron you can search CAS ETA
and hit up Lutron comm for more
information casita by Lutron welcome
home to peace of mind why do we love
them 820 Pro so much you're gonna
individually going right into it here
they stole no well go they took
inspiration from manufacturer a
manufacturer whose device that whose
devices I've used for generations
because of one feature the wide-angle
camera yes it took off the monochrome
which I liked but whatever if you're
gonna replace it with an ultra wide
camera that lets me guess it kind of get
the kind of shots that I've been able to
get from an LG g 6g 7 b 30 be 40 and in
Parratt and other ones
v20 v10 as well oh you're doing a while
right in the face no but you're not in
the right mode though super super macro
I just don't know I I'm sorry that was
not very good radio everybody the ultra
wide camera I mean it really is a very
versatile third lens to put on the back
of a phone you pair it with Huawei's
night mode you pair you you paired with
the the 3x telephoto which I'm sure
somebody else will talk about it's just
a lot of most versatile camera array I
have seen I'm personally surprised by
the fact that you can use this many
lenses on this many
yeah same I kept trying to like you know
get to disappoint myself right I'd like
switch over to wide and be like alright
now go into night mode is it grayed out
oh no I can use it you're not and there
is stabilization in wide electronics a
video but not so I tried it in the
Porsche ride today and it was epic so I
was afraid to go too wide and obviously
I couldn't just ask the trainer to drive
the car like crazy again so I only had
one shot to do it and I by accident
flipped into the wide-angle stable AF it
was great I was like oh my god word
something we've been waiting for for a
while so why am i excited for the may 24
so the iPhone the iPhone 10 we're going
to start alright so I'm looking at it
from the back and I'm like this is the
Samsung gout is the Galaxy S 10s with a
V 40 camera this is literally while we
took inspiration from a lot of
technologies that have been really
defining for taste from design to
functionality and they've created this
beast this total beast of a phone like I
it's very hard for me not to be I've
never been in a presentation you know
it's funny when I mean I mean these
presentations and and and they make them
for consumers let me tell you they they
make them first one sumers and they're
like oh it's got this and I care like I
don't care about half the things they
say except for this one I was like wow
it can oh it can do that it was L Wow
glad well that was my reaction to
absolutely everything they announced a
lot of it I don't know like the reverse
charging I don't know that's gonna be
useful for more than once he used today
to help me
okay you remember to Michael he uses a
day to help me it was great you got you
got you got four percent yeah it's real
slow my biggest problem is that we
weren't briefed on the price yeah and
when they were providing the price I'm
like okay Huawei you want to own this
you literally look nice this below $900
and you're gonna own every no they won't
do that because that machine is equal
but then of all these ponies do know but
they're not this is the most expensive
entry-level phone there is what no no no
no wait no the the the most expensive
way to buy the product so an iPhone is
$9.99 a galaxy note 9 is 9 9 b 9 99 as
well okay so this is the first phone
that is truly in a price tag four digits
its 1050 well that's nice configuration
oh yeah you can I mean that's only if
you if the May 20 didn't exist 20 throw
because the May 20 doesn't compare to it
really sure but you could say the same
about the iPhone 10's max not comparing
to the iPhone but literally they're the
same phone just when it's bigger than
the other batteries yet whereas in the
case of the mate 20 point I know they're
entirely is they're entirely different
so yeah I get it from the may 20 pro
perspective this is literally the most
expensive phone right now
I don't know if I buy that I don't I
don't know if you can say that what's
the what's the Oppo find that what did
the Oppo find X start at os towers you
know like there's all kinds of category
stretching phones that have been
launched again the Oppo find X has a lot
of stuff that's in this and you guys
didn't mention that this actually has a
lot of the design cues from the feels
like a find X yes it does I said it I
don't know what what the price of the
find X is if you could find it well it's
hard to get that phone
yeah and it's tough to get this one but
yeah I had a somebody bribe me an email
and said he ordered it from clove and
he's a US citizen so we know who s
pricing you were from clove and it's
gonna be delivered in the 26 or
something and it was 1016 US dollars
with shipping right and also that
includes like I think the watch comes
with it and a wireless charger so like
for the probe yeah well we made 20 not
to not the find X yeah I'm sorry excuse
me so you know so there's that right so
like it may well be the most is one of
the most expensive phones without
without question yeah it's in the same
price range yeah it's just I wish they
wouldn't have priced it so high I'm like
my god you can know it's funny we could
say that for a lot of these phones it's
like God
1050 really we can say that for pretty
much anything is the thing and like you
know it's a reality we don't want to
accept and and it's totally
understandable
yeah but at the same time it's like when
you look at this compare so no denying
the only thing is missing is the s-pen
but it's also got a wide-angle lens you
have to figure out what your priorities
are
yeah and we can't change companies
actually making these prices sighs I
would have a hard time going back to the
note 9 with everything this phone has
the reason would you say that it's $50
more worth it yes yes I think I think
the reason the reason why this phone is
so compelling compared to the rest of
everyone else this year because 2018 s
kind of been the year of the
quote/unquote incremental update I think
everyone used that term in every phone
release this entire year and when you
either don't offer more than we're a
little faster and we're a little better
or in LG's case now we have a wide-angle
camera even though it sucks
what Arden it so they have a telephoto
camera that's not optically stabilized I
haven't done my review you do it sighs
so you know it's like they everyone else
is like we made it slightly better or we
have one standout feature that may not
even be that great and then while weight
comes in and they're like we have five
standout features and they're all
awesome like they're all legit like just
actually well engineered and well just
yeah good yeah so like of course it's
gonna be worth the extra money cuz like
Richard you has the best job in the
world he just goes up there he reads off
of the screen and says that's what they
got this won't we this is what we do we
got we've spent these many billion and
spent these many billions of dollars in
R&amp;amp;D and we're actually pushing out a
product that's worth that amount of
money yes I listen I started my hands-on
video with unlit release the Kraken like
this is the phone
that's gonna make everybody else look
bad that's the way I feel there are a
lot of comments right now that based
upon all of our hands-on videos they
feel the same way yeah I mean everyone
else should feel bad like if they're
really seeing the same thing with a
slightly faster processor at the same
price then they need a freaking change
what they're doing is it just boldness
though this is just the whole make it
possible mantra like is it why is Huawei
why is why we're pushing the envelope
like being hungry versus not being
hungry right
so Huawei needs to do things to stand
out and gain more market share even
though yes they were one of the largest
companies on the planet but like in
certain markets they are very much not
whereas Samsung is comfortable Apple is
comfortable right like when you're that
comfortable you do incremental things
right like Apple did it first Samsung is
now following that and so always trying
to stand out it's a marketing thing like
there's nothing to say they like when
they get to a certain point if they were
number one they might do the same right
like to your point though like yes a lot
of things really well and like I don't
know like this is this is a phone that
like when we all were pre briefed we
were all like whoa huh like obviously we
wait yeah let me see how it actually was
gonna work that's one because there's a
couple things that
there's a couple things that promises to
do well right now they either doesn't do
it all or B doesn't do well correct we
were watching the spec sheet get listed
and them telling us what it did we were
like huh oh yeah it was how I would love
to see this device and that doesn't like
gr2 something doesn't it doesn't happen
very often and halfway through that New
York City briefing is when I decided to
come here to London yeah right because I
was like this is a funny that's true
even for long board I was not booked on
this trip and I was like I hate to
change my mind because I need to see
this this might be my next phone yeah
God promises yeah no I see but I am I am
so happy that this phone literally looks
so good and doesn't feel like a truck
and does everything that it does I was
actually asking earlier of Michael like
how can you still get that six plus six
plus inch screen with the phone that
doesn't feel quite as I like it does no
yeah and you said it was a taller screen
and I agree yeah it definitely she oh
you put in a big honking knob that a lot
of people are gonna complain about
they're gonna complain about it but you
know what you have the best of both
worlds you have a very minimal bezel and
then you have that bit of a notch
because of the 3d depth sensor
commenters yes why not let's begin
talking about the knife it actually
serves a purpose here yeah just cuz you
don't like the wide-angle camera on the
front that's a purpose that's a purpose
on the Pixlr purpose like wall-e I know
yeah yeah I get that is the ugliest
notch we have but there was purpose also
it's fine if it has a purpose give me an
option to hide it at least yeah don't
even do they do have to do that they're
going to hopefully banner and even
Michael overhears arse admiring the
phone you guys get by the way what
clothes do you guys get I got Twilight
Twilight David more for Aurora but it's
yeah but it's there Mac backronym in at
220 got the green counting it that most
greens for David
okay in my view to drive it got the blue
I guess so yeah
so here's here here we go oh it is very
different yeah so the blue the blue is
definitely the blue is definitely like a
real blue it's an azure and this is like
a turquoise really I mean the colors
yeah when you go with the green and the
blue one it's less exciting that you get
a green or blue phone it's more exciting
that it's still glass but it's been
etched in yeah that makes it more
crippled and optical mega haze or
whatever look at my script hyper optical
oh yeah sounds like it sounds like I
don't actually know if I like I don't
know if I like this the feeling of it I
appreciate the fact that slippers health
it's not just regular glass and that
they put the more effort into it it
looks nicer slippers all but it fails I
don't know it feels like okay so here's
the thing for me here's thank me like
oneplus was able to make this coating
that just felt like silk I just felt so
good and then Google with the pixel
three oh there's freaking amazing yeah
soft touch glass is so unique and so
interesting to get rid of this case yes
sorry but I don't know I I appreciate
that they're doing the etching because
it's it looks very different I have a
question for you guys so how do you feel
about the design of the camera I I love
it I love it I love it as well and I'll
tell you why the p20 Pro the p20 Pro had
a gradient that was unlike anything else
on the market but if you took that
gradient away got the black one kind of
look like an iPhone 10 with a camera
like they moved the camera lens up to
the corner and put an extra one below it
but this one like no one else is doing a
big block full of its cameras right the
the matrix
it's the stove what it is and we
we know this because we've gone to the
European design aesthetic Center in
Paris but the truthers are like Huawei
all of a sudden is understanding the
value of design language finally finally
and so in Paris by the way but no like
that's that's that's something that I
think is important to them and they
don't haven't realizing from now in
Paris where was it Paris so no but like
it does like it's unique from behind
like even if you had a case on this you
would know it was a different device yes
as for our viewers okay so you know what
you know what I think is interesting is
that is that Huawei are still coming up
right there I mean obviously they're
like number two phone man Wow so they're
they're really actually huge but there
was a time in which Samsung was what
while we is now where Samsung were the
ones that were innovating and packing
crazy amounts of things into their
phones and then Samsung got so
comfortable they started leaning on
luxury and yes but that's that's that's
interesting to me because now Huawei is
doing the same thing but they're also
starting to lean on luxury yeah because
Samsung packed crazy amounts of tech
into their phones until everyone bought
Samsung phones and then they started
being like if you own a Samsung phone
you're high-class it's like the whole
iPhone become a brand anything well I
wonder this is that's an interesting
point and I don't really have a
completed thought about this no matter
if y'all can help me cuz we used to tear
apart Samsung back in the day oh yeah
ways for no yes they were plastic crappy
feeling phones right yeah but they
loaded into point as they loaded into so
many features yeah that were not useful
or they were half-baked hey you're
trying to be useful screen stay you know
you would like if you blinked at your
few posed your eyes the screaming
turnoff except it didn't really work
right
you know using for galaxy s4's as a
surround sound speaker system like the
thing that Nokia is now calling both II
like being able to shoot with the front
back camera sound yeah you sure sorry
excuse me
and we just kind of ripped into him for
this because they would load in a
hundred and fifty thousand features and
like four of them were useful Huawei is
is not no less guilty of loading in a
bunch of crap you're never gonna use
including do the same thing LG is doing
as like ripping off the iPhone portrait
modes poorly so like why is it that I'm
more accepting of that when it comes to
Huawei is it because these phones are
like from a hardware standpoint works of
art and all the Samsung phones of the
time we're plastic piece probably it's
because there are plenty isn't a hammer
like and that's it yeah but even though
they offer you know things that are may
not be that important they also uh they
also hit the standards very well and I
think that's what they must have yeah
that V 42 completely fell apart on they
somehow hit the fundamentals in such a
way that makes you like it's a phone
date for it's a phone you're happy to
use and and the cameras and in
particular there are some extra features
on there that actually work to the
benefit like the night mode the night
mode is something that we've used so
many times and it's something no one
else does is doing it now how long ago
that they hire I remember in your review
of the p20 Pro you mentioned and I had
no idea that they hired the designer
from Nokia Ranocchia yeah yeah you know
they hired him in time for him to be
involved in the p20 pros development but
I don't remember they got behind one of
the excuse me one of the guys behind
PureView that was obviously a huge team
yeah yeah so I mean there's that it's
just interesting because I feel like
these especially Chinese companies that
are trying to rapidly develop are
leaning on different things like oneplus
leans on community and they lean on like
low price high value but Josh as well
exactly
Xiaomi is the that is the next company
that was gonna bring up like as 1 plus
lanes on community but the only reason
they have a community
is because they're so like here's the
phone no extras but it's got high specs
and then xiaomi's like we're making our
software literally based on what you
tell us
oneplus doesn't do that they just like
make it super basic and so these Chinese
companies are kind of like taking
various approaches but it's interesting
to me that Huawei is kind of starting to
lean into the every feature ever but now
we're kind of being luxury type thing
because I could see a point in which
they stopped innovating and just tried
to make jewelry dude but I'll tell you
this much that is very functional
jewelry man oh yeah this is yeah this is
your point like for me it has one thing
that separates the iPhone from Android
for me one stupid little thing what do I
like about the iPhone 10 antennas that I
can look at it Apple logo UF and cheap
of course fifty million up folks will
see you in the comments I love I love
getting notifications and that my
notifications are not visible on the
iPhone 10 and 10s until I look at the
phone hmm and so the huawei mate 20 pro
is the first phone to do that from
Android to find X do it because it had a
thing right tell notifications it's
either or I either see them like for
example right now I don't think I don't
have any notifications but like I like
that I like that my I like that level of
privacy where I'm not forced to unlock
my phone to see my stuff or vice versa
so as much as we can crap on emui all we
want they've actually made some changes
that I actually like that Android
doesn't do yet Android like the pixel
doesn't do that I mean one that the main
one that I always think is useful I
don't use it but I think that's what
people could is the dual app oh I love
it
and a second space app twice
yeah they did oneplus has that Oh oppa
oppa was the first company to have
AppLocker and a lot of those things what
do you use it for Twitter also before
Instagram supported multiple accounts
that was really useful yeah I did have
two WeChat accounts at one point and
what I got locked out of my first one
okay yeah and then way this is when I
was with Xiaomi and they have the same
thing or you could do do a lot so I had
to log into both at some point once I
finally was able to get back into my
other one and then and then there are
things that I don't like about the user
interface like if you want to go for
gestures
I like that they've adopted a just
referred the Google assistant I hated
they've adopted the back gesture from
show me where you have to go to the edge
of the phone and slide and so that feels
okay on the meme x2s where there's no
curve but on this phone because of the
curve it's like really hard to yeah it
makes it difficult hate me if you want
but I just want everyone to copy apple's
gestures like they did copy apple's
gestures and I love that they didn't
adopt the like a hard press the power
button to get the Google assistant I
like that you're all wrong if you're
going to steal gestures the only company
you need to look at is Motorola they are
the only ones to go home you swipe right
to go to multitasking okay so why didn't
always make sense to me as Google's you
should be like the baseline oh yeah has
it's in a back button it's something on
the right like what is symmetry and like
what the problems with that
implementation are just you just slice
in the land it's not hard I can't put
the buttons back on that may 20 pro for
what it's worth I really here I'm
actually thinking putting mine back
because you know it's really hard to go
back correctly what a problem I'm very
forceful
even if but the problem is because it's
because your palm test touches the other
side lift your arm this podcast brought
to you by the human pretzel what were
you doing look at off your shoe it's hit
her okay I say what do you see left hand
right now
you can use it from the right I didn't
know like it's still it's still the
worst gesture they have like it's still
the curved screen I agree does not feel
great and try and try using it on G
board when you're trying to go backwards
and you end up erasing everything you
wrote try using it on the camera
whenever you're on the camera and then
it flips you don't know where you don't
know where back is anymore there are
simply places where you're gonna
collapse the keyboard and it just it it
thinks you're swiping it thinks you're
swiping no it's really annoying it is
I'm just gonna bring back my bar -
you're right let's do the buttons all
right well let's let's take another
break all right the pocket now weekly is
also sponsored by one plus the one plus
60 is giving you the speed you need on
October 29th now and tickets to the big
launch event in New York and New Delhi
have sold out so if you can't make it in
person you can catch the livestream
starting at 11 a.m. Eastern 1,500 GMT
head to pocketnow.com / 1 + 60 for more
information and stay tuned for the
announcement I just want to spend 10 to
15 on the on the end of this just
talking a little bit about the
experience we had to do of course well
tie it we'll tie it into the device
we'll tie it into the device
I'll leave the room that's cool oh you
need to try you guys have a valid
driver's license that's me because I
live in New York and never thought about
it and then once the Portia event and of
course because there someone in there is
German yep
was like 11 Batum so what did what do we
so what did we end up doing today I mean
Jaime had the most one I feel like I had
it was therapy it was fantastic so it
was it was it was bittersweet it I think
is the best way to say it because I feel
it that the easiest way for huawei to
guarantee that I could ever use any of
their phones as my daily drivers
permanently is if that phone is not on
everybody else's hands we're talking of
course about the may 20 RS so I wore a
design for horses design which like they
make the camera hump look like if it's
flush but it's not it's a little thicker
and that's how they achieve that flush
design that phone is a bit thick with
leather from cows from somewhere in
Texas
large cast large they're treated for
weeks before their and this is the thing
I wanted to get into is like this phone
like like Huawei we were talking about
luxury earlier they know barbed wire and
the way it is like no barbed wire
because it damages the product the
brands that they have partnered with
yeah like while we is leaning on luxury
but they're picking the right brands
like Richard Richard you is obsessed
with Europe is what I've heard and so
we've got like we've got Porsche Design
and I mean I find I found it funny when
we were in the presentation and people
were like you know some of us members of
the press were arguing about the price
I'm like why are you arguing about the
price this design product yeah when they
asked like what makes this more
expensive I was like do you really want
to get man what are we asking this
question and you're not forced to buy
the Porsche design very good buy the
regular wouldn't be happy like you know
what branding is
you have any idea what that is yeah
whatever you know but yeah they were
they were sort of agonizing on about
just how hard it is to make the phone
and all that and we're not gonna be able
to get the price down of this phone it's
it's ridiculous it's 1690 65 60 95 euros
for the for the lower model of it but
the lower model in this case is a higher
model of the May 20 Pro yeah absolutely
yeah because I just remember him saying
up there is like well imagine if you
bought the biggest couch you could it
still won't make more phone so I was
like Edition product that's it you know
you could buy it or not how much does
that play into your purchasing
completely depends on what kind of
person you are in what you care about
what's the most special edition thing
you have Michael oh I have a 1 in 1 in
12 Star Trek communicator prototype from
2009 from Nokia how about you that I
bought on eBay
did I'm homeless his most prized
possession is all my possession I don't
really have anything that's super
limited edition you never had my Groudon
coin from my pokemon ruby pre-order oh
hey but you're doing this like if we
understand what like so I'm also a very
minimalistic person so like I am
obviously not the person to buy this
device very much I'm very millennial of
me I'm Fiat I'm like I don't I don't I
don't need these things I live in the
American gardens actually do have a band
poster of one of my favorite bands that
is limit it's limited edition okay I
don't think I have anything that's right
millennial just like I I just I I like I
like to get them because our job is cool
you said Diego
okay yeah like I have like what about
you I can't really think of anything in
particular I mean either maybe my maybe
my Onizuka Tigers my three pairs of them
so it's not really limited edition but
no one I know really has it that's what
I was going for is that like yeah you
get this phone because nobody else has
it right but the Porsche design isn't
gonna be sold in the States either yeah
so probably sold out at this showing it
comes in a region like Europe for
example where did where Huawei is
widespread then you know I want to get
the latest thing but I want this model
that no one else is gonna have right
okay also crap money and yeah it's right
it's a no or my poor Richfield just not
the demographic and I find that shocking
when I see people buying an Apple watch
or mess right well that's the same
concept same concept so if I had their
are string combinations for that Apple
watch er mess that cost the same as that
portion of the sign phone where am I
getting more more my money's worth
so you can't quantify the value that's
the point that I was for nerds and we
want to quantify everything but also
also can I just say that like the bottom
skew porsche design right
six-six no it's hired then isn't it oh
yeah it means the same okay how much is
the top model Pro I think it was I think
it was 1200 I think which is probably
around 1200 yen I think 1016 dollars
shipped 16 design yes so for $400 a year
1695 euros yeah that's not dollars yeah
so four years
you little bees blasted and then what
does the oil leather case yeah no that's
not leather you did you thought they
said it they I don't know if they said
it but it's nice leather so all right so
let's say like those runabout nice box a
little card that says you own a porsche
design made a little plastic card that's
like this is Jared you know like a few
hundred euros is that it doesn't matter
it I actually think that they're under
priced I think so too
I think they're under price because like
so what if you get more hardware that's
you're not it does you're not the person
that's gonna buy it if you're gonna buy
it you want it because you want it and
like Randy you're to every branding yeah
but that's all virtue did if you're
buying a product that is specifically
specifically branded as a luxury product
then it doesn't matter what's in it I
forgot I do have a limited edition
product that I have a Porsche it design
a hard drive do I Drive advice Lacey
yeah Lacey Lacey would that thing tour
every single bag I had your bag it's
just like the mentality of the whole
Porsche sign thing I totally get it like
there there's functional there's form
there's design there's their style and
all that and you know I can't really
think of a Porsche design product I
wouldn't use if I owned it they were
showing off all of them to photographs
to the jacket wasn't a porsche design
jacket there's just a porsche jacket now
poor me but here's so i love the fact
that the chief designer porsche design
was still using a may tonight yeah that
was he could have any phone he wants do
it he literally contributed in the
design and he was still using a phone
and so his point was we make timeless
products if you see our watches they
don't look from the 70s if you see our
pens
don't look from the 80s true if you see
our bags they don't look from the 90s we
make products that you can use as long
as you want and that makes a lot of
sense well we're always gonna be very
Millennial of me to say right now also
but it's not about the things it's about
the experiences so it made a lot of
sense to me that is this is a phone that
you are going to have that no one else
has you're also going to get an
experience that no one else will have my
god that driving experience was
fantastic phone they got the driving
experience sure yeah absolutely that's
not fair to give them any any thought
you want to give on on actually getting
behind the wheel of a Porsche yes I have
so many and I got in the car and he
tried to make me nauseous god we did
doughnuts in the parking lot you did
doughnuts in the parking away we did oh
so it was fun for Sue for those of you
that watch my at&amp;amp;t it can wait campaign
video I was in a horrible car accident
in 2015 and ever since then I've had
literally like PTSD like I've like
insecurities when driving and that's the
main reason I didn't buy a fast car
anymore where I bought a truck like I
focused on things that would not put me
in a position to have another accident
like that and this was the first time
since then that I felt confident about
driving a car at the speed that I did it
was fabulous like it was therapy for me
I had such a great time and definitely I
mean the the you know the instructor she
was amazing not just in looks like she
was really not knowledgeable like she
did an amazing job at I met Rivera p.o
box two three you just had to quickly
ease that one in there not just it looks
oh my god no she was fantastic
and she was kicking everybody's ass yeah
when we were going around the track
Michael did I see that you weren't did
you you drove right drove the hell out
of that thing okay I saw you in the past
and the last round you got like after I
completed the ice incline on my first
attempt yeah
contrary to my instructors expectations
he was like gave me a firm handshake
which I appreciate it and then he was
like let me happen that driver's seat
for a second I'll show you how to how I
do some turns and it was quite quite
impressive yeah had nothing to do with
the phones but I really appreciated
learning something about how how cards
are handled professionally so I switch
they like presented it that way because
this is something you'll never have this
is something that is uniquely yours
something you'll always have and I'll
always I'm always gonna remember this
experience as well yeah that's what that
meant and all of you you were doing that
launch what was it launched at launch
pad or what I was doing launch control
and I was telling I was challenging
myself to break up to the last possible
second yes now was def I was just trying
my best to like learn everything I could
because I don't think I'll ever be
behind the wheel of a car like this
again I don't and I wanted to take every
moment of it like with the gt3 that we
were driving I did gt3 felt like a beast
yeah I did not go back to any of the wet
areas I stayed on the track and I said I
want to be on this track with this car
if you'll let me and he said have at it
and he started giving me tips on how to
like really be efficient on the track
it's a skill I wanted to learn it's
something that I know I won't be it was
such a different car to the other one
that I drove first yeah yeah Wow so I
wanted to take advantage of you know and
then of course the porsche design phone
was in my pocket so I actually used the
experience driving on the right side of
the roads it's really what it's horrible
that I asked her I asked her to drive
because they weren't allowing us to film
and so I was like so what have you
driving I film you and she's like yeah
we could totally do that oh then tell me
I could do that's all I was allowed to
do I use I use that experience I use
that experience to test the 4k
stabilization dudes like from the the so
the telephoto does not have good
stabilization
and I think it's broken because a p20
pro has quite good stabilization on the
3x yeah and I think it's it's gotta be a
software patch it has to be a software
software I mean when I say it's broken I
was using the and so oh my god so 4k
there's no 4k at 60 right now even
though apparently the processor is
capable but I did 4k at 30 and there is
great stabilization on the regular
sensor and then if you do the wide I
don't know why but I felt that even
better yeah well it's cause it's more
frame to like work with yeah right like
that makes sense yeah yeah yeah but it's
it C is we should say it's not no but
dude at this point E is is literally
like made o is because these gyro and
video and video sure yeah yeah all right
well it was a good time so I'm saying I
think they had a great time yesterday
I'm looking right at Cogan when I say
this it's a heaven now yeah how's your
pixel I want one last hot take from
everybody before we call it on this one
you have price is no object you can pick
one or the other it's sitting right in
front of you PD or pro David go yeah rs
or pro RS but as another bad question
let's get the RS out out because we
can't have it let's let's put another
phone no not true for me for me it has
nothing to do with the branding because
I don't care at all about branding and
I'm not even a car guy like I drove a
Porsche and I'm I know that I'm
extremely lucky position to be able to
do that yeah and it was kind of fun and
not a lot of people get to do that just
renew your license for God's sake
like ultimately I don't really care
about cars
I just don't and I and so it's not a big
deal me but the leather feels really
good to hold and it's grippier and it
doesn't attract finger prints like crazy
I don't know and I also like the heat
that it gathers when you're holding it
so I agreed like that they also that
leather is like proper leather it's not
like the it's it feels better he's
making a face I am making a face I've
used the Moto X 2014 which is the best
leather that you can find on a
smartphone in history actually you have
to hold mine all right I just bumped
Michael for that because that's kind of
part of my point okay well that makes
sense but regardless I would actually
choose the pro because I I actually
prefer some of the other things that it
has and I prefer I don't know I like the
the styling I like the gradient color I
know that like a lot of people are
bashing on because it's not as good as
the last gradient but I don't know I
like that it's brash I like that it's
outstanding it's going to be different
because I live in the United States
so nobody anyway that's it no I would
choose the brown I didn't like the
separation between the leather on the on
the rs8 felt it seemed a little bit
weird to me and I remember talking to a
bunch of people on our trip and I was
just like I'm not sure about this
leather and they kept going but the
camera's flush I'm like but the leather
is kind of odd put the cameras flourish
camera bump like if extremists are the
worst but the cameras flooding everybody
in our comments a bump in 28 yeah
basically like me a camera bump I don't
mind the camera bump that one of the
pros not even that egregious like
seriously like good couple on our phones
right it feels great
the phone feels great I just don't think
that it's actually that much more
attractive than the front and I did a
poll on Instagram and somewhat narrowly
the pro did win out it's still it's
still different in a way it's almost
like when you see that PD logo on the
back and then you see leather you're
like oh of course
right it's expected
the red that's okay that's that's nice
that's me so I am pissed that they made
that red berry and exclusive to China
I'm like okay cuz I like that even like
that red I would have loved that porsche
design phone in like a silver leather
with the black bar in the middle that
would have looked fantastic
I agree but for me but for me like right
now I am sitting on font on phone tober
phone tober fest october oh hey I have I
have so many phones to review and until
like February of next year it's like
crazy and we've still got more to see so
if I had to pick all of these phones
obviously we have to wait for the final
software of the May 20 Pro make sure
that it delivers on all it's all Allah's
promise but I find this phone to be
fascinating and if I could have like a
limited edition version that read I
would go for that like if I had a choice
if I could pick just one phone and I've
had pixel three Excel I have all the
iPhones I've had all the galaxies and
the one well we don't know what one plus
60 is gonna be yet but I would grab that
red mate 20 probe Porsche Edition hey
Josh hmm I just because I've forgotten
the question was the Porsche Design at
the regular one right yes
yeah the pro you know the pro I was very
apprehensive that this in display
fingerprint sensor was going to be bad
it was on the previous I love demo is
bad on the demo devices we saw way on
our pre-brief and it was also bad on the
porsche design okay so I was very
worried but I have to tell you I'm using
this I turned off the face scanner me
too since that don't really matter
divorce ourselves I wanted to use SEO
what right I did - is there room for
improvement most certainly yeah do I
still wish I had some kind of tactile
guide to know where the divot is like on
a hardware fingerprint scent totally but
once you get a little bit of muscle
memory involved that says it's so cool
it is pretty cool it's so so he's gonna
be kind of like a WOW factor yeah I
think said that in my video - I was like
the thing about the fingerprint sensor
is that you don't know where it is when
you first start using it yeah but like
at some point I imagine you would gain
some muscle memory and you'd be okay
with it and does have like a little
indicator like that indicator doesn't
come on until you kind of like mess with
it it's always it's always ready to go
the face scanner works pretty well yeah
I just use it up but like I have there's
plenty times that I've used that
fingerprint scanner be good as the face
scanner is not quick enough but at least
it's better than the one on the pixel
where if you turn on the display it'll
indicate unlock the fingerprint and the
scanners at the back right yeah like
everything I get every phone every phone
gives you that fingerprint sensor
Brahman I still remember my parents on
their first iPhone like putting their
thumb on the display where the
thumbprint logo was and I'm like no no
it's not part of the screen that would
be impossible now cool how cool is it
that we're at that point yeah I think
Lee remember in middle school I had an
iPod Touch the first generation you had
an iPod Touch in middle school how old
you been all right that's why I said
first generation bunch of old-timers
sitting on the couch it yeah anyway
never graduate from college and being
like I wonder if she'll ever build an
iPod Touch anyway well you listen to
music on your dis Minh word yeah in the
first generation in the first wave of
apps that were just stupid like the food
like the freakin beer app and all that
crap those were yeah so so there was an
app that was basically a screen unlock
that he pretended to be a fingerprint
sensor in the screen and it was meant to
just blow your friends minds but you
would actually like DoubleTap on the
corner before you did it for to make it
actually work guys you went
that so that's how you're able to like
trick people into thinking like oh my
gosh there's a fever in the screen and
so then everyone was like oh my god
that's actually here it's insane like
see seeing that tech as like a kid and
being like this is actually an app we
just like and it only took two years I
