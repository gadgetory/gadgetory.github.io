Pocket now I just received a box of
dozens of phones that are part of the
pocket now archive of devices that goes
back many many years I don't know what's
in the box but I'm really excited to
find out there's gonna be some weird and
wacky phones in the box some old phones
some new phones some phones I don't even
think I've ever seen before some phones
you've never seen before these phones
belonged to different PocketNow people
along the years some of the phones
belong to michael fisher some of the
phones belong to quan carlos back now
some of them belong to me like ten years
ago and they've just been passed around
to different PocketNow editors over time
so let's get to the mega unboxing and
see what's in this mystery box let's get
to it okay so I'm super excited to see
what's in this box I will literally have
no idea what's in it but I know that
there's probably gonna be some weird and
wacky stuff that goes back years and
years so let's let's unbox it and I've
got my cleaning chamois here because
some of these phones might be dirty but
let's take a look
this is a big box
okay packaged really well get this out
so doesn't boxers in the box
I'll get this big box out of the way
okay here we are so let's get our hands
dirty up inside here's the first one the
Sony Xperia x8 to ultra so the cool
thing about this phone a lot of people
didn't buy the XA ultra the XA one ultra
and the XA two ultra the cool thing
about this phone is it has really small
bezels on the sides and it's just a very
large screen phone it's got a nice metal
build on the back it's got these really
cool chamfers and this really nice blue
color this is a really nice phone
actually it's pretty slim for being a
such a large screen so that's the XA 2
ultra
that's a cool phone next looks like we
have some accessories here one plus five
case not that interesting oh wow
Sony CLE a this is so cool definitely
gonna do a video about this this is one
of the early PDAs that have really
interesting convertible design you could
use it as a standard phone like a like a
Motorola star tech you could have use
the dedicated keyboard which is actually
pretty nice you can use it with a
touchscreen up here or you can flip it
around on this side actually I want to
turn this one on and just use it for a
minute while I go through the other
phones how do you turn this up here it
is
this is camera swivel around where's the
camera
super weird phone then turn it on this
is called a personal entertainment
organizer I might not even have a charge
actually yeah I don't think it has a
charge and it's got a super proprietary
port which works with this crazy thing
I'm gonna have to plug that in charge it
up and see what it's like see what else
we have in here oh my gosh it's the
Motorola cube do you remember this phone
this phone ran an early version of
Windows Mobile it's so small and so
light and it's got this really good
keyboard this was a direct competitor
with the Blackberry phones of the day
actually want to turn this one on but as
a charge oh it had the scroll wheel on
the side which was really really cool
a lot of these probably have no charge
wonder how this probably microSD you
would see that's not it
well here it is mini-usb I probably
don't even have a mini USB connector
lying around without the look so this
one's totally dead - oh yeah this is
awesome this is the things the sony vaio
p clamshell phone whoa this is awesome
this was so expensive back in the day I
don't even know an operating system that
runs and I really want to turn it on but
I bet it probably has no charge let's
see here it charges with micro USB so
that's good I turn it on and see if
anything happens
this thing is huge did anything happen
no okay try it again
very few people bought this device just
because look at it but I think it might
be a really cool productivity tool I
definitely want to take a look at this
fully really cool phone and I really do
forget the exact name of it but maybe if
you know what this is called leave a
message in the comments all right so
let's move on to put that to the side
into the chart file you have to charge a
lot of these phones what's next
there are just so many phones in here
this is awesome this is like the best
day in my life oh yeah
the original HTC one this was an amazing
phone one of the first all-metal phones
actually this is my phone I can tell
because it's a dent in it from like 7
years ago this is one of the last phone
set Beats Audio but just a beautifully
designed phone little dirty had really
loud boom sound speakers a relatively
small screen for today's standards but
back then this was awesome it just felt
so high quality and it was super fast ok
what is this I have no idea maybe it's
like the XE premium really no way of
knowing it's USB see so it's a
relatively new Sony phone it's got the
fingerprint sensor on the side I have no
idea what phone this is maybe like that
this one will work so I'll turn on oh
yeah it vibrated we'll come back to that
in a sec I'm looking at the screen up
close looks really sharp it might be the
XE XE premium with the 4k display that
would be amazing
alright let's keep going here oh yeah
it's the oneplus X Wow that's something
you don't see every day this is what
oneplus decided to make an all glass
phone before the one plus six oh this is
so nice it's got an AMOLED screen really
good for one-handed usability it's got a
really nice metal trim around the edges
this is a super cool phone hope it turns
on let's see
yep vibrated it's got micro you has to
be on the bottom
this phone is awesome Hey look the Sony
phone went on let's see if we can get
and see what model it is I'm not even
sure whatever you get into this devices
is this does if I suppose are set to
continue sign in with a Google account
that was previously synced with this
device so I'm gonna have to figure that
out I still have no idea what phone this
is but I really do think it's the XE
premium let me know in the comments if
you have any idea what Sony phone this
is let's move on you
the oneplus X turned on wow this phone
is just so awesome it's so thin and so
light it's probably really fast because
you know it's it's a it's a one plus
phone probably doesn't have their most
recent version of Android or anything
even close it's so cool to see a oneplus
phone in this form factor what a beauty
Wow
I think it has Android lollipop let's
see it's phone so cool what a beautiful
screen Wow this is running android 5.1
and i doubt there's an update but i'll
check or maybe i can flash something
from Exedy a what a nice phone
too bad oneplus stopped making the
oneplus x it's a really cool product
super nice just a really great
one-handed phone let's move on
got some more phones in here a lot more
to go this is really really fun let's
see what we have here
looks like we have Huawei this is the
meet 10th row yeah looks like the meet
10 pro in mocha beautiful color Wow
never seen in this color super nice
super nice it's got a screen protector
on it with the like camera this is a
really great phone and I love the color
mate 10 pro great phone next oh heck yes
it's the Nexus 5 in white with the white
earpiece love this phone people that had
this phone really really liked it it's
just it's small it's fast got great
battery life they fixed the camera with
a software update so it actually takes
really good pictures it's got Micro USB
this is an old phone so it doesn't have
the new stuff it's got an old processor
it's a little bit dirty but super
excited to have the Nexus 5 back this is
such a good phone
and what's this oh cool this is the one
plus five back when once I did smaller
screens so of course this is the 5.5
inch display it's it almost feels
similar in size of the oneplus X it's so
small compared to like the one plus six
and five T so you know good sized screen
got the hardware button down here
fingerprint sensor on the on the front
really nice metal build just a beautiful
really great phone with one plus five
okay let's keep going this is awesome
there are so many phones left in this
box got an iPhone looks like the seven
plus so nothing interesting to say about
that oh wow this is a cool case on the
Nexus 6p wonder what color this Nexus 6p
is black that's nice you guys remember
this phone made by Huawei really fast
great phone this is really one of the
first Google made phones that had an
actually good camera and this is
actually in really good condition in
this case is awesome I love it I'm gonna
keep it in there Nexus 6p let's see what
I got Samsung Galaxy Note 8 in black
pretty good condition I never really
liked this phone it's just too big and
slippery especially when you start using
it it gets a little greasy you really
need a case on it and then it gets even
bigger when you put a case on it but if
you want the S Pen if you want to have a
big bad fast Samsung phone this is the
one to get let's move on
I just can't believe how many phones
there are this is like bone heaven oh
it's the blackberry Passport
I've never actually seen one of these in
person what a ridiculous phone it's got
this really large spacious hardware
keyboard
it runs BlackBerry OS I forget which
version I'd really want to turn this on
and see it it's got a micro USB this is
an 18 T unit C it gets the powers on the
top
what a silly place to put a power button
on such a big phone this might be dead -
yep looks like it has no battery so it's
another one well to charge up I'll
probably want to do a video about this
whoa does the back come off that is
super rare yeah oh oh I see just a
little panel comes off for microSD
expansion put your SIM card in this
actually feels really good in the hand
too bit BlackBerry OS is not good if
this ran Android it would be really
really cool right just to have the the
screen is not tall it's just wide great
for spreadsheets and other boring things
but really cool phone blackberry
Passport
it's not something you see every day
more phones here oh cool it's the LG G
flex wasn't this the phone that has the
self-healing back I think so if you
scratch the back and you rub it with
heat it will self heal apparently not
really to perfection because there's a
lot of scratches on here you got the old
school LG volume buttons on the back
which is kind of a cool place and the
idea with this phone is that it kind of
has a nice curve to it so it feels good
against your face for phone calls really
rare phone you don't really see very
much of microUSB I'm going to turn it on
probably doesn't turn on but hey let's
try
nope okay add to the charge file Wow so
many phones this is the best okay this
looks like a pixel pixel XL original
last year in very blue this was a really
cool color that most people didn't get
it's kind of offensive with the white
front they should have gone with the
black front and blue back but this is
the original pixel XL really nice phone
still stands up well you can get Android
P Developer Preview on it if you want at
this point really nice phone next looks
like we have a galaxy s 9 here with a
really cool case no this is not the
galaxy s 9 or actually it is no this is
a Galaxy s8 because you got the
fingerprint scanner in the terrible
location single camera and it's a
smaller size so Galaxy s8 with a really
cool case ok it looks like we have
another one +5 here oh no this is the
one plus three T or three can't really
tell by looking at it because the three
and the three T looked about the same
but another really cool design for
oneplus after the oneplus one in the
oneplus 2 1 plus 3 came out with this
all-metal build and it was kind of like
the maturation of oneplus going towards
a really nice design this is just a
beautiful phone with the gunmetal super
nice has a case leave in the case and
let's see if there are any more phones I
think we're getting to the bottom of the
box
I think that's it okay so I'm just gonna
go through real quick and figure out
which phones I want to make videos on
because I want to charge those
definitely want to do a video on the
blackberry Passport
definitely want to do a video on this
whatever it is it's so cool I hope I can
charge it let's see what else
definitely want to do a video on the old
Sony Klee eh I mean how cool is this
this was really high technology for back
in the day
it's so big oh it runs palm OS wow
that's actually good because palm was
pretty pretty good by the time you know
it was iterated on many times definitely
wanna do a video on the oneplus X loved
that phone and finally got my eye on the
definitely want to do a video on the fc2
old truck I think this is a very
underrated flow and most people don't
even know that it exists it's really
cheap actually if you go on Amazon get
it unlocked for like two or three
hundred bucks it's just a really cool
phone with a huge screen and small
bezels on the sides cameras not so great
battery life is pretty good just a
really great budget phone that you
wouldn't expect people to think about so
you might be wondering what are we gonna
be doing with all these phones well a
variety of things I'm gonna be making
videos on the ones I just talked about
we will probably do some contests and
give away some of these some of them
that are older we might try to sell on
like eBay or suavo and the other ones we
don't use we'll just put in a box put in
a drawer and save for someone else at
pocket now to open up these are really
really interesting phones and I got to
charge up these guys it's gonna be
awesome
so thanks for watching this video hope
you enjoyed it as much as I did this was
a lot of fun going back in time and
seeing all these cool phones
that have collected we've collected in
the pocket how archives over many years
so thanks for watching and that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
