was eight years ago and is still
considered one of the most brilliant
marketing campaigns we've all seen and
focus specifically on serving you and
that's exactly what the company is
seeking one more time with its new
product lineup I'm Jaime but I would
pocket now when we recently had an
opportunity to play with the HTC you
play and you ultra all right disclaimer
we are usually allowed to film devices
whenever we are at HTC pre briefings but
for some reason recently in Las Vegas we
weren't allowed to film the new HTC you
play a new ultra we were only allowed to
take stills of it but we negotiated
being able to put together a video
showing these stills there are a couple
of changes that HTC wants the flagship
during 2017 the first one is a new
approach to artificial intelligence
where Google handles the back end of
everything that's focused on audio like
in the case of the Google assistant and
the HTC has this new HTC Sense companion
that has now focused on making
applications smarter and yes we do get
two new devices in addition to this new
approach the HTC you play a new ultra HD
Z claim that it's kind of tired of
playing with aluminum and it's wanting
to try something new with glass and even
sapphire in certain cases we've got new
color options brilliant black in
addition to cosmetic pink ice white and
also sapphire blue now even though we do
have the you play the company barely
talked about it it does follow the same
design language of the U ultra mostly
but obviously the U ultra is the
flagship so in case you need
specifications for the play there will
be a separate post being pushed live at
the same time of this video with
information on specifications in the
case of the U ultra we have the premium
flagship 5.7 inch quad HD display that
sports Super LCD 5 and yeah well you
notice at the top is actually a separate
display this is a two inch display that
has the same pixel density as the rest
of the glass and the great thing about
it is that yeah you're pretty much
looking at an LG V 20 but that's where
HTC is doing things differently remember
that the approach from the company is
now to make application smarter so the
idea for this separate display is to
help the
HTC sense companion provide you
notifications that are catered to your
priorities remember it is focused on you
so it has to learn from you you'll teach
it where your favorite contacts our
favorite applications are which
applications you actually want to get
interrupted by and this screen will
actually provide those specific
notifications there's a very genius
approach that obviously we will have to
try to prove if it is not even more
intrusive than every other focus on
notification so you can get from other
manufacturers and the rest we have a
standard flagship what you see is a
Snapdragon 801 processor in addition to
four gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of storage
if you go for the Gorilla Glass 5 option
there is also a 128 gigabyte sapphire
glass version and the sapphire glass is
actually only at the front it's not
available at the back but obviously the
company is trying to provide users with
a more premium approach to the
smartphone and when it comes to the
cameras we pretty much have the same
combo that we saw in the case of the HTC
10 which is not bad we have a 12 ultra
pixel camera at the back of f 1.8
aperture but what makes the front camera
cool is that even though we have a 16
megapixel camera here at the front it
can then become a 4 ultra pixel camera
if you also want to if you want to
provide better performance in low-light
we still can't confirm if this will be
optically stabilized like we have on the
HTC 10 but that's also an option and in
addition to that we also have other
approaches to making the phone smarter
for example since the Google assistant
will play a big role in artificial
intelligence the company is providing
four new omnidirectional microphones
that are apparently are even capable of
biometrically unlocking your phone
we can't wait to test that if you're
wondering where are the stereo speakers
we have the same HTC boomsound hi-fi
Edition the same we saw with the HTC 10
where the top is a tweeter the bottom is
the woofer overall my impressions of the
HTC u ultra and you play are very
positive these phones feel amazing in
the hand the design is exactly what you
come to expect from HTC and what we were
able to see from the user interface is
also something that we do enjoy it looks
a lot like the HTC Sense that we know
but there are a couple of things that we
weren't able to test because the
software is
not final so definitely there is a lot
more to come from HTC and we are hoping
that it's not just these u ultra and you
play smartphones company kind of tees
that we should be expecting more from
the company in 2017 and let's just say
that this is a very positive start
that's it for our impressions of the HTC
you play and you altra let us know in
