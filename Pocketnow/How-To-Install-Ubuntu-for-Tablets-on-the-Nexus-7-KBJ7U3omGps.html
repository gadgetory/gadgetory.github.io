released to the public earlier today and
you might be wondering how you can get
it on your own devices I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow and this is how you
install the Ubuntu touch Developer
Preview on a nexus 7 the first thing you
need to do is to back up your device
you're gonna lose your pictures and
everything in this so make sure you have
a backup of everything also you will
need a TB setup on your computer and
your device's bootloader will have to be
unlocked once you have those two things
ready you will need to boot to the
bootloader plug the device in type an
ADB reboot bootloader and the device
will reboot from there we will flash
twrp a custom recovery which will allow
us to flash Ubuntu from the terminal
type in fastboot flash recovery and the
name of the recovery image this will
take just a second and then you will
need to boot into the recovery mode once
the recovery comes up it's time to back
up the device hit the backup option
swipe and wait this will take a few
minutes and once it completes you will
need to offload the backup to an
external drive the next step is to wipe
the device from the main screen of TWRP
select wipe factory reset and swipe your
finger this will take just a few seconds
or maybe a little longer if you haven't
reset your device in a while then it's
on to the real stuff from Canonical's
page you will need to download two files
you will need to download one
specifically for the group or the Nexus
7 and the main Ubuntu image he's a big
file so this could take some time
if I should still be in the recovery
mode so once those are downloaded select
Advanced ADB sideload and then swipe
your finger in the terminal and your
computer type ADB sideload and the name
of the first recovery image the one
specific to the group or the Nexus 7 and
wait this one should not take too
terribly long once it finishes you will
be met with the option to reboot the
system hit back select ADB sideload once
again and swipe back on your computer in
the terminal type in ADB sideload and
the name of the second image the general
phablet image hit enter and wait this
one is the large image it's almost 500
megabytes and it will take some time to
transfer over the device and into flash
so wait this one out for a few minutes
and once it does finish hit reboot
system the device will take several
minutes to reboot and once it does you
will see the Ubuntu welcome screen swipe
from right to left
access the main screen and you now have
Ubuntu for tablets installed on your
Nexus 7 it may take some time for the
install to finally complete it'll be a
little laggy at first and then it should
speed up and be pretty fun to use the
great thing about this entire process is
that it's just as easy to go back to
Android as it is to flash Ubuntu simply
download the stock image from Google
boot back into the bootloader and flash
the stock image back to the device and
in no time it will be back to Android
