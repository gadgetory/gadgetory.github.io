pocketnow.com and in this video we're
gonna unbox the htc inspire 4G this is
sort of a 4G phone on 18t we're going to
talk about why this is a very important
phone for AT&amp;amp;T when we come back let's
get to it so AT&amp;amp;T in our opinion has one
of the best strategies for their 4G
deployment what they're doing is they're
rolling out HSPA+ today and it's
available to pretty much anyone that has
a teen t3g service the idea behind this
is that they're gonna launch their 4G
LTE network later than 2011 and kind of
big-time in 2012 the cool thing about
what they're doing is that because
they're gonna have to sort of roll out
LTE slowly there are going to be times
when you don't have LTE and this box is
being kind of a pain so the idea is that
you'll fall back to the HSPA+ speeds
instead of in the case of Verizon and
you know Sprint falling back to the much
slower 3G speeds makes a lot of sense so
that you can get really the fastest
connection anywhere you are
this is vastly different than than the
4G strategy for Verizon and Sprint of
course where they have really four G and
then 3G but here ATT has something in
between that should be pretty awesome so
let's throw this box over here and here
we go the inspire 4G it's it's really
funny HTC has rebranded the Desire HD in
many many many different ways we had the
Evo 4G we have the Thunderbolt coming
out and now we have the inspire 4G don't
let them fool you this is the Desire HD
just with a different logo and slightly
different design which isn't necessarily
a bad thing the Desire HD has a large
4.3 inch display it's got a fast
Qualcomm one gigahertz Snapdragon
processor it's got 512 megabytes of RAM
the latest version of sense it's a
pretty sweet package so let's take a
look at the inspire 4G a lot of AT&amp;amp;T
people have really been waiting for this
phone because 18t hasn't had that huge
4.3 inch display phone yet so here we
have a Quick Start Guide here we have
the device without a little notch to
take
get outs got to turn it over pretty
heavy pretty thick first impression
let's pull out the orange goodness got
an HTC charger no headphones that's
alright we probably have this already
turned on as it was activated and
whatnot and so here we are the inspire
4G this thing is a tank very heavy you
know I don't think it's as thick as some
people are making out to be
looks like the battery door has been
sort of popped open and here is the
battery door okay pop out the battery
and this is of size let's see here here
it is twelve hundred and thirty milliamp
hours a smaller battery than the
Thunderbolt probably because the
Thunderbolt which has LTE capability on
Verizon needs more juice to be able to
run through with the LTE so let's pop
this back on if I could figure out how
to do that really weird how they've
brought over almost the HTC legend the
unibody
style of design may have to pop this
back in and cut back in okay got it in
and this should be able to pop off we've
got a SIM card in here also the microSD
slot it comes with it should be an eight
gigabyte microSD card it yep and it is a
class class - alright pretty cool so
we've got one gigabyte of built-in
storage plus another eight gigabytes
coming on the card so I've got a total
of nine gigabytes so down here it says
Dolby mobile surround sound SRS so
presumably better audio output let's
take a look around the device we've got
an 8 megapixel camera here dual LED
flash
an interesting design speaker grille
here this is gonna be annoying - trying
to keep this in hopefully it stays in
volume rocker on the left side up here
we've got a large earpiece with that's
not a front-facing camera unfortunately
unlike the HTC Thunderbolt which it does
have front facing camera capacitive
buttons look at beautiful 4.3 inch
display which picks up fingerprints
really really well so we're gonna boot
this up and while that's booting up
let's compare it to some other devices
here got the HTC hd2 of course another
device with a 4.3 inch display really
miss the design of the HD - HTC went in
the direction of sort of more rounded
edge
is the hd2 is a little bit boxy and it's
super slender because of that let's
compare it to the old Nexus S which has
a four inch screen of course we've
standard LCD over here and Super AMOLED
on the Nexus S and the iPhone of course
3.5 inch screen this thing is not
intended to really go head-to-head with
the iPhone it's just such a larger
device although if you look at it
interestingly sort of the the width and
the height isn't that much greater than
the iPhone even though it has a 4.3 inch
display so really really curious about
HSPA+ the kind of speeds we can get we
tend to benchmark as phone speeds a lot
so we have a lot of data right now it's
showing edge which is very very strange
because there's absolutely 3G in this
area it's got to move around on the
screens a little bit and just talk about
what we have this is the new version of
HTC Sense we saw this on the Desire HD
and a lot of other devices and what this
means is that we've got sort of a new
way to organize sense a new way to
personalise sense and of course we've
got the my location thing up there so
you'll see the weather clock there we go
each plus you know I want to get right
to it and run a speed benchmark because
I'm sure you're very curious about what
kinds of speeds you can get so I'm gonna
download speedtest.net I'll be right
back alright and we're back we're just
gonna quickly download speed test net
it's still using the old version of the
Android Market but of course within
probably three minutes the new version
will be pushed to this device
downloading let's go into the settings
real quick and take a look at some of
the about information curious about
certain things you've already got some
fingerprints on the screen so let's go
into down here a bat phone and let's
check Network just want to see what it
says it's very interesting it says HSDPA
and yet it says h plus implying HSPA
we'll have to look into that
let's see the software information here
so this is running on android 2.2 point
one unfortunately not Android 2.3
although this device is likely to see an
upgrade it's one of HTC's flagship
devices now they want to make sure that
they give enough loved where love is due
so let's find the speedtest.net
application you're going to see it run
for the first time here we've got a full
signal
of HSPA+ here so we should be really
getting the fastest speeds possible just
for some context AT&amp;amp;T 3G in this area
will max out at about 2.6 megabits per
second down and about 1.3 megabits per
second up that's the average of
literally hundreds of tests that we've
run from this location let's see what we
get
drumroll please okay that is probably
not accurate we're going to let this run
and we're going to run it again
sometimes speedtest.net does this it
shows a very very low speed as you just
saw it bursts it up to 1.5 yeah this is
definitely not a good representation
let's let's run it again okay test again
very strange here getting these slow
speeds we're gonna have to take this out
into the field and perhaps the device
needs some I'm gonna need some braking
in time or something well if we just saw
a burst 2 3.3 megabits per second down
so maybe something's happening here and
let's do it one more time just for good
measure hoping that it comes through and
shows us what it's really capable of
with the HSPA+ here we go no it's not so
we're gonna have to come back and talk
more about the speeds it's one of the
you know the biggest stories of this
device is the HSPA+ speeds and we're
going to come back and talk a lot about
that after we benchmark it from
different places maybe there's something
wrong with the cell tower around here
so that is the htc inspire 4G this is a
commanding phone it's very large but I
mean if you're getting this you really
want a large display but it's also quite
heavy simultaneously it's got a high
quality feel which I think many will
appreciate so if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up and we'll be
back with plenty more on the htc inspire
4G and of course check out the review
coming up in the near future on
pocketnow.com
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
