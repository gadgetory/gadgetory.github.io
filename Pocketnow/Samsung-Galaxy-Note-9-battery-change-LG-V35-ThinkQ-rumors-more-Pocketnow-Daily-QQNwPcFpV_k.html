on battery life for the galaxy note 9
finally we get rumors of the LGV lineups
feature and changes aren't so V and
don't say it and warn you but Apple
keeps struggling with its home pod I'm
Jaime Rivera and yes the p20 pro is here
as I'm now in Studio One and I'm
actually getting on a plane on Saturday
to actually review this phone as it
should stay tuned this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for the
Ghul pixel to excel it's currently
available it would obviously refurbished
in this case we have the regular Aryan
for $4.99 which is a steal but if you
want the 128 gigabyte variant it's 549
again it's refurbished you can learn
more about it in the description now for
those of you that want that Huawei P 20
pro quality camera on a mate well it's
gonna be available the mate RS on April
23rd obviously the funny part is the
price tag I mean $2,400 it's crazy but
again if you're in the market for it you
can learn more about the details on the
description now let's talk about Apple
as we know that the home pod has not
sold as the company was envisioning it
makes all the sense in the world it's
just too expensive if you look at the
math I mean the company is apparently
estimating that it's not gonna sell more
than 9 million units at a time when
Amazon echo units are selling in the
tens of millions so it's clear that the
Cupertino really needs to rethink I'm
not questioning the quality of the audio
or anything compared to the echo it's
just come on man it's a speaker and for
those of you that are wondering exactly
when we're getting a successor to the
LGB 30 we have the LGB 30s think you
plus whatever but it seems that the
company is already working on you know
the changes the update and the update
doesn't seem to bring more than what we
already get with whatever LG G 7 might
come you know the snapdragon 845 and
everything up to the point where even
the name is going to be the LG
35-knot v40 so we'll see whenever we get
that unit and finally the most
interesting news today have to do with
the possible galaxy note 9 we're
expecting it to launch in the fall but
we've got some trusted sources that are
already talking about specifications the
most significant change is the battery
life apparently we're getting a four
thousand milliamp hour power pack and
Samsung is not new to this we've seen
this with the galaxy eight active and
the galaxy s7 active for example so it
makes sense for the company to figure
out but the problem was obviously the
bad publicity that the note 7 had and
also the fact that it needs to fit the
s-pen so will the company find the way
to make this phone not so chunky and
include the battery that would be great
but in the comments today do you think
that it's time for Samsung to figure out
battery life not just on the size of the
power pack but other efficiency like
we've seen with competing devices like
you know the pixels because in my case I
feel that it has more to do with the
Samsung please figure out efficiency but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news earlier photo
