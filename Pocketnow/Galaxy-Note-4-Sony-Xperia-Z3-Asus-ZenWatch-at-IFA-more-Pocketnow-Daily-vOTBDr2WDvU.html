yes a galaxy note edge Sony steals the
show with you in another batch of hot
Xperia products and asustas it Zen watch
officially as well I'm hi melody mehta
and the first link in the description
leads to our Aoife coverage it is a lot
this is parking out daily guys there is
so much official news today I cannot
cover it in a three minute video so bear
with me here a sous is the first company
to announce products today they have
just launched the zen watch and even
though we were waiting for this product
to be more of a budget-minded Android
wear watch it turns out that it's not
it's actually a hundred ninety nine year
old watch which is a like two hundred
sixty dollars and it turns out that the
design is actually quite elegant it
looks really nice stay tuned as a let's
see what we get some hands-on coverage
for you ok now try to pay attention to
this sony has just announced the sony
xperia z3 the z3 compact the e3 the sony
xperia z3 tablet compact the SmartWatch
3 and the smart band talk god I almost
forgot so many names that have just been
announced we have so much hands-on
coverage coming up very soon but so far
the Sony Xperia z3 is obviously the
biggest news here and the compact as
well because they pretty much share the
same specifications we are kind of
disappointed with the 1080p display in
this day and age but then again
everything else about all the sony
products today is hot so expect their
hands on coverage very soon and no we're
not done with sony the company has also
launched their QX lenses for smartphones
and even though the QX 30 is probably
not the big deal it brings some major
expect bumps and stuff the coolest one
is the QX one the reason why is because
if you have sony e-mount lenses like if
you own like for example one of our sony
NEX cameras you can actually use these
lenses with that QX lens on your
smartphone that is extremely hot we
obviously have to test performance and
tell you exactly how great this is but
definitely sony is figuring out what to
do with these QX lenses obviously the
price tag will tell us a lot now let's
are about samsung as the company has
just announced the gear VR and for those
of you that were waiting for this to be
a standalone virtual reality thing it's
actually not it
next to the galaxy note 4 that we're
going to talk about next and yeah you
can pretty much amount the Galaxy Note 4
you can use it to play games it brings
its own controller we are still waiting
to see a price tag here and see just how
compelling it is but the good news is
that AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint have already
confirmed they will carry it so let's
see when we can get some more official
stuff because yeah the price tag will
make a big difference here and finally
for the hot news of the day Samsung has
just announced to Galaxy Note
smartphones the Galaxy Note 4 and the
Galaxy Note edge and even though both
phones are pretty much the same thing
when it comes to specifications 5.7 inch
2k display watch the resolution among
other great details the metal chassis
the sort of leather faux back which is
great the design of these products is
awesome and we do get the optically
stabilized 16 megapixel I so cell
shooter so there are some great things
coming now this galaxy note edge is even
cooler because it's got this like side
mount a notification tray that you can
actually use control music and other
things we have still to confirm exactly
how we will use this in the future when
we get our review unit but that leads me
to the question of the day which of
these two products when you choose the
note edge or the note 4 because in my
case I'll stick to the convention I'll
go with the galaxy note 4 but leave us a
comment down below and don't forget
we've got more Aoife coverage coming up
