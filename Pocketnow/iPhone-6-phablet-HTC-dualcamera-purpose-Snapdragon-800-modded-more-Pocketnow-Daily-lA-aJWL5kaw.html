like the iphone 5c only with different
focus we get credible reports of what to
expect for the dual cameras of the all
new HTC One and a developer just made
the Snapdragon 800 the dream processor
for many I'm hi Mary betta and probably
one of my biggest wishes for the spring
is to have a permanent air conditioning
everywhere this is poking out daily
let's say off with some official news as
AT&amp;amp;T has begun teasing the ax sous Pat
boned x on its network and even though
we don't get specifics as to when we
should expect this tablet phablet phone
or whatever you might call this thing
it's really interesting as we've never
really seen the Pat bone being sold in
the United States this would pretty much
be the first carrier to adopt it and
again we can't wait to see that price
tag especially with that tablet
accessory of the PadFone so stay tuned
we're really looking forward to this now
let's talk about the all new HTC One now
AKA ma as we get more leaks and reports
of what to expect from those dual
cameras apparently HTC is planning to do
selective focus in a very different way
currently OEMs take a lot of photos and
have that light roll effect by just
taking different selecting focus points
from these photos and the way HTC is
going to do it is taking two photos and
actually allowing you to be able to
access your photographs in less time
adding more accuracy now we still don't
know exactly if that's going to be it
meaning we still don't know exactly the
official new so stay tuned as the HTC m8
should be available on the twenty-fifth
of this month now let's talk about the
Snapdragon 800 processor but not
necessarily about Qualcomm as the
company hasn't really figured out how to
pull a Moto X with any of its processors
meaning you can't really talk to the
phone and make it wake up it's not
always listening to you but a developer
just figured out how to do it and even
though there is a work in progress this
is really buggy at the moment it's
really interesting that a third party
figures out how to do something so cool
let's just see how it goes eventually
hopefully Qualcomm can hire the guy now
let's talk about the apple vs samsung
patent dispute as i know the soap opera
is extremely boring but even more
interesting is the fact that there is no
reports that apple is actually asking
forty dollars as a licensing
p for all of its patents for samsung and
this is really interesting as analysts
have now predicted that those forty
dollars are exactly how much money at
samsung is making it profits from any
smartphone that's below four hundred
dollars and we know that the galaxy
lineup actually sells more in the low to
your phone's meaning Apple is actually
looking for a way to not make money out
of Samson what they want is for the
company cannot make profits out of
smartphones which is actually even more
interesting so stay tuned as a judge
could either rule in favor of that or
against that that's going to be
interesting and finally for the hot news
of the day let's talk about Apple is we
get two very interesting leaks number
one there talk of iOS 8 and iOS 9
apparently I was eight will be launched
this year at WWDC and even though we do
expect it to look exactly like iOS 7 one
of the things that apparently Apple will
push is maps as they've hired three
companies to make this better and decide
from that another one of the reports is
that we get details on what to expect
from the iphone 6 but the phablet
variant apparently this phone will look
a lot like the iphone 5c and designing
and though this will be an aluminum
chassis and not probably carpeted but
that leads you to the question of the
day are you really interested in a
phablet from Apple will that make you
choose an apple product as opposed to a
galaxy note 3 for example because and I
particular case I'll be honest with you
i am an iphone user and therefore i am
also a galaxy note 3 users so for me
that would probably be the best of both
worlds but not necessarily leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video was filming she follow us on park
and i'll comment subscribe to our
youtube channel as well you know also
follow me on twitter hi meanders
quarterly data please give this video
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
high memory that I thank you very much
for watching we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
