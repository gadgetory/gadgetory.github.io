pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to show you the browsing
experience on the HTC hero then in a few
minutes we're going to compare the
browsing experience the rendering
fidelity and speed with windows mobile
and also iphone so that's coming up in a
few minutes but first let's talk about
the browsing experience on the HTC hero
and let's get a little bit closer in on
the screen okay so right now we are over
Wi-Fi and you'll notice that i also have
opera mini loaded on here this is from
the market app store on android and the
reason i have that is because this
device doesn't have us 3g so it really
helps to have a web browser that uses
server-side rendering to kind of
increase page load times it would be
great if skyfire had a version for
android but they don't yet skyfire does
the same thing as opera mini but i think
a little bit better so let's go into the
web browser on the hero and the web
browser on the hero makes really good
use of screen space it always goes full
screen much like most of the
applications and android and to get to
any sort of function you have to press
the Menu key doing so and right now
we're in landscape it looks like let's
flip it back over doing so will bring up
the address bar plus some buttons that
we're going to explore later so let's go
to a website let's go to pocket now calm
and we'll see how long it takes it's
already coming up here and it's done it
was about 15-20 seconds which isn't too
bad a little bit slow and as you can see
it's doing the it's doing flash up here
and just like you saw before we can
rotate to landscape although it takes a
little bit too long the hero does have
multitouch so you can pinch to zoom out
although it's strange that it starts
zoomed in it should start actually
zoomed out a bit more and of course you
can flick downwards like so and what you
don't get as seen with other mobile
browsers is the grid pattern if you flip
down really fast so it has really good
rendering capability in terms of
refreshing the page you can also use the
trackball if you want to flick up
forward kind of makes for a nice scroll
actually and if we want to zoom in we
can double tap on a column and it will
resize the column although it kind of
fakes it this should be a bit wider and
we can zoom a little bit more we can
move it around on the page and see
websites just like they appear on the
desktop now if we go down here and hit
the menu button we can do a few things
for example we can go to the selection
of windows right now I've two windows
open you kind of get this coverflow like
look to the different windows that are
open and here we are on a YouTube page
and I'm going to play this video which
is obviously flash-based and and I say
the hero sort of does flash because on
flash banners and certain flash
applications it will work but in the
case of hulu hulu does not work here on
we were on a YouTube page and we
couldn't get the streaming youtube video
right on the page actually what happens
is it links to the YouTube application
kind of like the iphone does with
YouTube videos so let's go and open up a
new window and go to a different website
so we can just press the plus button
here now let's go to cnet.com see how
that looks and so it brings up the
keyboard as the dot-com built in and
we'll hit go let's do landscape
okay it's done already it looks like we
have the mobile version of cnet right
now and so there's not really much to
zoom out on we can tap along to reviews
and again we got the mobile version so
it's a lot faster than the full desktop
version although we can go down here to
view full cnet site so see what it looks
like on the hero here we are on the full
cnet site and let's see how it looks
zoomed out still loading a little bit it
looks pretty good we get the flash
animation we get all of the text align
the way it should be we can pinch to
zoom or double tap to zoom in so pretty
so pretty good in terms of rendering
fidelity let's go into the menu and see
what kind of options that we have so we
can go back it's kind of unfortunate the
back button isn't built right into the
screen it's great that the android
browser takes advantage of the entire
screen but again you have to drill into
a setting or the menu button to do
really anything to go back or to press
refresh or this becomes a stop button if
it's loading the page so we can make
into a bookmark or we can go to more and
there are some items we have here let's
go to settings see what kind of settings
there on the web browser and change the
homepage by default it's HTC com you can
choose to load images on web pages if
you want to save on data and make it
come up faster and block popup windows
you can turn on or off the mobile view
if you want to have pages load faster
enable JavaScript new windows open
behind the current one or if they open
the current one change the text size and
it actually may make sense to make it
smaller so that you see more on the
screen at one time if your eyes can
handle it and then clear cookie data
clear cache it'll save passwords and all
that sort of advanced stuff that you get
on a desktop browser change the cache
size enable plugins although I'm not
sure of any plugins that work with this
browser I'm sure there are some in the
application store and you can reset
everything back to default okay so we're
going to try to pull off an amazing feat
here by getting all three of these
devices to launch engadget at the same
time got the omnia to running windows
mobile using opera mobile 9.5 the
phone 3gs running Safari and the HTC
hero running the Android browser so
let's try to do this at the same exact
time not making any promises let's see
what we can do here okay ready set go
and they're off nice okay the iphone 3gs
looks like it's ahead and it won iphone
3gs one followed by the hero gonna win
or the omnia it's close call progress
bars are still loading their much
further behind the iphone 3gs living
some final elements in the page hero
second place omnia coming up in last
place still not done here it goes so
let's move around the web pages see kind
of how they look notice how the hero
starts in a zoomed in position and then
the and then the iphone 3gs kind of is
very much zoomed out and then the omnia
is kind of halfway there it's got part
of the page there it may be hard to tell
but the AMOLED screen on the omnia two
is really showing its stuff right now
it's just beautiful with the blacks and
how crisp everything is so let's kind of
move down the page and see what it's
like to just flick down the page so it
looks like the omnia has a problem with
redrawing the page if you move down too
fast the iphone 3gs moves a little bit
slower but it doesn't have the problem
with the checkerboard and nor does the
HTC hero which doesn't have as smooth
scrolling as the iphone 3gs but it can
actually go a little bit faster so let's
let's zoom into a column I'm going to
zoom out on all of these and for this
well we're already zoomed out let's find
the story at the top and zoom into the
text all the way up here by double
tapping on the entry here we are so I'm
going to double tap here see what it
looks like so cut it wraps the text but
doesn't weird way the iphone 3gs formats
it perfectly and the omnia
who kind of does it very similarly to
the hero it doesn't actually it wraps
the column in a smaller area than then
the iphone so let's zoom out again and
let's go to another web page okay next
up we've Yahoo Finance so we've got them
loaded up here and we're going to hit go
try to do at the same time here one two
three go there we go and they're off
iphone 3gs is looks like it's coming up
first yep its first hero is the omnia
two may actually beat the hero Wow
almost the same time to hear on the
omnia two so again let's take a look at
look at how these three devices render
Yahoo Finance so again the iphone 3gs
starts from a very zoomed out position
the samsung omnia does kind of halfway
zoomed out but it's not completely
zoomed out and on the hero it starts in
the upper left corner of the site which
actually doesn't really make a lot of
sense so we can pinch to get the the
outside view so let's just scroll down
the page to a little flick and see how
it works it goes right to the bottom
it's a little bit smoother here and it
went right down without having any
checkerboard now let's do a test of the
screen rotation in yahoo finance now
turning over three devices at the same
time it's probably going to be very
difficult so we're going to do these two
at a time first we'll compare the omnia
with the iphone so okay so the iphone is
a bit faster and turn it back over okay
let's do that again
I don't think that was fair I didn't
turn it completely over and Saddam me is
definitely slower than the iphone let's
compare the omnia to the hero and screen
rotation speed and so now it's hard to
see at this angle it ready go well the
hero went very very fast the omnia two
is slower and let's compare the hero
with the iphone in the screen rotation
speed test so let's flip over now faster
on the iphone 3gs faster again just
faster by half a second not very
significant the hero has pretty fast
screen rotation speed sometimes that
half a second feels like a long time so
overall the web browser on the HTC hero
is quite good it's not as fast as the
iphone 3gs and it does have some flaws
like it starts the page zoomed in
instead of zoomed out but it does
perform well and it doesn't have the
checkerboard pattern that sometimes we
find in Opera Mobile 9.5 it doesn't have
full flash support it kind of has half
flash support it doesn't let you look at
hula videos or certain other video sites
but most of the mobile browsers like you
know Opera Mobile 9.5 and Safari on the
iPhone don't support flash anyway so
that's not really expected so that's it
on the web browsing experience on the
HTC hero we'll be back soon to talk
about the market and the whole
application buying process on the HTC
hero we'll be back soon with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
