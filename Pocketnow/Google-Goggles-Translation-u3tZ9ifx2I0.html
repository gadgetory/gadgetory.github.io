pocketnow.com today i'm gonna revisit an
app that's been out for a little while
it's called Google Goggles Google
Goggles
is a really hard program to pronounce
when you say it really fast and I'm
probably going to screw it up a few
times so forgive me in advance but what
it lets you do is it harnesses the power
of Google to search stuff using your
phone's camera so there's lots of cool
stuff that it can do can search for
books it can search logos it can search
barcodes it can even scan business cards
and contact information and allow you to
import them right into your phone so
it's really cool but they just
introduced something else and that's a
Translate module so I'm gonna hurry and
show you just a brief overview of a
whole bunch of stuff that it can do and
then we're going to jump right into
translate so let's go take a look okay
this is a Nexus One running Android 2.2
but goggles will work on any Android
device running Android 1.6 and above the
icon looks like a pair of 3d glasses
with the word goggles underneath it well
tap that and the first thing that you'll
notice is it's basically just a camera
app but it is GPS enabled GPS is turned
on by default if you can see a little
GPS icon down in the corner so because
this is a camera app it stands to reason
that you can scan stuff like barcodes
with the camera so we'll go ahead and do
that it auto focuses takes the picture
and then runs through and does a
recognition in this case it says that
it's scanned a barcode and it came up
with Firefly the complete series yadda
yadda yadda it's got some web search
results gives you a link to compare
prices at Google Product Search does
some text matches and even shows you the
picture that it took and lets you just
come down here and type in a search
phrase if that wasn't at all what you
wanted so that's kind of cool it can
also do more complex barcodes like I
showed you in my QR code video this can
scan QR codes as long as I can find the
QR code in the viewfinder I'm going to
take
that picture it'll autofocus and
recognize and you can see there it found
a URL that's tappa below and in fact
that's the right URL if we tap that it's
going to go ahead and launch the web
browser and put that right there into
your browser so pretty neat let's go and
see what else goggles can do so barcodes
are cool but let's say back to Firefly
let's see we don't have a barcode here
the barcode is damaged or missing that's
a problem
so goggles want you to do something
really neat and that is we're just gonna
come in here and take a picture of the
cover and I'm not even going to get all
of the cover just some of it and if we
look it's doing its recognition and lo
and behold it found that this is the
same thing that it found what it was
doing the barcode search has the same
set of results has some similar results
and there's the picture that we took so
that's really cool let's see what other
stuff it can do this is a book by
Margaret Wiese called ghost Legion it's
the 4th book in her start of the
Guardians trilogy don't ask me how phors
and 3 but anyway we're gonna do the same
thing here take a picture and it scans
through all that and this time it didn't
find anything we're gonna try one more
time and then move on we'll get a little
bit more of the book here and it's going
through and scanning that again and this
time it got it this is ghost Legion can
print compare prices on it we can even
preview that book at Google Book Search
so we'll go ahead and do that it loads
up books.google.com has a book review
has user ratings lots of cool stuff
about the book so let's get back one of
the things that Google Goggles does is
logo recognition so I've got a empty
bottle of Vicks nyquil cough let's scan
that see what we come up with this is
really hard to hold the camera and take
pictures like this so bear with me
so there's the picture and there's the
scanning and it found a logo in this
case nyquil so it didn't figure out that
that was my quill cold and cough but it
did find the Vicks nyquil logo and it
gives us some web results that help out
with that now if we wanted to find the
exact product we could always come over
here and scan the barcode and see what
results that gave us and it did pretty
good it says this is an antihistamine
cough suppressant cherry-flavored 10
ounces and sure enough this is a
histamine cough suppressant analysis so
perfect recognition there this is
something more complicated it's a
business card you may have seen these if
you do any kind of business people like
to hand them out has their contact
information on them but what it doesn't
have is a quick and easy way to get that
information into your phone so this is
real-world stuff guys so if you show up
at my house make sure you have a pizza
some mountain dew something like that if
you call me go ahead and leave a
constructive message you may all do the
same thing be nice so we'll put that in
our viewfinder and we'll take a picture
and see how it does and right there it
found my address it found my title it
found my name and it's asking me if I
want to add it to contacts which one
touch I can go ahead and do that so
that's great if it were in a different
language I could even translate that and
then it gives me some web results which
are all very relevant the first two
results are my website the next one is
actually a link to me that somebody else
has put up there so that's kind of cool
and then of course I've gotten the
picture if I need to refer to it and
don't have that business card anymore so
really really neat but this Translate
thing is kind of interesting so let's
take a look at that what I've got here
is a French textbook and this textbook
has French in it and I can't speak
French I can't read French I
know that French is a language that they
speak somewhere in a country near Spain
but what I want to do is I can't get the
text that I want that's that's this text
right here in the frame without messing
up so I'm gonna use this other feature
which is the crop tool which I don't
like the way they implement it because
you have to crop on your viewfinder not
on the taken picture so that's kind of
awkward as you can see but you can
highlight basically what you want it to
take a picture of and it'll only scan
that which makes your scans faster and
more accurate it just have to make sure
you keep it in the right orientation so
we'll go ahead and do that it's taking
that picture and it's scanning through
right now and in this case I've found a
bird book not what I wanted and not the
result that I got when I tested this out
so let's try again again this is just
the text
and in this case it got the text so
great let's go ahead and translate that
it automatically detects that it was in
French and it tells me that this says in
the fall we play football in winter it's
cold it rains a lot in the spring it
goes to the beach in the summer ok great
I don't know if that's what that says or
not maybe one of my French viewers can
help me translate that more accurately
and see if it did a pretty good job but
as far as I can tell since this picture
up here talks about looks like the beach
it looks like there's a park and
football which in America we call this
soccer and then skiing over here it
looks like that is contextually relevant
and and pretty good so if I were and
France and needed to find out what a
sign said I could use my Google phone
running Android and Google Goggles to
quickly take a picture of that and scan
it in and translate it now I've even
seen some times where some translations
have a speak option I think that's more
on the web side but I think that's
coming over to this app sometime soon so
keep your fingers crossed but how cool
would that be
if you could see something that you
didn't know what it said take a picture
of it and have it speak it back to you
in the native language and then in the
translated language as well so really
we're just one step closer to to living
in a Star Trek universe here with a
universal translator in this case and of
course that would be your pad but all
kinds of cool stuff what kind of stuff
have you scanned using Google Goggles
again let me get back here and show you
this is it neat is it lame is it a pain
do you like to use it have you ever
dropped your phone when you're doing
that that crop tool I'd like to know
there's one other feature that I haven't
showed you here and that's the little
what sneer made geo pin I'm gonna do an
entirely separate video about that we'll
do it outside on location but go ahead
and give Google Goggles a try and let
know how your searches turn out you can
see in this video we were about 8090
percent accurate but I want to know
about you is it any better for you or is
it just kind of lame is it a tool that
you'd use all the time or is it
something you'd install and then throw
away let me know in the comments then
talking about Google Goggles I am Joe
