calm and today we're going to go over
DVD catalyst three this is the answer to
the question that many people have on
how to watch movies on your phone it's
very simple DVD catalyst 3 is hands down
one of the best DVD and movie converters
out there for ten dollars it's a steal
there's also a booster pack that is
available that will enable you to take
advantage of the multiple processors on
many of today's computers so let's do a
quick overview you open up tools for
movies DVD catalyst 3 is the retail
version I've converted to eat terminator
salvation here and I'll show you how
that works if you want one thing that's
important to know about DVD catalyst 3
is it's not per device this works for
all the devices that you can buy it it's
updated all the time so under here we
have all kinds of devices here I mean
everything from t mobile devices to
BlackBerry's 28 the HTC devices for
example the touch pro two right there
you can go down to the Microsoft devices
these covers lots of the windows mobile
devices and the pocket pcs you can go
all the way up to Windows Mobile five
and six the vga versions as well so for
this demonstration we're going to go to
the t-mobile we're going to pick my
touch 3g there's also the g1 available
in here now if you want go ahead and
verify that your settings are what you
want them you can change them here if
you don't know what your player screen
sizes for your phone just go ahead and
go to PDA day 2 DB net and search for
your phone for example i'll type in the
shadow here and we'll get to results and
i can click on either of these and get
the screen size
just go ahead and click here and I'll
bring up the phone specs and there we
are display resolution 240 x 320 we're
doing the mytouch 3G so we're just going
to leave things as is right there now if
I insert a DVD it'll recognize it it'll
tell us how long it is if we can convert
it file size the Indian file size of
what it will be convert to or just hit
go right before we come down here and
hit preview for a preview before we do
that let's take a look at some global
settings here tons of customization
available in DVD catalyst 3 you can
customize closed captions your audio
selections what the default subtitle
selections will be I suggest always
using subtitles if you're converting for
a device like phone because you might
not always have your headphones with you
and you might not be able to hear the
movie all the time so you'll be able to
understand what's being said you can
there is automatic movie and episode
recognition so if you insert a season
disc from the unit or you know law and
order something that you watch it'll
recognize the different episodes and you
can have those converted separately you
can change the conversion priority how
much of the processor you want it to use
remove black bars you can have it
converted automatically so if you have
something like utorrent running in the
background downloading some torrents and
dropping these videos into certain
folder you can have DVD catalyst
recognize those and automatically
convert them for you there's also
booster pack available that will enable
you to take full advantage of the
different processors that you have and
some advanced features such as shutting
down DVD catalyst when it's done or
shutting down the computer when it's
done converting in case you're worried
about or you're concerned about your
energy bill alright so going back to the
selection q there it is all we have to
do is click go and click go and it will
convert it terminator salvation on a 2
core 2.4 gigahertz processor looking at
the AMD turion 64 will take about 30
minutes it's an hour and 54 minute long
movie and will come out with a 625
megabyte file when we're done once it's
done it'll open up the folder showing
where they actually save the file to and
from there else you have to do is copy
it onto your device the website is tools
