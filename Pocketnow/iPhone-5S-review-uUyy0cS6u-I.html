5 but is it enough to keep up with what
the competition is going to come out
with over the next 12 months hey guys
it's Brandon Minnemann from pocket now
this is our full review of the iPhone 5s
let's get to it
last year we sang the praises of the
iPhone 5 it's hardware speed camera and
fantastic one-handed usability led us to
highly recommend the phone this year
Apple is keeping a lot the same while
improving upon several key areas where
the iPhone 5 has now fallen behind in
the face of competition there are three
areas where the 5s is different than the
5 and actually the 5c one the a7 64-bit
chip 2 a camera with improved low-light
performance and some new shooting modes
and three a fingerprint security scanner
but in actuality there are other areas
in which the 5s is better than the 5 and
5c and we'll cover those in the test
notes section of this review let's start
off talking about hardware you know it's
a 5s because the home button has a
metallic border that matches the color
of the body of the phone the metal
border stands out the most on the gold
or silver versions as the Space Gray has
a black ring around the home button that
is difficult to see unless you're
looking for it we tested both a Space
Gray and silver version of the 5s the
Space Gray is a lot nicer than last
year's black model because the metal is
a lighter color that hides fingerprints
better the silver color is the same as
the previous white model in the new 5s
the home button is actually flat which
is very similar in feel to the curved
concave button that we've come to expect
from other iPhone models flipping over
to the back we can see that the typeface
of the word iPhone is a little less bold
than last year
perhaps in a nod to iOS 7's new thinner
typography at the top we can see the new
dual tone flash along with the larger
camera sensor the display is the same 11
36 by 64 IPS panel used in the iPhone 5
and 5c it's a really good screen with
excellent brightness color saturation
and contrast but compared to 1080p
screens that take sharpness to a whole
new level
the iPhones display starting to feel a
bit dated that said the excellent
one-handed usability is obviously still
there
the iPhone 5 had some terrible
durability problems after just moderate
use our iPhone 5 had numerous chips and
scratches especially on the metal edges
we're hoping that Apple has solved this
issue with the 5s but only time will
tell
let's talk about some of the features
unique to the 5s those of you that use a
pin on your phone to unlock will love
touch ID which is the name for Apple's
fingerprint scanner in the home button
setting up touch ID requires you to use
a pin on your phone once you do that you
can associate multiple fingers to your
phone whether there are your own fingers
or someone else's the setup process is
quick and easy and in practice the phone
recognizes your fingerprint in about a
second making it almost as fast that's
just sliding to unlock your phone which
you won't need to do if you're using
touch ID but there's a big downside to
touch ID it's use is limited only to
unlocking your device and for paying for
purchases in the App Store
even Apple's own apps like find my
friends in the Apple Store cannot use
touch ID but overall we can see Apple
using touch ID in all of its future
products we just hope that it's useful
to be expanded one day with a developer
API the iPhone 5s is powered by 64-bit
multi-core a7 CPU with a gigabyte of RAM
in practice this makes the 5s faster
than the 5 but by about a beat
meaning apps open a tad faster webpages
load a bit more quickly and so on but as
of the time of this video 0 apps have
been updated that we can find that have
been rewritten in 64-bit it's only a
matter of time before that happens
especially for games but we're not
likely to see Facebook or Instagram
upgraded anytime soon because those apps
really can't take advantage of 64-bit
architecture in their current form so we
don't recommend that you buy a 5s
because you think it's going to be much
faster than a 5 or 5c because that's
just not going to be the case along with
the a7 CPU we get the m7 coprocessor
which is designed to measure motion data
in a separate low-power chip this means
that fitness apps and apps that use the
accelerometer gyroscope or compass will
be more power efficient it will also do
things like predict when you're inactive
like sleeping and it will reduce network
pinging helping to improve battery
and then there's the camera the f 2.2
aperture lens let's in more light and
the two-tone flash helps to avoid bright
white photo shots and very low light
where the flash fires the iPhone 5 was
falling behind in low-light photography
compared to devices like the HTC One and
Lumia 1020 this the 5s is new camera fix
the problem it helps but it's not a huge
leap the 8 megapixel daytime photos come
out about the same as the 5 but when
there is limited light the 5s excels
with far less noise present and shots
taken without a flash take a look at
these photos taken in dark situations
with the 5 and then the 5s there's a
clear difference especially when no
flash is used however we're not sold on
the true tone flash in our tests using
the flash on the 5s resulted in slightly
warmer photos but not to the degree of
making or breaking a photo nighttime
video also benefits from the larger lens
as you can see here with decent
visibility and limited noise the camera
software has some neat improvements in
the 5s first is burst shot which isn't
new to smartphones but new to the iPhone
you can hold down the shutter button on
the 5s and take dozens and dozens of
photos then the phone can try to guess
which ones are the best or you can do it
for yourself this is great for
situations where there's a lot of motion
then there is slow motion video which
again isn't new to smartphones but new
to the iPhone you can capture 120 frames
per second video and then go back and
choose which parts of the video be one
in slow motion and which you want in
regular and it's a fun tool to use we're
not going to cover I oh s 7 because it's
been out for a while than most people
that are using iOS devices already have
it on the 5s iOS 7 works great there's
not much more we can say about that now
for some test notes in terms of speaker
output we found the v s/s speaker to be
significantly louder and clearer than
the 5 which is nice it's still not as
loud as boom sound on the HTC one but
it's actually a close second in terms of
battery life the 5s has a battery that
is 10 percent larger than the 5 does
that lead to better battery
yeah slightly the iPhone 5 under normal
use could easily go about 12 hours
without needing a charge under mixed use
the iPhone 5s can go a bit longer under
similar situations going for about 13 or
14 hours off the charger Apple is making
a new case for the 5s after taking a
break from making cases for the 5 it's
made from a high-grade leather which we
should add passes our smell test and you
pay for it at 40 bucks of course there
are many other less expensive cases you
can buy for your 5s and cases for the 5
will indeed fit the 5s but the Apple
made cases especially nice and it comes
in a variety of colors now of course the
iPhone 5s doesn't have a big screen with
1080p resolution nor does it have the
unparalleled flexibility of Android but
if you're buying an iPhone you have a
different agenda you appreciate a
fantastically well rounded phone that
does many things well all while keeping
one-handed usability in mind we give the
iPhone 5s a 9 out of 10 so that's going
to do it for our iPhone 5s coverage if
you want to see our review of the iPhone
5c Michael Fischer did a great video and
we'll put a link up here so you can jump
back to that post about comparisons
between the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5
the 5c and the 5 the 5 seen the 5s we've
done it all and be sure to check out the
full review on pocket now coming up on
the 5s and the 5c is already up so check
that out thanks for watching and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
