Android lollipop version 5.0 for the LG
Nexus 4
let's go hands-on and see what you can
expect when you get the OTA or sideload
lollipop on your Nexus 4 so here we've
got the LG Nexus 4 complete with its
very sparkly back cover I've got a SAG
invisible shield over the back of that
just because yeah exactly
how slippery they are so let's go ahead
and fire this up now this I went ahead
and downloaded the system image and I
flashed this which means I wiped
everything out and started all from
scratch so let's go ahead and take a
look in here we'll do our double
pulldown that works we can do our two
finger pulldown let's go ahead and go
into settings and if you notice there
was a little rotation there on the COG
so we've gotten used to with Android
lollipop let's go down to about phone
android 5.0 this is indeed the nexus 4
and we are running the lrx 21 t build
which is the one that i download and
installed now i've only been running
this for about a day or a day and a half
so far i'm quite impressed the
animations are a little bit less fluid
than they are in the nexus 5 but the
phone itself feels like it's still about
the same speed everything is quick I
mean you saw that animation right there
animated up from the app drawer and
everything comes in nice and fast the
whole thing just seems nice and fluid
let's go ahead and switch over here I
don't have any internet connection so
we're gonna just kind of skip my my
google now but that's ok
overall everything is nice everything is
quick we've got all the animations that
we've become accustomed to you can go
out and get this right now today and
flash it on your nexus 4 if you want to
you don't have to though let's go ahead
and switch over to my other nexus 4 I
know how it'd be right so this is the
OTA it is come in here just a little bit
almost 400 megabytes 390 4.4 for this
particular model the nice thing about
this is you're not gonna lose any of
your settings you're not going to lose
any
data at least that's the theory so
what's gonna happen here is we're just
gonna go ahead and let that finish up
installing it's gonna reboot a couple
times while it updates and goes from
there while we're here let me go ahead
and show you that this in fact is not
version 5 this is version 4.4 kitkat in
fact running the KTU 84 p build so let's
go ahead and just do kind of a
side-by-side there so you can see what
they look like and this is really hard
dual wielding phones so you go ahead and
grab that again for you back in about
phone so there's our our differences
nice animations at the top and bottom
over here in the valley pop version
let's go back home you can see our our
buttons down the bottom very lollipop
over here very KitKat over there we'll
go back home about the same speed okay
about the same go ahead and open the app
drawers a little bit quicker over here
on on the lollipop version but there you
go now everything else is pretty much
what you're accustomed to the updates
happen the same way you've got all of
the new apps that Google is updating so
the apps over here the new material
design apps are going to look the same
as the material design apps and lollipop
has on KitKat but all in all it's very
nice the big question that we've got is
how is battery life going to be using
the brand new lollipop version and
project Volta which should do better
with battery life than the KitKat
version like I said we've only had this
in hand for about a day day and a half
we're curious to find out your
experiences too so especially with the
battery life and performance let us know
down in the comments how the battery
life is like on your Nexus 4 running
lollipop and stay tuned to our social
networks I'm at Joe Levi over on Twitter
and over the next several days I'm going
to be posting my thoughts and my
experiences with the Nexus 4 you won't
want to miss out on that for PocketNow
showing off the latest and greatest
operating systems on well a little bit
older hardware I'm Joe Levi
thanks for watching and we'll catch you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
