than ever the verizon nokia lumia sapir
in photos and according to consumer
reports the iphones purple haze is
normal um hi meri behna wondering if I
look a little purple right now because
somebody said it was normal and this is
parking out daily Google is doing a
great job at beating Apple like a dead
horse at times when Apple can barely get
maps on iOS 6 right google has just
published 250,000 additional miles of
Street View for countries in Europe Asia
some portions of the united states and
even south africa the update is
automatic for people that have street
view like for example android customers
iOS customers will sadly have to use the
browser speaking of google let's do a
little more nexus talking this time
photos have emerged of the LG e960 and
if you look at it this time it's not
blurry it looks exactly like the current
generation galaxy nexus with a couple of
changes at the back though the good news
in there if those could have been
considered good news because first of
all that Samsung I 9260 that was rumored
to be the galaxy nexus 2 is actually the
galaxy premier and don't even get me
talking about that galaxy s3 mini
because it was released today and it's
terrible and verizon has just announced
the availability of their motorola droid
razr HD and Droid Razr HD Maxx and these
names are long but hey first of all it
took them five weeks to finally announce
that we'll be able to pick them up on
october 18th and you get the droid razr
HD for 200 bucks after 2-year contract
and the HD max I'm not going to say the
full name man for 300 bucks no pre order
information yet apparently you'll just
have to go pick them up at the store and
speaking of Verizon recent leak photos
now show a new nokia lumia 822 and you
guessed it just after the photos emerged
now we're hearing rumors of the nokia
lumia 920 to coming to verizon now it's
a clear of big red will have these
devices before Black Friday with that
exclusivity 480 with those number
changes in everything but at least it
does seems like if Nokia got the memo
and finally for the contradictory news
of the day Consumer Reports has just
come on record
show that that purple haze on the iphone
5 when taking photos at direct sunlight
is normal they even showed photos of the
galaxy s3 in a similar scenario taking
photos of direct sunlight and they show
that that purple haze happens to the
galaxy s three as well and well that
leads me to the question of the day do
you have any problems with purple hazing
your photos you should probably go
outside and give it a try I've own
smartphones in 2007 and I never had
Barney pop up in my photos but leave us
a comment down below now if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on
pacquiao com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
