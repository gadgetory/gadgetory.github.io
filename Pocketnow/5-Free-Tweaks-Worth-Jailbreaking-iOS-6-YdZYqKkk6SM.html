iPhone and we even told you our top 5
reasons why you should jailbreak iOS 6
but still people ask us what makes
jailbreaking worth it so I'm Jaime
Rivera
this is fucking now I'm gonna give you
five different things that annoy me
about iOS 6 and 5 different solutions
that you can get with a jailbreak for
free ok so one of my biggest annoyances
with iOS 6 is the fact that if you want
to go to Settings you pretty much need
to do it in the settings application so
you need to leave whatever application
you're on to actually be able to do
anything the cool thing about
jailbreaking is that there's this
service that's free and that's extremely
all called SBS settings all you need to
do is little swipe and it will give you
different our goals to enable 3G enable
Bluetooth control your brightness for
example turn on or off data location you
can actually even kill applications that
are currently running in the background
without the need to actually leave the
service and you can just end it right
there and that's simply it SPS settings
is completely free and it's worth every
penny it's completely skinnable and
there are actually different toggles you
could get another one of my annoyances
with iOS is Siri it's not the best voice
assistant out there and the problem
Google Voice is you really have to go
into the assistant and call it up the
cool thing about jailbreaking is that
there's this free service called now now
you could be anywhere you want and I
haven't set the tap and hold the clock
and there we go speak now and how tall
is Barack Obama and singing it's time
and it'll give me an answer but the
point is now now will enable for you to
use Google Voice Search you can still
call on Siri by pressing and holding but
if you don't want Siri press and hold or
whatever command you set it and you can
use Google Voice Search so if you're
asking yourself how am I able to call on
voice search by tapping and holding the
clock or how am I able to call on SBS
settings with a simple swipe well that's
because jailbreakers kept this free
service called activator and it's
actually even available when you
jailbreak and the cool thing about
activator is that you can set the device
to do whatever you want from anywhere so
let's say that I want to set triple
press to do something specific let's
look for something that I use usually
which would probably be going into
whatever let's go into the equalizer so
let's just get out of here one two three
then get there right 1 2 3 and there we
go here we are in the settings equalizer
and the cool thing about activator is
that you don't only set things whenever
you're anywhere you can for example set
that whenever you are within the home
screen you get a specific call of action
whenever you're within an application
you get specific commands whenever
you're in the lock screen you get
specific commands you can toggle
anything to your volume up volume down
buttons anything you want you can even
recommend whatever you want the home
button to do which is really cool so
there are even gestures included I do
recommend you have a look another one of
my biggest annoyances with iOS is
whenever I want to get rid of the
keyboard let's say I'm in Evernote and
let's say that I am writing a specific
note right now and I'm typing right now
but I for some reason probably this note
is long and I want to get rid of the
keyboard well in iOS 6 you can't really
do that but there's this cool service
called pull to dismiss that's free where
you simply swipe and you get rid of the
keyboard tap again to start typing swipe
down to get rid of the keyboard it
doesn't work if you try to do it from
the keyboard you actually have to do it
from the top of the keyboard down but
again whenever you're in any specific
area that you
want to get rid of the keyboard just
swipe down and you get rid of it really
genies have you asked me I really can't
figure out why Apple hasn't done this
and finally another thing that really
annoys me is that well you only get four
icons in the dock you can't really
select more icons there are a lot of
services that allow you to bring more
icons to the dock but there's a free one
that you could just look for which is
called five icons ah it's completely
free and for example in my case I use
Gmail a lot but I also use messaging in
Safari and Mail and phone as well so
let's say I want to pull Gmail out of
here and it's as simple as activating
the service and now I get five icons on
my dog again these five services that
we've just the motor probably thinks you
already knew about if you already been
to jailbreak communities in the past but
if you're completely new to jailbreaking
yes these are five different things that
completely Madden ourselves from iOS
that you can simply fix with
jailbreaking and as you can see these
don't really require much resources from
your device so you're not really losing
anything it doesn't power down your
battery and it's just really cool
I do recommend that's it for a quick
