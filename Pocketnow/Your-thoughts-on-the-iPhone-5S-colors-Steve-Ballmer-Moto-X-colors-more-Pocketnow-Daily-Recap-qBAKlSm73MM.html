300 to 500 comments a day sometimes a
thousand and we can respond to every one
of them but we do read them a lot so we
thought we'd try something new I'm hi
Matt Rivera this is pocket now and this
is our pocket nail daily recap for last
week last Monday I asked you if you like
color on your phones the news were about
the iphone 5s probably bringing color
and we've got 553 comments out of which
let's go through some of them a bill
allah says no color apple how will I os7
blend in and to be honest with you
you're kind of right i mean iOS 7 is so
colorful i can't imagine a colorful
phone with a colorful you on as hard
shadow says no cases it disrupts the
aesthetics until you drop the phone and
probably the reason for that was because
i said that with the iphone at least you
get the option of a case and well
honestly yeah you're kind of right i
don't like cases myself the only benefit
is the fact that it sounds like the
iphone you just have to use a case
anyways stephen tiller which is a
frequent commodore said no either white
or black and you'd be surprised i think
about sixty to seventy percent of the
comments said no we don't want color on
our phones and it's probably something
we just have to dive in eventually and
then a code that i'm not even gonna try
to pronounce here said that yes a
product red iphone would be cool and
you're kind of right it would be awesome
to have the option for color especially
if it's for a benefit of something
honestly color is just one of those
things that you do see it in cars you do
see it a clothing but i don't know i
haven't seen color and watches yet or at
least not in a dog watches is what i'm
trying to say on tuesday of last week I
asked you if you like the customizable
phone concept because we know what the
Moto X can do we got 211 comments out of
which for example a bra and I'm sorry
man i'm not trying to butcher your name
everybody butchers mine all the time but
you say that we should give motorola
credit for what they've done in the
comment is kind of long but bottom line
is you're right yes we should give
motorola credit nobody's doing it we
thought about this concept years ago but
we probably thought about it more on the
option of thinking of your processor or
ram options and everything but still i
think that color is a right direction
they're starting with it and you're not
obligated to buy color you could just go
for a black or white phone which is
great then we have given johnson who
says yes i would like a customizable
phone concept because it's different and
unique and you're right you
won't be the same guy in the crowd that
has the same phone that everybody has
yes you could have the same phone but
it's gonna be unique to you actually and
another commoner with a code name here
says I love custom colors but I'll never
engrave my phone you know that's a
really good point engraving is really
complicated because you're stuck with a
phone for you unless you figure out a
name like powered by webos or something
like that that somebody else could like
you're pretty much stuck to the phone
and finally Brian a says ipad apple will
not be excited and yeah competition is
actually very interesting and we'd love
it now in wednesday of last week I asked
you if you would still like a keyword a
keyboard on your phone because LG is
bringing this cheap uh well affordable
phone out there that has accurate a
keyboard and I got 547 comments here out
of which let's say for example call me
mark says the g pad needs a home button
called the g-spot ah next le with
response it's pronounced cariddi not
curity just a little FYI um le for your
information it's QT is not even an
acronym it's not a name you're just
pronouncing the letters just like an a's
rd keyboard for example for the French
so I don't think there's really a right
pronunciation Sammy vanity is probably
one of the only people that said yes I
would love a curity keyboard and it's
interesting people are moving away from
it I personally think that it was a cool
thing to have in the past but I honestly
find myself typing faster on a normal
keyboard than I would with a cutie
keyboard and that's just I guess
evolution the way it is text petition
has got a lot better and then super fat
shall 14 says at 259 he sounded like
pain from the dark knight rises bane
let's see we take power from the corrupt
and we give it to the people that good
enough now if you remember on Thursday
we had this ad from Microsoft for
windows phone in the Lumia 1020 that I
actually praised a lot and the question
of the day was what did you think about
Windows Phone ads in general we got 335
comments and first of all any Rosado
says windows phone I want you to succeed
and I think everybody does I mean no
market in a duopoly where we have
android and iOS succeeds we need more
operating systems to succeed windows
phone has a lot of things that I wish
would be better but still I do want it
to succeed as well especially because of
the fact that I
from windows mobile then another
commoner says great ads better than
HTC's and you know I'm not gonna agree
with that actually I remember the HTC
you campaign which was good there's a
little off topic but still I feel the
HTC is doing a better job now with
Robert Downey jr. they're generating
expectation and yeah it's getting there
sadly Microsoft adds this is probably
the first one that I like then we have
sonido 928 saying I like Windows Phone 8
ads I mean the surface ones sadly on the
other hand and then we get a couple of
points and I you understand your point
especially when we have Isaac peachy
saying my favorite is the windows RT
commercial I think that every time I see
it the price lowers soon they will pay
to take it and I'm not gonna say
anything but you're right then on Friday
the hot news wrote the fact that Steve
Ballmer was retiring a CEO of Microsoft
and I asked you what do you think of his
retirement 313 comments came in one of
them was broken horn 90 which said
bomber is the best thing that ever
happened to the mac in the linux world
and you know honestly you're kind of
right in the types of Bill Gates this
would have happened then handy set he
had said Stephen Elop please and that
would probably be a good idea for a CEO
he's doing a good job at nokia i just
wish i would see more results but
obviously we need to be patient with a
guy then Italy 1999 comes up it says
bring old school bag bring gates back
and you know a lot of people have
debated this I even wrote an editorial
about it recently and i do want bill
gates to come back i'm not saying that
other people new people can't do a
better job but i do believe that Bill
Gates is that person that knows the
company better than anybody in Microsoft
is kind of a complex company it's really
big so honestly it's not that I'm saying
that nobody else is capable I'm just
saying that Microsoft is in need of some
desperate measures and they don't really
need to try somebody out they need to
bring somebody that already knows how to
fix the problem that's probably the
reason why I would love for Bill Gates
to come back but again thank you very
much for all these comments these for
the total of the weekend we will see
obviously how things emerge out of these
five things that we discuss today that's
it for this week's recap thank you very
much for watching if you want your
question to be featured a couple of tips
number one keep it short number to stick
to the point and number three try to get
as many votes as you can then again
follow us on social media we've got a
lot more video con
coming up and obviously a pocket out
daily every single day please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw I am hi Mary vetta thank you very
much for watching we will see you on the
next recap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
